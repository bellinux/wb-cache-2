5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{as a function of the}} other variables. The <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the rate}} at which a {{commercial}} bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method of {{measuring}} {{the degree of}} currency misalignment {{through the use of}} offshore <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Using default risk adjusted no-arbitrage conditions for <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> contracts, we calculate the spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and the domestic interest rates that are implied from the observed <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> The difference between the implied and the observed spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> is our measure of currency misalignment. Our methodology is based on the presumption that, during a currency crisis, offshore <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> reflect market fundamentals more closely than onshore spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> The latter are usually tightly regulated and heavily affected by government intervention during a non-normal event such as a financial crisis.

5|$|The unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} given conditions of rational expectations and risk neutrality, the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is an unbiased predictor {{of the future}} spot exchange rate. Without introducing a foreign exchange risk premium (due to the assumption of risk neutrality), the following equation illustrates the unbiasedness hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (also {{referred}} to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

The empirical tests confirm that differences {{in the level of}} expected real interest rates between the U.

40|$|The {{forward-bias}} puzzle {{is probably}} the most important puzzle in international macroeconomics. After more than 20 years, there is no accepted solution. My solution is based on covered interest parity (CIP). CIP implies: (1) Forward rates are not rational expectations of future spot rates. Those expectations depend on future spot rates and interest rate differentials. (2) The forward bias {{is the result of a}} specification error, replacing future <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> with current <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> That misspecification is the direct result of (1). Implication (1) has the further implication that, in general, covered and uncovered interest parity are inconsistent...|$|R
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
40|$|The Unbiased Forward Rate Hypothesis (UFRH) {{stipulates}} that the forward rates {{should be a}} perfect predictor for the future spot rates. A {{number of studies have}} tested the UFRH and foreign market efficiency and concluded that the hypothesis does not hold. This phenomenon is known as the UFRH puzzle. A number of studies that reject the UFRH have made use of ordinary least square (OLS) methods and support a linear adjustment between spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> This paper establishes that the use of a linear model in testing the UFRH can lead to a misspecification problem if indeed there is a nonlinear adjustment between the <b>forward</b> and spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> In order to overcome the problem of model misspecification, this paper applies the nonlinear method of the class of the Smooth Transition Regression (STR) model in assessing the relationship between the Rand-US Dollar future spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> With the aid of a series of diagnostic tests, the paper shows that there is indeed a nonlinear adjustment process between the Rand-US Dollar spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and that there exists a regime in the STR model where the UFRH eventually holds. Furthermore, the out-of-sample forecast results show that the STR forecasting method outperforms the OLS and random walk methods in forecasting the future spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> ...|$|R

The possibility of the two variables being fractionally cointegrated is also examined throughout the differenced series.

500|$|The {{following}} equation represents covered {{interest rate}} parity, a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to {{foreign exchange risk}} (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) {{with the use of}} a forward contract [...] the exchange rate risk is effectively covered. Under this condition, a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency at the spot exchange rate, investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate, and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency at the negotiated <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Investors will be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the state of}} foreign exchange markets efficiency in Asia Pacific under different time periods based {{on some of the}} key economic events. We employ two popular techniques to test for foreign exchange markets efficiency. First, we use the Johansen cointegration technique to test for the unbiasedness hypothesis of the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Second, we run the Fama regression to determine whether the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are unbiased predictor of future spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> We found that the foreign exchange markets in Asia Pacific are generally efficient within-country in which the spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are cointegrated. From the across-country perspective, the foreign exchange markets are generally efficient when tested using the bivariate cointegration method but show some evidence of inefficiency when tested using the multivariate method. However, the finding of stationary forward premium reduces the argument for markets inefficiency as the error correction term could possibly be acting as proxy for risk premium. Lastly, the Fama regression results show that the forward bias puzzle is a pervasive phenomenon which happens in all of the currency markets. From the pooled regression analysis, this phenomenon is shown to be particularly prevalent among the high income and more liberalised nations during the overall and normal periods. On the other hand, this phenomenon is present among the medium income and not-so-liberalised nations during the turbulent periods...|$|R
