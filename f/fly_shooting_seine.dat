Significant differences in resistance to <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> damage were observed in two of the three seasons. The incidence of dead-heart symptoms ranged from 32 to 71 % during the 1998 / 99 season, from 27 to 54 % during the 1999 / 2000 season and from 58 to 88 % in the 2001 / 02 seasons. Varieties Pirira- 1 and Pirira- 2 were the most resistant across seasons. Although the level of resistance in many of the sorghum varieties was low, several varieties with moderate levels of resistance were identified...|$|R

It is damaged by > 150 insect species, of which sorghum <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> (Atherigona soccata Rond.), stem borers (Chilo partellus Swin., Busseola fusca Fuller, Eldana saccharina Wlk., Sesamia spp. and Diatraea saccharalis Wlk.), armyworms (Mythimna separata Wlk., Spodoptera exempta Wlk. and S. frugiperda J.

Considerable progress has been made in screening and breeding for resistance to <b>shoot</b> <b>fly,</b> stem borers, greenbug, midge, armyworms and head bugs. Resistance to major pests is available in diverse genotypes. It is possible to combine resistance to two or more insect species in some cases (e. g. <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> and stem borer, stem borer and armyworms, midge and aphids and head bugs and head caterpillars). However, it may be quite difficult to combine resistance to some insect species (e. g. <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> versus midge and/or head bugs). Host-plant resistance can be used for the management of sorghum midge, greenbug, mites, aphids and head caterpillars. However, host-plant resistance need to be supplemented with other methods of pest control for <b>shoot</b> <b>fly,</b> stem borers. armyworms and head bugs...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum {{is damaged}} by several insect species, {{of which the}} <b>shoot</b> <b>fly,</b> Atherigona soccata, is {{important}} in Asia and Africa. Host plant resistance is an effective component {{for the management of}} this pest under subsistence farming conditions. With the discovery of the cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) system (Milo cytoplasm), there is an increasing emphasis to develop sorghum hybrids to increase the productivity of this crop. In order to develop sorghum hybrids with broad based resistance to <b>shoot</b> <b>fly,</b> it is important to identify CMS, maintainer, and restorer lines with different mechanisms of resistance to this pest. Therefore, the expression of resistance and the components associated with resistance to sorghum <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> in a diverse array of shoot fly-resistant and -susceptible CMS and maintainer lines were studied for three years (2002 - 2004). The shoot fly-resistant CMS lines were preferred for oviposition by the <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> females than the corresponding maintainer lines (78. 5 to 82. 8 % versus 71. 5 to 79. 9 % plants with eggs), and had more deadhearts (47. 6 to 79. 3 % versus 41. 6 to 74. 0 %). The shoot fly-susceptible CMS and maintainers were equally susceptible to <b>shoot</b> <b>fly</b> damage. <b>Shoot</b> fly-resistant maintainer lines showed better recovery than the CMS lines. The expression of trichomes on abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces was more in the maintainer lines than the CMS lines. Leaf glossiness, trichome density, and plumule and leaf sheath pigmentation showed negative associations with oviposition and deadhearts, while leaf surface wetness, chlorophyll content, and waxy bloom were associated with susceptibility. Plants with eggs, deadhearts, leaf surface wetness, leaf sheath pigmentation, leaf glossiness, trichomes on the adaxial surface of the leaf, and waxy bloom can be used as marker traits to select for resistance to A. soccata. The results suggested that the resistance to A. soccata is influenced by factors associated with cytoplasmic male-sterility and the interaction between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes...|$|R
