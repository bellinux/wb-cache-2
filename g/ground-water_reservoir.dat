40|$|Because of its "renewability" {{water is}} unique among earth {{resources}} that sustain and enhance life. No other mineral resource that we extract {{on a long-term}} and continuous basis {{can be counted on}} for at least some degree of replenishment within a human lifetime. This attribute allows a great deal of flexibility in management of the resource. In Delaware local rainfall, approximately 40 " to 44 " per year, renews part or all of our water supply on a regular basis. However, not all of the rain that falls is available for use. From this total rainfall must be subtracted the water that evaporates (about 20 "/ year), the amount that is used by plants (about 3 "/year), and the amount that runs overland to surface streams during storms (about 4 "- 5 "/year). The remainder, approximately 13 " to 15 " is Delaware's bank of water for the year. This water is stored in a system of <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> or aquifers, that underlie most of the State.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of making regional estimates of ground-water resources {{has been demonstrated}} in Minnesota. Average annual ground-water recharge rates were used {{as an indicator of}} groundwater resources. Ground-water resources are defined here as the amount of ground water that can be withdrawn from water-table aquifers {{for a long period of}} time without irreversible depletion of the <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir.</b> In contrast ground-water reserves are a function of the areal extent, thickness and hydrogeologic parameters of the aquifers and confining beds. Data from three research approaches were used to estimate ground-water resources: (1) ground-water contribution to the streamflow; (2) 3 D-day lowflow characteristics of Minnesota streams; (3) ground-water hydrographs. Comparison of results of the three methods shows that values derived from ground-water hydrographs and data on groundwater contribution to streams are relatively close. Values derived from low-flow data, however, were consistently smaller. This discrepancy is related to two factors: (1) the limited time for which records of low-flow measurements were available; (2) the severely limited accuracy of low-flow estimates. However, the use of all three methods in conjunction does provide meaningful estimates of ground-water resources; The study shows regional distribution of ground-water resources in the 39 watersheds in Minnesota. The general distribution of ground-water resources is due to three major factors [...] hydrogeologic environment, geomorphology and climate.

40|$|Estimates {{of annual}} {{ground-water}} contribution to streamflow in 38 drainage basins of Minnesota {{by use of}} standard streamflow hydrograph separation methods permit determination of relations between ground-water runoff and such basin characteristics as geologic environment, precipitation and temperature, and percentage of lake and wetland cover. Generalized conclusions derived from {{analysis of the data}} are that ground-water runoff is (1) least from glaciated basins that have surficial lake bed sediments or gray-drift ground moraine immediately underlain by relatively impermeable bedrock and (2) greatest from glaciated basins that have surficial depos its immediately underlain by permeable bedrock or that have thick surficial loess deposits immediately underlain by permeable bedrock. Ground-water runoff is much greater from glaciated basins having red drift than from basins having gray drift. The rate of ground-water increases as annual precipitation increases. Lakes and wetlands sustain and regulate streamflow during rainless periods; if they were absent sustained streamflow from northern parts of the state would be greatly reduced. Recharge to aquifers in the state is difficult to ascertain. Because many aquifers are deeply buried by glacial materials of varying characteristics, not all ground-water runoff can be diverted into cones of depression, for there is some lateral as well as vertical movement of water in surficial deposits. Data on ground-water runoff can be useful in estimating the rate of recharge to aquifers and in evaluating the potential yields of <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> However, no simple re- 1 ation exists between ground-water runoff and ground-water recharge or the potential yields of aquifers.

40|$|The {{extensive}} canalization of the Doab, {{which was}} necessary {{to the development of}} irrigation agriculture induced added recharge to the ground-water system from the canal leakage. Disruption of the hydrologic balance of the regional flow system resulted in water-logging and soil salinization on a scale that threatens the entire economy of the region. The report establishes the cause-effect relationships involved and defines the functioning of the hydrologic system. Analog-simulation techniques for the analyses of ground-water systems in the Doab is developed. Analyses are made for (a) steady-state conditions that prevailed prior to the canal-irrigation period, and (b) non-steady state conditions for the canal-irrigation period from the year 1900 to 1960. The rise in ground-water levels, rate of infiltration from the main canals and their distributaries, net recharge rate to <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir,</b> and the effect of evapotranspiration on the rising groundwater levels are determined. Recharge to ground-water from the rivers Jhelum and Chenab and discharge through evapotranspiration are found to be the main sources for maintaining hydraulic dynamic equilibrium during the pre-irrigation period. Further analysis indicates that, during the canal-irrigation period, the infiltration from the main canals and their distributaries is the cause of rise in ground-water levels. The net infiltration rate is of the order of 1767 million gallons per day and is a function of canal size. Out of this, 867 million gallons per day is the loss due to evapotranspiration, showing its importance in the ground-water system of the area.

40|$|Numerous debris-flow events {{occurred}} {{along the}} Wasatch Front near Salt Lake City, Utah, during the springs of 1983 and 1984. These flows were distinctly {{different from the}} previous damaging flows of 1923 and 1930 which were related to cloudburst thunderstorms. The 1983 and 1984 flows {{were related to the}} rapid melting of an above average snow pack. These flows originated as localized failures ofcolluvial sediment on the upper slopes of the Wasatch Front which had developed on a Precambrian metamorphic bedrock. Following the debris-flow event, "normally dry streams " continued to flow well into the autumn. These sustained flows suggest drainage of a <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir,</b> "tapped " by the slope failure and scour of the chan nel. The supply of ground water contained within the colluvium could not sustain the observed stream flow at the canyon mouth. Therefore, we believe that a bedrock reservoir provided the source of water for sustained stream discharges. Field observations and mapping indicate that the metamorphic bedrock has been highly fractured. Erosion control and range management practices following the 1930 debris-flow events combined with a gradual recovery of the Salt Lake area moisture balance effectively recharged this bedrock aquifer. Excess recharge during the rapid spring melt overcharged the bedrock aquifer, increased the pore-water pressure in the colluvium at locations of bedrock springs and seeps, and led to localized slope failures which mobilized the down canyon colluvium into debris flows. Drainage of the bedrock aquifer, at exposed springs and seeps, maintains the sustained stream discharge seen at the canyon mouths.

40|$|The Las Vegas {{ground-water}} basin {{as described}} in this report includes {{the southern part of}} Indian Spring Valley, Three Lakes Valley, the northern half of Ivanpah Valley, and Las Vegas Valley. These valleys in part are inferred to form a hydrologic unit that includes an area of about 3, 000 square miles {{in the southern part of}} Clark County, Nev. The valleys forming the Las Vegas ground-water basin are broad structural depressions surrounded by mountains. The climate of the region is arid, and precipitation in the basin lowlands rarely exceeds 5 inches per year. Drainage is interior except for occasional Hood runoff and waste from the industrial plants at Henderson; the occasional flood runoff and waste flow through the Las Vegas Wash to Lake Mead. The mountain ranges are composed of indurated rocks that impede the movement of ground water from the basin and form the boundary of the <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The valley fill that forms the principal <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir</b> is composed of a thick sequence ranging from Miocene (?) through Recent in age. Most of the ground water is in a large leaky artesian system comprising four principal zones of aquifers—the deep, middle, and shallow zones of artesian aquifers and the near-surface zone of water-table aquifers. To facilitate quantitative analyses of recharge, discharge, and yield, the aquifers have been divided arbitrarily into an artesian system, which includes the three principal artesian aquifers, and the near-surface water-table system. Natural recharge to the artesian system is from precipitation in the mountainswithin the drainage area of the basin. As ground water moves from areas ofrecharge toward areas of discharge in the lower parts of Las Vegas Valley, itbecomes confined between relatively impermeable beds. Nearly imperviousbarriers caused by faulting of the valley fill impede the lateral movement of the ground water. Artesian pressure causes the water to leak upward along thefaults into shallow aquifers. The average annual natural recharge to the Las Vegas artesian system was estimated by the following methods: (1) Estimation of consumptive use by phreatophytes under natural conditions prior to ground-water development; (2) estimation of ground-water underflow to the Las Vegas area during a period of near-stability in the ground-water reservoir; and (3) study of the relationship between precipitation and recharge during periods of equilibrium in the <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Estimates of the natural recharge based on these methods suggest that the average annual natural recharge to the basin is on the order of 25, 000 acre-feet. The total draft on the artesian aquifers in 1955 was approximately 48, 000 acre-feet, of which about 42, 000 acre-feet was from wells and springs and about 6, 000 acre-feet was from upward leakage. Therefore, overdraft on the artesian reservoir in 1955 was about 23, 000 acre-feet. Recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was derived from upward leakage from the underlying artesian aquifers and by infiltration of waste water. The total estimated recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet. The draft on the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet, of which about 24, 000 acre-feet was discharged by phreatophytes and about 1, 000 acre-feet was discharged by wells. During this study, the near-surface reservoir was in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium. The above data indicate that the overdraft on the entire Las Vegas ground-water basin in 1955 was approximately equal to the overdraft on the artesian aquifers—that is, about 23, 000 acre-feet. As the artesian heads continue to decline in Las Vegas Valley, the quantity ofground water lost through upward leakage and subsequent transpiration willdecrease. Conditions of optimum development of the artesian system will beachieved when the artesian heads have been lowered to about 50 feet below land surface, because most of the upward leakage that is currently discharged by phreatophytes will have been eliminated. At the present rate of decline of the artesian head and with the present distribution and amount of withdrawals, the artesian head will be lowered sufficiently to prevent most natural discharge in the Las Vegas area in about 40 years and in the Paradise Valley area in about 75 years. The maximum sustained yield that can be developed from the artesian aquifers when the artesian head has been lowered below the root zone of phreatophytes will be limited to the approximate average annual natural recharge to the artesian system plus the amount of nonconsumptively used ground water and imported water which becomes available for reuse through downward leakage or artificial recharge. The accumulated annual discharge from the Las Vegas artesian aquifers hasexceeded the accumulated recharge since the development of the first successful well in 1906, and as a result the artesian pressure has declined almost uninterruptedly from year to year since that time. The artesian head in selected observation wells in the vicinity of Las Vegas and Paradise Valley declined about 30 feet between 1941 and 1956. During this time the approximate cumulative overdraft amounted to about 300, 000 acre-feet. The amount of overdraft per foot of lowering of artesian head within the area of approximately 40 square miles represented by the observation wells during this period was about 10, 000 acre-feet. The chemical quality of the ground water in Las Vegas Valley is, in general,better in the northern than in the southern part of the valley. In the northernpart of the valley, water from the shallow and middle zones of aquifers is of better quality than water in the deep zone of aquifers. As the ground water migrates southward into the Paradise Valley and the Whitney-Pittman areas, the water in the middle and shallow zones becomes more mineralized than the water in the deep zone of aquifers. The lowering of artesian head in the Las Vegas area between 1935 and 1950 has caused about 180 millimeters of local land subsidence in the vicinity of the Bonanza Street underpass, where the sediments are predominantly clay and silt. In the western part of the valley, where the sediments are predominantly sand and gravel, subsidence during the same period of time was negligible...|$|E

The information derived will be used to help interpret results of marsh studies, particularly the marsh hydrology studies that are to be used in conjunction with the hydrodynamic modeling to extrapolate project impacts spatially across the marsh-floodplain surface. These data will be converted into a “marsh succession model ” that will be used with inputs from a three dimensional (3 D) hydrodynamic model to predict the overall impact of the harbor deepening on the area’s ecosystem. The linkage between the water level and specific conductance of the tidal marshes to the Savannah River is critical to developing a successful marsh succession model. A confounding factor of the marsh studies is that South Carolina and Georgia are currently (2002) experiencing the fifth year of drought. Below normal rainfalls {{over the last four years}} have limited the recharges of <b>ground-water</b> aquifers and <b>reservoirs.</b> With the ground water and reservoir storage below normal, creeks, streams, and rivers are experiencing record low streamflow conditions.

40|$|The geology and {{ground-water}} {{resources of}} the upper Republican River valley west {{of the town of}} Alma, Nebr., to the Nebraska-Colorado State line and of the Frenchman River valley from its confluence with the Republican River to a point about 12 miles upstream from Wauneta, Nebr., were studied from January 1950 to April 1951. The {{purpose of the study was}} to relate the occurrence of ground water to irrigation and flood control and to aid in the evaluation of the effects of irrigation on the land in the area. The area included in this study consists of 370 square miles of flat or gently sloping terraces and bottom land that border the Republican and Frenchman Rivers on either side. The Republican River is a comparatively shallow stream, ranging in width from about 150 feet at the western end of the area to about 300 feet at the eastern end. The channel banks are low, except where the river cuts into bordering terraces. In many places, natural levees of loose sand and gravel have been formed adjacent to the river banks. The bedrock formations exposed in the area are the Niobrara formation and the Pierre shale of Cretaceous age and the Ogallala formation of Tertiary age. Deposits of sand and gravel, of early Pleistocene age, are present in the bottom of the ancestral Republican River valley and along the north side of the present valley. These coarse deposits are mantled by finer sediments of later Pleistocene and Recent age. Large quantities of ground water are available from the Pleistocene and Recent deposits throughout most of the Republican River valley. In the center of the valley as much as 40 to 60 feet of the deposits are saturated. The <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir</b> is recharged principally by precipitation.

40|$|Caves in Corral County, Texas, were {{examined}} {{with regard to}} their lithologic and geomorphic setting, paying particular attention to controls such as stratigraphic variation, topography, jointing, and ground-water flow. In the light of these data, a new classification of caves is proposed based upon the mode of water flow involved in their formation. Influent caves are formed by water flowing from the surface to the ground-water table. Effluent caves are formed by water flowing from the <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir</b> to the surface. Conduit caves are formed principally by phreatic flow with little, or no, surface relationship. This classification is extremely useful in identifying the factors involved in speleogenesis when used in conjunction with areal maps of the aforementioned controls. Effluent caves in the lower Glen Rose Formation are localized within a massive, fossiliferous aquifer and oriented generally down-dip, thus substantiating Gardner's (1935) theory of speleogenesis. Influent caves in both the upper and lower Glen Rose Formation are developed in areas with low surface gradient and consequently high infiltration. They develop vertically until the water reaches a suitable calcareous stratum which conducts it away laterally. A later change of conditions may cause further deepening and a series of pits and passages may develop. Conduit caves in the upper Glen Rose Formation appear to be localized within the more calcareous strata because of the high solubility of these layers in contrast to the shales, marls, and dolomites composing the major part of the section. Secondary collapse of the overlying less soluble strata may provide access for additional inflow, but in most cases this can be eliminated as the primary cause of cavern development. Vadose inflow and the mixing effect which Thrailkill (1968) has postulated as causes of increased solution do not seem responsible either. All the conduit caves examined in detail, however, occur in areas of ground-water convergence. It is hypothesized that the abnormally high flow rate and volume due to this convergence is responsible for their development, thus supporting the mechanism proposed by Swinnerton (1932) and Davies (1957). A cursory examination of caves in the Edwards Limestone reveals that effluent caves may also be caused by the overflowing of a perched aquifer into surface valleys. In the Edwards Limestone it also appears that conduit caves may be localized in a horizon which has high permeability, even within a compositionally homogeneous section...|$|E
40|$|Three {{aquifers}} {{of diverse}} lithology and hydraulic character form the <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the Roswell basin. The main aquifer, the carbonate aquifer, is developed in carbonate rocks of Permian age. It {{is the source}} of about two-thirds of the ground water pumped in the basin and receives more than 90 percent of the recharge to the basin. The second most important aquifer is the shallow aquifer which lies near the Pecos River in beds of sand and gravel of both Permian and Holocene age. About one-third of the ground water pumped in the basin comes from the shallow aquifer. Prior to pumping, the main source of recharge to the shallow aquifer was probably ground water leaking upward from the carbonate aquifer. Since pumping began, the main source of recharge to the shallow aquifer is probably return flow of irrigation water pumped from the carbonate aquifer. Natural discharge of ground water from the shallow aquifer into the Pecos River causes a gain in th. e base flow of the Pecos River in the Roswell basin. The third aquifer, the shallow-artesian aquifer, is in red beds and evaporite beds of Permian age. This aquifer overlies the carbonate aquifer and underlies the shallow aquifer. The shallow-artesian aquifer acts as a minor aquifer and also as a semi-permeable unit which partly confines ground water in the carbonate aquifer. Vertical permeability of the shallow-artesian aquifer is variable and depends on the lithology and thickness of the aquifer. Hydraulic head in the shallow-artesian aquifer also varies quite widely depending on the depth to which a well penetrates the aquifer. All ground-water aquifers in the basin transect formational boundaries and are therefore not closely related to the named geologic formations. A flow net analysis of the carbonate aquifer and of the shallow aquifer imply that geologic structure is important in the movement of ground water in the basin by limiting the transmissivity of the shallow and carbonate aquifers, by forming the present pattern of surface water drainage, and possibly by the contamination of fresh ground water by highly saline ground water. The flow net analysis also shows areas of recharge to the shallow and carbonate aquifers, and areas where the carbonate aquifer looses water to the shallow-artesian aquifer and to the shallow aquifer...|$|E
40|$|The area {{described}} in this report includes the eastern, or lower, end of the valley of Pumpkin Creek and is in Morrill and Banner Counties, in western Nebraska. A reconnaissance of the geology and ground-water resources of the area was made to determine the possibilities of developing ground-water supplies for irrigation. Rocks that crop out in the Pumpkin Creek area are shown on a geologic map that {{is included in the}} report. They range in age from Oligocene to Recent and consist of the Brule, Arikaree, and Ogallala formations and of the alluvium. The Chadron formation, of Oligocene age, underlies the area but is not exposed at the surface. The Lance formation, of Late Cretaceous age, underlies the Chadron formation. Sandstones, which are thought to be in the Lance formation, contain ground water under artesian pressure and might yield sufficient water for irrigation on a small scale. Several thousand feet of Pierre shale, which is not known to yield appreciable quantities of water to wells, underlies the Lance formation. In some places sufficient water for irrigation can be obtained by wells from fractures in the Brule formation. Large supplies of water can be expected in places where the fractures are extensive or where they are overlain by saturated alluvial material. A few springs that are fed by recharge from the upland area issue at the contact of the Brule and Arikaree formations. The Ogallala formation yields water to domestic and stock wells in the upland areas south of Pumpkin Creek valley. Inasmuch as this formation is high topographically and is well drained, the depth to water is considerable generally 100 ft or more and the thickness of the saturated material probably is not great. It is doubtful, therefore, that sufficient water for irrigation could be obtained from this material; however, it may be possible in some places to obtain water for irrigation on a small scale. Alluvium, which underlies the floodplains of Pumpkin Creek and some of its major tributaries, is the principal aquifer in the area. The alluvium of Quaternary age consists of coarse sand and gravel and yields sufficient water for irrigation. In most places yields of 1, 000 to 2, 000 gpm probably could be obtained from properly constructed wells in this material. It is estimated that about 21, 000 acre-ft of ground water annually leaves the area as stream flow. This represents approximately the amount of additional ground water available for development; however, if sufficient ground water is pumped to lower the water table appreciably, the additional water salvaged from loss by evaporation and transpiration also would be available for irrigation use. The development of any additional ground water from the unconfined <b>ground-water</b> <b>reservoir</b> will cause a reduction in the flow of Pumpkin Creek. Water from the alluvium and the Brule formation is moderately mineralized. Although most water is hard, some soft water is obtained from the Brule. The dissolved solids in water from the Brule formation and the alluvium ranged from 236 to 356 ppm. Hardness in these two water-bearing formations ranged from 6. 0 to 20 k ppm. Water obtained from deep wells in the Lance formation is more mineralized and softer than water obtained from the overlying formations. The dissolved solids, which consist largely of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, range from 812 to 1, 170 ppm. Although the water from the Lance formation is satisfactory for domestic needs, the high percentage of sodium restricts its use for irrigation...|$|E
