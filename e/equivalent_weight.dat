5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> in the locomotive itself.|$|E
25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E

The specification {{required that the}} aircraft be capable of carrying a 21in (533mm) torpedo or an <b>equivalent</b> <b>weight</b> of bombs, and produced responses both from Blackburn Aircraft (the Cubaroo) and Avro. Roy Chadwick, chief designer of Avro, initially produced a single-engined design, the Avro 556 powered by a Napier Cub engine, similar to the Cubaroo. This was however rejected in favour of a twin-engined aircraft using two Rolls-Royce Condor engines, this being designated the Avro Type 557 Ava, and winning an order for two prototypes from the Air Ministry. Completed in secret (owing to its armament of a 21in (533mm) torpedo, thought {{to be able to}} sink the largest warships), the first prototype Ava (serial number N171) flew in mid-1924.|$|E

In all cases {{it was found that the}} local ensemble transform Kalman filter produced lower root mean squared errors than the <b>equivalent</b> <b>weights</b> particle filter. The performance of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>weights</b> particle filter is shown to depend strongly on the form of nudging used, and a nudging term based on the local ensemble transform Kalman smoother is shown to improve the performance of the filter.

The EW is defined as the weight of Nafion (in terms of molecular mass) per sulfonic acid group. [...] For example, Nafion 117 indicates a material with 1100 g EW and 0.007inches in thickness.

French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1800-84) became one of the more influential opponents of atomic theory, after having embraced it earlier in his career, but was a staunch supporter of <b>equivalent</b> <b>weights.</b> Insofar as the atomic tables have been drawn up in part following the laws of Wenzel and Richter, in part by simple speculations, they have left plenty of doubts in the best of minds. It was to escape this problem that it was attempted to deduce the atomic weights from the density of the elements in the vapour state, from their specific heat, from their crystalline form. But one must not forget that the value of the figures deduced from these properties is not in the least absolute… To sum up, what have left from this ambitious excursion that we have allowed ourselves {{in the realm of the}} atoms? Nothing, nothing necessary at the very least. What we have left is the conviction that chemistry got itself lost there, as it always does when it abandons experiment, it tried to walk without a guide through the shadows. With experiment as a guide, you find Wenzel's equivalents, Mitscherlich'sequivalents, they are nothing else but molecular groups.
