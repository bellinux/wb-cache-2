40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study on the possibilities to estimate the density of grass en maize silages for calculation of the <b>fodder</b> <b>stock</b> more accurately than the current table values. During ensiling the amount of crop of 104 grass silage clamps, 42 maize silage clamps and 108 big bales (54 round and 54 square) were weighted and after ensiling the dimensions were measured and the chemical composition was analysed. For round and square bales a new regression formula was derived, which estimates the density more accurate than the current table values. It is recommended to calculate the density of round en square bales with the following formula: Density (kg/m 3) = 994. 81 - 0. 5335 x dry matter content (g/kg) - 1. 196 x crude fibre content (g/kg ds). For grass en maize silage in clamps and bunker silo’s no new model could be derived which estimated the density more accurately than the current table values...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, cereal crop harvest {{residues}} are communally grazed by the ruminant {{herds of}} villagers and transhumant pastoralists in the agro-pastoral systems which predominate in the savannah zone of West Africa. We analysed {{the impact of}} the private use of crop residues by individual farmers on crop and livestock productivity at three scales: the field, farm, and village. We collected data in the village of Koumbia, located in the Sudanian region of Burkina Faso. Three types of farmers were identified: resource-poor farmers, predominantly livestock farmers, and resource-rich farmers. The trade-offs between different uses and users of cereal crop residues at the three scales were analysed through field surveys and a simple model of biomass flows. We considered current communal use practices and two alternative scenarios of private cereal crop residue use: (i) for composting (fertility scenario) and (ii) as fodder (fodder scenario). Our analysis of current practices confirmed that farmers left around 80 % of cereal crop residues on their fields. Soil fertility for cereal production therefore could be improved through crop residue management at the farm scale. We also found that communal grazing benefited farmers with high numbers of livestock. Maize grain production at the farm scale was improved in both of the simulated scenarios. Yet these scenarios had a negative impact on fodder self-sufficiency at the village scale, and on the N balance of the savannah-derived rangelands. The negative impact was greater in the fertility scenario than the <b>fodder</b> <b>stock</b> scenario. Increasing cereal productivity at the farm scale cannot be achieved without considering the trade-offs involved at the village scale. Changes in practices will require negotiations between the different types of farmers involved. Participatory innovation platforms with discussion support tools like the model presented in our study can facilitate such negotiations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Trifolium repens: Low growing, spreading plants with trifoliate leaves, sometimes mistaken for grass. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Frothy bloat: Saponins and glycoproteins. MECHANISM OF ACTION: • Soluble proteins escape rapidly from fragile thin-walled cells of above species during cellulose digestion. • This results in changes in surface tension of ruminal fluid and stabilization of gas bubbles in rumen. • Critical concentration of several surface-active agents leads to persistent, rigid foam. Phyto-oestrogenism: • The toxic principles of the clovers are various isoflavone glycosides, which are inherently oestrogenic and/or are biotransformed in the rumen to active or inactive compounds. • The oestrogenic compounds contained in lucerne are coumestans. SYNDROMES: Frothy bloat, ABPE, Phyto-oestrogenism. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Gastro-intestinal, urogenital and respiratory systems. CLINICAL SIGNS: Frothy bloat: • Severe bloat, distended abdomen. • Ruminal atony. • Dyspnoea. Phyto-oestrogenism: • Infertility. Colour photos. Final web-ready size: JPEG, 72 ppi.

For instance, flexible adjustment of <b>fodder</b> composition, feed <b>stocks,</b> or land use as well as gross margin insurance are considered. Our results show that assuming moderate risk aversion farms' gross margin variability is rather high, with a coefficient of variation of gross margin ranging from 19 to 21 %. Accounting for on-farm risk-management strategies we find that gross margin variability can be reduced significantly, causing only low reductions of average gross margin levels. We find that the use of maize as a switch crop and a market for the trade of roughage are the most efficient risk-management strategies. Our results also indicate that gross margin insurance is not attractive for farmers. Thus in particular promoting better access to markets for feedstuffs provides a valuable opportunity for farmers to manage gross margin risks. </p...|$|R

Ringbarking and vegetation clearing, fencing, prickly pear cutting and tending to stock (initially sheep for wool and later beef cattle) were ongoing tasks throughout {{the life of the}} reserve. A range of crops were grown with varying degrees of success, with the reserve vulnerable to the extremes of flooding and droughts. Crops included cotton, potatoes, pumpkins, corn and melons, and <b>stock</b> <b>fodder.</b> An orchard of seven acres had been established by 1918 with 500 citrus trees.

A 260 ft (79.25m) bore, capped by a windmill and connected to pipelines, tanks and stock troughs was sunk near the orchard for the reserve's water needs in 1916. The water's excessive iron content meant that it could not be used as effectively as hoped. Other infrastructure known to have been constructed included extensive fencing, horse yards, a woolshed in 1913, dams, a butcher's shop, new yards and a dip in 1919, a milling shed for a small sawbench and engine, and a bridge over the Dawson River.|$|R

3000|$|The grazing, {{cultivation}} and fodder {{production management}} regime integrates rearing of improved breeds, cultivation of maize and beans, and cultivation of high-yielding grass varieties. This regime has been necessitated by two factors: (1) reducing availability of natural pasture due to increasing uptake of crop-based {{regimes in the}} wetter regions of Chepareria and (2) intensification in livestock production (through improved breeds) and ready market for livestock marketable products, particularly milk. These factors necessitate households to practise fodder production {{in order to ensure}} sufficiency/stability in pasture availability and stability in milk production.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{strategies}} aimed at sustainable resource management {{requires an understanding}} of the trade-offs between the ecosystem services at stake, to determine appropriate ways in which to navigate them. We assess trade-offs between forage production for cattle ranching and the maintenance of carbon stocks or tree diversity in a Mexican tropical dry forest. Trade-offs between pairs of services were assessed by identifying their efficiency frontiers at both site and landscape scales. We also estimated service outcomes under current and hypothetical land-management conditions. We found stark trade-offs between <b>fodder</b> and carbon <b>stocks</b> and between <b>fodder</b> and tree species richness at the site scale. At the landscape scale, the efficiency frontier was concave, with a much less pronounced trade-off in the fodder-species richness case. Our estimates of current service supply levels showed a reduction of 18 - 21 % for C stock and 41 - 43 % for fodder biomass, relative to the maximum feasible values along the efficiency frontier. Choice of the optimum management strategy to reduce such inefficiency depended on deforestation level: secondary forest regeneration was most suitable when deforestation is low, whereas increased fodder productivity in the pastures is best when deforestation is high. Pasture enrichment with forage trees and secondary forest growth are potential management alternatives for achieving sustainability given the range of enabling ecological factors and to balance ecological and social sustainability given the requirements and preferences of local stakeholders.

40|$|Senegalese {{livestock}} size {{has largely}} increased {{during the last}} three decades in relation to the population growth. The <b>fodder</b> biomass <b>stock</b> available {{at the end of the}} growing season, therefore, becomes increasingly limited to meet feeding needs of pastoral livestock which provides third of the national agricultural wealth. With the reduction of natural grazing lands mostly generated by the expansion of croplands, and the reduction of fodder biomass production due to drought effects, the increase of the livestock size leads to the rangelands overload whose persistence can lead in turn to their degradation. A technique based on a simple linear relationship between the temporal integration of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the ground biomass data, developed in the 1980 s, has been operationally applied by the Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE) of Dakar (Senegal) to assess the fodder biomass available in rangelands at the end of the growing season. The derived map of total biomass production enables to help pastoral livestock managers as well as national stakeholders against food insecurity and natural resources degradation. Carried out annually, this approach comprises unfortunately some uncertainties as: (1) the saturation drawback of NDVI in areas with high biomass productivity, (2) the temporal scale which is restricted to biomass data of the ongoing year not being used again in the following year, (3) the low predictive ability due to the large time gap between data collection and published results, and (4) the high costs for annual data collection. In addition, although the earth observation (EO) data have largely progressed {{during the last three}} decades, this technique has not changed over this period and consequently is not state-of-the-art. To tackle these limitations and advance the traditional method, new statistical models that include new earth observations datasets and historical in situ plant biomass data were developed for estimating and / or predicting the forage availability at the end of the growing season in Senegalese semi-arid rangelands. A backward analysis of the linear regression approach currently applied in Senegal provided evidence that nonlinear regression functions such as Exponential and Power are more suited to estimate the end-of-season total biomass in this region using annual data solely. A completely new methodology using multiple-linear models which include various phenological metrics from the time series of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and 14 years of in situ total biomass samples was developed. The proposed approach provided more reliable and accurate estimates as compared to the current CSE biomass product. Multiple-linear models developed with specific metrics adapted to ecosystem properties increased the overall accuracy of the fodder biomass estimates and mitigated the saturation of FAPAR obtained with models run across the whole study area. With this new approach, timely information about possible deficits/surplus of total fodder biomass can be provided to stakeholders using phenological metrics that are available relatively early in the growing season. Another new approach based on a machine learning algorithm (i. e., Cubist) was developed, as never done before, to assess herbaceous biomass in Senegalese Sahel. Three Cubist models using FAPAR seasonal metrics and/or agrometeorological variables (i. e., soil water status indicators) were established and compared. The Cubist model including both FAPAR and agrometeorological variables provided the best estimation performance. This model enabled to mitigate the saturation affecting optical remotely sensed vegetation data in areas of high plant productivity as well as the discrepancy between herbaceous biomass and greenness, and corrected therefore for herbaceous biomass underestimations observed with the sole FAPAR based model, particularly in sparsely vegetated areas. In contrast to the date of the growing season onset retrieved from FAPAR seasonal dynamics, the rainy season onset was significantly related to the herbaceous biomass and its inclusion in models could constitute a significant improvement in forecasting risks of fodder biomass deficit. The methods developed in this research provide tools to assess Senegalese forage resources at two levels: herbaceous and total fodder biomass (Herbaceous + woody leaf biomass). They require limited data and free available software and therefore can be easily replicated in other countries of the West African Sahel...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 59: We may form {{some idea}} of the stile of life {{maintained}} by the border warriors, from the anecdotes, handed down by tradition, concerning Walter Scott of Harden, who flourished towards the middle of the sixteenth century. This ancient laird was a renowned freebooter, and used to ride with a numerous band of followers. The spoil, which they carried off from England, or from their neighbours, was concealed in a deep and impervious glen, on the brink of which the old tower of Harden was situated. From thence the cattle were brought out, one by one, as they were wanted, to supply the rude and plentiful table of the laird. When the last bullock was killed and devoured, it was the lady's custom to place on the table a dish, which, on being uncovered, was found to contain a pair of clean spurs; a hint to the riders, that they must shift for their next meal. Upon one occasion, when the village herd was driving out the cattle to pasture, the old laird heard him call loudly to drive out Harden's cow. [...] "Harden's cow!" [...] echoed the affronted chief--"Is it come to that pass? by my faith they shall sune say Harden's kye (cows)." [...] Accordingly, he sounded his bugle, mounted his horse, set out with his followers, and returned next day with [...] "a bow of kye, and a bussen'd (brindled) bull." [...] On his return with this gallant prey, he passed a very large hay-stack. It occurred to the provident laird, that this would be extremely convenient to <b>fodder</b> his new <b>stock</b> of cattle; but as no means of transporting it occurred, he was fain to take leave of it with this apostrophe, now proverbial: [...] "By my soul, had ye but four feet, ye should not stand lang there." [...] In short, as Froissard says of a similar class of feudal robbers, nothing came amiss to them, that was not too heavy, or too hot. The same mode of house-keeping characterized most border families on both sides. An MS. quoted in History of Cumberland, p. 466, concerning the Graemes of Netherby, and others of that clan, runs thus: [...] "They were all stark moss-troopers and arrant thieves: both to England and Scotland outlawed: yet sometimes connived at, because they gave intelligence forth of Scotland, and would raise 400 horse at any time, upon a raid of the English into Scotland." [...] A saying is recorded of a mother to her son (which is now become proverbial), [...] "Ride Rouly (Rowland), hough's i' the pot;" [...] that is, the last piece of beef was in the pot, and therefore it was high time for him to go and fetch more. To such men might with justice be applied the poet's description of the Cretan warrior; translated by my friend, Dr. Leyden.|$|R

The native species investigated were typical of those used in restoration projects. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), an introduced species that dominates New Zealand pasturelands, was used as a control. I studied rhizosphere soil and foliar N status at two planted restoration sites. Plant growth and uptake in response to agriculturally elevated N levels were investigated in greenhouse pot trials. A field experiment explored the effect of Kunzea robusta (kānuka) on N₂O fluxes from soil. Finally, farm-scale N uptake and reduction in N losses were modelled for various native planting scenarios. At the restoration sites New Zealand native species Austroderia richardii (toetoe), Phormium tenax (flax), Cordyline australis (cabbage tree), Coprosma robusta (karamu), K. robusta, Olearia paniculata (akeake) and Pittosporum tenuifolium (black matipo) had similar foliar N concentrations to L. perenne. While native species with winter leaf loss, Plagianthus regius (ribbonwood) and Sophora microphylla (kōwhai), had higher foliar N than these other species. There was significant inter species variation in rhizosphere soil mineral N concentrations among native species, with A. richardii and P. regius having higher nitrate status than L. perenne. Pot trials revealed that while native species tolerate high N loading (up to 1600 kg ha⁻¹), there was negligible growth response. Increased soil N concentrations resulted in increased foliar N in native plants, of which the high-biomass-producing monocotyledons assimilated the most. Nevertheless, foliar N concentrations were higher for L. perenne receiving N and farm-scale calculations showed L. perenne to extract more soil N than the native species. K. robusta reduced N₂O emissions following effluent application by 80 % relative to control soil, which emitted significant amounts. Modelling revealed that incorporating native species into agricultural landscapes reduced the N loading per hectare due to the reduced area of fertilised and grazed soil. The native monocotyledons, in particular P. tenax and Carex virgata (pukio), have greater potential to reduce nitrate leaching than the woody species and are the most suitable for receiving effluent, whereas K. robusta in farm paddocks may mitigate N₂O emissions following urine deposition by sheltering stock. Further work could involve lysimetry to quantify simultaneously the effects of native species on nitrate leaching and N₂O emissions. These findings provide a first step towards targeted native planting strategies in sustainable agricultural management...|$|R
40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} {{which has}} only {{recently}} come into general use. It is used - and practised - most widely in tropical countries because of its advantages in optimizing production while reducing soil erosion. While the name may be new, the technique has long been practised in some countries. A groforestry covers all systems where trees are deliberately left or planted on land where crops are grown or animals grazed, and so includes pratices as diverse as shifting cultivation, taungya, the growing of shade trees in cash crops such as coffee, {{and the use of}} living fences to contain or exclude animals. The upsurge of interest in these practices over the last ten years stems from the increasing population pressures and shortages of food and fuel among poor people in many developing countries. To meet their needs, those living in the more marginal areas have been forced to shorten the time the land is left fallow, to encroach further into forested land, and to overgraze pasture. As a result, the natural soil cover has been removed and the recycling of nutrients prevented leading to soil erosion and rapid decline in crop yields. Agroforestry is seen as one way of solving these problems, since by including trees in their farming systems, farmers not only benefit from a supply of wood and other tree products but help ensure their land remains fertile and productive as well Leaf litter from the trees adds organic matter to the soil and acts as a mulch to retain soil moisture and prevent soil erosion. Deep-rooted trees may tap sources of nutrients which are {{out of the reach of}} annual crops, making them available once the leaves fall. Leguminous trees such as leucaena can also improve soil fertility more directly by nitrogen fixation. Tree roots can help bind the soil and also create channels which improve its aeration and permeability to water. A mixture of tree and annual crops of different heights provides a more complete ground cover which again helps protect the soil from erosion and makes maximum use of available sunlight. The tree cover helps moderate extremes of temperature preventing rapid heat loss from the soil at night and protecting crops from excessive heat during the day. While these environmental benefits are of great importance to the conservation of fragile ecosystems in the long term, farmers are more likely to appreciate the value of trees in their farming system if they can see more immediate rewards. Multi-purpose trees which provide <b>fodder</b> for <b>stock</b> and edible fruits or nuts, as well as fuel, timber and support for climbing vegetables are those most likely to be used. Traditional systems Traditional agroforestry systems differ in the extent of the association between tree and crop or livestock components. Amongst the most closely integrated agroforestry systems are home gardens such as those commonly found in West Java and the more humid parts of West Africa. These gardens contain an intensive mix of crops of all types so that their structure resembles the natural forest. Annuals such as rice, maize and sweet potato are among perennials such as fruit, nuts and fibres and forest trees retained to provide fuel, timber, tannins, gums and medicinal products. <b>Fodder</b> for small <b>stock</b> comes from tree leaves and the grasses which grow under the trees. In the agroforestry system known as taungya, crops are grown among young trees only until the tree canopy closes over (one to three years), so that in this case the tree-crop association is temporary. The system was developed in Burma in the 1 850 s, when foresters needed labour to help establish new plantations as teak was felled. By allowing farmers to grow crops among the trees, weed growth was controlled among crop plants and trees. This system has since spread through Asia to Africa and Latin America. In West Africa it has been used to help establish plantations of Gmelina arborea. But although the system benefits poorer farmers as well as the forester, farmers sometimes resent the restrictions imposed and the constant need to move on. As a result they have been known to damage the trees deliberately and so postpone the time when they shade out the crone. In the case of shifting cultivation, or bush fallow, trees and crops occupy the same ground in turn. Although the more valued trees may be retained during the years when crops are being grown, and the trees are never completely cleared, the association between trees and annual crops is less close than it is in other agroforestry systems. Even so in the past it shared many of the advantages of more closely integrated systems. It is only now, when increasing demands o the land have led to shorter and shorter fallow periods, and in some cases eliminated them altogether, that soil erosion and reduced fertility have become a serious problem. Because bush fallow is the dominant form of farming in Africa as well as parts of the Pacific, it is this more than anything else which has promoted the search for alternative and more sustainable agroforestry systems. For those involved in improving and developing existing systems, agroforestry demands an all-round approach very different from that found among conventionally-trained agriculturalists and foresters, so justifying the need for a new discipline with a new name. Researchers, extension workers, and policy makers concerned with agroforestry have to consider not only how these improvements will affect the sustainability of the system: they also have to take account of local laws and customs concerning the ownership of trees and land, since, for example, farmers may be reluctant to plant trees if this calls into question their rights to crop a particular area. Although agriculturists can provide information about many of the crops found in agroforestry systems, little is known about most of the trees, with the exception of those such as leucaena, some acacias, glyricidia and calliandra. Even less is know about interaction between the trees and the crop. The research possibilities seem limitless. Diagnosis and design The International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) has played a key role in developing new research approaches to cope with the complexity of the subject. Established as recently as 1978, and based in Nairobi, its main aims are to initiate, promote and support research, and to increase awareness of the benefits which agroforestry brings. With only a limited number of staff, it is fulfilling these aims admirably, acting as a catalyst for agroforestry research worldwide. To help researchers investigate existing systems, see how they can be improved, and set priorities for research, ICRAF has developed an approach it calls D & D - diagnosis and design. In the diagnosis stage researchers discuss with farmers their basic needs, such as those for food, fuel, shelter and a cash income. They examine the existing system in terms of both its productivity and sustainability. In the design stage they use their knowledge of agroforestry systems elsewhere to suggest improvements which the farmers might adopt straight away. At the same time they identify more serious problems which might be resolved by research and the development of new technology. ICRAF has also proposed that an agroforestry research network for Africa (AFRENA) be set up, linking researchers in five widely occurring agro-ecological zones, so that those with common problems can share information. Two such networks have so far been established. One links Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe which all have highland areas characterised by a hot or warm climate and a single rainy season, where the natural vegetation is miombo or savanna woodland. The second is in the hot humid lowlands of West Africa and initially involves only Cameroon. ICRAF is supporting the programme by first promoting the network approach among government departments and research institutions in the countries concerned and then offering training in appropriate research methods. The networks should help researchers establish which problems are best solved on a regional basis and which should be tackled at the local level. However ICRAF is by no means the only international centre concerned with agroforestry. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) based in Nigeria and the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) based in Ethiopia, and with an outstation in Nigeria, have for some years been testing and developing the agroforestry system known as alley cropping. Alley cropping Originally from Asia, this is one of the innovative approaches adopted to tackle the problems caused by reduced bush fallows. Food crops are grown in the alleys between the lines of trees or shrubs. The trees are cut back like a hedge while the crop is grown, but allowed to grow out and cover the soil once it is harvested. The benefits are similar to those in a traditional bush fallow, but in this case cropping and fallowing occur side by side, so allowing continuous use of the same piece of land. The researchers have confirmed that alley cropping can be adapted to Nigerian conditions, and have tested several tree species, examining how they can be established, at what height they should be pruned, and the best distance between rows. The system has now been adopted by several villages in southwest Nigeria, although researchers were horrified to discover farmers growing highly competitive crops such as yam, melon and cassava between the young trees instead of the recommended maize. However, the trees survived and the researchers realised that what mattered was that the trees could be adapted to suit the farmers' existing system, not whether they took six months or two years to establish. This example highlights the importance of considering the farmers' needs in order to simplify the research that needs to be done. Once it is established that a system works, and has advantages over the existing one, it is more appropriate to consider the range of conditions which component species can tolerate rather than under what conditions they grow best. For farmers with limited resources farming under highly variable conditions, it is the flexibility and diversity of traditional agroforestry systems which give them their strength.
