Yug holds himself responsible for ruining Vrinda's life and wants to die as soon as possible. Rajbeer wants to ruin Yug financially and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> until Virnda comes back into their lives with her 8-year-old daughter, named Tulsi. Vrinda tells Yug that {{he had nothing to}} do with ruining her life, in fact he was the only one who stood by her. Relieved from his guilt, Yug goes back into business and gets back on top.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{new book}} in process, Theory of the Gimmick explores the [...] "gimmick" [...] as {{encoding}} a relation to labor (the gimmicky artwork irritates us because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> {{too hard to}} get our attention, but also not working hard enough), and as the inverted image of the modernist [...] "device" [...] celebrated by Victor Shklovsky. While both are essentially artistic techniques that perform the reflexive action of [...] "laying bare" [...] {{the means by which}} their effects are produced, in one case this action gives rise to a negative aesthetic judgment while it becomes a bearer of high aesthetic value in the otherExtending the focus in Ngai's second book on the historical significance of the rise of equivocal aesthetic categories (such as the merely 'interesting') and with an eye to the special difficulties posed by the very idea of an aesthetics of production (as opposed to reception), Theory of the Gimmick explores the uneasy mix of attraction and repulsion produced by the gimmick across a range of forms specific to western capitalism. These include fictions by Mark Twain, Charles Chesnutt, Gertrude Stein, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, and Henry James; twentieth-century poetic stunts; the video installations of contemporary artist Stan Douglas; reality television; and the novel of ideas.|$|E

The BBC {{recorded}} the whole of the Reading Festival, we went down amazingly well. Tommy Vance played 40 minutes of our set on his show and got a fantastic response from it - thus it was public reaction really that prompted us to release something from the Reading Festival. You've seen the reaction on [...] "When I'm Dancin' I Ain't Fightin'" [...] now - when we first brought the track out on the [...] "Six of the Best EP", it didn't see the light of day as far as charts were concerned - but now it's on the Reading EP and all the crowds are singing it! The turning point has been that we have been doing our songs in a live manner - and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working.</b> I don't know whether it's good or bad that we have to do this, but the live thing has always been our main strong-point. [...] "Get Down and Get With It" [...] was our first hit because it had basically a live feel to it, the same applies to [...] "When I'm Dancin' I Ain't Fightin'" [...] from Reading." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brown Panther did {{not begin}} his fourth season until the 23 June {{when he won the}} Pontefract Castle stakes {{for the second year in}} succession, beating Souviens Toi by three and a half lengths with Main Sequence in fourth place. On his next {{appearance}} he was moved up in class and distance for the Goodwood Cup over two miles on 1 August and was made 13/2 third favourite behind Mount Athos and the John Gosden-trained Caucus. The other runners included Colour Vision (winner of the 2012 Ascot Gold Cup), Altano (later to win the Prix du Cadran), Saddler's Rock (winner of the race in 2012) and Cavalryman (Grand Prix de Paris, Dubai Gold Cup). Brown Panther tracked the leaders before forcing his way through the pack to take the lead two furlongs out. He quickly accelerated clear of his rivals and won by three and a half length from Ahzeemah with Altano taking third. Owen commented [...] "There is a lot of heritage in this race and it's a fabulous race to win. He's full of stamina" [...] before suggesting the Melbourne Cup as a future target. Dascombe said [...] "We probably haven't done as well as we should have done with him by now. I think the horse is helping us because he's maturing. We've taken our time and tried to pick races this year. We've tried to get him spot-on for each day and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> a bit better than it was. This was the plan, this was the target. Hopefully we'll move on if he's all right after this".|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} recent authors have {{compared}} Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and traditional Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). The present article describes ACT as a distinct and unified model of behavior change, linked to a specific strategy of scientific development, which we term contextual behavioral science. We outline the empirical progress of ACT and describe its distinctive development strategy. A contextual behavioral science approach is an inductive attempt to build more adequate psychological systems based on philosophical clarity; the development of basic principles and theories; the development of applied theories linked to basic ones; techniques and components linked to these processes and principles; measurement of theoretically key processes; an emphasis on mediation and moderation {{in the analysis of}} applied impact; an interest in effectiveness, dissemination, and training; empirical testing of the research program across a broad range of areas and levels of analysis; {{and the creation of a}} more effective scientific and clinical community. We argue that this is a reasonable approach, focused on long-term progress, and that in broad terms <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working.</b> ACT is not hostile to traditional CBT, and is not directly buoyed up by whatever weaknesses traditiona...|$|E
40|$|The Homewood Community Partners Initiative (HCPI) {{is one of}} {{the newest}} waves of {{development}} based in Baltimore. 1 HCPI has a different approach to development than other economic development plans in Baltimore and, in comparison to some failed attempts {{in other areas of the}} City, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working.</b> Baltimore has long suffered from blight, high rates of vacant buildings, and high crime. There have been many previous attempts to address and repair those issues with only some success. HCPI is attempting to mitigate all those issues by way of a community development agenda and a five-part plan. 2 While the execution of the plan extends beyond a simple five steps and will be spread out over many years, the HCPI agenda so far can be counted as a success. What makes the HCPI development plan successful? and can the elements that make the initiative so successful be applied elsewhere in city redevelopment? are questions to be discussed below. HCPI was first conceived in 2010, prompted by an External Affairs and Community Engagement Committee created by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Board of Trustees. JHU launched HCPI in 2011 and brought in a consultant to engage the community in a manymonths effort with the goal of identifying methods for creating a more attractive community. 3 With the formal launch of HCPI, JHU announced a $ 10 million pledge to launch the HCPI agenda 4 and to be spent over five years. 5 HCPI would not exist without the backing from an anchor institution like JHU, but one of the other major factors in the HCPI progress are its consultants and partners: McNeely Legal Services and Central Baltimore Partnership (CBP), a non-profit organization that exists to promote the betterment of central Baltimore, along with a wide variety of other partner organizations. 6 CBP was founded in 20067 and worked on a variety of projects and programs before adopting the HCPI initiative as its own agenda. Thereafter, CBP committed to engage the community in the HCPI neighborhoods and to help design the issues to be addressed by HCPI, including starting with 37 recommended programs. 8 Since the first agenda was envisioned, CBP and HCPI have narrowed the focus and chosen four key areas to target as part of the agenda: public safety and quality of life, housing creation and blight removal, public education, and retail and commercial development. 9 In conjunction with those four areas HCPI plans to augment the agenda with targeted local hiring and purchasing. 10 By targeting these areas, HCPI is set up to approach redevelopment with a holistic methodology. Rather than targeting only one issue at a time, HCPI attempts to bolster all aspects that contribute to neighborhood redevelopment...|$|E
