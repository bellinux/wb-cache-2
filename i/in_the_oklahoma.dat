5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced the cancellation of the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not safe in heavy rain and high wind. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, as did about 15,000 customers in total <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma {{is between}} the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, {{generally}} sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary. Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at 4,973 feet (1,516m) above sea level, situated near its far northwest corner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> Panhandle.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|US-64 {{was one of}} the {{original}} United States Numbered Highways designated at the highway system's creation on November 11, 1926. It stretched from the New Mexico state line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oklahoma</b> panhandle east to the Arkansas state line near Fort Smith. The original route included two sharp, right-angle turns near the city of Freedom. On February 19, 1934, the Oklahoma Highway Commission approved the re-routing of US-64 onto a roadway a bit further west to eliminate these turns. On November 9, 1937, the highway was re-routed through the city of Tulsa, as well. Later, in 1943 just south of the city of Muskogee, US-64 and SH-2, which was then concurrent with US-64, were relocated slightly to the west to allow for the new Davis Field air base to be constructed at the place the highways had run before relocation.|$|E
