40|$|In the Critique of the Power <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> Kant {{develops}} a rigorous formulation <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments,</b> {{in which he}} makes a sharp distinction between <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste and <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable (both of which are, I claim, types <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments)</b> if only to dismiss <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable as worthy objects of study. Kant is primarily concerned with <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste, the main example of which is judging something to be beautiful (whether it be {{a work of art}} or a natural object). He asserts that such judgments are subjective, universal, necessary, disinterested, and do not presuppose a purpose. The other type <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgment</b> are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable, “which are the kind <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> expressed by saying simply that one likes something or finds it pleasing. ” These are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> what, in Kant’s words, please “the senses in sensation” as opposed to pleasing ourcognition in reflection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHumans use the {{direction}} of eye gaze and facial identity to make important social judgments. We carried out the first measurements of spatial frequency (SF) tuning for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze, and compared SF tuning for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity and eye gaze. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated between leftward and rightward shifts of gaze, or between two male faces or two female faces. Faces were masked with visual noise that blocked one of 10 SF bands. For each task and masking SF, we measured contrast thresholds for human observers, and used an ideal observer to measure the amount of visual information available to perform the task. As in previous research, low to mid SFs were most important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity. Mid to high SFs were most important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze, and the highest SF important for these judgments was higher than that for identity. In Experiment 2, participants discriminated horizontal and vertical shifts of gaze. The highest SF important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> gaze did not differ between the horizontal and vertical axes. However, SFs above and below this value were more important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> vertical shifts of gaze than for horizontal shifts of gaze. These {{results suggest that the}} visual system relies on higher SFs for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze than for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity, and that SF tuning is broader for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> vertical shifts of gaze than for horizontal shifts of gaze...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension <b>of</b> time <b>judgments,</b> namely subjective <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> {{the speed of}} time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage and what factors influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage: the more {{attention is paid to}} non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation speed of stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the speed of time passage. It shows that both presentation speed of stimuli and comparison could influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage, but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation speed of stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions <b>of</b> movements on <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage such as presentation speed of stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R

40|$|Can {{numerical}} anchors influence people's <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> {{their own}} recent behavior? We {{investigate this question}} {{in a series of}} six studies. In Study 1, subjects' <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> how many anagrams they were given assimilated to numerical anchors. Subjects' <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> how many math problems they correctly solved and how many stairs they had just walked up were also influenced by numerical anchors (Studies 2 A and 3 A), and this occurred even when the anchors were extreme and nonsensical (Studies 2 B and 3 B). Thus, our first five studies showed that anchors can affect people's <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> their own recent behavior. Finally, in Study 4, we tested the hypothesis that self-knowledge, despite not eliminating anchoring effects, does still attenuate anchoring. However, we found no evidence that self-knowledge reduced anchoring: subjects' <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> their own recent behavior and subjects' <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> other people's recent behavior were equally influenced by anchors. We discuss implications of these findings for research on domain knowledge and anchoring, as well as for research on the malleability of memory...|$|R
40|$|Perceptions and <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> 84 {{managers}} were analyzed {{in the development}} of models of organisational effectiveness applied in managerial judgments. Managers described 283 subordinate organization units in terms of 114 variables often mentioned as indicative of organizational effectiveness.

Analysis of the descriptions indicated that the 114 variables reflect 24 basic dimensions of organizational effectiveness. Models predictive <b>of</b> managerial <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> organizational effectiveness were developed using these 24 dimensions. A general model accounted for 56 per cent of the variance <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> overall effectiveness made by the 84 managers. Other models developed for more homogeneous sub-samples of managers accounted for 75 to 85 per cent of the variance in <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> overall effectiveness.

In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In Hirst, the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.|$|E
