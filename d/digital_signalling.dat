50|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is {{a signal}} that is {{constructed}} from a discrete set of waveforms of a physical quantity so as to represent a sequence of discrete values.

50|$|The signals {{carried by}} SCART include both {{composite}} and RGB (with composite synchronisation) video, stereo audio input/output and <b>digital</b> <b>signalling.</b> The standard was extended {{at the end}} of the 1980s to support the new S-Video signals. A TV can be awakened from standby mode, and it can automatically switch to appropriate AV channel, when the device attached to it through a SCART connector is turned on. SCART connection was also used for high definition signals like 720i, 720p, 1080i, 1080p with YPbPr connection by some manufacturers, but to the present day this connection is very scarce due to the advent of HDMI.|$|E
50|$|V5 {{provided}} a standard set of protocols from the subscriber to the LE. The AN (or Access Network) {{was defined as}} a reference point. Signalling between this point and the LE was standardised and therefore allowed a multiple vendor solution, provided the specifications were followed. This resulted in a single link (or in the case of V5.2 multiple links) from the AN to the LE, reducing the need for many lines along this point (or more likely no need for a proprietary solution to manage the single link). The final link to the local loop remained the same with <b>digital</b> <b>signalling</b> (ISDN) and analogue signalling for basic telephony (also known as POTS in the industry).|$|E
5000|$|Examples of coded {{track circuit}} systems include the Pennsylvania Railroad {{standard}} system, {{a variation of}} which was used on the London Underground Victoria line, Later, audio frequency (AF) track circuit systems eventually came to replace [...] "power" [...] frequency systems in rapid transit applications as higher frequency signals could self-attenuate reducing the need for insulated rail joints. Some of the first users of AF cab signal systems include the Washington Metro and Bay Area Rapid Transit. More recently digital systems have become preferred, transmitting speed information to trains using datagrams instead of simple codes. The French TVM makes use of the running rails to transmit the <b>digital</b> <b>signalling</b> information while the German LZB system makes use of auxiliary wires strung down {{the centre of the}} track to continually transmit the signalling information.|$|E
