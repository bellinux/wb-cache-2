5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often <b>have</b> <b>them</b> in multiple copies.|$|E
