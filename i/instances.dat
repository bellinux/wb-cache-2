30|$|In {{addition}} to {{the time it takes}} for the cloud infrastructure to provision an <b>instance,</b> configuration scripts that need to run also determine the time it takes for the <b>instance</b> to become available. To some extent, this time can be reduced by installing frequently required packages in the <b>instance</b> image used. For example, in the case of ELVIRA we installed OpenJDK in the <b>instance</b> image as well as the Swarm client.jar file to avoid having to download them every time an <b>instance</b> is created. The Portland Group Fortran libraries, in contrast, are staged in each time an <b>instance</b> is created since we wanted to keep the <b>instance</b> image generic.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} {{that the structure}} of the set of stable marriages of a stable marriage <b>instance</b> can be represented as a finite distributive lattice and, conversely, every finite distributive lattice is a set of stable marriages for some stable marriage <b>instance.</b> Recently, Irving [12] and Gusfield [9] propose some representations of the set of all stable assignments for a given solvable <b>instance</b> of the stable roommates problem. In this paper, we will give a unifying approach to the structures of the stable marriage problem and the stable roommates problem. To achieve this purpose, we first study the duality in the structure of a stable marriage <b>instance,</b> then transform every stable roommates <b>instance</b> into a corresponding stable marriage <b>instance</b> and obtain {{the structure of the}} stable roommates <b>instance</b> directly from that of the corresponding stable marriage <b>instance.</b> The main results of this paper are: (1) There is a one-one correspondence between the set of stable marriages for a stable marriage <b>instance</b> and the set of feasible words of some Faigle geometry; (2) There is a one-one correspondence between the set of stable assignments for a stable roommates <b>instance</b> and the set of basic words of some Faigle geometry...|$|R
