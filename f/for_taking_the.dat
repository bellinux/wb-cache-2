5|$|Members {{who would}} become famous {{included}} George Burns and Bucharest-born Edward G. Robinson, who had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1906. Robinson would later laugh that his propensity <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> stage was demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech {{in the history of}} the congregation—"but the men sat still and listened".|$|E
5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car crash that kills a mother and her daughter. Although Susan was driving, Mike takes the blame, as Susan did not have her license with her at the time. Susan feels incredibly guilty <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), but Mike insists it was not their fault. The argument over the topic becomes so great that it results in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> train. The Ballon d'Alsace, {{which had been}} the first real {{mountain}} in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured again. Just as the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.|$|E
5|$|John Komnenos married Anna Dalassene, the {{daughter}} of Alexios Charon, most likely in 1044. Anna, born c. 1028, long outlived her husband and after his death ran the family as its undisputed matriarch. Anna became involved in conspiracies against the Doukas family, whom she never forgave <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1059. Later she also {{played a major role}} in the successful overthrow of Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078–81) and the rise of her son Alexios to the throne. After that, and for about fifteen years, she served as the virtual co-ruler of the empire along her son. She then retired to a monastery, where she died in 1100 or 1102.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to {{the fall}} of 1993. Jack Tunney {{announced}} that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's gold chains.|$|E

5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{stretched}} the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany’s president to reach across political, national, and age boundaries {{to address a}} wide range of controversial issues. He is credited with being largely responsible <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying it was not necessary for the government to send a representative.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

5|$|In July 1799, Baranov {{returned}} to Sitka Sound on the brig Oryol and established {{the settlement of}} Arkhangelsk, also known as Fort Archangel Gabriel. In June 1802, Tlingit warriors attacked the settlement and killed or captured most of the 150 Russians and Aleuts living there. Baranov led an armed expedition to retake Sitka by force in June 1804. The Russian warship Neva joined Baranov at Sitka. A new Russian fort was established while the Tlingit prepared to defend themselves with a well-armed fort of their own. Tension rapidly escalated into skirmishes and negotiations broke down. In early October, the Russians attacked the Tlingit fort with cannon from the Neva and from a land party. The Tlingit responded with powerful gun and cannon fire of their own. The Battle of Sitka continued for several days until the Tlingit abandoned their fort and left the area. Tlingit accounts of the battle refuse to admit defeat or give the Russians credit <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> Tlingit fort. The Russians destroyed the abandoned Tlingit fort and named the new Russian fort Novo-Arkhangelsk (New Archangel), also known as Fort Archangel Michael and Fort Saint Michael. The confrontations at Sitka in 1802 and 1804 {{played a significant role}} in subsequent Tlingit-Russian relations for generations.|$|E
5|$|The baths {{have been}} {{modified}} on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, {{when the city}} corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) {{to the south of}} the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room, a neo-classical salon which remains in use, both <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo-classical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810 the hot springs failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original course and the baths filled in less time than before.|$|E
