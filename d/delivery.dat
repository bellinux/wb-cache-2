40|$|Data from Berlin (Germany) show a {{significant}} correlation between {{the increase in the}} stork population around the city and the increase in <b>deliveries</b> outside city hospitals (out-of-hospital <b>deliveries).</b> However, there is no correlation between <b>deliveries</b> in hospital buildings (clinical <b>deliveries)</b> and the stork population. The {{decline in the number of}} pairs of storks in the German state of Lower Saxony between 1970 and 1985 correlated with the decrease of <b>deliveries</b> in that area. The nearly constant num-ber of <b>deliveries</b> from 1985 to 1995 was associated with an unchanged stork popula-tion (no statistical significance). However, the relevance of the stork for the birth rate in that part of Germany remains unclear, because the number of out-of-hospital deliv-eries in this area is not well documented. A lack of statistical information on out-of-hospital <b>deliveries</b> in general is a severe handicap for further proof for the Theory of the Stork...|$|R

40|$|Breech {{presentation}} implies {{vertical position}} of the fetus, accounting for 3 - 4 % of all monofetal <b>deliveries.</b> Perinatal morbidity and mortality are significantly higher in breech <b>deliveries</b> than in head presentation <b>deliveries.</b> The aim of the investigation {{was to examine the}} association between the anamnestic and population characteristics of the breech <b>deliveries</b> and the same characteristics in the head <b>deliveries.</b> Study group included 282 mothers who had breech <b>deliveries</b> and 282 mothers in control group who had head presentation <b>deliveries.</b> All the babies were delivered at the Clinic of Obstetrics and Gyneclogy Kragujevac. The population sample - the subject of the study encompassed mothers from Sumadija region with the center in Kragujevac as the capital and biggest city in the region. Distribution of probabilities according to profession or education of mothers was similar in both groups. The mean age of the mothers in both groups was 26. 8 years. Significantly, the largest number of mothers from both groups was between 20 and 29 years of age, e. g. 70 %. With significantly high probability, the pregnancy progression in both groups was positive (85 %), without maintaining pregnancy.

40|$|Improving {{maternal}} health {{has been a}} challenge for developing nations with very high rates of maternal mortality. Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, {{has some of the}} highest maternal mortality rates in the world. In an attempt to improve on this, the Sierra Leonean government enacted free {{maternal health}}care services in 2010. The Sierra Leone Free Healthcare Initiative (SLFHCI) provides free healthcare for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children under 5 years old. This research explored the impact of the free healthcare on hospital <b>deliveries.</b> The determinant of health model was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the SLFHCI program, and a quantitative study design was used to analyze 1, 200 samples of secondary data. Five research questions aimed to determine how the pre and postimplementation periods of the SLFHCI program impacted the rate of antenatal services usage, hospital <b>deliveries,</b> low birth weight <b>deliveries,</b> very low birth weight <b>deliveries,</b> and preterm <b>deliveries.</b> Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression were used to analyze data. The results indicated improvements in antenatal visits, hospital <b>deliveries,</b> low birth weight <b>deliveries,</b> and preterm <b>deliveries</b> after adjusting for covariates. The results suggest that the SLFCHI program is an effective strategy for preventing low birth weight and preterm <b>deliveries</b> and for improving antenatal visits and hospital <b>deliveries.</b> The knowledge gained from this research could provide a roadmap for improving overall maternal care in Sierra Leone and other affected countries. Strategies to improve the quality of the SLFHCI intervention are worthy of further investigatio...|$|R

40|$|During daily 3 -hr sessions, 5 rhesus monkeys drank drug {{solutions}} and water that were concurrently available. The drug solutions were: 1 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) pentobarbital (2 monkeys), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 0. 5 % ethanol (1 monkey), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 1 % ethanol (1 monkey), and 8 % ethanol (1 monkey). The drug solution and water were available under identical two-component tandem fixed-ratio continuous-reinforcement N schedules. Two variables were manipulated: {{the size of}} the fixed-ratio component and the number of liquid <b>deliveries</b> (N) in the second component. <b>Deliveries</b> of the drug solution maintained higher rates of responding than did <b>deliveries</b> of the drug vehicle, water. The number of drug <b>deliveries</b> per session increased with increases in the number of <b>deliveries</b> per fixed ratio and decreased with increases in fixed-ratio size. Analysis of the results in terms of the proportion of <b>deliveries</b> to responses showed that the number of drug <b>deliveries</b> per session was directly related to the size of this quotient. Finally, when fixed-ratio size was repeatedly doubled, the following orderly relationship emerged: The greater the number of available drug <b>deliveries</b> per fixed ratio, the less was the percent {{decrease in the number of}} fixed ratios completed per session.

This is because Staples has a poor control of its suppliers in the current situation. Another problem that Staples experience is that their inspection of the incoming flow is taking too long time.
