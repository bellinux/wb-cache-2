25|$|The CDKN2A gene {{is located}} on the {{chromosome}} 9p21 locus, which <b>is</b> <b>intriguing</b> for several reasons. First, this region is well known in cancer genetics {{as one of the most}} common sites of deletions leading to hereditary forms of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Second, genome wide association studies have reported a significant association of chromosome 9p21 with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction as well as the progression of atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{the central}} Arctic Ocean was {{ice-free}} before, during, {{and after the}} PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) at 87°N on Lomonosov Ridge. Moreover, temperatures increased during the PETM, {{as indicated by the}} brief presence of subtropical dinoflagellates, and a marked increase in TEX86. The latter record <b>is</b> <b>intriguing,</b> though, because it suggests a 6°C (11°F) rise from ~ before the PETM to ~ during the PETM. Assuming the TEX86 record reflects summer temperatures, it still implies much warmer temperatures on the North Pole compared to the present day, but no significant latitudinal amplification relative to surrounding time.|$|E

25|$|The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars {{telecommunications}} orbiter {{and atmospheric}} gas analyzer mission that was launched on 14 March 2016. The spacecraft {{arrived in the}} Martian orbit in October 2016. It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of methane on Mars and other gases, and in doing so, help select the landing site for the ExoMars rover to be launched in 2020. The presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere <b>is</b> <b>intriguing</b> because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon {{the arrival of the}} rover in 2021, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the Schiaparelli EDM lander and ExoMars rover with telecommunication relay. NASA provided an Electra telecommunications relay and navigation instrument to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth. The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.|$|E

500|$|While {{the absence}} of {{ceramics}} appears anomalous, the presence of textiles <b>is</b> <b>intriguing.</b> Quipu (or khipu), string-based recording devices, have been found at Caral, suggesting a writing, or [...] "proto-writing", system at Norte Chico. (The discovery was reported by Mann in Science in 2005, but has not been formally published or described by Shady.) The exact use of quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widely debated. Originally it {{was believed to be}} simply a mnemonic used to record numeric information, such as a count of items bought and sold. Evidence has emerged that the quipu may also have recorded logographic information in the same way writing does. Research has focused on the much larger sample of a few hundred quipu dating to Inca times; the Norte Chico discovery remains singular and undeciphered.|$|E
500|$|What <b>is</b> <b>intriguing</b> {{about this}} {{literary}} {{link between the}} oldest Polish cookbook and the national epic is that Mickiewicz apparently confused the title of Czerniecki's work with that of Wielądko's Kucharz doskonały, both in the poem itself and in the poet's explanatory notes. Whether this {{is a result of}} the author's mistake or poetic license, remains a matter of scholarly dispute. According to the poet's friend, Antoni Edward Odyniec, Mickiewicz never parted with an [...] "old and torn book" [...] entitled Doskonały kucharz, which he carried in his personal traveling library. Stanisław Pigoń, a historian of Polish literature, has suggested that it was actually a copy of Czerniecki's book, which happened to be missing its title page, so Mickiewicz was familiar with the contents of Compendium ferculorum, but not with its title, and confounded it with Wielądko's cookbook.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene in the}} episode, Hawking and Homer are seen {{discussing}} the universe in Moe's tavern.

Noire floors {{you out of the}} gate, loses some steam due to repetition, but eventually wins the day thanks to its subtlety, attention to detail, and stunning character interaction." [...] GameSpot's Carolyn Petit awarded the game a 9 out of 10, concluding that [...] "L.A. Noires absorbing investigations and intoxicating sense of style make it an unforgettable journey through the seamy side of the City of Angels." [...] GameZone gave the game an 8.5/10, stating [...] "The story <b>is</b> <b>intriguing,</b> albeit a little slow at first. L.A. Noire takes an old school approach toward its storytelling. It’s a much slower approach, similar to older movies, with a heavy emphasis on detail. It is that attention to detail that sets L.A.

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept <b>is</b> <b>intriguing,</b> bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works.

[...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
500|$|As to why Proba {{arranged}} {{in the poem}} in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was {{a reaction to the}} Roman emperor Julian's law forbidding Christians from teaching classical Greek and Latin mythological literature which they did not believe to be true. Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil [...] "without [...] gods, and [...] a [...] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism". In this way, a Christian teacher could use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their moral integrity. A somewhat related hypothesis, proposed by the classicist Aurelio Amatucci, suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible. However, there is no direct evidence that the poem was a teaching tool. Clark and Hatch postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's Caesares and Contra Galilaeos. They conclude that the hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>intriguing</b> but unverifiable {{due to the lack of}} information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions.|$|E

500|$|The work, {{which is}} in part a retrospective, [...] "conflated early modernism with {{emergent}} postmodernism". Lichtenstein refers {{to some of his}} paintings, including Look Mickey in this work, which depicts his own studio as the ideal studio and implies that the public consensus ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter. The series depicts individual Lichtenstein works as well as groups of works in closed room that is ironically devoid of paint brushes or easels. The series served as a review of Lichtenstein's post 1961 work, with objects of his prior works decorating the room as furnishings. [...] In Artist's Studio—Look Mickey, the couch, door, wall frieze, telephone and fruit all are drawn from earlier works and serve this setting as interior decoration, while Look Mickey is almost presented undisturbed in its entirety. Less notable works include the mirror and the Trompe-l'œil painting of the rear side of the canvas. Two other paintings were works in progress {{at the time of this}} work and one became a painting within a year after the completion of this work: the gull and the dune landscape. The speech balloon was never produced as a separate work. However, its juxtaposition to the speech balloon from Donald Duck <b>is</b> <b>intriguing.</b> He references his Entablatures works as ceiling molding.|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, actress Nayantara {{was signed}} {{for the female}} lead role in Paiyaa for a record salary of 1 crore. Speaking about the issue, the {{director}} admitted that {{she was one of}} his favourite actress and he liked her performance in Yaaradi Nee Mohini. He also quoted: [...] "The way her career graph shot up <b>is</b> <b>intriguing.</b> Unlike others her career progressed in reverse gear. She paired up with the superstar {{during the early years of}} her career and started accepting roles with heroes of next generation." [...] She also expressed her interest to work in the project. However, plans were made to trim the film's budget due to the economic recession, and discussions were held with Nayantara to reduce her salary. The talks resulted in failure and Nayantara left the project in December 2008. Later, she was accused of cheating the director by refusing to return an advance of 15 lakh she had taken before commencement, after walking out of the film. The director filed a complaint with the Tamil Film Producers Council, which decided to ban the actress. Subsequently, Trisha was reported to have won the role, before Tamannaah was finalised as the female lead, who was signed for 80 lakh. Later in December 2008, Milind Soman, who had last appeared in Pachaikili Muthucharam, was signed up for the main antagonist's role, a Mumbai-based don, with other minor antagonists numbering up to 18.|$|E
500|$|Justin Ravitz of PopMatters {{called the}} series a [...] "cleverly trashy postmodern soap" [...] and {{credited}} it for reviving {{the soap opera}} genre, which he felt had disappeared but still suited American culture. He compared the pilot to Sex and the City, declaring it [...] "could potentially replace the departed Sex as the TV Sunday ritual for women and gay men everywhere, although DH is the guiltier pleasure of the two." [...] However, he noted the contrasting tones and dynamics between the two series, and stated that the friendships between Desperate Housewives four leading women seemed [...] "tenuous," [...] opining, [...] "the sisterly, sugar-swapping connection between the surviving women is superficial, and clearly vulnerable to shifting alliances, acts of betrayal and crowd-pleasing cat-fights." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety called the pilot [...] "oodles of fun." [...] He complimented the cast, stating that while Hatcher provides [...] "the emotional core" [...] of the series, [...] "nearly everyone <b>is</b> <b>intriguing</b> {{in one way or}} another," [...] and predicted that Eva Longoria would become the show's breakout star. However, Lowry noted that Desperate Housewives may be [...] "a little too smart for its own good" [...] and expressed concern over the series' [...] "soapy elements." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the pilot, assessing, [...] "In visual style, witty language, borderline surrealism and overall mad attitude, [...] stands on a mountaintop all its own, the best new drama of the season and perhaps the best new comedy, too." [...] He complimented Cross and Hatcher's performances, as well as the writing for the Mary Alice character's narrations. The Futon Critic selected the pilot as the 26th best television episode of 2004.|$|E

500|$|Critics adulated the {{character}} development of Rick Grimes, {{as well as}} the concluding scene of [...] "Nebraska". Kine appreciated the attempt to incorporate a suspenseful feeling in the series. She wrote: [...] "Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn’t find it that tense, I appreciated the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger." [...] Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming [...] "something of a badass". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. [...] "This {{is one of the best}} scenes I’ve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past," [...] he opined. [...] "The tension builds naturally , the dialogue has actual subtext, and there’s a clear sense of risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself." [...] Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. [...] "There are characters with new information ," [...] Meslow commented. [...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There <b>is</b> <b>intriguing</b> parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was [...] "as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters".|$|E
2500|$|The {{increase}} in mammalian abundance <b>is</b> <b>intriguing.</b> There {{is no evidence}} of any increased extinction rate among the terrestrial biota.
