5|$|Final Fantasy XI is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG), and {{differs from}} previous {{titles in the}} series in several ways. Unlike the predefined main characters of previous Final Fantasy titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender, facial style, <b>hair</b> <b>color,</b> body size, job, and nation allegiance. Also diverging from previous games in the series, the game {{takes place in a}} fully three-dimensional landscape with enemies freely roaming in it, allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the random encounters used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered Final Fantasy title since.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} advertising, {{the game was}} dubbed , and used {{character}} and narrative concepts that did {{not appear in the}} final product. The graphics also underwent changes, being particularly noticeable with Marth's <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> and style. The game was advertised on television with a live-action commercial featuring a version of the Fire Emblem theme. Filming the commercial proved troublesome: the actors overheated due to their heavy costumes, and the light and sound effects made the actor horse skittish. The commercial required twenty retakes. The game released on April 20, 1990. Future ports were released through Nintendo's Virtual Console. It released for the Wii on October 20, 2009; for Nintendo 3DS on August 1, 2012; and for Wii U on June 4, 2014.|$|E

5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have their eye and <b>hair</b> <b>color,</b> facial features, and skin tone customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what <b>hair</b> <b>color</b> they would have.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. <b>Hair</b> <b>coloring</b> {{products}} {{are widely used}} and contain components that are mutagenic and carcinogenic. An association between occupational exposure to <b>hair</b> <b>coloring</b> products and hematopoietic cancers has been reported, but the risk for these cancers among users has not been carefully evaluated. METHODS. We conducted a population-based, case-control study with telephone interviews from 385 with telephone interviews from 385 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, 70 Hodgkin's disease cases, 72 multiple myeloma cases, 56 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases, and 1432 controls. RESULTS. Among women, use was associated with odds ratios of 1. 5 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1. 7 for Hodgkin's disease, 1. 8 for multiple myeloma, and 1. 0 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Risk was higher for permanent <b>hair</b> <b>coloring</b> products than for semi- or nonpermanent products, particularly for dark colors. Long duration and early age of first use tended to increase risk, but the patterns were inconsistent. Use was much less common in men and did not significantly increase risk. CONCLUSIONS. The use of <b>hair</b> <b>coloring</b> products appears to {{increase the risk of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease were also associated, although based on far fewer subjects. If these results represent a causal association, use of <b>hair</b> <b>coloring</b> products would account for 35 % of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases in exposed women and 20 % in all women...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis [...] Representative natural <b>hair</b> <b>colors</b> {{have been}} {{characterized}} in physical terms using {{a specially designed}} gonioreflectometer and the tristimulus system. Dominant wavelength varies very little; most samples fall {{in the range from}} 586 to 588 nm. Purity varies between 10 and 60 %; luminosity between about 2 and 90 %. Measured purity correlates with the subjective descriptors ashen and warmth. <b>Hair</b> <b>colors</b> of low purity are ash or drab and those of high purity warm or red. Similarly, measured luminosity correlates with the subjec-tive assessment of dark or light; hair of low luminosity is dark and of high luminosity light or blonde. The tristimulus data for natural <b>hair</b> <b>colors</b> can be classified and correlated with subjective descriptions as "dark brown, " "medium brown, " "warm blonde, " etc. Similar measurements of several earlier workers are in good agreement with these classifications...|$|R
