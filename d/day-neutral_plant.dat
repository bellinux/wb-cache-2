40|$|The {{last decade}} the Belgian florist azalea sector {{suffered}} increasingly from inferior flowering quality. The production scheme of azalea {{is complex and}} therefore {{it was difficult for}} growers to point out the exact cause for the problem. The impact of plant growth regulators on flowering and the need for a cold period to release dormancy have been investigated. An integrated approach that combined physiological measurements and gene expression of candidate genes was applied in two different stages of azalea growth. The impact of day length conditions together with plant growth regulators on the flower initiation revealed that azalea is a <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plant.</b> Application of growth regulators speeds up the flower initiation and the expression of an FT-like gene, one of the signalling molecules in this process. The expression of LFY appears to be indicative {{for the start of the}} flower differentiation process. The increased LFY expression can be measured prior to the microscopic confirmation of flower bud initiation. Florist azalea flower buds have a dormant stage and require a period of cold to release it. The expression profiles of ELIP, ARP and dehydrin revealed that dormancy was released after 4 to 5 weeks at 7 degrees C. This was confirmed in a bio-assay. The expression of SUSY and a-amylase confirmed that cold treatment has a negative impact on the starch concentration in the plant which can have serious drawbacks on anthesis...|$|E
40|$|Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plant</b> with a {{sympodial}} growth habit. Triple mutants {{were produced}} {{in order to}} investigate the genetic interactions in the flowering regulation of this species in the initial and sympodial segments. The jointless: uniflora: self pruning and uniflora: blind: self pruning triple mutants were produced by crossing the jointless:uniflora and uniflora:blind double mutants with the uniflora:self pruning double mutant. The phenotype of the triple mutants was characterised and {{the expression of the}} affected genes was studied in the uniflora mutant through semi quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The triple mutants produced solitary flowers, as their uniflora parent, instead of inflorescences. They were both late flowering in the initial segment with a flowering time intermediate between their parental double mutants. The flowering time of the sympodial segments was delayed in the jointless: uniflora: self pruning triple mutant while the uniflora: blind: self pruning triple mutant did not initiate sympodial segments. The expression of the studied genes was not markedly affected by the uniflora mutation. These results suggest that floral transition of the primary shoot and of sympodial segments is regulated differently in tomato. The UNIFLORA gene acts upstream of the other investigated genes in controlling reproductive structure and flowering time of the initial segment although their expression does not seem affected by the uniflora mutation. In the sympodial segments, the self pruning determinate phenotype is strengthened by the blind mutation and suppressed by the jointless mutation...|$|E
50|$|<b>Day-neutral</b> <b>plants,</b> such as cucumbers, roses, and tomatoes, do not {{initiate}} flowering {{based on}} photoperiodism.

50|$|Much {{emphasis}} is placed on photoperiod when discussing plant development.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant {{architecture}} {{and the timing}} and distribution of reproductive structures are fundamental agronomic traits shaped by patterns of determinate and indeterminate growth. Florigen, encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) in tomato, acts as a general growth hormone, advancing determinate growth. Domestication of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) converted it from a lanky photoperiodic perennial to a highly inbred, compact <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plant</b> that is managed as an annual row-crop. This dramatic change in plant architecture provides {{a unique opportunity to}} analyze the transition from perennial to annual growth. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore these architectural changes, we addressed the role of day-length upon flowering in an ancestral, perennial accession and in a domesticated variety of cotton. Using a disarmed Cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV) as a transient expression system, we delivered FT to both cotton accessions. Ectopic expression of FT in ancestral cotton mimicked the effects of day-length, promoting photoperiod-independent flowering, precocious determinate architecture, and lanceolate leaf shape. Domesticated cotton infected with FT demonstrated more synchronized fruiting and enhanced "annualization". Transient expression of FT also facilitated simple crosses between wild photoperiodic and domesticated day-neutral accessions, effectively demonstrating a mechanism to increase genetic diversity among cultivated lines of cotton. Virus was not detected in the F(1) progeny, indicating that crosses made by this approach do not harbor recombinant DNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend our understanding of FT as a general growth hormone that regulates shoot architecture by advancing organ-specific and age-related determinate growth. Judicious manipulation of FT could benefit cotton architecture to improve crop management...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from vegetative growth to floral meristems in higher plants is regulated through {{the integration of}} internal cues and environmental signals. We were interested to examine the molecular mechanism of flowering in the <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plant</b> tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{and the effect of}} environmental conditions on tomato flowering. Analysis of the tomato genome uncovered 13 PEBP (phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) genes, and found six of them were FT-like genes which named as SlSP 3 D, SlSP 6 A, SlSP 5 G, SlSP 5 G 1, SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3. 6 FT-like genes were analyzed to clarify their functional roles in flowering using transgenic and expression analyses. We found that SlSP 5 G, SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3 proteins were floral inhibitors whereas only SlSP 3 D/SFT (SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS) was a floral inducer. SlSP 5 G was expressed at higher levels in long day (LD) conditions compared to short day (SD) conditions while SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3 showed the opposite expression patterns. The silencing of SlSP 5 G by VIGS (Virus induced gene silencing) resulted in tomato plants that flowered early under LD conditions and the silencing of SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3 led to early flowering under SD conditions. The higher expression levels of SlSP 5 G under LD conditions were not seen in phyB 1 mutants, and the expression levels of SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3 were increased in phyB 1 mutants under both SD and LD conditions compared to wild type plants. These data suggest that SlSP 5 G, SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3 are controlled by photoperiod, and the different expression patterns of FT-like genes under different photoperiod may contribute to tomato being a day neutral plant. In addition, PHYB 1 mediate the expression of SlSP 5 G, SlSP 5 G 2 and SlSP 5 G 3 to regulate flowering in tomato...|$|E
40|$|Plants are sessile {{organisms and}} so they cannot escape changes in {{environmental}} conditions. In order to optimize seed production {{and to ensure that}} flowering occurs during the appropriate season, plants have evolved a complex of regulatory pathways to control when the floral transition takes place. One group of regulatory pathways involves enviromental factors like certain photoperiod or vernalization. The second group of regulatory pathways involves the state of development and is not sensitive to environmental cues, this pathway is called autonomous pathway and plants in this group do not require a particular photoperiod or vernalization, they are called <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plants.</b> The transition of these plants from vegetative to reproductive phase depends on combination of reaching certain minimal number of nodes, inhibition effect of roots, floral signals generated by leaves and activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Among early events of the transition of SAM to reproductive phase belongs an increase in the mitotic activities of the cells in SAM. Precise mechanisms of the action of the signals connected with transition of SAM to flowering have not been elucidated yet. The <b>plants</b> of <b>day-neutral</b> tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cv.

40|$|Light {{of various}} {{spectral}} regions (at low or high intensities) supplemented a short day (SD) in white light, or was used alone at high intensity. Two types of relation of wave length to photoperiodic reaction were found: Crucifers were sensitive to blue and infrared (even SD exposure promoted elongation and flowering) {{and did not}} respond to 520 - 700 mμ(so this region inhibited flowering in white light despite its blue component); other plants, e. g. Cosmos bipinnatus and Spinacia oleracea were sensitive to 520 - 700 mμand showed little or no response to blue and infrared. Flowering of <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plants</b> was not affected by wave length of supplementary light. All species showed strong response to supplementary blue and infrared radiation, by excessive elongation of a part such as internodes, leaves or petioles. The rate depended on light intensity and the process was inhibited by red or green. Light of restricted spectral regions also induced strong formative and biochemical effects. Infrared counteracted red light. 'Monochromatic' light of high intensity perhaps regulated auxin level, whereas the supplementary light might effect its activity or sensitivity to auxin. <p/...|$|R
40|$|The rooting of {{cuttings}} from day-neutral tomato was not {{influenced by}} flower development, nor by SD or LD treatments {{of them or}} of the mother plants. In cuttings of the SD plant Perilla crispa flower initiation and development severely inhibited rooting. Leaves produced about 61 % of the roots, buds about 16 %, stems a small proportion. Together these organs were more effective than their summed separate effects. A supposed substance regulating adventitious root formation would need more than 2 days for transport from the leaves or buds. The physiological age of the cutting markedly affected rooting. The presence of buds during SD treatment may have changed auxin distribution, which became concentrated in the apical region and slightly promoted rooting there. Stems could induce flowering. Day length had no influence during rooting. Light {{on the base of}} the cutting inhibited root formation. In the LD plant red clover, flower initiation inhibited rooting of cuttings. In both SD and LD plants, auxin distribution during flower initiation and development must cause antagonism between adventitious root formation and flowering. This did not apply to <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plants</b> with a vegetative terminal bud, but perhaps to those with a terminal flower bud. <p/...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} to form flower buds in thin-layer explants was studied in flowering plants of several species, cultivars, and lines of Nicotiana differing in {{their response to}} photoperiod. This capacity was found in all biotypes examined and could extend into sepals and corolla. It varied greatly, depending on genotype, source tissue and its developmental stage, and composition of the culture medium, particularly the levels of glucose, auxin, and cytokinin. It was greatest in the two <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plants</b> examined, Samsun tobacco and Nicotiana rustica, where it extended from the inflorescence region down the vegetative stem, in a basipetally decreasing gradient; it was least in the two qualitative photoperiodic plants studied, the long-day plant Nicotiana silvestris and the short-day plant Maryland Mammoth tobacco, the quantitative long-day plant Nicotiana alata and the quantitative short-day plant Nicotiana otophora line 38 -G- 81, where it {{was limited to the}} pedicels (and, in some cases, the sepals). Regardless of the photoperiodic response of the source plants, the response was the same in explants cultured under long and short days. The finding that {{capacity to}} form flower buds in explants is present in all Nicotiana biotypes studied supports the idea that it is regulated by the same mechanism(s), regardless of the plant's photoperiodic character. However, the source plants were all in the flowering stage, and no flower-bud formation can be obtained in explants from strictly vegetative Nicotiana plants. Hence, flower formation in the explants is not identical with de novo flower formation in a hitherto vegetative plant: it is rather the expression of a floral state already established in the plant, although it can vary widely in extent and spatial distribution. Culture conditions that permit flower-bud formation in an explant are conditions that maintain the floral state and encourage its expression; conditions under which no flower buds are formed reduce this state and/or prevent its expression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The diploid {{woodland}} strawberry (Fragaria vesca) {{is an attractive}} system for functional genomics studies. Its small stature, fast regeneration time, efficient transformability and small genome size, together with substantial EST and genomic sequence resources make it an ideal reference plant for Fragaria and other herbaceous perennials. Most importantly, this species shares gene sequence similarity and genomic microcolinearity {{with other members of}} the Rosaceae family, including large-statured tree crops (such as apple, peach and cherry), and brambles and roses as well as with the cultivated octoploid strawberry, F. × ananassa. F. vesca may be used to quickly address questions of gene function relevant to these valuable crop species. Although some F. vesca lines have been shown to be substantially homozygous, in our hands plants in purportedly homozygous populations exhibited a range of morphological and physiological variation, confounding phenotypic analyses. We also found the genotype of a named variety, thought to be well-characterized and even sold commercially, to be in question. An easy to grow, standardized, inbred diploid Fragaria line with documented genotype that is available to all members of the research community will facilitate comparison of results among laboratories and provide the research community with a necessary tool for functionally testing the large amount of sequence data that will soon be available for peach, apple, and strawberry. Results A highly inbred line, YW 5 AF 7, of a diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca f. semperflorens line called "Yellow Wonder" (Y 2) was developed and examined. Botanical descriptors were assessed for morphological characterization of this genotype. The plant line was found to be rapidly transformable using established techniques and media formulations. Conclusion The development of the documented YW 5 AF 7 line provides an important tool for Rosaceae functional genomic analyses. These <b>day-neutral</b> <b>plants</b> have a small genome, a seed to seed cycle of 3. 0 - 3. 5 months, and produce fruit in 7. 5 cm pots in a growth chamber. YW 5 AF 7 is runnerless and therefore easy to maintain in the greenhouse, forms abundant branch crowns for vegetative propagation, and produces highly aromatic yellow fruit throughout the year in the greenhouse. F. vesca can be transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, making these plants suitable for insertional mutagenesis, RNAi and overexpression studies that can be compared against a stable baseline of phenotypic descriptors and can be readily genetically substantiated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Flowering of the SD plant Perilla crispa {{was also}} {{possible}} in LD and in continuous light, if lighting was weak enough. The light range within which flowering is possible, decreased with increasing day length. With an illumination of 300 μwatts/cm 2 spherical cross-section, seedlings were <b>day-neutral.</b> Older <b>plants</b> proved more predisposed to flower than seedlings. In plants with two equivalent but differently illuminated shoots the brightly lit shoot initiated flowers in long days through {{influence of the}} weakly lit shoot; this influence was stronger after defoliation of the brightly lit shoot. Neither in bright nor weak light (with SD or LD) did defoliation qualitatively influence flower initiation. Even 0. 5 cm leaf surface was sufficient for flower initiation. With the day-neutral tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum var. Ailsa Craig) defoliation advanced flower initiation and {{increased the number of}} flowers. Brighter light decreased the number of leaves before the initiation of the first flower cluster; in very weak light the plants could be kept vegetative for a year. With the day-neutral Phaseolus vulgaris var. Vroege Wagenaar defoliation of the main shoot promoted development of axillary shoots, through whose later defoliation the number of flowers could be increased. There was a positive correlation between flower number and light intensity. Flower initiation itself was however independent of intensity, day length, removal of cotyledons or defoliation but the number of flowers decreased through removal of the cotyledons. In SD plants too much growth regulator probably inhibited flowering; in other plants this was caused by the growing leaf. Flowering probably needed an equilibrium between available assimilates and growth regulators. <p/...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{studies in}} Arabidopsis {{established}} FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) {{as a key}} flower-promoting gene in photoperiodic systems. Grafting experiments established unequivocal one-to-one relations between SFT (SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS), a tomato homolog of FT, and the hypothetical florigen, in all flowering plants. Additional studies of SFT and SP (SELF PRUNING, homolog of TFL 1), two antagonistic genes regulating {{the architecture of the}} sympodial shoot system, have suggested that transition to flowering in the day-neutral and perennial tomato is synonymous with ‘termination’. Dosage manipulation of its endogenous and mobile, graft-transmissible levels demonstrated that florigen regulates termination and transition to flowering in an SP-dependent manner and, by the same token, that high florigen levels induce growth arrest and termination in meristems across the tomato shoot system. It was thus proposed that growth balances, and consequently the patterning of the shoot systems in all plants, are mediated by endogenous, meristem-specific SFT/SP ratios, and that shifts to termination by elevated SFT/SP ratios are triggered by mobile florigen. Florigen is a universal growth plant hormone inherently checked by a complementary antagonistic systemic system. Thus, an examination of the endogenous functions of FT-like genes, or of the systemic roles of the mobile florigen in any plant species, that fails to pay careful attention to the balancing antagonistic systems, or to consider its functions in <b>day-neutral</b> or perennial <b>plants,</b> would be incomplete...|$|R

Each block was a 100 -ft-long double row of plants with 12 -in. spacing between plants, and treatment subplots within blocks were 20 -ft segments of the double row. Data were taken only from the center 15 ft of each subplot. Timing of fungicide sprays for Botrytis fruit rot in the 2 ̆ 2 model-driven 2 ̆ 2 treatment was based on a leaf wetness-temperature model proposed by M.

In the same treatments, timing of insecticide sprays for tarnished plant bug (IPB) were based on thresholds of TPB counts; a spray was applied when the mean number of TPB 2 ̆ 7 s (sum of nymphs and adults) per fruit cluster equaled or exceeded the threshold number. TPB numbers were assessed 2 x/week by beating 10 fruit clusters per plot (one cluster per sampled plant) twice over a white plastic dish and counting TPB nymphs and adults in the dish. A fourth treatment (2 ̆ 2 weekly 2 ̆ 2) was a weekly spray of fungicides and insecticides, and a fifth treatment (2 ̆ 2 unsprayed 2 ̆ 2) received no pesticide sprays.

40|$|Strawberries are perennial, {{flowering}} plants of genus Fragaria, {{in the family}} Rosaceae. Woodland Strawberry (wild F. vesca) is the most widely distributed natural species in the northern hemisphere and a new promising model plant {{for the study of}} flowering in perennial plants.

SD F. vesca can behave as a <b>day-neutral,</b> short day <b>plant</b> or non-flowering plant depending on different ambient temperature. Flower initiation takes place regardless of photoperiod when F. vesca is put at 9 °C, but only flower under SD at 15 °C and no flowering is observed when the ambient temperature is higher than 21 °C. The experiment was designed to observe flower induction and explore the role of few flowering genes in the temperature regulation of flowering at long day (LD) condition. The expression of key flowering genes FT, SOC 1 and TFL 1 were analyzed in wild F. vesca and transgenic lines in F. vesca background. The results showed low temperature (11 °C) promotes flowering in SD F. vesca. FT was down-regulated by 11 °C and negatively correlated with flowering in F. vesca, in contrast to findings in other SD plants. SOC 1 may act downstream of FT, it represses flowering in SD F. vesc and may affect vegetative growth by interacting with GA pathway. Although FT functions as an integrator gene in flowering, there may be an FT-independent pathway in SD F. vesca.
