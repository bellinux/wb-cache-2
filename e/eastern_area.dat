5|$|In July–August 1946, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area</b> Command {{oversaw the}} {{establishment}} of No.86 (Transport) Wing, operating C-47 Dakotas, at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, displacing No.78 (Fighter) Wing, which moved to RAAF Station Williamtown, and began operating P-51 Mustangs. The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area,</b> covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal {{was part of a}} much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries largely remained in place. Lachal succeeded Charlesworth as AOC <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area</b> in October, and held command until his retirement from the Air Force in July 1947.|$|E
5|$|Headquartered in the Sydney {{suburb of}} Edgecliff, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area</b> Command was formed on 15May 1942 under the {{leadership}} of Air Vice Marshal Bill Anderson. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers. Training units in New South Wales remained part of No.2 (Training) Group. No.5 (Maintenance) Group was formed in Sydney on 1June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area</b> Command. In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the South West Pacific Area, Major General George Kenney, formed the majority of his US flying units into the Fifth Air Force, and most of their Australian counterparts into RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock. Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent on the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, for supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's {{area command}} {{structure}} was revised in 1942, following {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War: Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area,</b> was created, making a total of five commands. In October 1943, the Air Board proposed carving a new Central Area Command out of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area,</b> which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision. This Central Area Command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland. The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time the new Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland. Once again, nothing came of the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area,</b> which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area.</b> Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea.

5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following {{the cessation of}} hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area.</b> During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones, {{to ensure that they}} would operate with a degree of autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North Eastern Railway became the North <b>Eastern</b> <b>area</b> of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).

In the early 1950s control was split between the North Eastern and London Midland regions with Kirkby Stephen as the boundary. Local passenger trains were withdrawn between Kirkby Stephen and Tebay on 1 December 1952. The service along Weardale was withdrawn on 29 June 1953 and services north of Crook on 11 June 1956.|$|E
500|$|Mean annual {{precipitation}} ranges from [...] {{in the eastern}} parts of Formosa Province {{to a low of}} [...] in the west and southwest. Summer witnesses the maximum precipitation. Summer rains are intense, and torrential rain is common, occasionally causing floods and soil erosion. During the winter months, precipitation is sparse. <b>Eastern</b> <b>areas</b> receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, which penetrates the <b>eastern</b> <b>areas</b> more than the west, bringing in more precipitation. As a result, the vegetation differs: <b>eastern</b> <b>areas</b> are covered by forests, savannas, marshes and subtropical wet forest, and western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses. In all parts of the region, precipitation is highly variable from year to year.|$|R

5|$|As of 20April 1942, {{operational}} {{authority over}} all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was {{invested in the}} newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under South West Pacific Area Command (SWPA). On 15May, Southern Area, which by then was considered too large, yielded responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area.</b> Control of maintenance units under Southern Area {{was transferred to the}} newly established No.4 (Maintenance) Group in Melbourne on 14September. September also saw the formation of RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA. Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over Australian units.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In 1947 he was {{promoted}} to air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Staff at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan. Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last Air Officer Commanding (AOC) <b>Eastern</b> <b>Area</b> and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now Air Command). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954, and was knighted a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia—particularly Vietnam—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light supersonic bomber to replace the Air Force's English Electric Canberra. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in Sydney in 1989, aged 89.|$|E

Its flying complement now included Nos.12 (formerly of No.85 Wing), 21, and 23 Squadrons, but these were renumbered Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively in February 1948. At the same time, the wartime Liberators were replaced by Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. During 1949–50, some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the Royal Air Force gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the Soviet Union.|$|E
