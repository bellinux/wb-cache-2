5000|$|In general, {{molecular}} rigidity {{contributes to}} potency, while size affects whether a muscle relaxant shows a polarizing or a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effect.</b> Cations {{must be able}} to flow through the trans-membrane tube of the ion-channel to depolarize the endplate. Small molecules may be rigid and potent but unable to occupy or block the area between the receptive sites. Large molecules, on the other hand, may bind to both receptive sites and hinder depolarizing cations independent of whether the ion-channel is open or closed below. Having a lipophilic surface pointed towards the synapse enhances this effect by repelling cations. The importance of this effect varies between different muscle relaxants and classifying depolarizing from non-depolarizing blocks is a complex issue. The onium heads are usually kept small and the chains connecting the heads usually keep the N-N distance at 10 N or O atoms. Keeping the distance in mind the structure of the chain can vary (double bonded, cyclohexyl, benzyl, etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} whether regional differences exist in the effects of midazolam, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, on synaptic transmissions in rat hippocampal slices. First, the author compared the effects of midazolam on orthodromically evoked spikes, membrane properties, and synaptic potentials between CA 1 pyramidal cells (CA 1 -PC) and dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GC) using intracellular recordings. Secondly, {{the effects of a}} GABAA receptor agonist muscimol on resting membrane potentials and input resistances were compared between CA 1 -PC and DG-GC. The following results were obtained; 1. Midazolam (75 μM) applied by superfusion markedly depressed orthodromic spikes in CA 1 - PC, compared with those in DG-GC. A GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 μM) almost completely antagonized the depressant effects of midazolam on spike generation in CA 1 -PC, while bicuculline slightly antagonized the midazolam effects in DG-GC. 2. Midazolam (75 μM) produced <b>depolarizing</b> or hyperpolarizing <b>effects</b> on resting membrane potentials (RMP) with an input resistance decrease in CA 1 -PC, whereas it produced slight <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effects</b> on RMP without affecting input resistance in DG-GC. 3. Midazolam (75 μM) significantly increased the amplitudes of monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in CA 1 -PC, evoked by stimulation near the recording electrode in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists, but slightly decreased those in DG-GC. 4. Muscimol (100 μM) produced <b>depolarizing</b> or hyperpolarizing <b>effects</b> on RMP in CA 1 -PC, and <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effects</b> in DG-GC. In both CA 1 -PC and DG-GC, muscimol decreased input resistance to 75 % compared with that of control values. These results clearly demonstrated that midazolam has differential depressant effects on hippocampal synaptic transmissions in CA 1 -PC and DG-GC.

At higher concentrations (10 [*]nM– 10 [*]μM) UK 14, 304 also induced a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effect</b> which was potentiated by yohimbine and inhibited by prazosin. These results indicate that UK 14, 304 acts on α 2 -adrenoceptors at lower concentrations and on both α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptors above 10 [*]nM. In rings, with or without endothelium, noradrenaline had a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effect</b> which was inhibited by prazosin. Adrenaline {{did not affect the}} membrane potential but in the presence of prazosin caused hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by yohimbine and glibenclamide.

The majority of magnocellular neurones (67 %) showed concentration-dependent, reversible depolarizations in response to OX-A. These effects were abolished in tetrodotoxin (TTX), suggesting them to be indirect effects on this population of neurones. OX-A also caused increases in excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) frequency and amplitude in magnocellular neurones. The former effects were again blocked in TTX while increases in mini-EPSC amplitude remained. <b>Depolarizing</b> <b>effects</b> of OX-A on magnocellular neurones were also found to be abolished by kynurenic acid, supporting the conclusion that these effects {{were the result of}} activation of a glutamate interneurone. Parvocellular neurones (73 % of those tested) also showed concentration-dependent, reversible depolarizations in response to OX-A. In contrast to magnocellular neurones, these effects were maintained in TTX, indicating direct effects of OX-A on this population of neurones. Voltage clamp analysis using slow voltage ramps demonstrated that OX-A enhanced a non-selective cationic conductance with a reversal potential of - 40 mV in parvocellular neurones, effects which probably explain the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effects</b> of this peptide in this subpopulation of PVN neurones.

40|$|The {{realization}} of a spontaneous macroscopic ferroelectric order in fluids of anisotropic mesogens {{is a topic}} of both fundamental and technological interest. Recently, we demonstrated that a system of dipolar achiral disklike ellipsoids can exhibit long-searched ferroelectric liquid crystalline phases of dipolar origin. In the present work, extensive off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the phase behavior of the system under the influences of the electrostatic boundary conditions that restrict any global polarization. We find that the system develops strongly ferroelectric slablike domains periodically arranged in an antiferroelectric fashion. Exploring the phase behavior at different dipole strengths, we find existence of the ferroelectric nematic and ferroelectric columnar order inside the domains. For higher dipole strengths, a biaxial phase is also obtained with a similar periodic array of ferroelectric slabs of antiparallel polarizations. We have studied the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effects</b> by using both the Ewald summation and the spherical cut-off techniques. We present and compare {{the results of the}} two different approaches of considering the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>effects</b> in this anisotropic system.
