5|$|After the Old School–New School split, the Old School General Assembly {{created the}} Board of Foreign Missions.

When the New School (which had been partnering with the Congregationalist ABCFM) reunited with the Old School in 1870, the Board of Foreign Missions {{took over the}} ABCFM's {{operations}} in Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The reunited denomination also expanded missions into Korea, Central America, South America, and the Philippines.|$|E

5000|$|India-Japan {{relations}} (lead=yes) and (भारत-जापान सम्बन्ध) {{have traditionally}} been strong. For centuries, the people of <b>India</b> and <b>Japan</b> have engaged in cultural exchanges, primarily {{as a result of}} Buddhism, which spread indirectly from <b>India</b> to <b>Japan,</b> via China and Korea. The people of <b>India</b> and <b>Japan</b> are guided by common cultural traditions including the heritage of Buddhism, and share commitment to the ideals of democracy, tolerance, pluralism and open society. <b>India</b> and <b>Japan,</b> two of the largest and oldest democracies in Asia, having a high degree of congruence of political, economic and strategic interests, view each other as partners that have responsibility for and are capable of responding to global and regional challenges. India is the largest recipient of Japanese official development assistance (ODA). As of 2013, bilateral trade between <b>India</b> and <b>Japan</b> stood at US$16.31 billion and is expected to reach US$50 billion by 2019-20.|$|R

5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E
5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E
5|$|<b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> China, the United States, and the European Space Agency each sent lunar orbiters, and {{especially}} ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 {{has contributed to}} confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith. The post-Apollo era has also seen two rover missions: the final Soviet Lunokhod mission in 1973, and China's ongoing Chang'e 3 mission, which deployed its Yutu rover on 14 December 2013. The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.|$|E

5|$|Ochetellus ants {{are native}} to Australia {{and have been}} {{introduced}} into New Zealand. In Asia, they are native to <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> the Philippines and southern Burma. Species are found on the islands of Fiji, Mauritius and New Caledonia. Ochetellus glaber was first sighted in Hawaii in 1977 and is considered an invasive species. Since its introduction, the ant has spread throughout the state, and is now found in Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Kauai, Maui and Oahu. The ant has also been introduced to mainland United States, being found in north-central Florida, where it is localised in Orange County.|$|E
5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests, and tend {{to appear in the}} summer and autumn. In Spain, it is common in dune pine forests. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides. Widely distributed, Russula densifolia is known from Asia (including China, <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> and Thailand), Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|BAe {{eventually}} received £450million {{of funding}} from the UK government, well short of the £750million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, {{just prior to the}} Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven.|$|E

5|$|Cathay dragon (Formerly Dragonair) {{operated}} {{its first}} commercial flight from Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia in July 1985 with a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, after receiving its air operator's certificate. In 1986, the airline introduced regular passenger services to Guilin, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen in the People's Republic of China, and to Phuket, Thailand. In the following years, the airline's operations expanded to more {{cities in the}} People's Republic of China and to other countries across Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> Nepal, Philippines, the Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Vietnam. Initially, Dragonair operated its passenger services only as regular charter flights; these were passenger flights that were operated by the airline on a programme basis similar to scheduled flights, but {{were not part of}} the air services agreement between their respective countries. The airline was granted scheduled services rights in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, <b>India,</b> <b>Japan,</b> Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E
