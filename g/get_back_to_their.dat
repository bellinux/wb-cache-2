5|$|The German advance never {{recovered}} from its initial delay, and Kampfgruppe Peiper only {{got as far}} as Stoumont, where the remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from American aircraft, artillery, and tanks. Having advanced less than half-way to the River Meuse, they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town, including six Tiger II tanks. The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (including 30 Tiger IIs), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through the brush at night, trying to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own line.|$|E

At a campaign stop in St. John's Dunderdale, along with the majority of her caucus, endorsed the Conservative Party. After having difficulty attracting candidates in 2008, the Conservative ran three former provincial cabinet ministers who served under Williams.

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's sound output focus towards <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> punk rock roots, {{rather than trying}} to expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs.

[...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|R

Although introduced in the series as children, the siblings grow up into adults while reigning in Narnia.

500|$|The {{postponed}} {{attack was}} rescheduled {{for the following}} day, and despite further problems with the tank support, the 48th Battalion was able to push through to the second line of German trenches in the Hindenburg Line east of Bullecourt. The position {{was considered to be}} secure if close artillery support was provided. But mistaken artillery and air observers insisted that they had seen Australian troops beyond the Hindenburg Line, messages from the forward battalions did not <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> higher headquarters, and the artillery commanders would not bring down the protective barrage needed. Reinforcements were unable to get through in sufficient strength. When a large-scale German counterattack developed, the 48th Battalion was almost cut off in the captured German trenches, and had to fight their way out, taking heavy casualties in the process. Of the around 750 men of the battalion involved in the attack, the unit lost 15 officers and 421 men. Leane's nephew Allan, who had led the fight in the captured German trench, was captured after being wounded and later died in a German hospital. The Australian commanders were scathing of the tanks, blaming them almost entirely for the failure, with Leane even accusing the tank crews of [...] "cowardice and incompetence".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Anymore" [...] {{received}} a mixed to positive response from music critics. Several critics {{noted that the}} track serves as a strong opener for Silver Eye. David Chiu from Consequence of Sound described the song as an [...] "outstanding opening track" [...] for [...] "fans who {{have been waiting for}} Goldfrapp to somehow <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> dance club roots". Agreeing, Daryl Easlea, writing for Record Collector, labelled it as the [...] "perfect opener". In the album review for Silver Eye, AllMusic's Heather Phares claimed that [...] "Anymore" [...] was a [...] "quintessential" [...] track and noted how the duo tends to open their albums in similar manners. A group of critics from PopMatters reviewed the recording in their [...] "Singles Going Steady" [...] column; Adriane Pontecorvo from the publication stated that although it [...] "isn't breaking any barrier", it [...] "makes no apologies" [...] and [...] "promises a good time". Chris Ingalls thought similarly and said, [...] "'Anymore' won't change your life, but it'll get stuck in your head {{for the better part of}} the morning". And finally, Andrew Paschal was more mixed to the track, awarding it five out of ten stars, and claiming that the track is [...] "fun" [...] but overall found it to be too predictable.|$|E

500|$|In 1967, {{after having}} {{wrestled}} with other partners, including {{a stint as}} The Internationals with Karl Von Brauner, Costello decided {{that he wanted to}} reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. He got in touch with a friend from Great Britain, Tinker Todd, and asked him to be his new partner and reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. Todd agreed, taking the name [...] "Ray St. Clair" [...] and adopting an [...] "Australian" [...] persona. George [...] "Crybaby" [...] Cannon had managed Costello and Von Brauner when they wrestled as The Internationals, and he was brought in to be The Kangaroos new manager. Not long after Costello and St. Clair hit the circuit, they captured both gold and the hatred of the crowd, just like the original Kangaroos. A couple of months after reforming, Costello and St. Clair won the NWA Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Fred Curry and Billy Red Lyons, but lost the titles to Fred Curry and Dan Miller a few weeks later. Costello and St. Clair showed the same gift for riling up the fans as Costello and Heffernan had and even caused their own share of riots. One particular event in Cincinnati, Ohio saw the predominantly African American crowd start a riot after The Kangaroos spat {{in the eye of the}} African American Bobo Brazil during a match. The crowd rushed towards the ring when a fan fell from the balcony, causing a diversion that enabled Costello and St. Clair to escape the ring and <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> dressing room. When fans started to break down the door to the dressing room, The Kangaroos ducked out the back, ran down an alley and hid in a half full dumpster overnight. The next morning when The Kangaroos returned to their car, they found all four tires slashed. Despite the success of the new version of The Fabulous Kangaroos, the Costello / St. Ray team did not last more than six tumultuous months. St. Clair missed his native Britain and was suffering from a debilitating knee injury that meant he had to retire from wrestling altogether.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The setting up of the transplant programme involved obtaining legal clearances, creating public awareness, harnessing the institutional facilities, drawing up protocols, assembling the surgical team, managing immunological issues, rehabilitation and preparing the ancillary services. Results: Both, the first and second bilateral hand transplants were resounding successes with both the recipients <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> original daily routines. Conclusions: The organisation of the hand transplant programme was a large task, which necessitated intensive planning, and cooperation from various teams within and outside the institution.

People in huge numbers used to come to Dhakeswari temple on foot from different roads to be blessed by the deity Durga. It was the best moment of their whole year. With great hope they would come out from their home, and it was reflected on their faces, to get rid of their sins by worshiping the Deity with exclusive devotion and bowing their head to meditation of Bhagaban. They forget about everything- hunger, sleep, restlessness – and they just believe that they will be blessed and they step up for the temple. All those people were divided into small groups with each group having ten to twenty people. The groups consisted of mainly women, only one man, who is the oldest of the village, was there for taking care of them. They came from very long distance by forming groups. People of different ages, including the oldest and skinniest, were also gathered with these groups.
