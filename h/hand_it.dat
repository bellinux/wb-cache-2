5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|Given a group action, {{this gives}} further means {{to study the}} object being acted on. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> also yields {{information}} about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle {{in the theory of}} finite groups, Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, especially (locally) compact groups.|$|E

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Athlete or Desultor, {{located near}} the forum, {{contains}} a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched <b>hand.</b> <b>It</b> may possibly represent Silenus. The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus, behind rows of shops that lined the street under an arcade. They were entered from side streets between the shops.|$|E
5|$|The sons of vanquished foes {{would be}} enslaved and often {{forced to work}} in male brothels, {{as in the case}} of Phaedo of Elis, who at the request of Socrates was bought and freed from such an {{enterprise}} by the philosopher's rich friends. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> is attested in sources that the rape of slaves was prosecuted, at least occasionally.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} almost totally {{restricted}} to the swales and lower slopes of dunes. Various reasons for this have been proposed; on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> {{has been argued that}} its dependence on ground water necessitates that it grow only where ground water is relatively near the surface; on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> has been suggested that it cannot survive in higher parts of the landscape because fires are too frequent there. The latter hypothesis is supported by the recent expansion of B.prionotes along road verges of the Brand Highway, where fires are relatively rare. Despite B.prionotes occurrence in lower parts of the landscape, it does not occur in areas prone to flooding, because of its intolerance of heavy soils, and because extended periods of flooding kill seedlings. However, recent falls of the water table on the Swan Coastal Plain have seen B.prionotes replace the more water-loving Banksia littoralis in some areas that were previously flood-prone.|$|E
5|$|The work, {{written in}} a vernacular language, also {{described}} the contemporary social developments and expressed ideas that were considered revolutionary and anticlerical, and addressed {{the political and economic}} decay of the Ottoman Empire. Geographia Neoteriki was welcomed with enthusiasm by western intellectual circles, especially in France, but on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> was largely neglected by Greek scholars.|$|E
5|$|This unique {{geography}} {{has greatly}} influenced Ikata's growth. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> has presented significant challenges to urban development {{that were not}} overcome until recently in the town's long history.

5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E
5|$|ASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and {{a number}} of closely related sign {{languages}} derived from ASL are used in many different countries. Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in these imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language. For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.|$|E
5|$|Agents Phil Coulson, Melinda May, and Grant Ward break an {{undercover}} agent {{out of a}} hostile base, receiving classified S.H.I.E.L.D. Level 8 intel. Trainee Skye is frustrated when Coulson refuses to tell the team what the information is, based on their clearance level. At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria <b>Hand,</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the Overkill device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other weapons from great distances. Ward, a field specialist, and Agent Leo Fitz, a weapons technology specialist, are tasked with finding and disabling the device within 24 hours, before the separatists use it to declare independence from Russia and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 55. Logano gave up {{the lead}} on lap 62 to pit and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> back to Harvick. Danica Patrick gave up fifth to pit on lap 84. Harvick pitted from the lead on lap 84 and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to Brad Keselowski, who {{gave up the}} lead to pit the next time by and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to Kyle Busch. Debris on the front stretch brought out the third caution of the race on lap 90. Harvick opted not to pit and retook the lead.|$|R

5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and <b>hand.</b> <b>It</b> has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time â€” the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> has been shown that the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(uâˆ’1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
