In Canada and the United States, the sale and production of high-end CRT TVs (30-inch screens) in these markets had all but ended by 2007. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> later, inexpensive combo CRT TVs (20-inch screens with an integrated VHS player) disappeared from discount stores.

2500|$|In a {{development}} hinted at by the Variety quotation above, technological advances are greatly facilitating {{the production of}} truly low-budget motion pictures. Although {{there have always been}} economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 and 16 mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these mediums could hardly rival the image quality of 35 mm film. The development and widespread usage of digital cameras and postproduction methods allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent (and not necessarily [...] "grittier") image quality and precise editing effects—though technical excellence is no guarantee of aesthetic value or even cinematographic competence. As Marone observes, [...] "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features." [...] Comparing circumstances in 2006 to those <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> earlier, he argues that the [...] "quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically." ...|$|E
