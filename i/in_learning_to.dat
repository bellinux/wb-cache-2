5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother {{noticed that she}} was slow <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} congenital deafness after her grandmother identified the problem and took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893. A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment {{was formed}} at Ringway {{airfield}} near Manchester; although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, {{it was also}} directed to investigate using gliders to transport troops into battle. It had been decided that the Royal Air Force and the Army would cooperate in forming the airborne establishment, and as such Squadron Leader L.A. Strange and Major J.F. Rock were tasked with gathering potential glider pilots and forming a glider unit; this was achieved by searching {{for members of the}} armed forces who had pre-war experience of flying gliders, or were interested <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> do so. The two officers and their newly formed unit were provided with four obsolete Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers and a small number of Tiger Moth and Avro 504 biplanes for towing purposes.|$|E

5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E

Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.|$|E

He submitted Deathbounce to Brøderbund, which they declined. They provided Mechner with a copy of Choplifter, then one of the top selling games from Brøderbund. Mechner recognized from this game that he could pursue original game concepts instead of having to remake existing titles.|$|E

For about six months, their study went relatively unnoticed. While Freeland remained complacent about their activities, other plantation owners became incensed about their slaves being educated. One Sunday they burst in on the gathering, armed with clubs and stones, to disperse the congregation permanently.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> ski, one of {{the first}} skills learned is getting {{into and out of the}} ski, and how to {{position}} the body in the ski in order to maintain balance. The skier then learns how to fall and to get up. The skier then works with the instructor on learning to ski on flat terrain, with the purpose of this exercise being to learn how to use the outriggers. The skier next learns how to get into and out of a chairlift. After this, the skier learns how to make basic turns, edging, medium radius turns and advance skiing techniques.|$|E

After passing the initial aptitude test, he was to undertake a month-long course; if he passed that, he would begin full flight training in early 2009. Harry had to pass his flying assessment at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop, the result of which determined if he would continue on to train as a pilot of the Apache, Lynx, or Gazelle helicopter. Having reached the requisite standard, Harry attended the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury, where he joined brother William.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, the European Commission {{presented}} {{a new strategy}} to decrease youth unemployment rate, which is close to 23% across the European Union. The European Qualifications Framework calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. Students are expected to learn skills that they will need when they complete their education. It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through work-based learning. Work-based learning for students should also lead to recognition of vocational training for these students. The program also sets goals for learning foreign languages, and for teachers continued education. It also {{highlights the importance of}} using technology, especially the internet, <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> make it relevant to students.|$|E

Although Marsh had appreciated the drawings of Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo since he was a child—his father's studio was full of reproductions of the old masters' work—the famous paintings that he saw at the Louvre and other museums stimulated in him a new fascination with the old masters.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. <b>In</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E
500|$|Several {{nineteenth and}} twentieth century writers {{influenced}} Chatwin's work. The work of Robert Byron influenced Chatwin, who admitted to imitating his style {{when he first}} began making notes of his own travels. While in Patagonia he read In Our Time by Ernest Hemingway. Chatwin admired Hemingway for his spare prose. While writing In Patagonia, Chatwin strove to approach his writing as a [...] "literary Cartier-Bresson." [...] Chatwin's biographer described the resulting prose as [...] "quick snapshots of ordinary people." [...] Along with Hemingway and Cartier-Bresson, Osip Mandelstam's work strongly influenced Chatwin during the writing of In Patagonia. An admirer of Noël Coward, Chatwin found the breakfast scene in Private Lives helpful <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> write dialogue. Once Chatwin began work on The Viceroy of Ouidah, he began studying the work of nineteenth-century French authors, such as Honoré de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert. These writers would continue to influence Chatwin {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E
