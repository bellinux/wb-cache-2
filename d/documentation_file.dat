This is solved in AmigaOS {{by the use of}} assigns. An assign follows, again, the same syntax as a device name; however, it already points to a directory inside the filesystem. The place an assign points to can be changed at any time by the user (this behavior is similar to, but nevertheless distinct from, the [...] command in MS-DOS, for example). Assigns were also convenient because one logical assign could point to more than one different physical location at the same time, thereby allowing an assign′s contents to expand logically, while still maintaining a separate physical organization.

The positions of transmitter-receivers were limited by time-logistic constraints (e.g., morphology and accessibility of the degassing areas); given the geometry of the optical paths, we admit some heterogeneities in our CO 2 maps (Figs.  4 and 5) may result from inhomogeneous, incomplete coverage of the degassing areas. During operations, the GasFinder was left to acquire data along each single GasFinder-retroreflector path for ~ 3 – 5  min, before being rotated to measure along the successive path (an additional <b>documentation</b> <b>file</b> shows more details of acquisition-paths (see A 1 in Additional file 1).|$|E

40|$|Nowadays the International Patent Classification (IPC) {{has become}} the main information-retrieval system {{in the field of}} patent information. The {{efficiency}} in using the IPC for patent search depends to a great extent on the consistency of classifying in Patent Offices of different countries. Insufficient consistency may be explained by errors in classifying, by peculiarities of patent laws influencing the wording of a patent document, {{as well as by the}} complexity of identifying the subject of an invention which should be classified. To provide the desired completeness and accuracy of classifying it is reasonable to use aspect analysis of document contents in order to reveal all relevant aspects from which the subject of an invention should be considered. The creation in different patent offices of common search files based on the IPC would also contribute to the efficient use of the IPC.
