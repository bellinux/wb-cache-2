50|$|As social bees, A. florea {{require a}} {{mechanism}} of communication, especially when conveying important spatial information about foraging, including direction and distance. The time elapsed during the waggle phase when a dancer moves forward while shaking the abdomen {{from side to}} side indicates the distance to a site. The longer the waggle phase, the longer the distance to a site and vice versa. In order to indicate direction, A. florea workers orient the waggle phase {{in the direction of the}} site, while dancing on the crow of the nest or swarm. The precision of dance does not depend on the type of site i.e. nest sites or food patches. In other words, A. florea do not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate a goal is a nest site or <b>food</b> <b>patch,</b> unlike A. mellifera, which do change precision when conveying information about food patches specifically. This suggests that A. florea do not prioritize nesting site nor <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> information by changing the precision of dance.|$|E

The flight period and reproductive period occur together, beginning in late January and ending in early May. It is rare to see the Palos Verdes blue far from its home <b>food</b> <b>patch,</b> but research shows that males cover more distance and have longer periods of flight. Palos Verdes blues are a diurnal and panmictic species. They are also non-migratory and very particular in their use of larval food plants. Their adult lifespan is only five days.|$|E
40|$|Small herbivores face {{risks of}} {{predation}} while foraging {{and are often}} forced to trade off food quality for safety. Life history, behaviour, and habitat of predator and prey can influence these trade-offs. We compared how two sympatric rabbits (pygmy rabbit, Brachylagus idahoensis; mountain cottontail, Sylvilagus nuttallii) that differ in size, use of burrows, and habitat specialization in the sagebrush-steppe of western North America respond to amount and orientation of concealment cover and proximity to burrow refuges when selecting <b>food</b> <b>patches.</b> We predicted that both rabbit species would prefer <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> that offered greater concealment and <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> that were closer to burrow refuges. However, because pygmy rabbits are small, obligate burrowers that are restricted to sagebrush habitats, we predicted that they would show stronger preferences for greater cover, orientation of concealment, and patches closer to burrow refuges. We offered two <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> to individuals of each species during three experiments that either varied {{in the amount of}} concealment cover, orientation of concealment cover, or distance from a burrow refuge. Both species preferred <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> that offered greater concealment, but pygmy rabbits generally preferred terrestrial and mountain cottontails preferred aerial concealment. Only pygmy rabbits preferred <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> closer to their burrow refuge. Different responses to concealment and proximity to burrow refuges by the two species likely reflect differences in perceived predation risks. Because terrestrial predators are able to dig for prey in burrows, animals like pygmy rabbits that rely on burrow refuges might select <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> based more on terrestrial concealment. In contrast, larger habitat generalists that do not rely on burrow refuges, like mountain cottontails, might trade off terrestrial concealment for visibility to detect approaching terrestrial predators. This study suggests that body size and evolutionary adaptations for using habitat, even in closely related species, might influence anti-predator behaviors in prey species...|$|R

5000|$|Proposed by Peter Ward and Amotz Zahavi in 1973, the Information Center Hypothesis (ICH) {{states that}} bird assemblages such as {{communal}} roosts act as information hubs for distributing knowledge about food source location. When <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> knowledge is unevenly distributed amongst certain flock members, the other “clueless” flock members can follow and join these knowledgeable members {{to find good}} feeding locations. To quote Ward and Zahavi on the evolutionary reasons as to how communal roosts came about, [...] "...communal roosts, breeding colonies and certain other bird assemblages have been evolved primarily for the efficient exploitation of unevenly-distributed food sources by serving as ' information-centres.' [...] " [...] Currently, there is only speculation {{as to how the}} information is conveyed. It has been suggested that the successful members first convey their knowledge through displays and the unsuccessful members then follow, or that the unsuccessful members circle in the air or slowly fly out and proceed to join the successful members when they take off. Ward and Zahavi approached the explanation for the ICH in several different ways, but each explanation is related to the ability to distribute knowledge of resources. In this case, roosting can be divided into several components: advertisement, synchronized breeding, seasonality, mood, and predation.|$|E

In this paper we have tested this hypothesis. We held birds in a steady group size and describe their decision to join a group at the ground at successive intervals, when variable <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> size was offered.

We collected data on 22 adult and subadult spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) living in a large community in the protected area of Otoch Ma’ax Yetel Kooh, Yucatan, Mexico. We recorded subgroup size and fission events as well as fruit abundance during 12 mo and conducted nutritional analyses on the fruit species that the study subjects consumed most.

While the absence of support for a relationship between fruit characteristics and fission decisions may be due to the short temporal scale of the analysis, our findings relating subgroup size to the amount of protein in the visited <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> over the course of the day may be explained by individual spider monkeys attempting to obtain sufficient protein intake from their fruit-based diet. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New Yor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of group-living are not distributed evenly among group members. Individuals that maintain positions on the front, outside edge of the group encounter most predators first, but are more likely to access <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> before others. Therefore a trade-off exists in which a strategy maximizing safety, by staying in the group’s center, may lower foraging success, whereas a strategy maximizing food acquisition may increase predation risk. We examined intragroup spatial positions for vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda relative to sex, age, dominance rank, and activity when the group was moving and when it was stationary. We used artificial <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> of varied richness to examine which individuals found new food sources and what share they obtained. When the group was stationary, high-ranking females tended to be at the group’s center, while males and subordinates were at the group’s edge. Moving and feeding occurred more than expected at the edge, while social behavior took place in the center. When the group was moving, most females stayed {{in the center of the}} group, but dominant males and the alpha female foraged at the front, outside edge of the group. These dominants also found more artificial <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> and foraged at greater interindividual distances than those in the center.

40|$|Individuals {{foraging}} {{in groups}} constantly {{need to make}} decisions, such as when to leave a group, when to join a group, and when to move collectively to another feeding site. In recent years, it has become evident that personality may affect these foraging decisions, but studies where individuals are experimentally forced into different roles are still absent. Here, we forced individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, differing in boldness scores, either in a joining or in a leaving role in a feeding context. We placed a <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> {{at the far end}} of a test arena and measured the arrival latency and number of visits of individuals to the patch either in the presence of a companion that was confined near the <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> (“joining context”) or in the presence of a companion that was confined away from the <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> (“leaving context”). We also ran trials without a companion (“nonsocial context”). Bolder individuals arrived more quickly than shyer individuals in the “leaving” context, but there was no effect of boldness in the “joining” context, suggesting that boldness differences are important in explaining variation in leaving behavior but not in joining behavior. The difference in arrival latency between the “joining” and non-social context increased with decreasing boldness score, suggesting that shyer individuals are more responsive to the presence of other individuals (i. e., social facilitation). These results indicate that individual differences in boldness play a role in patch choice decisions of group-living animals, such as when to leave a flock and when to join others at a patch. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Harpacticoid copepod food is patchily {{distributed}} {{and individuals}} must episodically {{move to new}} <b>food</b> <b>patches.</b> Key questions in harpacticoid feeding ecology include how individuals detect <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> and how rapidly they move toward patches. Based on literature reports, we hypothesized that harpacticoids locate food parcels by sensing a water-borne cue.

Moreover this Brownian walk is not the main process responsible for movement patterns of baboons.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{there exist}} {{advantages}} to group-living {{in comparison to}} a solitary lifestyle, costs and gains of group-living may be unequally distributed among group members. Predation risk, vigilance levels and food intake may be unevenly distributed across group spatial geometry and certain within-group spatial positions may {{be more or less}} advantageous depending on the spatial distribution of these factors. In species characterized with dominance hierarchy, high-ranking individuals are commonly observed in advantageous spatial position. However, in complex social systems, individuals can develop affiliative relationships that may balance the effect of dominance relationships in individual’s spatial distribution. The objective of the present study is to investigate how the group spatial distribution of a semi-free ranging colony of Mandrills relates to its social organization. Using spatial observations in an area surrounding the feeding zone, we tested the three following hypothesis: (1) does dominance hierarchy explain being observed in proximity or far from a <b>food</b> <b>patch?</b> (2) Do affiliative associations also explain being observed in proximity or far from a <b>food</b> <b>patch?</b> (3) Do the differences in rank in the group hierarchy explain being co-observed in proximity of a <b>food</b> <b>patch?</b> Our results showed that high-ranking individuals were more observed in proximity of the feeding zone while low-ranking individuals were more observed at the boundaries of the observation area. Furthermore, we observed that affiliative relationships were also associated with individual spatial distributions and explain more of the total variance of the spatial distribution in comparison with dominance hierarchy. Finally, we found that individuals observed at a same moment in proximity of the feeding zone {{were more likely to be}} distant in the hierarchy while controlling for maternal kinship, age and sex similarity.

Any tray could {{be removed from the}} aquarium and “loaded” with a known number of prey. One bird foraged in the aquarium at a time; thus, by removing a food tray after a trial ended and counting the remaining prey, I calculated the number of prey consumed by the bird. I designed several experiments to determine if ruddy ducks abandoned a <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} the predictions of a simple, deterministic, patch depletion model. This model is based on the premise that a predator should maximize its rate of net energy intake while foraging.

In the majority of comparisons, the number of food items consumed by the ruddy ducks in these experiments was consistent with the predictions of the foraging model. When the birds did not forage as predicted by the model, they stayed in the patch longer and consumed more prey than predicted by the model. An examination of the relation between rate of net energy intake and time spent foraging in the <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> indicated that by staying in a patch longer than predicted, the ruddy ducks experienced only a small deviation from maximum rate of net energy intake.

We examined the impact of prior exposure to low salinity {{and the presence of}} a <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> on the behavior of P. ochraceus larvae in a halocline. In the gastrula stage, P. ochraceus larvae were split into a low salinity treatment (reared in 20 - 22 ‰ filtered sea water) and a control treatment (reared in 30 - 32 ‰ filtered sea water). In the first experiment, bipinnariae were introduced into the top or bottom of 20 / 30 haloclines. In the second experiment brachiolariae were introduced into control columns with and without the algae Isochrysis galbana, and into 20 / 30 haloclines with and without I. galbana patches at the halocline. The halocline posed a major barrier to larval vertical migration, especially for the younger bipinnaria stage. Low salinity larvae changed their distribution in the water column at a much slower rate than control larvae, indicating that they may have impaired swimming abilities.

40|$|Ward and Zahavi {{suggested}} in 1973 that colonies {{could serve as}} information centres, through a transfer {{of information on the}} location of food resources between unrelated individuals (Information Centre Hypothesis). Using GPS tracking and observations on group movements, we studied the search strategy and information transfer in two of the most colonial seabirds, Guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii) and Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata). Both species breed together and feed on the same prey. They do return to the same feeding zone from one trip to the next indicating high unpredictability in the location of food resources. We found that the Guanay cormorants use social information to select their bearing when departing the colony. They form a raft at the sea surface whose position is continuously adjusted to the bearing of the largest returning columns of cormorants. As such, the raft serves as a compass signal that gives an indication on the location of the <b>food</b> <b>patches.</b> Conversely, Peruvian boobies rely mainly on personal information based on memory to take heading at departure.

At the first-discovered and most-exploited <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> social connections between birds affected the order of discovery and presumably contributed to a greater exploitation of this patch.

Males discovered the food sources sooner than females, while feeding activity was negatively related to patch discovery. Age had no effect on the order of discovery. Birds that first discovered and fed at the food patches were characterized by higher level of social indifference, i. e. followed others less frequently than other birds in an independent context. Our findings provide experimental evidence for the importance of variable social connections during social foraging in house sparrow flocks, and suggest that social attraction can contribute differently to the exploitation of different patches when multiple food sources are present...|$|E
40|$|Variation in food {{quality and}} {{abundance}} requires animals {{to decide whether}} to stay on a poor <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> or leave in search of better food. An important question in behavioral ecology asks when is it optimal for an animal to leave a <b>food</b> <b>patch</b> it is depleting. Although optimal foraging is central to evolutionary success, the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying it are poorly understood. Here we investigate the neuronal basis for adaptive food-leaving behavior in response to resource depletion in Caenorhabditis elegans, and identify several of the signaling pathways involved. The ASE neurons, previously implicated in salt chemoattraction, promote food-leaving behavior via a cGMP pathway as food becomes limited. High ambient O 2 promotes food-leaving via the O 2 -sensing neurons AQR, PQR, and URX. Ectopic activation of these neurons using channelrhodopsin is sufficient to induce high food-leaving behavior. In contrast, the neuropeptide receptor NPR- 1, which regulates social behavior on food, acts in the ASE neurons, the nociceptive ASH neurons, and in the RMG interneuron to repress food-leaving. Finally, we show that neuroendocrine signaling by TGF-β/DAF- 7 and neuronal insulin signaling are necessary for adaptive food-leaving behavior. We suggest that animals integrate information about their nutritional state with ambient oxygen and gustatory stimuli to formulate optimal foraging strategies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWard and Zahavi {{suggested}} in 1973 that colonies {{could serve as}} information centres, through a transfer {{of information on the}} location of food resources between unrelated individuals (Information Centre Hypothesis). Using GPS tracking and observations on group movements, we studied the search strategy and information transfer in two of the most colonial seabirds, Guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii) and Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata). Both species breed together and feed on the same prey. They do return to the same feeding zone from one trip to the next indicating high unpredictability in the location of food resources. We found that the Guanay cormorants use social information to select their bearing when departing the colony. They form a raft at the sea surface whose position is continuously adjusted to the bearing of the largest returning columns of cormorants. As such, the raft serves as a compass signal that gives an indication on the location of the <b>food</b> <b>patches.</b> Conversely, Peruvian boobies rely mainly on personal information based on memory to take heading at departure. They search for <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> solitarily or in small groups through network foraging by detecting the white plumage of congeners visible at long distance. Our results show that information transfer does occur and we propose a new mechanism of information transfer based on the use of rafts off colonies. The use of rafts for information transfer may be common in central place foraging colonial seabirds that exploit short lasting and/or unpredictably distributed <b>food</b> <b>patches.</b> Over the past decades Guanay cormorants have declined ten times whereas Peruvian boobies have remained relatively stable. We suggest that the decline of the cormorants could be related to reduced social information opportunities and that social behaviour and search strategies have the potential {{to play an important role}} in the population dynamics of colonial animals...|$|R
40|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} has {{the potential}} to impact interactions among species in a community and is influenced, in part, by individual condition and fear of predation. These relationships are exemplified by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in mixed hardwood forest communities of the northeastern U. S. A., whose foraging behaviour can influence the population ecology of several prey items and the disease ecology of human Lyme disease and its tick vector. We examined whether dosage of an immunogen influenced foraging behaviour in wild white-footed mice at foraging arenas. Low-dose mice preferentially favoured safe (covered) <b>food</b> <b>patches</b> over risky <b>food</b> <b>patches,</b> whereas high-dose mice showed no preference based on patch safety. Immunochallenge did not alter foraging time in patches of equal risk. The results reveal fitness costs of an immune response, namely that immunochallenged mice favour increased energy consumption over safety from predation, presumably leading to greater mortality. Acceptance of risky patches for foraging by immunochallenged mice suggests that mice mounting this immune response will forage in a greater proportion of their home ranges and encounter a greater number of patchily distributed prey items and ticks carrying pathogens...|$|R
