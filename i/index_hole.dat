Cowell wanted an instrument {{with which to}} play compositions involving multiple rhythmic patterns impossible for one person to perform simultaneously on acoustic keyboard or percussion instruments. The invention, completed by Theremin in 1931, can produce up to sixteen different rhythms—a periodic base rhythm on a selected fundamental pitch and fifteen progressively more rapid rhythms, each associated {{with one of the}} ascending notes of the fundamental pitch's overtone series. Like the overtone series itself, the rhythms follow an arithmetic progression, so that for every single beat of the fundamental, the first overtone (if played) beats twice, the second overtone beats three times, and so forth. Using the device's keyboard, each of the sixteen rhythms can be produced individually or in any combination. A seventeenth key permits optional syncopation. The instrument produces its percussion-like sound using a system, proposed by Cowell, that involves light being passed through radially <b>indexed</b> <b>holes</b> in a series of spinning [...] "cogwheel" [...] discs before arriving at electric photoreceptors.|$|R

Methods : This was a retrospective study of 54 patients who underwent macular hole surgery for the first time and who had no other ocular medical or surgical past history. The procedure was performed by four surgeons between July 2012 and August 2014. The clinical parameters such as gender, age, side, duration of symptoms, preoperative visual acuity in logMAR and lens status were collected. The macular holes were graded in agreement with the International Study Group Vitreomacular Traction classification. A Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography was carried out before every surgery. The OCT features were screened by a trained investigator. The size of the macular hole, the height, the right and left arm lengths, the basal diameter and the defect of the ellipsoid line and the COST line length were collected. We calculated OCT <b>indexes</b> (the Macular <b>Hole</b> <b>Index,</b> the Tractional <b>Hole</b> <b>Index</b> and the <b>Hole</b> Form Factor).

He {{did not believe}} that it was useful, writing [...] "For every {{copy protection}} scheme there's a hacker ready to defeat it. Most involve so-called nybble copiers, which try to analyze the original disk and then make a copy". By 1980, the first 'nibble' copier, Locksmith, was introduced for the Apple II. These copiers reproduced copy protected floppy disks an entire track at a time, ignoring how the sectors were marked. This was harder to do than it sounds for two reasons: firstly, Apple disks did not use the <b>index</b> <b>hole</b> to mark the start of a track; their drives could not even detect the <b>index</b> <b>hole.</b> Tracks could thus start anywhere, but the copied track had to have this [...] "write splice", which always caused some bits to be lost or duplicated due to speed variations, roughly in the same (unused for payload data) place as the original, or it would not work. Secondly, Apple used special [...] "self-sync" [...] bytes to achieve agreement between drive controller and computer about where any byte ended and the next one started on the disk. These bytes were written as normal data bytes followed by a slightly longer than normal pause, which was notoriously unreliable to detect on read-back; still, you had to get the self-sync bytes roughly right as without them being present in the right places, the copy would not work, and with them present in too many places, the track would not fit on the destination disk.|$|E

This was considered risky by some, for the reason that single sided disks would only be certified by the manufacturer for single sided use.

40|$|AIM: To {{predict the}} visual outcome in {{patients}} undergoing macular hole surgery by two novel three-dimensional morphological parameters on {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) : area ratio factor (ARF) and volume ratio factor (VRF). METHODS: A clinical case series was conducted, including 54 eyes of 54 patients with an idiopathic macular hole (IMH). Each patient had an OCT examination before and after surgery. Morphological parameters of the macular hole, such as minimum diameter, base diameter, and height were measured. Then, the macular <b>hole</b> <b>index</b> (MHI), tractional <b>hole</b> <b>index</b> (THI), and <b>hole</b> form factor (HFF) were calculated. Meanwhile, novel postoperative macular hole (MH) factors, ARF and VRF were calculated by three-dimensional morphology. Bivariate correlations were performed to acquire asymptotic significance values between the steady best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after surgery and 2 D/ 3 D arguments of MH by the Pearson method with two-tailed test. All significant factors were analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of SPSS software which were responsible for vision recovery. ROC curves analyses were performed to further discuss the different parameters on the prediction of visual outcome. RESULTS: The {{mean and standard deviation}} values of patients’ age, symptoms duration, and follow-up time were 64. 8 ± 8. 9 y (range: 28 - 81), 18. 6 ± 11. 5 d (range: 2 - 60), and 11. 4 ± 0. 4 mo (range: 6 - 24), respectively. Steady-post-BCVA analyzed with bivariate correlations was found to be significantly correlated with base diameter (r= 0. 521, P< 0. 001), minimum diameter (r= 0. 514, P< 0. 001), MHI (r= - 0. 531, P< 0. 001), THI (r=- 0. 386, P= 0. 004), HFF (r=- 0. 508, P< 0. 001), and ARF (r=- 0. 532, P< 0. 001). Other characteristic parameters such as age, duration of surgery, height, diameter <b>hole</b> <b>index,</b> and VRF were not statistically significant with steady-post-BCVA. According to area under the curve (AUC) values, values of ARF, MHI, HFF, minimum diameter, THI, and base diameter are 0. 806, 0. 772, 0. 750, 0. 705, 0. 690, and 0. 686, respectively. However, Steady-post-BCVA analysis with bivariate correlations for VRF was no statistical significance. Results of ROC curve analysis indicated that the MHI value, HFF, and ARF was greater than 0. 427, 1. 027 and 1. 558 respectively which could correlate with better visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Compared with MHI and HFF, ARF could effectively express three-dimensional characteristics of macular hole and achieve better sensitivity and specificity. Thus, ARF could be the most effective parameter to predict the visual outcome in macular hole surgery...|$|R

Methods A retrospective study of 50 eyes undergoing standardised macular hole surgery. All patients underwent preoperative OCT scanning with measurement of macular hole inner opening diameter, minimum linear diameter, base diameter and macular hole height. Values were calculated for the macular <b>hole</b> <b>index</b> and the tractional <b>hole</b> <b>index.</b> Results Logistic regression analyses indicated that the preoperative base diameter, macular hole inner opening and minimum linear diameter were associated with both anatomical and visual success. Derived parameters as alternatives to these basic ophthalmic parameters add little to the modelling of either anatomical or visual success. Conclusion Base diameter, macular hole inner opening and minimum linear diameter can each be used to predict anatomical and/or functional success in macular hole surgery. Preoperative base diameter is the most useful variable in this regard, as it holds the strongest association with anatomical and visual outcome and is easily measured on a OCT scan...|$|R

Locksmith copied Apple II disks by taking advantage of the fact that these sync fields between sectors almost always consisted of a long string of FF (hex) bytes. It found the longest string of FFs, which usually occurred between the last and first sectors on each track, and began writing the track in the middle of that; also it assumed that any long string of FF bytes was a sync sequence and introduced the necessary short pauses after writing each of them to the copy. Ironically, Locksmith would not copy itself. The first Locksmith measured the distance between sector 1 of each track. Copy protection engineers quickly figured out what Locksmith was doing and began to use the same technique to defeat it. Locksmith countered by introducing the ability to reproduce track alignment and prevented itself from being copied by embedding a special sequence of nibbles, that if found, would stop the copy process. Henry Roberts (CTO of Nalpeiron), a graduate student in computer science at the University of South Carolina, reverse engineered Locksmith, found the sequence and distributed the information to some of the 7 or 8 people producing copy protection at the time.|$|E
