25|$|The main Viet Cong {{attack was}} {{beginning}} to be worn down by the American firepower. Light and <b>heavy</b> <b>helicopter</b> fire teams were aiming rockets and miniguns on the wood line to the northeast; artillery was massing along the east flank and in depth to the east. As the flights arrived with cluster bombs and attacked within thirty meters of the American positions, large groups of Viet Cong bodies formed. As the ordnance began taking its toll, the Viet Cong started to run, many throwing down their weapons.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Orthodox Church {{attempted}} to repossess the cathedral in the 1990s. The first cross to be reinstalled {{on the main}} dome was made in 1996 but was not erected due to financial problems. The second attempt, in 2002, employed a <b>heavy</b> <b>helicopter</b> and nearly ended in a disaster: the seven-meter cross fell from the dome and was damaged beyond repair; there were no human injuries. The third cross was successfully erected November 24, 2002. Three years later, November 2, 2005, the church celebrated the first Divine Liturgy in the Naval Cathedral since 1929. In September 2008 the cathedral became operational again, but services were only conducted on special occasions.|$|E
