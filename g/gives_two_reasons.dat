25|$|The Talmud Bavli <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> {{why there}} are three basic prayers de-rabbanan ("from our Rabbis") since the early Second Temple period on: to recall the daily sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem, and/or because each of the Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the {{afternoon}} and Jacob the evening prayer. The Talmud yerushalmi states that the Anshei Knesset HaGedola ("The Men of the Great Assembly") learned and understood the beneficial concept of regular daily prayer from personal habits of the forefathers (avoth, Avraham, Isaac, Yaacov) as hinted in the Tanach, and instituted the three daily prayers. A distinction is made between individual prayer and communal prayer, which requires a quorum known as a minyan, with communal prayer being preferable as it permits the inclusion of prayers that otherwise would be omitted.|$|E

2500|$|Shakespeare sets up {{the dispute}} between {{the heart and the}} eye as a legal battle that is to be decided by a jury ("quest of thoughts"). [...] Legal {{terminology}} is abundant throughout the sonnet, with both the heart and eye making [...] "pleas" [...] for their cases. [...] Eventually, a [...] "verdict is determined" [...] that the [...] "outward part" [...] of the body belongs to the eye while the [...] "inward love of heart" [...] belongs to the heart. Critic Paul Hammond focuses on the word [...] "'cide" [...] in line 9. [...] He argues that neither [...] "'cide" [...] as in [...] "decide" [...] nor [...] "side" [...] as in [...] "to support" [...] or [...] "to side with" [...] make sense {{in the context of the}} poem. He states that the word was originally printed as [...] "fide", which was a misprint of [...] "finde", meaning [...] "to determine and declare". He <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> why he thinks this is the correct word: (1) [...] "side" [...] does not make sense in the context of the poem and (2) that [...] "finde" [...] continues the legal imagery of the sonnet.|$|E

50|$|The Buddhist commentarial scriptures <b>give</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for {{the name}} Kausambi/Kosambī. The more favoured is {{that the city was}} so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once {{occupied}} by the sage Kusumba (v.l. Kusumbha). Another explanation is that large and stately neem trees or Kosammarukkhā grew in great numbers in and around the city.|$|R

50|$|The WIPO {{treaty and}} several related {{international}} agreements underline that {{the protection of}} intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for intellectual property laws:One is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations {{and the rights of}} the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.|$|E

He points out that a human clone, while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery—machines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules.

5000|$|Orwell quotes {{extensively}} {{from the}} [...] "Save Europe Now" [...] {{material on the}} shortages of food and medicines in places like Austria and Czechoslovakia and Budapest and the breakdown {{of law and order}} among children, and reports that the voluntary scheme proposed was discouraged officially. Orwell <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for the Left being against the scheme. Firstly the working classes would resent it, and secondly food is a political weapon and Russophiles consider that sending food to Eastern Europe is an attempt to undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union. In conclusion Orwell argues that letting Germans go hungry would have the same effect as the punitive reparations after the First World War.|$|E

5000|$|After {{six years}} as director, Matthai {{announced}} his decision to step down and stay on as professor. He <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for doing so:first, leaders of academic institutions tended to use their positions for career advancement at an adverse cost to the institutions;secondly, {{it was important to}} establish the principle that the director’s position is not hierarchical; he is only first among equals, which was characteristically bold of him, given the cultural milieu prevailing in leading academic institutions at that time.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the years}} 2005, {{companies}} in China {{had been using}} Sudan I illegally, and government officials <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> why the 1996 ban had not been adequately enforced. The first reason {{was that there were}} too many agencies overseeing food production, creating loopholes and inefficiency. The second reason was that the government agencies were not equipped or trained with the food testing equipment that could have detected the dye earlier. Officials announced that they would begin to reform the food safety system on national and local levels.|$|R
5000|$|On one {{occasion}} Rabbi Schneerson <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for his particular choice of campaign, saying, [...] "The first {{reason is that}} there is a passage in the Talmudic tractate of Rosh Hashanah which says that once a Jew wears Tefillin on his head - even one time in his life - he falls into a different category as a Jew." [...] Secondly, [...] "When a Jew in Miami sees pictures of Jews at the Western Wall wearing Tefillin, he gets an urge to put on Tefillin himself." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Derekh Hashem Section II, chapter 7, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} stars on humanity and events on earth. There he <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for the existence of}} stars and planets. The first is that stars and planets maintain the existence of all physical things on earth, acting as the means by which spiritual forces are transmitted to physical entities. The second is that events on earth are also initiated through planetary and stellar activity. Luzzatto states that each earthly phenomenon is assigned to a specific star, which controls it. Quoting the Talmudic dictum in Sanhedrin 156a - [...] "for Israel, there is no mazal ("luck", literally [...] "planet" [...] or [...] "constellation")", he also states that higher powers (i.e. God or angels) may overcome the influences of this system, and that they typically do so for Jews.|$|E
5000|$|To {{support his}} claim, Murray <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, even though Newburyport was the {{inspiration}} for Innsmouth, it is clearly a separate location since Lovecraft himself placed the real-life Newburyport {{to the north of}} Innsmouth in [...] "The Shadow Over Innsmouth". Based on his research, Murray thinks that Lovecraft actually based Innsmouth on Gloucester, Massachusetts, which is located on Cape Ann on the coast. Secondly, Lovecraft is known to have come up with the name for his fictional Miskatonic River by combining Algonquian root words. Murray believes that Lovecraft used a similar method to come up with Manuxet. In Algonquian, man means [...] "island" [...] and uxet translates to [...] "at the large part of the river"; thus, when combined Manuxet means [...] "Island at the large part of the river". Murray contends that this meaning is well suited to Innsmouth's placement {{at the mouth of the}} Manuxet. And Cape Ann itself (the alleged site of Innsmouth) is connected to the mainland by only a thin strip of land and might be thought of as an island.|$|E

5000|$|Hamilton also defends {{against the}} claims made in Cato No. 4, which claimed that [...] "The {{establishment}} of a vice-president is as unnecessary as it is dangerous them to preside in the senate". Madison <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for the vice president}} to be the presiding officer of the senate. First, since he only has one vote, he is equal to his substituents. Also, should the president die, the vice president will know the concerns of the Congress and president, and as such be better prepared than anyone else to take the position.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1937, Ian Macfarlan (the {{member for}} Brighton) left the United Australia Party (UAP) and sat as an Independent. Macfarlan <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for his {{resignation}} from the UAP: that the party was sitting {{in opposition to the}} Dunstan Country government which he praised; and that it was controlled by a central body outside of the parliament, the members of which were unknown to most party members. Frederick Holden (Grant) also left the UAP and sat on the cross benches. This reduced the UAP's numbers from 21 to 19.|$|R

50|$|Seen as the {{simplest}} form of message production, the fundamental premise of Expressive Design Logic is that “Language is {{a medium for}} expressing thoughts and feelings.” This premise is {{the simplest}} of the three logics and explains that someone says what they feel. As long as this feeling is conveyed in the message, the message is deemed successful. O’Keefe <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> why individuals who operate under this design logic are very literal {{when it comes to}} impression in message design and interpretation. “First, they fail to appreciate that in communication, the process of expression can be made to serve other goals, and second, they interpret messages as independent units rather than as threads in an interaction fabric.” Individuals that communicate expressively do not recognize the idea that messages might be designed to induce particular reactions by the receiver. They believe that messages are taken straightforwardly by a receiver who has thoughts, feelings, or reactions that are to be communicated back to the sender. Through this idea there are only two possible relationships that can be held between the speaker's intentions and messages; 1) To fully and honestly express the speaker’s current mental state. 2) To convey a distorted version of the speaker’s mental state though editing or lying. Due to the extreme straightforwardness of expressive messages they may contain multiple facets that can be viewed as negative when discussing communicative effectiveness, such as pointless content (excessive knowledge of what the speaker feels or wants), redundancies (due to a thought being recycled), noncontingent threats or insults (simple announcements of punishments), or inoffensive but inappropriate comments (complimentary personal remarks inappropriately delivered). Ultimately, individuals using Expressive Design Logic believe that the element that unites a speaker’s messages is simply what is on the speaker’s mind, whether they are items of information from one encounter or items from a complex chain of associations.|$|E
40|$|Pindar {{rejects the}} {{current version of}} two myths, that of Tantalos and Pelops (O. I) and that of Herakles’ {{conflict}} against Poseidon, Apollo and Hades (O. IX). In each case, he <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for his stance: a particular reason (that the stories implicitly impugn divine omniscience or omnipotence) and a more important general reason (that it is imprudent to alienate the gods). Piety without profundity is typical of Pindar...|$|E
40|$|Objects Finally, no {{discussion}} of linguistic description could be complete without {{a discussion of the}} range of further abstract objects that grammar implicates, such as STATES, POSSIBILITIES, FACTS and PROPOSITIONS. But there is perhaps one notable difference between these abstractions and the individuals we have already considered. A specification or system may be equipped with an inventory of concrete individuals to describe, by listing the objects or places in its environment, the meaningfully different quantities it can reason about, and even the events in some history or plan. But to describe abstract individuals in interesting ways, a system needs a generative understanding of them, and needs to create representations of them by inference, on the fly. Such inference in turn requires a more sophisticated implementation. At the same time, the linguistic expressions that describe abstractions are more rarefied. This <b>gives</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> why knowledge representation does not approach abstractions with the same urgency as other individuals. Of course, abstract individuals remain quite intriguing, as we shall now discover...|$|E
40|$|We <b>give</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> why {{we believe}} that non-central ultrarelativistic heavy ion {{collisions}} are the {{place to look for}} the disoriented chiral condensates (DCC). First, we argue that the most probable quench scenario for the formation of DCC requires non-central collisions. Second, we show by numerical simulations that strong electromagnetic fields of heavy ions can exert a surprisingly large effect on the DCC domain formation through the chiral anomaly. The effect again requires non-central collisions. Interestingly, the result of simulations is consistent with the formation of correlated two domains of the chiral condensate, which are aligned in space, perpendicular to the scattering plane, but misaligned in isospin space. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Constantine P. Cavafy <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for the {{transposition}} of {{the accent}} {{in the name}} [...] "Christos": firstly, the rule of transposition of the accent from the final syllable to the immediately preceding syllable in ancient adjectives when they become proper nouns, [...] "and secondly, the pious practice of differentiating in appearance from the divine epithet". Cavafy gave other anthropological examples of the need felt {{to distinguish between the}} [...] "sacred" [...] and the [...] "profane", and university professor Giorgos Veloudis added το Cavafy's examples the distinction between the [...] "profane" [...] word Σταύρος (the name [...] "Stavros") and the [...] "sacred" [...] word σταυρός ("cross").|$|R
5000|$|Pius XII <b>gave</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> why the Church {{gives the}} highest form of worship to the Heart of Jesus. The first {{rests on the}} {{principle}} whereby the believers recognise that Jesus' Heart is hypostatically united to the [...] "Person of the Incarnate Son of God Himself". The second reason {{is derived from the}} fact that the Heart is the natural sign and symbol of Jesus' boundless love for the humans. The encyclical recalls that for human souls the wound in Christ's side and the marks left by the nails have been [...] "the chief sign and symbol of that love" [...] that ever more incisively shaped their life from within.|$|R
