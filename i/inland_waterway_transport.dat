40|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> cargo <b>transport</b> in Europe is very {{competitive}} {{in relation to}} other, surface types of transport. Compositions of pushed barges can generate more ton-kilometers per distance unit than {{any other type of}} surface transport. Only pipeline transportation is more cost-effective than inland navigation, but it also has certain disadvantages like volume of investment, capability of only one type of liquid cargo (mostly crude oil), need for the flow to be always constant and to correspond to the full nominal capacity and travel conditions that reduce its flexibility. The development of this type of traffic in Europe was not satisfactory since its share according to traffic modal split was decreasing {{in the course of the}} last decades as a result of very rapid development of road transportation. Circulation volume in tons on <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> is significantly changing in very wide range from one European country to the other.

This figure is 20 times higher than the corresponding figure for road transports. The Swedish Transport Administration registered about 1, 300, 000 road vehicle-delay-hours due to unplanned stops over 5  minutes (and at least for all lanes in one direction) in 2010. The number of truck-delay hours is about 200, 000 (assuming that 15  % of the vehicles are trucks) and the number of the tonne-delay hours is approximately two million (assuming a load of ten tonnes per truck).

40|$|In its White Paper on Transport, the European Commission recognizes {{intermodal}} transport {{as an alternative}} solution to road transport. In practice, {{intermodal transport}} can be constituted by any combination of modes, while in the literature, intermodal transport is often modeled as a combination of modes in the order “road-rail/inland waterway-road”. This work develops a new intermodal allocation model which allows choosing between any direct (road, rail and <b>inland</b> <b>waterways)</b> <b>transport</b> and any intermodal transport chain constituted by up to three modes of transport. Intermodal solutions can pass through one or two intermodal terminals. Applied on experimental data at the European level, the model gives insight on the optimal flow distribution for economic objectives (optimization of transport operational costs) and environmental objectives (optimization of transport CO 2 emissions and air pollution external costs). Results highlight that the traditional modeling of intermodal transport as a “road-rail/inland waterway-road” combination better fits economic than environmental objectives. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Early use of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> {{used the}} rivers, and while barges could use sails to assist their passage when winds were {{favourable}} or {{the river was}} wide enough to allow tacking, in many cases this was not possible, and gangs of men were used to bow-haul the boats. As river banks were often privately owned, such teams worked their way along the river banks as best they could, but this was far from satisfactory. On British rivers such as the River Severn, the situation was improved by the creation of towing path companies in the late 1700s. The companies built towing paths {{along the banks of}} the river, and four such companies improved a section of 24 mi in this way between Bewdley and Coalbrookdale. They were not universally popular, however, as tolls were charged for their use, to recoup the capital cost, and this was resented on rivers where barge traffic had previously been free.|$|E
5000|$|Under FOB {{terms the}} seller bears all costs and risks {{up to the}} point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's {{responsibility}} does not end at that point unless the goods are [...] "appropriated to the contract" [...] that is, they are [...] "clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods." [...] Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce.
