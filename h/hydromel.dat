On going to rest he fancied he should be thirsty at night and called Leo to set a pitcher of <b>hydromel</b> by his bedside. As the slave was setting it down, the Frank looked slyly from under his eyelids, and said in joke, 'Tell me, my father-in-law's trusty man, wilt not thou some night take one of those horses, and run away to thine own home?' ...|$|E
60|$|A Norman {{would have}} despised the barbarous magnificence of an entertainment, {{consisting}} of kine and sheep roasted whole, of goat's flesh and deer's flesh seethed in the skins {{of the animals}} themselves; for the Normans piqued themselves on the quality rather than the quantity of their food, and, eating rather delicately than largely, ridiculed the coarser taste of the Britons, although the last were in their banquets much more moderate than were the Saxons; nor would the oceans of Crw and <b>hydromel,</b> which overwhelmed the guests like a deluge, have made up, in their opinion, {{for the absence of}} the more elegant and costly beverage which they had learnt to love in the south of Europe. Milk, prepared in various ways, was another material of the British entertainment, which would not have received their approbation, although a nutriment which, on ordinary occasions, often supplied the Avant of all others among the ancient inhabitants, whose country was rich in flocks and herds, but poor in agricultural produce.|$|E

Ten pounds of honey with five heminas of vinegar, {{which will be}} subsumed. Themison {{confused}} oxymel and <b>hydromel.</b> But <b>hydromel</b> wine is made from water and honey, hence the name. Its name recalls the creation of omphacomel, which is made from semi-dry sharp grapes and sweet honey, hence the name, [...] Hence what is called [...] "omphalic oil", from sour olives which in Greek is called (?), and omphacium from grapes, commonly called agreste.|$|E

It is also the French name for mead <b>hydromel.</b> (See also and compare with the Catalan hidromel and aiguamel, Galician aiguamel, Portuguese hidromel, Italian idromele and Spanish hidromiel and aguamiel).

The honey which {{is used in the}} production of Lindisfarne Mead is drawn from around the world {{as well as from the}} island. Unlike other traditional mead, Lindisfarne mead is actually a <b>hydromel</b> because it contains pure natural water from an artesian well and grape juice.|$|E

Deciding that her scientific skills are needed more on Terminus, Nyssa elects to stay behind, bidding her friends a tearful farewell.

50|$|In ancient Rome, {{childbirth}} brought upon {{high risk}} to {{both mother and}} child due to a greater chance of complications which includes infection, uterine hemorrhage, and the young age of the mothers. Women relied mainly on the religious and superstitious practices associated with medicine at this time. After conception, women would rest in bed to “preserve the seed.” To treat pregnancy symptoms they would eat a bland diet of eggs or rice and would be massaged with olive oil. Plants and herbs such as dittany leaves, scordotis in <b>hydromel</b> and the root of vervain were used for relief during labor. Also, methodologies such as a drink powdered with sow’s dung to relieve labor pains and fumes from hyena loin fat or placing the right foot of a hyena on the woman to induce an easy delivery were of use. The development of midwives greatly improved the birthing process for Roman women. Midwives assisted births {{in the home and}} prepared the mothers with oil for lubrication, warm water, sponges, and provided bandages for the newborn. During difficult births tools with sharp hooks would be used to extract the baby. Once the baby was born the midwife would cut the umbilical cord, remove the placenta and then they would decide if the child was worth keeping. Once declared fit to live, the midwife would place the child on the ground for the head of the house hold to raise up the child and claim to rear it as a Roman ritual.|$|E
40|$|The {{content and}} {{composition}} of phenols are among the main characteristics which differentiate the <b>hydromel</b> from other alchoholic beverages. These compounds in the <b>hydromel</b> are substantially those present in the honey from which it is made by dilution and fermentation. The comparison of phenolic compounds of <b>hydromel</b> with those of honey, where they are present as flavonoids aglicones and free phenolic acids, may give information both {{on the origin of}} this alchoholic beverage and the evolution of these compounds during the fermentation, clarification and storage. In this paper is presented a simple analytical method for the extraction and separation of phenolic compounds of honey and <b>hydromel,</b> based on solid phase extraction and interaction of phenolic compounds with metal ions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA future economy {{based on}} {{reduction}} of carbon-based fuels for power generation and transportation may consider hydrogen as possible energy carrier. Extensive and {{widespread use of}} hydrogen might require a pipeline network. The alternatives might be {{the use of the}} existing natural gas network or to design a dedicated network. Whatever the solution, mixing hydrogen with natural gas will modify the consequences of accidents, substantially. The French National Research Agency (ANR) funded project called <b>HYDROMEL</b> focuses on these critical questions. Within this project large-scale jet fires have been studied experimentally and numerically. The main characteristics of these flames including visible length, radiation fluxes and blowout have been assessed...|$|E

Though the africanist author of this text would not {{go so far as}} to maintain with one of his fellow anthropologists that cannibalism, apart from the odd criminal or pathological case, has never existed anywhere or at anytime, it has always been exceptional, excentric and esoteric in Africa (1 - numbers refer to items in the bibliography). Africans have never regularly eaten one another for lack of anything (better) to eat!

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of hazards linked with Hydrogen/Natural gas mixtures transport by pipeline, the National Institute of Industrial Environment and Risks (INERIS) alongside with the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), the industrial companies Air Liquide and GDF SUEZ, and the French Research Institutes ICARE and PPRIME (CNRS) have been involved in a project called <b>HYDROMEL.</b> This project was partially funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) in the framework of its PAN-H program aimed at promoting the R&D activities related to the hydrogen deployment. Firstly, the project partners investigated how a NG/H 2 mixture may influence the modeling of a hazard scenario, i. e. how the addition of a quantity of hydrogen in natural gas can increase the potential of danger. Therefore it was necessary to build an experimental database of physics properties for mixtures. Secondly, effect distances in accidental scenarios that could happen on pipelines have been calculated with existing models adapted to the mixtures. This part was preceded by a benchmark exercise between all partners' models and experimental results found in the literature. Finally the consortium wrote a 'good practice guideline for modeling the effects related to the release of natural gas /hydrogen mixture'. The selected models and their comparison with data collected in the literature as well as the experimental results of this project, and the main conclusions of the guidelines are presented in this paper...|$|E

The Ulster method on malt-agar and PDA culture media has been used, evaluating the percentage of fungal taxons present on/in rape seeds. The most important pathogenic fungi identified were: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, Botrytis cinerea Pers., Rhizoctonia solani Kühn, Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc., A. brassicicola (Schwein.) Wiltshire and Fusarium spp. Also, a large quantities of some saprophytic fungi, as Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus have been recorded. These ones have been affected the health condition of rape seeds, suppressing their germination and other vital phenomena. Among potential antagonistic fungi the following genera have been isolated: Chaetomium (0 - 4 %), Trichoderma (0 - 10 %), Aspergillus (0 - 14 %), Penicillium (0 - 100 %). Some correlations and comparisons have been established between fungal diversity, their provenience, cultivars, culture media (Malt-Agar/MA, Potato-Dextrose-Agar/PDA) used. It has been evaluated the behaviour of rape cultivars and hybrids towards the main rape seed pathogens...|$|E
