5|$|Buckinghamshire County Council's architect, Fred Pooley, {{had spent}} {{considerable}} {{time in the}} <b>early</b> <b>sixties</b> developing ideas for a new town in the Bletchley and Wolverton area. He developed a futuristic proposal based on a monorail linking a series of individual townships to a major town centre. The county council published the proposals in 1966, {{but it was too}} late to influence the government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and <b>early</b> <b>sixties</b> Howard showed {{regularly}} at the Picture Loan Society, a Toronto gallery established by Douglas Duncan in 1936 {{to present the}} work of contemporary Canadian artists such as Emily Carr, Fred Varley, David Milne, Lawren Harris and A.Y. Jackson. Several Canadian public collections possess Howard drawings and paintings acquired through the Douglas Duncan estate, as Duncan was also a collector of her work.|$|E
5|$|The Philippine Football Association {{partnered with}} San Miguel Brewery to seek foreign {{assistance}} in developing football in the country. In the <b>early</b> <b>sixties,</b> British coaches Alan Rogers and Brian Birch {{were brought in}} and funded by San Miguel to train referees, coaches and players in the country. Due to lack of facilities, the two coaches organized a five-a-side football competition which was played in a field with the same size of a basketball court. The two were later relieved and Danny McClellan and Graham Adams were tasked train national and youth players.|$|E

5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the <b>early</b> <b>sixties</b> a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided {{to drop out}} of the race. When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson to remain as a candidate. Johnson replied that it was not in the best interest of the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he probably would not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their <b>early</b> <b>sixties.</b> A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E

40|$|This brief {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the world, UK and Scottish economic outlook. The upward movement in the Scotland/UK unemployment relative over the past few quarters is unlikely to portend a return to the poor relative performance of the Scottish economy which occurred in the <b>early</b> nineteen <b>sixties.</b> Nevertheless the outlook for the Scottish economy in 1978 is not very encouraging...|$|R

40|$|Vincristine, {{one of the}} {{naturally}} occurring vinca alkaloids extracted from {{the leaves of the}} periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus, remains to be an important anti-neoplastic drug in paediatric oncology since its introduction in the <b>early</b> nineteen <b>sixties.</b> Vincristine is active against acute leukaemia, Hodgkin's and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, Wilm's tumour, brain tumour and neuroblastoma. The dose-limiting side effect consists of a peripheral sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy. Other side effects, such as bone-marrow suppression, are relatively mild and no serious long-term side effects are known. Zie: Summary...|$|R

25|$|In three short papers {{published}} in the <b>early</b> <b>sixties,</b> Feyerabend sought to defend materialism against the supposition that the mind cannot be a physical thing. Feyerabend suggested that our commonsense understanding of the mind was incommensurable with the (materialistic) scientific view, but that nevertheless we ought to prefer the materialistic one on general methodological grounds.|$|E
50|$|Elder {{was very}} {{fortunate}} in his mining ventures. <b>Early</b> in the <b>sixties</b> he had large {{interests in the}} Moonta and Wallaroo copper-mines which brought him in a huge fortune.

He was again elected in 1871, but resigned in 1878 and took no further part in politics.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism {{at the time was}} New York Times art critic John Canaday. Meyer Schapiro and Leo Steinberg were also {{important}} postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of cylindrical shed reinforced concrete shells, a type of construction used primarily in industrial buildings. Like other types of shells, most cylindrical sheds were built between the end of World War II and the <b>early</b> nineteen <b>sixties.</b> The article reviews their characteristics and construction parameters based on contemporary studies and briefly documents some of the most prominent structures. The final chapter contains a detailed analysis of the design and construction of what, to the authors’ knowledge, is the largest such shell ever erected. Built for the Jamin factory at Oosterhout, Netherlands, this shed was the object of an ingenious destructive study on a scale model conducted in 1955 at Madrid’s Central Construction Materials Laboratory...|$|R
25|$|By the <b>early</b> <b>sixties,</b> high lumber {{prices and}} {{competition}} from new materials, such as fiberboard, paper-overlaid veneer, plastic and metal precipitated revolutionary {{changes in the}} container and packaging industry.

5000|$|Leslie Stevens, {{who wrote}} and {{directed}} Private Property, began his career working for Orson Welles' The Mercury Theatre {{while he was a}} teenager. After a stint in the Air Force during World War Two, Stevens returned to Broadway and wrote a hit play, The Marriage-Go-Round, which was adapted into a nineteen sixty film with Susan Hayward. In the <b>early</b> nineteen <b>sixties,</b> Stevens went into television, creating the series Stoney Burke with Jack Lord, in his pre-Hawaii Five-O days, as a rodeo rider and Warren Oates as Lord's sidekick. Jack Lord as a rodeo rider amuses me — especially thinking of him riding in a rodeo in the thick wool blue suits he inexplicably wore every day on Hawaii Five-O — I mean, it's Hawaii, man.|$|R

25|$|Bulgaria has {{the largest}} jackal {{population}} in Europe, which went through a 33–fold increase in range from the <b>early</b> <b>sixties</b> to mid-eighties. Factors aiding this increase include the replacement of natural forests with dense scrub, an increase in animal carcasses from state game farms, reductions in wolf populations and the abandonment of poisoning campaigns. In the early 1990s, {{it was estimated that}} up to 5000 jackals populated Bulgaria. The population increased in 1994, and appears to have stabilised.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the days}} of the <b>earlier</b> <b>sixties,</b> we youth who wished to be thought elect did not feel {{ourselves}} so unless we were deeply read in Hawthorne's romance of The Marble Faun. We made that our aesthetic handbook in Rome, and we devoutly looked up all the places mentioned in it, which were important for being mentioned; though such places as the Tarpeian Rock, the Forum, the Capitoline Museum, and the Villa Bor-ghese might secondarily have their historical or artistic interest. In like manner Story's statue of Cleopatra was to be seen, because it was the [...] "original" [...] of the imaginary sculptor Kenyon's Cleopatra, and a certain mediaeval tower was sacred because it was universally identified as the tower where the heroine Hilda lived dreaming and drawing, and fed the doves that circled around its top. We used to show the new arrivals where Hilda's tower was, and then stand with them watching the pigeons which made it unmistakable. I should then have thought I could never forget it, but I must have passed it several times unnoting in my latest Roman sojourn, when one afternoon in a pilgrimage to the Via del Gambero a contemporary of that earlier day glanced around the narrow piazza through which we were passing and, seeing a cloud of doves wheeling aloft, joyfully shouted, [...] "Look! There is Hilda's tower!" [...] and if Hilda herself had waved to us from its battlements we could not have been surer of it. The present vanished, and we were restored to our citizenship in that Rome of the imagination which is greater than any material Rome, and which it needs no archaeologist to discover in its indestructible integrity.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by Alex Inkeles classic study, I {{began in}} the <b>early</b> {{nineteen}} <b>sixties</b> to study Soviet mass communication and propaganda. This interest has grown throughout my years of graduate study, and along with it has developed a desire {{to contribute to the}} building of bridges between the study of Soviet politics and the analysis of politi-cal behavior in general. Although conditions for linking these two fields of enquiry are far from ideal even today, the situation has im-proved significantly over the last decade. The study of political motivations and actions has come into its own as a legitimate area of scholarly concentration, and the Soviet political environment has im-proved enough to make available more useful and interesting materials. The present study is one result of a project on Communist com-munication systems carried on at the Center for International Studie...|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>early</b> mid <b>sixties,</b> 1963-1964, post {{football}} and before his pro wrestling debut with 50th State Wrestling, Curtis [...] "the Bull" [...] Iaukea briefly {{worked as a}} disc jockey for KUMU Radio station in Kaimuki under then station owner/manager John Wiser. Playing a [...] "Classical Music" [...] format, he provided the first OJT job internship cueing records and tapes as a station gopher/programing assistant for a young upcoming south-shore surfer Steve Gilbert, whom he paid {{out of his own}} pocket.
