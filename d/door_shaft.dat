50|$|A bunker {{commonly}} has two doors, one {{of which}} is convenient, and in peace time use, and the other is strong. Naturally, the shelter must always have a secondary exit which can be used if the primary door is blocked by debris. <b>Door</b> <b>shafts</b> may double as ventilation shafts to reduce the digging, although this is inadvisable.|$|R
50|$|The doors must be {{at least}} as strong as the walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to {{minimize}} the size and expense. To reduce the weight, the door is normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame. Very thick wood also serves, and is more resistant to heat because it chars rather than melts. If the door is on the surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of the door is normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. A bunker should have two <b>doors.</b> <b>Door</b> <b>shafts</b> may double as ventilation shafts to reduce digging.|$|R
60|$|Having thought these {{problems}} out {{so far as}} it was in her power to do, Juanna rose and began to walk up and down the cell, noting its construction and peculiarities. Doubtless Leonard was behind yonder door, but it was so thick that she could hear nothing of his movements. For the rest, it seemed clear that escape was impossible. Excepting the <b>doors,</b> the <b>shaft</b> in the rock was the only other opening {{that she was able to}} see, but through this no child could pass, and if he might it would be to fall into the pool of raging water.|$|R
60|$|ROBERTS {{appears at}} the outer door of his {{apartment}} on the fifth floor. It opens upon a spacious landing, to which a wide staircase ascends at one side. At the other is seen the grated <b>door</b> to the <b>shaft</b> of the elevator. He peers about on all sides, and listens {{for a moment before}} he speaks.|$|R
50|$|Thieves led by Franz (reminiscent of Hans Gruber from Die Hard) have {{robbed a}} Burger King and flee to Pioneer Village, taking {{everyone}} hostage. Stan, Wendy, Jimmy and Kyle flee with two townspeople {{to an office}} where Kyle calls the police. The thieves find a locked mine <b>shaft</b> <b>door.</b> They interrogate the workers to find the code, but none will break character (even after the thieves manage to kill one of the workers).|$|R
5000|$|An {{arrangement}} {{often found}} in high rise public housing blocks, particularly those built in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s, is that elevators would only call at half {{the total number of}} floors, or at an intermediate level between a pair of floors; for example a lift of a 24-storey building would only stop at 12 levels, with staircases used to access the [...] "upper" [...] or [...] "lower" [...] level from each intermediate landing. This was commonly used as a cost-saving measure {{to reduce the number of}} elevator <b>shaft</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Given {{the current}} {{challenges}} in flood risk management and vulnerability assessment of buildings exposed to flood hazards, this study presents three-dimensional numerical modelling of torrential floods and its interaction with buildings. By {{means of a}} case study application, the FLOW- 3 D software {{is applied to the}} lower reach of the Rio Vallarsa torrent in the village of Laives (Italy). A single-family house on the flood plain is therefore considered in detail. It is exposed to a 300 -year flood hydrograph. Different building representation scenarios, including an entire impervious building envelope and the assumption of fully permeable <b>doors,</b> light <b>shafts</b> and windows, are analysed. The modelling results give insight into the flooding process of the building's interior, the impacting hydrodynamic forces on the exterior and interior walls, and further, they quantify the impact of the flooding of a building on the flow field on the surrounding flood plain. The presented study contributes {{to the development of a}} comprehensive physics-based vulnerability assessment framework. For pure water floods, this study presents the possibilities and limits of advanced numerical modelling techniques within flood risk management and, thereby, the planning of local structural protection measures...|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> of the <b>shaft</b> was removed, the car {{which had}} hung high above it was lowered {{to the mouth}} of the opening, and Roland stepped within it and seated himself. Above him and around him were placed {{geological}} tools and instruments of many kinds; a lantern, food and drink; everything, in fact, which he could possibly be presumed to need upon this extraordinary journey. A telephone was at his side by which he could communicate at any time with the surface of the earth. There were electric bells; there was everything to make his expedition safe and profitable. When he gave the word to start the engines, there were no ceremonies, and nothing was said out of the common.|$|R
50|$|The next jump {{takes them}} to a {{partially}} damaged arrival chamber. Upon examination the redoubt seems ireminiscent of a hidden redoubt the companions previously visited. Numerous earthshifts have blocked of much of this deep-buried redoubt, including {{the upper reaches of}} the staircase leading out of it. With no other choice the companions make use of an ancient elevator to reach the exit. Some ten feet from the top it stops functioning as the cables lifting it begin to fray. The companions narrowly escape through the elevator's maintenance hatch, and hang from the snapped cable strands as the elevator drops hundreds of feet to the bottom of the shaft. J. B. blows the <b>door</b> atop the <b>shaft</b> with plas-ex, allowing everyone to swing to safety.|$|R
50|$|The impact {{created a}} hole, {{estimated}} at 1 to 2 ft in diameter, in the Terminatorâ€™s aft lazarette area (a storage space between decks). The incoming water flooded the shaft alley. The watertight <b>door</b> between the <b>shaft</b> alley and main engine compartment was permanently affixed open. A cutting torch was needed {{before the door}} could be secured. This process took 20 minutes and only slowed the water coming into the engine room. Pumps to de-water the vessel operated only intermittently. There was no eductor (a type of water pump). The aft peak tank and bilge were filled with concrete (presumably for stability) and this extra weight could not be shifted to another area of the vessel from where the vessel was taking on water.|$|R
5000|$|Elevator doors protect riders {{from falling}} into the shaft. The most common {{configuration}} is to have two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large [...] "slab" [...] door: a single panel door {{the width of the}} doorway that opens to the left or right laterally. Some buildings have elevators with the single <b>door</b> on the <b>shaft</b> way, and double cascading doors on the cab.|$|R
5000|$|Members of {{the group}} Scholars for 9/11 Truth have {{collected}} eyewitness accounts of flashes and loud explosions immediately before the fall. Eyewitnesses have repeatedly reported of explosions happening before {{the collapse of the}} WTC towers, and the organization [...] "International Center for 9/11 Studies" [...] has published videos obtained from NIST, together with indications about when such explosions could be heard. There are many types of loud sharp noises that are not caused by explosives, and seismographic records of the collapse do not show evidence of explosions. Jones and others have argued that horizontal puffs of smoke seen during the collapse of the towers would indicate that the towers had been brought down by controlled explosions. NIST attributes these puffs to air pressure, created by the decreasing volume of the falling building above, traveling down elevator shafts and exiting from the open elevator <b>shaft</b> <b>doors</b> on lower levels).|$|R
50|$|He {{invites the}} provincial {{governor}} to his birthday dinner and cunningly gets approval from him, {{on condition that}} the dam will be built using his own finance. Though he faces multiple difficulties, the dam is nearly constructed, except for the <b>shaft</b> <b>doors.</b> The doors are being held in custody by the new collector as stolen goods and the floods are soon to occur. The new collector proposes that the king gives him all his property as bribe and all credit of constructing the dam goes to him and British government. The king with whole heart does so. The dam is fully constructed in 1939 at Solaiyur to solve the water problems of that village. The British lied to the villagers that the Raja was a British spy who would hand over the dam and all the villagers' lands to the British once the dam was completed. The irate villagers threw the Raja out of Solaiyur. Later, the villagers realised the Raja's true intentions and after a search found {{him and his wife}} Bharathi (Sonakshi Sinha) living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the Raja to return to Solaiyur, the villagers decided to keep the Shiva temple which was built along with the dam closed until the Raja or his descendants returned to the village. Lingaa, on hearing the Raja's story, changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways.|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} that {{buildings}} are renovated and their functional use is changed which leads tonew layouts of floor plans and that new installations {{are necessary to}} be made. These changesentails that load bearing walls are removed and new <b>door,</b> window and <b>shaft</b> openings needs tobe made in already existing load bearing walls. Reinforced concrete walls are nowadayscommon as structural members in buildings. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have knowledge ofhow cut-out openings affect their structural behavior. This is nowadays almost unexplored andthe international codes, for example Eurocode 2 (2008), treat openings in walls indirectly,through the column theory. Further research is necessary in this subject to gain knowledge onhow cracks, failure mode and the ultimate load are affected by a cut-out opening, reinforcementratio and placement and the eccentricity of the load. A parametric study was performed with the finite element method (FEM) program ATENA(Version 5. 3. 2) (2015). A benchmark process was performed against experimental tests,reported by Popescu et al. (2015 b), on three different walls: one solid wall, one wall with largedoor opening (A 0 /A= 50 %) and one wall with small door opening (A 0 /A= 25 %). The materialparameters were benchmarked according to laboratory tests. The investigated walls in FEA andin the experimental tests were two-way walls with a centric reinforcement mesh. The parametric study included seven different wall types, one solid wall and six walls withopenings with A 0 /A between 25 - 75 %. Each wall was investigated to four load eccentricities,e= 0 mm, e= 10 mm, e= 15 mm, e= 30 mm. The influence of the reinforcement was investigatedby an analysis of an unreinforced wall and a wall with a centric placed reinforcement mesh. The influence of placement of the reinforcement was investigated by an analysis of a wall witha centric reinforcement mesh and a wall with two reinforcement meshes, one at each face ofthe wall. In both cases the reinforcement ratio was kept constant. The effect of the reinforcementratio was also investigated by increase the reinforcement ratio of a centrically placedreinforcement mesh by 4 times. The parametric study showed that the investigated door opening sizes gave a reduction of theultimate load with up to 74 % compared to the solid wall. It was noted that the opening sizeaffects the crack pattern of the wall but the influence of the door opening size decreases withan increased eccentricity. The parametric study also showed that the investigated loadeccentricities gave a reduction of the ultimate load with up to 82 % compared to when the loadact centrically on the wall. The influence of eccentricity decrease with increased door openingsize. It was also proved that reinforcement always increases the ultimate load. Anotherconclusion was that an increased reinforcement ratio by 4 times increases the ultimate load upto 11. 2 %. A placement of the reinforcement mesh in two layers, one at each face of the wall,instead of one centric increases the ultimate load up to 10. 2 %. Ultimate loads calculated in the finite element analysis (FEA) were compared to Eurocode 2 (2008) and a design equation according to Doh and Fragomeni (2006). The most accurate wasDoh and Fragomeni (2006) compared to the FEA. But both Eurocode 2 (2008) and Doh andFragomeni (2006) showed ultimate loads with large deviations for some wall types. This masterthesis showed that an improved design method for reinforced concrete walls with cut-outopenings is needed. Validerat; 20160313 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
