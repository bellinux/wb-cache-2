The canal was completed in two weeks, {{but it was not}} deep enough to provide passage for the gunboats. It proved useful, nevertheless, in that transports and supply vessels could use it, so that Pope did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> land communications.|$|E
25|$|Professional golfers, fans, {{and media}} critics remarked that {{allowing}} Wie {{to compete in}} PGA events took away opportunities from more deserving golfers. By late 2007, the criticism {{over the use of}} exemptions had extended to Wie's participation in women's events on the LPGA Tour as well. Wie declined to enter LPGA Tour qualifying school after turning 18 and therefore would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> sponsor exemptions to play in future LPGA tournaments. This decision drew criticism from golf fans and commentators. Such criticism ended after Wie qualified for the LPGA Tour through the 2008 qualifying tournament.|$|E
25|$|In her seventh title defense, Rousey faced Holly Holm in {{the main}} event at UFC 193 on November 15, 2015. Despite being a heavy betting favorite, Rousey was unable to get Holm {{to the ground and}} had no answer for Holm's {{superior}} striking. Early in the second round, Holm knocked Rousey out with a high kick to the neck, ending Rousey's three-year reign as champion. It was also her first loss. After the fight, Rousey and Holm were each awarded a Fight of the Night bonus of $50,000. She was also medically suspended by UFC on November 18, 2015, which included a no-contact suspension for 45-days, and no fights for 60-days, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> CT scan results to have the suspension reduced.

25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam {{would take away}} a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E
25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E
25|$|Before the Falklands War, Defence Secretary John Nott had {{advocated}} {{and initiated}} {{a series of}} cutbacks to the Navy. The Falklands War though, provided a reprieve in Nott-proposed cutbacks, and proved a need for the Royal Navy to regain an expeditionary and littoral capability which, with its resources and structure at the time, would prove difficult. At {{the beginning of the}} 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time Hermes was retained, along with all three of the Invincible-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the Fleet Air Arm. New and more capable ships were built; notably the Sheffield-class destroyers, the Type 21, Type 22, and Type 23 frigates, and new LPDs of the Albion class, and , but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the RN surface fleet continues to reduce in size. A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> her allies if her territories were attacked.|$|E

500|$|Parliament had {{subsequently}} {{used these}} plenary powers {{to enact the}} Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965 and the RSIA on 22 December 1965. This served to eliminate any doubt as to the legislative powers of the Singapore Parliament because section 5 of the RSIA transferred all the plenary legislative powers previously possessed by the Parliament of Malaysia to the Singapore Parliament. This would necessarily have included the power to legislate extraterritorially. This was not negated by section 6 of the RSIA for two reasons. First, with the plenary powers of the Malaysian legislature vested in it under section 5, Parliament [...] "did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> any express conferment of extraterritorial powers". Secondly, section 6 was concerned with provisions in the Malaysian Constitution which were either [...] "preserved or excluded because Parliament in 1965 {{did not have time}} to enact a new Constitution". It could not have any effect on section 5 of the RSIA which was not a provision of the Malaysian Constitution.|$|E

Although Wood suspected that Tommy had been murdered by Leopold Overheu he found no proof to support the allegation and concluded that all the white members of the patrol had lied and orchestrated their testimony and that their journal was fabricated. Wood warned that his conclusions were based on the balance of probabilities not the beyond reasonable doubt standard required for a trial. On the question of the number of Aboriginals killed Commissioner Wood stated that [...] "If I cannot get direct evidence I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> hearsay." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1872 and 1876, he {{published}} 17 volumes of Gakumon no Susume ( [...] 学問のすすめ, [...] "An Encouragement of Learning" [...] or more idiomatically [...] "On Studying"). [...] In these texts, Fukuzawa outlines {{the importance of}} understanding the principle of equality of opportunity and that study {{was the key to}} greatness. [...] He was an avid supporter of education and believed in a firm mental foundation through education and studiousness. [...] In the volumes of Gakumon no Susume, influenced by Elements of Moral Science (1835, 1856 ed.) by Brown University President Francis Wayland, Fukuzawa advocated his most lasting principle, [...] "national independence through personal independence." [...] Through personal independence, an individual does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the strength of another. With such a self-determining social morality, Fukuzawa hoped to instill a sense of personal strength among the people of Japan, and through that personal strength, build a nation to rival all others. His understanding was that western society had become powerful relative to other countries at the time because western countries fostered education, individualism (independence), competition and exchange of ideas.|$|E
