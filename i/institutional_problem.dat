Methods: After the general framework of China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection was established, this study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics of China to commission a large-scale 2009 to 2010 national expert survey (n = 3, 914) through the organization of a pilot health care provider research system for the first time in China, and the analytic network process (ANP) implementation methodology was adopted to analyze the dataset from this survey. Results: The market-oriented health care provider approach was the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from the doctors’ point of view; the traditional government’s regulation-oriented health care provider approach was the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from the pharmacists’ point of view, the hospital administrators’ point of view, and the point of view of health officials in health administration departments; the public private partnership (PPP) approach was the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from the nurses’ point of view, the point of view of officials in medical insurance agencies, and the health care researchers’ point of view.

30|$|The third abductive {{learning}} routine cycles {{back to the}} imagined configurations by refining or reframing the hypothesized interdependencies that are involved. Participants in the strategic or <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving cycles critically examine assumptions, deliberate over different perspectives, and bridge possible differences into new shared directions (Ansell 2011). Inquiry {{is based on the}} clash of different perspectives and communication for probing, adjudicating, and bridging these differences. Different people see different aspects of the product possibility and how it might function in the application setting. Iteratively integrating helps to overcome competency traps, push ideas, cross check possibilities, and generate a joint representation. Managers might refine and replace milestones, and develop new performance objectives that reflect new alternatives and consequences learned from evaluation (Grandori 2010). By reframing, managers holistically assess what they know so far and what they have learned. Reframing cycles back with a new hypothesis for the configuration of interdependencies, to be evaluated and reframed again.|$|E
30|$|As Dougherty (2016) details, cycling {{through the}} abductive {{learning}} routines for <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving begins with imagining a configuration of interdependencies among relational elements and rules {{that can produce}} the specific kind of collaboration needed to address a certain problem. For example, if the problem is developing improved models for the early evaluation of drug possibilities, participants would include large firms, research hospitals, regulators, and small firms. Leaders need to be appointed, perhaps a coalition with clear rules for IP, participation, and task forces to oversee particular processes. Evaluating digs into the hypothesized interdependencies to examine assumptions {{and figure out what}} works and not, and why and how. Over time, experiments generate insights into how to develop and deploy metrics about how well the collaboration is doing, update and revise the problem, arrive at joint decisions and agreements, and foster ongoing participation. Some collaborative commons will be relatively short-lived, while others may continue for years.|$|E

A legal analysis presents the obstacles and alternatives future institutional arrangements will be confronted with, and leads to a definition of the <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> (Chapter IV). The core of the thesis is a proposal for regional intergovernmental organizations, which coordinate the operation of aeronautical satellite communications and air traffic control as an intermediary between the States and service providers (Chapter V). Among other problems financing, user charges, and liability are discussed. Legal problems of navigation systems are discussed on the base of the emerging global systems (Chapter VI) ...|$|E

30|$|This essay {{argues that}} unless the {{strategic}} and <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving cycles unfold productively and interactively with the project and process cycles, innovation cannot occur. The reason: the innovative problems and solutions unfold over many years, eco-system participants cannot muster the staying power to persist and learn for innovation over many, many years without strategies. Strategies for innovation integrate learning, direct activities, and shape ongoing knowledge co-evolution. Strategizing in complex innovation eco-systems requires a portfolio of future possibilities that maps out in various time periods potential value creating opportunities, because the knowledge needed for innovation emerges unpredictably and over a very long time. Imagine looking out 15 – 20  years and seeing a variety of possible value creating opportunities emerging, depending on various anticipated learning events. The imagined portfolio represents the competitive or strategic landscape out in time. Different firms and agencies would imagine the overall portfolio of possible opportunities out in time, but from their own perspective. The portfolio affords a deeper look in time because various possibilities work as stepping stones into the future.|$|E
30|$|An example {{helps to}} {{illustrate}} the strategic and <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving cycles. Participants in the biopharmaceutical complex innovation system have already developed a large repertoire of possible strategies, {{so there is no}} shortage of ideas for what managers ought to do. Among these ideas are: 1) develop new classes of therapeutic compounds and treatment modalities; 2) deliver therapies via collaborations with hospitals and patient associations; 3) discover drug families that address diverse genetic make-ups among patients; 4) deploy emerging sciences and technologies such as diagnostics, or research areas like epigenetics into networks of commercial collaborations; and 5) shift to open innovation (Christensen et al. 2009; Pisano 2006; West and Nightingale 2009; Chesbrough 2003). A perusal of literatures on other complex innovation eco-systems would reveal a similarly rich repertoire of possibilities for addressing these various grand challenges. All these possible strategic thrusts listed above involve collaboration among a variety of agents and agencies, both public and private, so most new strategies also require ongoing development of governance arrangements so that diverse agents and agencies can collaborate on innovative strategies, processes, and projects.|$|E
