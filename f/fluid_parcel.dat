25|$|In many situations, {{the mapping}} of average {{quantities}} from some Eulerian position x to a corresponding Lagrangian position α forms a problem. Since a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> with label α traverses along {{a path of}} many different Eulerian positions x, {{it is not possible}} to assign α to a unique x.|$|E
25|$|For a pure {{wave motion}} in fluid dynamics, the Stokes drift {{velocity}} {{is the average}} velocity when following a specific <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes drift velocity {{in the direction of}} wave propagation.|$|E
25|$|More generally, the Stokes drift {{velocity}} {{is the difference}} between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel,</b> and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid at a fixed position. This nonlinear phenomenon is named after George Gabriel Stokes, who derived expressions for this drift in his 1847 study of water waves.|$|E

During the passage of the body the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> move, according to their Lagrangian motion. Far after the passage of the body, the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are permanently displaced. The volume between the initial plane of the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> and the surface consisting of the parcel positions long after the body's passage is called the Darwin drift volume.|$|R

25|$|The Stokes drift is the {{difference}} in end positions, after a predefined amount of time (usually one wave period), as derived from a description in the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates. The end position in the Lagrangian description is obtained by following a specific <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> during the time interval. The corresponding end position in the Eulerian description is obtained by integrating the flow velocity at a fixed position—equal to the initial position in the Lagrangian description—during the same time interval.|$|E

2500|$|Stokes further observed, that {{although}} (in this Eulerian description) the third-order orbital velocity field {{consists of a}} circular motion at each point, the Lagrangian paths of <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are not closed circles. [...] This {{is due to the}} reduction of the velocity amplitude at increasing depth below the surface. This Lagrangian drift of the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> is known as the Stokes drift.|$|R
50|$|This {{mathematical}} {{concept is}} closely related to the description of fluid motion—its kinematics and dynamics—in a Lagrangian frame of reference. In this reference frame, <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are labelled and followed through space and time. But also in the Eulerian frame of reference the notion of <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> can be advantageous, for instance in defining the material derivative, streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines; or for determining the Stokes drift.|$|R

2500|$|Mathematically, {{incompressibility}} {{is expressed}} {{by saying that}} the density ρ of a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> does not change as it moves in the flow field, i.e., ...|$|E
2500|$|In most {{flows of}} liquids, and of gases at low Mach number, {{the density of}} a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> can be {{considered}} to be constant, regardless of pressure variations in the flow. [...] Therefore, the fluid can {{be considered to be}} incompressible and these flows are called incompressible flows. Bernoulli performed his experiments on liquids, so his equation in its original form is valid only for incompressible flow.|$|E
2500|$|In {{fields such}} as fluid {{dynamics}} and solid mechanics, it is not feasible to follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules. Instead, the materials must be approximated by a continuum {{in which there is}} a particle or <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density [...] and velocity [...] that depend on time [...] and position [...] The momentum per unit volume is [...]|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamic of}} <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> is {{described}} {{with the help}} of Newton's second law. An accelerating <b>parcel</b> of <b>fluid</b> is subject to inertial effects.|$|R
50|$|Often, the Lagrangian {{coordinates}} α {{are chosen}} {{to coincide with}} the Eulerian coordinates x at the initial time t = t0 :But also other ways of labeling the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are possible.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Lagrangian specification, {{individual}} <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are followed through time. The <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are labelled by some (time-independent) vector field x0. (Often, x0 is {{chosen to be}} the center of mass of the parcels at some initial time t0. It is chosen in this particular manner to account for the possible changes of the shape over time. Therefore the center of mass is a good parametrization of the flow velocity u of the parcel.) In the Lagrangian description, the flow is described by a functiongiving the position of the parcel labeled x0 at time t.|$|R
50|$|In fluid dynamics, {{within the}} {{framework}} of continuum mechanics, a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> is a very small amount of fluid, identifiable throughout its dynamic history while moving with the fluid flow. As it moves, the mass of a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> remains constant, while—in a compressible flow—its volume may change. And its shape changes due to the distortion by the flow. In an incompressible flow the volume of the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> is also a constant (isochoric flow).|$|E
5000|$|Thus, as a <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> moves equatorward (βy {{approaches}} zero), {{the relative}} vorticity must increase {{and become more}} cyclonic in nature. Conversely, if the same <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> moves poleward, (βy becomes larger), the relative vorticity must decrease and become more anticyclonic in nature.|$|E
50|$|For air flow, the {{corresponding}} term is air parcel. Another name for <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> is material element of fluid. Correspondingly, also {{the notions of}} material line and material surface can be introduced, always consisting of the same material elements and moving with the fluid flow. Yet another name used for <b>fluid</b> <b>parcel</b> is fluid element.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion, {{there is also}} a {{pressure}} oscillation underneath the free surface, with wave-induced pressure oscillations reducing with depth below the free surface – {{in the same way as}} for the orbital motion of <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} is {{by using the}} Lagrangian frame of reference, following the <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels.</b> The Lagrangian formulations show enhanced convergence, {{as compared to the}} formulations in both the Eulerian frame, and in the frame with the potential and streamfunction as independent variables.|$|R

Fluid Mech., vol. 749, 2014, pp. 577 – 596), collisions of counter-propagating solitary waves were studied experimentally by analysing the measured water-surface variations. Here we study the flow fields associated with the collisions. With the resolved velocity data obtained in the laboratory, the flow fields are analysed in terms of acceleration, vorticity, and velocity-gradient tensors in addition to the velocity field. The data show that flow acceleration becomes maximum slightly before and after the collision peak, not in accord with the linear theory which predicts the maximum acceleration at the collision peak. Visualized velocity-gradient-tensor fields show that <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are stretched vertically prior to reaching the state of maximum wave amplitude. After the collision peak, <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> are stretched in the horizontal direction. The boundary-layer evolution based on the vorticity generation and diffusion processes are discussed. It is shown that flow separation occurs at the bed during the collision. The collision creates small dispersive trailing waves. The formation of the trailing waves is captured by observing the transition behaviour of the velocity-gradient-tensor field: the direction of stretching of <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> alternates during the generation of the trailing waves...|$|R
50|$|The GLM method {{does not}} {{suffer from the}} strong {{drawback}} of the Lagrangian specification of the flow field - following individual <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> - that Lagrangian positions which are initially close gradually drift far apart.

40|$|International audienceThe {{possibility}} for a preexisting surface-intensified anticyclone to subduct beneath a surface front is investigated using an isopycnal numerical model. Subduction occurs for strong coherent vortices {{and is usually}} accompanied by strong dissipation. Two main mechanisms cause {{the erosion of the}} vortex core. The first one is induced by the velocity shear associated with the front. It results in the peeling of the vortex potential vorticity (PV) core, sometimes leading to its complete disappearance. The second mechanism occurs after the vortex has subducted. Entrainment of high positive PV <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> from the front above the vortex low negative PV core modifies the stability properties of the latter. Meanders are observed to grow at the rim of the structure, which favors the formation of PV filaments. The erosion rates caused by each mechanism are discussed in relation to the jet and vortex characteristics, and to the background stratification. The trapping of high PV <b>fluid</b> <b>parcels</b> above the vortex is also shown to be partly responsible for the decrease and eventual loss of the eddy altimetric signal, after it has subducted...|$|R
