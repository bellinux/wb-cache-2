50|$|As California's State Engineer, Hall {{worked on}} a {{comprehensive}} water supply and flood control system for the Sacramento Valley. Hall's study of California's hydrology lasted from 1878 through 1883. In that time, his staff installed an extensive flow <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> along some of California rivers. He was also instrumental in designing projects to help San Francisco acquire adequate supplies {{of water from the}} western watershed of the Tuolumne River.

50|$|Hall's {{methods were}} novel for the time. Hall {{transferred}} water power through {{a system of}} leather belts and pulleys to power his machines with unusual pace, greater than 3,000 revolutions per minute with efficiency, while most artisans used hand cutters and files. Like his contemporary Simeon North, Hall began using this mill power to run machine tools and achieve the dimension controls necessary for interchangeable parts. He employed metal-cutting machines attached with cutters and saws {{in the place of}} the standard heavy labor, made from cast-iron frames to ensure structural integrity and minimize vibrations from the millâ€™s belts. These machine-cut surfaces would then be hand filed to ensure fit and interchangeability, verified by a <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> Hall had designed.|$|E

5000|$|Inside each tank {{there are}} {{typically}} three submerged pumps. There {{are two main}} cargo pumps which are used in cargo discharge operations and a much smaller pump which {{is referred to as}} the spray pump. The spray pump is used for either pumping out liquid LNG to be used as fuel (via a vaporizer), or for cooling down cargo tanks. It can also be used for [...] "stripping" [...] out the last of the cargo in discharge operations. All of these pumps are contained within what is known as the pump tower which hangs from the top of the tank and runs the entire depth of the tank. The pump tower also contains the tank <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> and the tank filling line, all of which are located near the bottom of the tank.|$|E

50|$|Wodonga {{station was}} the {{original}} terminus of Victorian Railways' North East line which was built during the 1870s, with Wodonga opening on 21 November 1873. The connection through to the standard <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> across the Murray River to Albury was not completed until 14 June 1883, partly because the New South Wales Government Railways standard <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> had not yet extended {{as far south as}} Albury.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a generic <b>gauge</b> <b>system,</b> whose physical {{degrees of freedom}} are obtained by restriction on a constraint surface followed by factorization {{with respect to the}} action of gauge transformations; in so doing, no Hamiltonian structure or action principle is supposed to exist. For such a generic <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> we construct a consistent BRST formulation, which includes the conventional BV Lagrangian and BFV Hamiltonian schemes as particular cases. If the original manifold carries a weak Poisson structure (a bivector field giving rise to a Poisson bracket on the space of physical observables) the generic <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> is shown to admit deformation quantization by means of the Kontsevich formality theorem. A sigma-model interpretation of this quantization algorithm is briefly discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the Phase 2 Resonant Infrasonic <b>Gauging</b> <b>System</b> (RIGS) {{development}} program are presented.

Except for hydrogen, {{it can be used}} to gauge virtually any propellant in liquid form, including cryogenics. The gage consists of a sensor unit which is attached to the propellant tank and an electronic control unit which may be positioned separately from the sensor.

40|$|Gauging {{the mass}} of {{propellants}} in a tank in low gravity is not a straightforward task because of {{the uncertainty of the}} liquid configuration in the tank and the possibility of there being more than one ullage bubble. Several concepts for such a low-gravity <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> have been proposed, and breadboard or flight-like versions have been tested in normal gravity or even in low gravity, but at present, a flight-proven reliable <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> is not available. NASA desired a database of the gauging techniques used in current and past vehicles during ascent or under settled conditions, and during short coasting (unpowered) periods, for both cryogenic and storable propellants. Past and current research and development efforts on gauging systems that are believed to be applicable in low-gravity conditions were also desired.

40|$|A {{modeling}} method of virtual <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> based on kernel partial least squares (KPLS) was proposed. The C frame of a <b>gauging</b> <b>system</b> is only {{installed in the}} delivery side of a hot strip finishing mill, therefore serious delay will definitely occur, {{in order to reduce}} the delay effect, automatic gauge control (AGC) system of upstream finishing mill adopts indirect gauge measurement method by stretch formula, but because the stretch modulus is not easy to get, and stretch formula is only an approximate expression, this method does not effectively improve the quality of strip. KPLS is a promising regression method for tackling nonlinear problems. This paper adopts KPLS method for nonlinear feature extraction, Simulation and online results show that on the data sets employed KPLS achieves better results than PLS and some other KPLS, so a more accurate gauge value with less delay is provided for the AGC system of upstream finishing mill to get better gauge accuracy. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} the Higgs {{mechanism}} for non-Abelian N = 2 gauge theories in four dimensions is geometrically realized {{in the context of}} type II strings as transitions among compactifications of Calabi-Yau 3 -folds. We use this result and T-duality of a further compactification on a circle to derive N = 4, d = 3 dual field theories. This reduces the dualities for N = 4 <b>gauge</b> <b>systems</b> in three dimensions to perturbative symmetries of string theory. Moreover, we find that the dual of a <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> always exists but may or may not correspond to a Lagrangian system. In particular, we verify a conjecture of Intriligator and Seiberg that an ordinary <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> is dual to compactification of exceptional tensionless string theory down to three dimensions...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that [...] differing from {{ordinary}} <b>gauge</b> <b>systems</b> [...] canonical <b>gauges</b> are not admissible in the path integral for parametrized systems. This is the case for the relativistic particle and gravitation. However, a time dependent canonical transformation can turn a parametrized system into an ordinary <b>gauge</b> <b>system.</b> It is shown how to build a canonical transformation such that the fixation of the new coordinates is equivalent to the fixation of the original ones; this aim can be achieved only if the Hamiltonian constraint allows for an intrinsic global time. Thus the resulting action, describing an ordinary <b>gauge</b> <b>system</b> and allowing for canonical gauges, can be used in the path integral for the quantum propagator associated with the original variables.
