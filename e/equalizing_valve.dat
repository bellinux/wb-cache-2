50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally <b>equalized</b> <b>valves</b> is how the evaporator pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally <b>equalized</b> <b>valves,</b> the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the evaporator, whereas in externally <b>equalized</b> <b>valves,</b> the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the evaporator. Externally <b>equalized</b> thermostatic expansion <b>valves</b> compensate for any pressure drop through the evaporator.|$|R
50|$|Internally <b>equalized</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used}} on {{single circuit}} {{evaporator}} coils having low pressure drop. Externally <b>equalized</b> <b>valves</b> must be used on multi-circuited evaporators with refrigerant distributors. Externally equalized TXVs {{can be used on}} all applications; however, an externally equalized TXV cannot be replaced with an internally equalized TXV.|$|R
25|$|As the {{pressure}} in the train line {{and that of the}} reservoir <b>equalize,</b> the triple <b>valve</b> closes, causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in, and the brake cylinder is not pressurized.|$|R
40|$|Engineers face a {{wide variety}} of {{problems}} to be solved each day. A trouble shooting (TS) problem is one where something occurs that is unexpected and out-of-the-ordinary, {{to such an extent that}} it is perceived that some immediate corrective action may be needed. The action may be:-to flee,-to forget the situation; it will eventually correct itself,-to initiate emergency shut-down procedures,-to put the situation into "hold " as you methodically diagnose the fault, identify the cause, decide on corrective action and ensure that everything is done to try to prevent a reoccurrence. Case 1 : "The pipe on the exit line from our ammonia storage tank burst between the vessel and the o valve. An uncontrolled jet of- 33 C ammonia is streaming out onto the ground. What do you do?" Case 2 : "During the startup of the ammonia synthesis reactors, the inlet and outlet valves to the startup heater were opened. The pressure in the synthesis loop was <b>equalized.</b> The <b>valves</b> to the high pressure stage of the synthesis gas compressor were opened and the firing on the start-up heater was increased. However, we experienced difficulty getting the fuel gas pressure greater than 75 kPa; indeed a rumbling noise is heard if we try to increase the pressure. The process gas temperature was o only 65 C. What do you do?"...|$|R
40|$|U. S. Patent 6, 142, 151 {{describes}} a dual-bed ventilation {{system for a}} space suit, with emphasis on a multiport spool valve that switches air flows between two chemical beds that adsorb carbon dioxide and water vapor. The valve is used to alternately make the air flow through one bed while exposing the other bed to the outer-space environment to regenerate that bed through vacuum desorption of CO 2 and H 2 O. Oxygen flowing from a supply tank is routed through a pair of periodically switched solenoid valves to drive the spool valve in a reciprocating motion. The spool <b>valve</b> <b>equalizes</b> the pressures of air in the beds and the volumes of air flowing {{into and out of}} the beds during the alternations between the adsorption and desorption phases, in such a manner that the volume of air that must be vented to outer space is half of what it would be in the absence of pressure equalization. Oxygen that has been used to actuate the spool valve in its reciprocating motion is released into the ventilation loop to replenish air lost to vacuum during the previous desorption phase of the operating cycle...|$|R
