50|$|The {{tightening}} {{is simply}} a normal behavior of a cylindrical, helically wound braid, usually the common biaxial braid. Pulling the entire braid lengthens and narrows it. The length is gained by reducing the angle between the warp and weft threads at their crossing points, but this reduces the radial distance between opposing sides and hence the overall circumference. The more one pulls, the more the circumference shrinks and the trap tightens. The same effect is used in specialized textile manufacturing, the Vivien Kellems cable grip, Indonesian woven <b>fruit</b> <b>presses,</b> and by fly-fishers.|$|R

50|$|A juicing press, {{such as a}} <b>fruit</b> <b>press</b> or wine press, is {{a larger}} scale {{that are used in}} {{agricultural}} production. These presses can be stationary or mobile. A mobile press has the advantage that it can be moved from one orchard to another. The process is primarily used for apples and involves a stack of apple mash, wrapped in fine mesh cloth, which is then pressed under approx 40 tonnes. These machines are popular in Europe and have now been introduced to North America.|$|E
50|$|From {{the second}} century BC, The Isis cult began to resplace the Artemis cult. There were statues of Isis Tyche, Isis Lochia, the goddess of birth, and Aphrodite Hypolympiada. A statue of Julia Phrougiane Alexandra stood upright {{on the base of}} the excavations. Furthermore, statuettes of Harpokrates, the {{companion}} of the Isis, and stone tables showing footprints of different sizes (possibly of men and women) are exhibited. In addition to the representations of persons, one found the upper part of a well frame as well as cult objects such as a millstone, a <b>fruit</b> <b>press</b> and a small altar.|$|E
50|$|This rural villa (1st century BC - 6th century AD) {{belonged to}} the Roman {{province}} of Tarraconensis. It consists of two parts : the rural and the rustic. One can {{get an idea of}} its great value by looking, among other things, at the remains of the spa, the central heating system, the mosaics and the base of a <b>fruit</b> <b>press</b> with recipient for the crushed juices. Fragments of the mosaics, the stucco and several elements of sculptures attest to the wealth of the owners of the villa. The ceramic vases are proof of the trade with the Mediterranean world. Farming tools, fish tackle and loom tools reveal agricultural and fishing activities. Everyday life is evoked by other objects such as hairpins, small spoons and bone and ivory utensils.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Eblé married fellow painter Dan Campanelli {{and they}} made their living from {{teaching}} art classes and selling paintings. In 1976, they bought a stone farmhouse in New Jersey which was abandoned and had no electricity. As {{they were unable to}} obtain financing and had no savings, they restored the building themselves with hand tools. Eblé-Campanelli abandoned her wheelchair for hands and knees and refinished the floors, while Dan worked on the sagging structure. They pressed grapes in an antique <b>fruit</b> <b>press,</b> making their own wine; Eblé-Campanelli canned 400 jars of fruit annually; and she spun fleece from their Dorset sheep into yarn for projects. Their work and home was featured in Colonial Homes in the March/April 1981 issue and Country Living Magazine in April 1985. That same year, the New Jersey Network produced a PBS program on their artwork and life for television.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{all parts}} of the H. rhamnoides contain several {{bioactive}} compounds that can have positive health effects for humans as well as livestock. Particularly the fruit contain high vitamin C amounts, which exceed the ones of lemons and oranges.The H. rhamnoides fruits are processed in the food industry to different products. Usually, the berries are first washed and then pressed, resulting in press-cake and juice. The <b>fruit</b> <b>press</b> cake can be used to gain oil, natural food colour pigments (yellow/orange) or jam while the juice is further processed and then packaged as final juice product. Even in countries where there is no H. rhamnoides production, at least a few products can be found. It is usually possible to buy H. rhamnoides jam or fruit concentrate, fruit juices and some cosmetics, such as hand cream, shampoo or massage oils. In southern France for example, H. rhamnoides is commonly sold as fruit juice or as an ingredient in non-alcoholic and alcoholic mixed beverages. Typical liquor produced at the same latitudes in Italy, Tuscany, is the officinal Tuscan liquor - Spinello.|$|E

50|$|Within Odenbach’s limits lie roughly twelve {{abandoned}} sandstone quarries. They {{bear witness}} to a once ﬂourishing industry. Foremost among them was the former quarry and stonecutting business on the Kaiserhof. The yellow-veined sandstone from the cadastral area known as “In der Hinterwies” was easy to work and in demand for state buildings, town halls, schoolhouses, business premises and villas. Until 1914, almost 300 men were employed at this quarry. From the other quarries came stone mainly used for making hewn stones for window and door walling and lintels, and also for making stone crocks for sauerkraut, wine <b>press</b> vats and <b>fruit</b> <b>presses.</b> According to a 1926 state examination certiﬁcate, the sandstone from the mountain ridge between the Odenbach and the Glan was one of Germany’s hardest. As such, it was well suited for making millstones, and Odenbach millstones were put to use from the Hunsrück to the Moselle.|$|R
50|$|Reamers {{are used}} for {{squeezing}} juice from citrus such as grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges. Juice is extracted by pressing or grinding a halved citrus along a juicer's ridged conical center and discarding the rind.

40|$|Scientists see health-determining air {{paths in}} <b>fruit</b> <b>PRESS</b> RELEASE- Pears and apples contain air {{pathways}} to “breathe”. The pathways are microscopically small structures for oxygen supply and are key elements {{in determining the}} fruit’s health. Researchers from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) have visualized {{them for the first}} time, therefore proving their hypothesized existence. In apples, the pathways appear as irregular cavities between cells, whilst in pears they have the shape of tiny interconnected channels. These results allow {{a better understanding of how}} the fruit degrades after harvest and provide a scientific explanation of the everyday experience that pears are more susceptible to decay during storage. Apples and pears continue to “breathe ” after picking. To keep the fruit healthy, a minimum level of oxygen must be supplied to all cells of the fruit. If this does not happen, internal browning disorders appear and fruit quality decreases. This is why fruit is stored in dedicated cool rooms with accurate control of oxygen levels. Montage of a pear and an apple and their inner structure, including the air pathways. Credits: P. Verboven. The correct oxygen concentration is related to the complex mechanisms of gas exchange, respiration and fermentation in the fruit. Restricted gas exchange leads to too low a level of oxygen inside the cells. Three-dimensional images of the fruit microstructure help to determine and explain gas exchange rates and when fruit cells start to die and browning initiates. Such imaging is not easyScientists see health-determining air paths in fruit- ESR...|$|E

40|$|Tropical forests {{around the}} world contain animals that scatter-hoard fruits and seeds but few are known in Australian {{tropical}} forests. This study used both direct observation and spool-and-line tracking of simulated fruits to demonstrate that Australia's smallest kangaroos disperse large numbers of rain-forest fruits and seeds. They did so in two ways, either by scatter-hoarding or by carrying {{them away from the}} source to devour the flesh before dropping the seed on to the litter surface. The fruits used included a range of fruit types but particularly species with large fleshy fruit. Caches occurred as a single <b>fruit</b> <b>pressed</b> into the soil and covered with litter a mean distance of 17 m (± 2. 7 SE) and up to 68 m from the source. Musky rat-kangaroos handled up to 2700 fruits ha- 1 mo- 1 and they dispersed up to 900 fruits ha- 1 mo- 1 and cached up to 690 fruits ha- 1 mo- 1. This behaviour is a significant example of convergent evolution, which reflects similar behaviour found in agoutis, acouchies and squirrels on other continents...|$|R
30|$|Tyrosinase is transcriptionally {{regulated}} by MITF, and MITF expression is {{regulated by}} a number of kinase pathways. Recently, the melanogenesis-regulating activity of compounds have been evaluated by determining the tyrosinase expression as well as tyrosinase activity. Besides to clarify the mechanism, the expressions of MITF and kinases have been investigated by western blot analysis. 1 -O-Methyl-fructofuranose from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis is a traditional Korean medicinal herb, and the effects of 1 -O-methyl-fructofuranose on melanogenesis, expressions of melanogenic enzymes, and related signaling pathways were investigated. 1 -O-Methyl-fructofuranose inhibits melanogenesis by suppressing the expressions of tyrosinase, TRP- 1, and MITF. Additionally, the study also elucidated the compound increases the phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting 1 -O-methyl-fructofuranose inhibits melanogenesis by stimulating the ERK pathway [46]. Citrus <b>fruits</b> <b>press</b> cake was reported as melanogenesis inhibitor by suppressing MITF expression [47]. Rhodiola rosea extracts was studied as melanogenesis suppressor. The acetone extract of R. rosea exhibits tyrosinase inhibitory activity [48]. Besides R. rosea root containing phenylethanol derivatives, phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and triterpenes [49, 50] decreases melanin content in B 16 melanoma cells via suppressing the expressions of MC 1 R, a receptor of α-MSH, MITF, TRP- 1, and tyrosianse [51].|$|R
