500|$|The game's cutscenes {{were first}} drafted using a storyboard, {{then when the}} {{sequence}} of events had been finalized, motion capture was used to create the scene in a digitized format. Lighting and environmental effects were then put in place. One of the most challenging sequences to create was the opening real-time cutscene for the Limsa Lominsa story route: the giant sea serpent's fins were each individually animated. The game's opening cinematic was produced by Visual Works, Square Enix's in-house CGI development company. All the in-game models were first created in high-resolution form using a 3D sculpturing program, then readjusted so they could appear in the game with a lower polygon count but equivalent graphical quality. Another large part of creating the characters was their accessories: to help with this, the team developed a multi-layered development system. A technique dubbed [...] "polygon shaving" [...] was used so two sets of equipment could be designed to look different while using the same model data. Another function dubbed [...] "reshaping" [...] was used to adjust the shapes of <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories.</b> The third element, dubbed [...] "SSD-file", enabled the adjustment of the [...] "materials" [...] equipment was made off, so its color and texture could be changed. Rather than relying on a single design image, which would have been impractical for the hardware, the team took basic art and used Photoshop to add subtle changes to each. It was then passed down to the modeling team, who used the same sculpting process as was used for the game's monsters to create high-detail models while keeping the polygon count low.|$|E

Other costumes were designed by Production Designer Keith Wilson, who was also responsible for set design. Wilson's innovative Moonbase set construction, using [...] plastic foam-board panels, linked together Lego-like into whatever room configuration was required, made for a uniform and realistic appearance for the Alpha interiors (not to mention being relatively cheap and quickly assembled). A muted colour palette and the integration of recognisable <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> added to the verisimilitude.|$|E
