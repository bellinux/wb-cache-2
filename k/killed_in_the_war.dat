5|$|His {{death is}} now {{believed}} to have occurred after the first American combat fatalities in the Battle of Osan.

5|$|In 1817, Sharp {{was again}} {{elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives.

Marquis Ondore announces that the assassin was Dalmascan captain Basch, who has been sentenced to death, and that Princess Ashe has committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Street {{crime was}} {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became significant problems. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because {{there was so much}} street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E

5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related costs. A total of 20,000 people were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and refugees were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to verdicts by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other.|$|E
5|$|World WarII cost {{thousands}} of Australian lives and consumed {{a large portion}} of the national income. During the war, 27,073members of the Australian military were either killed, died of wounds or died while prisoners of war. Of these, 9,572 were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against Germany and Italy and 17,501 in the war against Japan. Prisoners of war held by the Japanese made up nearly half of Australia's deaths in the Pacific. At least 386Australian civilian seamen were killed during the war. Total Australian war expenditure was £2,949,380,000 and at its peak in 1942–43, military costs accounted for 40.1percent of national income.|$|E
5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in additional casualties. In order to prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the crash site with napalm two days later, reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames. The pilots observed that his body looked to have been disturbed and his clothes stolen, but he was still stuck in the aircraft. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African American U.S. Navy officer <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 27 October 1916, as his {{battalion}} attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien {{came down}} with trench fever, a disease carried by the lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916. Many of his dearest school friends were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed {{on the first day}} of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick {{was born}} in Harlan County, Kentucky, one of 10 children. After {{dropping}} {{out of high school}} in 1948, he joined the U.S. Army, and spent a year of service in Japan before being dispatched to South Korea {{at the onset of the}} Korean War in 1950 along with his unit, the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. During a patrol, Shadrick was killed by the machine gun of a North Korean T-34 tank, and his body was taken to an outpost where journalist Marguerite Higgins was covering the war. Higgins later reported that he was the first soldier <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a claim that was repeated in media across the United States.

5|$|American {{involvement}} in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged {{with the task of}} finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dewar enlisted early, {{joining the}} New Zealand Expeditionary Force leaving on 15August 1914 for German Samoa. On his return he volunteered again, joining the 9th Wellington Mounted Rifles as a machine gunner and was based at Awapuni Racecourse, Palmerston North; he was {{promoted}} quickly to sergeant. On 16October 1914, after training, Dewar embarked on the Orari at Wellington en route for Egypt. There, Dewar captained the Wellington Mounted Rifles rugby team in several matches against other regiments — beating the First Australian Light Horse, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, and the Auckland Mounted Rifles — before his regiment landed on 8August 1915 at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli. Twenty-four hours later, on 9August 1915, Dewar lost {{his life in the}} assault on Chunuk Bair — Albert Downing was killed in the same action, the first All Black to be <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Sergeant Henry Dewar is commemorated on the Chunuk Bair (NZ) Memorial Turkey (Panel 4).|$|E

5|$|In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had promised a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of psychological warfare by the CIA. Árbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. From 1954 onwards Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War. 200,000 civilians were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramopakhyana (the {{narrative}} of Rama in the epic Mahabharata), Sita informs Hanuman that Trijata brought her {{a message from}} Avindhya about the well-being of Rama, and that he and Lakshamana will soon come to rescue her from Lanka. Trijata thus assumes the role assigned to Kala in the original Ramayana. The Raghuvamsa, the Setubandha, the Balaramadasa Ramayana, the Kakawin Ramayana and the Seri Rama all replace Sarama with Trijata in the episode where {{the truth of the}} illusory head of Rama is revealed to Sita. The Prasannaraghava has Trijata inform Sita about the burning of Lanka, instead of Sarama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana makes Trijata the saviour of Sita, when she stops Ravana from killing Sita in the Ashoka Vatika; this role was originally assigned to Mandodari. Trijata again saves Sita's life when a vengeful Ravana rushes to slay his captive after his son Indrajit is <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> In the Ramayana, Suparshva – a minister of Ravana – stops him, while other adaptations attribute the act variously to Avindhya or Mandodari.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
