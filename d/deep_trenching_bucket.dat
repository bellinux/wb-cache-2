40|$|Etchback of {{polysilicon}} {{used for}} refilling <b>deep</b> <b>trenches</b> isolating bipolar devices {{has been investigated}} in a mag-netically enhanced reactive ion etcher using HBr, C 12, and SF 6 gas combinations.

Polysilicon etchback processes with uniformity better than 2 %, polysilicon etch rate larger than 5000 A/min, and loading factor less than 1. 3 were obtained with a gas mixture consisting of less than 9 sccm SF 6 flow in a predominant HBr and C 12 mixture. It was found that the etch roughness and surface pro-file of the resulting trench polysilicon was a strong function of C 12 percentage inthe mixture. The controllable trench poly-silicon etchback profile with smooth surface and curvature was obtained by using 60 sccm HBr and 50 sccm C 12 gas mix-tures with 6 sccm SF 6 gas flow.

40|$|International audienceRecently, {{thanks to}} the {{advancement}} in SiC process technology, the <b>deep</b> <b>trench</b> termination (DT 2) technique becomes an appropriate choice for future high voltage SiC power device. This technique termination {{is based on the}} use of a wide and <b>deep</b> <b>trench,</b> which is filled by a dielectric and associated with a field plate. DT 2 technique increases the breakdown voltage (VBR) to a value near to the ideal one that can be obtained in a plan case; and at the same time, reduces drastically the chip area comparing to the previous conventional techniques. In this work, the DT 2 used for a 3 kV 4 H-SiC bipolar vertical diode is presented. Simulations using TCAD SENTAURUS software show that a maximum breakdown voltage of 3286 V at room temperature can be achieved with a <b>deep</b> <b>trench</b> of 20 μm corresponding to 98 % of a parallel plane breakdown voltage for the drift layer of 18 μm.

40|$|We {{report a}} method of {{depositing}} individual ‘templated carbon nanotubes’ (T-CNTs) on opposing electrodes {{so that they are}} suspended across 100 µm <b>deep</b> <b>trenches,</b> and in separate experiments across low profile (70 nm thick) opposing electrodes. The geometry of the electrodes with <b>deep</b> <b>trenches</b> was chosen to be essentially identical to that in a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) testing stage used for mechanical loading of nanostructures. An electric field was used to attract the T-CNTs dispersed in a solvent and critical point drying was employed to protect them from breaking or deforming. The real-time potential change in the circuit was monitored as a means of characterizing the deposition of an individual T-CNT across this <b>deep</b> <b>trench.</b> For the case of sequential deposition on electrodes that are 70 nm above the substrate surface, a method was developed for counting the number of sequentially deposited T-CNTs. Simultaneous video recording of the deposition of T-CNTs confirmed the measured real-time potential changes for both cases. It was found that the resistance of the circuit changed as each new T-CNT was deposited for the sequential deposition; up to five T-CNTs were sequentially detected. This approach allows for controlled deposition of one-dimensional nanostructures for their potential use in NEMS devices, and may be useful for large-scale integration. 1...|$|R
