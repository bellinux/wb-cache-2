40|$|Hardware {{duplication}} {{techniques are}} widely used for concurrent error detection in dependable systems to ensure high availability and data integrity. These techniques are vulnerable to common-mode failures (CMFs). Use of <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> with diverse implementations of the two modules has been proposed {{in the past for}} protection against CMFs. In this paper, we define a category of faults, called non-self-testable faults that undermine the data integrity of dependable systems. These faults produce identical errors at the outputs of the two modules of a <b>duplex</b> <b>system</b> and can potentially be caused by CMFs. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) techniques that identify non-self-testable faults in <b>duplex</b> <b>systems,</b> and (2) design methods that reduce the number of non-selftestable faults by test point insertion. We show that our algorithm for identifying non-self-testable faults runs orders of magnitude faster than exact techniques with minimal loss of accuracy. Also, there is a significant {{reduction in the number of}} test points required for <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> with diverse implementations compared to <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> with identical implementations. Thus, we can detect commonmode failures in diverse <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> using very few test points.

40|$|Abstract: Virtual <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> {{have emerged}} as an {{alternative}} to traditional <b>duplex</b> <b>systems,</b> trading structural for temporal redundancy. When used in dependable embed-ded <b>systems,</b> virtual <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> provide a cost benefit because they require only one instead of two processors. In order to lighten the burden of this single processor, and in order to obey real-time requirements in embedded systems, the overhead due to the temporal redundancy must be low. As context-switch time constitutes a significant fraction of this overhead, we propose to use threads instead of processes to reduce the overhead in the error-free case and allow for faster detection of faults. Instead of using POSIX threads, we propose emulated multithreading to further reduce overhead. This technique allows very fine-grain execution and very short times between checkpoints. We evaluate the proposed concepts quantitatively. ...|$|R

40|$|Duplex and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) {{systems are}} used when a {{high-level}} of reliability is desired. Real-Time Systems for autonomous critical missions need such degrees of reliability, but energy consumption becomes a dominant concern when these systems are {{built out of}} high-performance processors that consume a large budget of electrical power for operation and cooling. Examples where energy consumption and real time are of paramount importance include reliable computers onboard mobile vehicles, such as the Mars Rover, satelites, and other autonomous vehicles. At first inspection, a <b>duplex</b> <b>system</b> uses about {{two thirds of the}} components that a TMR system does, leading one to conclude that <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> are more energy-efficient.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{concept of}} {{enhancing}} saltiness perception in emulsions and a liquid food formulated with the emulsions (ambient vegetable soup) through increasing salt {{concentration in the}} continuous phase while retaining the fat content of the (aqueous continuous) product was evaluated. This was accomplished by increasing the droplet phase volume using duplex emulsion technology. Viscosity and droplet size distribution was measured. Saltiness evaluation was based on simple paired comparison testing (2 -Alternate Forced Choice tests, BS ISO 5495 : 2007). Results Single and duplex emulsions and emulsion-based products had comparable mean oil droplet diameters (25 to 30 [*]μm); however, viscosity of the <b>duplex</b> emulsion <b>systems</b> was considerably higher. Sensory assessment of saltiness of emulsion pairs (2 AFC) indicated duplex technology enhanced saltiness perception compared to a single emulsion product at the same salt content (6. 3 [*]g/ 100 [*]g) in both simple emulsions and the formulated food product (P [*]=[*] 0. 0596 and 0. 0004 respectively) although assessors noted the increased viscosity of the <b>duplex</b> <b>systems.</b> The formulated food product also contained pea starch particles which may have aided product mixing with saliva and thus accelerated tastant transport to the taste buds. Lowering salt content in the <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> (to levels of aqueous phase salt concentration similar to the level in the single <b>systems)</b> resulted in <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> being perceived as less salty than the single system. It appears that the higher viscosity of the <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> could not be “overruled” by enhanced mixing through increased droplet phase volume at lowered salt content. Conclusions The results showed that salt reduction may be possible despite the added technology of <b>duplex</b> <b>systems</b> increasing the overall measured viscosity of the product. The changes in viscosity behavior impact mouthfeel, which may be exploitable {{in addition to the}} contribution towards salt reduction. With a view to applying this technology to real processed foods, it needs to be tested for the product in question but it should be considered as part of a salt reduction tool box. </p...|$|R
