40|$|The current {{research}} work aims to develop fibrous structures to reinforce concrete elements, {{as a substitute}} material of welded wire steel meshes. Directionally oriented fibrous structures (DOFS) have been developed. Six different DOFS were produced, varying the longitudinal and transversal reinforcement. The DOFS were used to reinforce self-compacting concrete slabs and bending tests were carried out to evaluate the mechanical performance of the textile reinforced concrete (TFiC) slabs. DOFS improve the mechanical behaviour of concrete. When subjected to bending, the six fibrous structures reinforced concrete elements produced presented similar mechanical behaviour as wire welded steel reinforced. It was concluded that either the rovings <b>linear</b> <b>mass</b> or rovings density has shown {{to have a significant}} influence on DOFS reinforced concrete load bearing capacity.

40|$|Abstract. We analyze <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> {{functions}} on simple polytopes ∆, where a <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> {{function is}} an affine function on ∆ whose {{value on the}} center of mass depends linearly on the positions of the supporting hyperplanes. On the one hand, we show that certain types of symmetries of ∆ give rise to nonconstant <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> functions on ∆. We call <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> functions which arise in this way inessential; the others are called essential. On the other hand, we show that most polytopes do not admit any nonconstant <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> functions. Further, if every affine function is <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> on ∆, then ∆ is affine equivalent to a product of simplices. Our main result is a classification of all 2 -dimensional simple polytopes and 3 -dimensional smooth polytopes which admit nonconstant <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> functions. In particular there is only one family of smooth polytopes of dimension ≤ 3 which admit essential <b>mass</b> <b>linear</b> functions. In part II, we will complete this classification in the 4 -dimensional case. These results have geometric implications. Fix a symplectic toric manifold (M,ω, T,Φ) with moment polytope ∆ = Φ(M).

In the hydrodynamics of these fireballs, we utilize the lattice QCD equation of state, however, we also apply non-relativistic kinematics for simplicity and clarity. Two new classes of exact, analytic solutions of fireball hydrodynamics are presented: {{the first class}} describes triaxially expanding, non-rotating ellipsoidal fireballs, while the second class of exact solutions corresponds to spheroidally symmetric, rotating fireballs. In both classes of solutions, we find evidence for a secondary explosion, that happens just after hadrochemical freeze-out. A realistic, <b>linear</b> <b>mass</b> scaling of the slope parameters of the single particle spectra of various hadronic species is obtained analytically, {{as well as an}} also realistic, <b>linear</b> <b>mass</b> scaling of the inverse of the squared HBT radius parameters of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions.

We use the {{presently}} observed number {{density of}} large X-ray clusters and <b>linear</b> <b>mass</b> power spectra to constrain the shape parameter (Γ), the spectral index (n), the amplitude of matter density perturbations {{on the scale}} of 8 h − 1 Mpc (σ 8), and the redshift distortion parameter (β). The non-spherical-collapse model as an improvement to the Press-Schechter formula is used and yields significantly lower σ 8 and β. An analytical formalism for the formation redshift of halos is also derived. One of the most important constraints on models of structure formation is the observed abundance of galaxy clusters. Because they are the largest virialized objects in the universe, their abundance can be simply predicted by and thus used to constrain the linear perturbation theory. In the light of the new observations and the improvement in modeling cluster evolution, we revisit this application [1], which has been extensively explored in the literature.
