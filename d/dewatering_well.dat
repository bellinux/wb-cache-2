Based on the quasi 3 D two-layered numerical model with area of 1550 km 2, groundwater flow system for premining and mining conditions using MODFLOW was constructed. Except the time of dewatering, the most important factors deciding on the range of the cone of depression are increase of effective infiltration, specific yield and storativity. These factors can’t be estimated based on the premining model, so it is necessary to use reliable data from other areas of mine operations...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of Mo. S. E. project {{for the protection of}} Venice against exceptional high tides, the development of Treporti (Lido's inlet) and Ca' Roman (Chioggia's inlet) harbours in the Venice Lagoon required the realization of two provisional sea basins, positioned below the sea level, which have been isolated with impermeable barriers and then drained with <b>dewatering</b> <b>well</b> systems to ensure their accessibility. These basins are now used to build the concrete lodging caissons of mobile barriers, and will be reopen after their installation. Two networks of piezometers (25 and 2 respectively) have been installed to monitor the impact of dewatering on the first and second aquifer levels close to the constructions sites. Hydraulic heads and groundwater electrical conductivity profiles are continuously measured. The anthropogenic impact on groundwater is determined by comparing the time series of hydraulic heads with the natural driving forces (rainfall, evapotranspiration, tidal oscillations) acting on the aquifers. After five years of monitoring activities, it has been ascertained in both sites that no depletion of the phreatic aquifer has been produced by dewatering pumping; in the confined one, instead, a depression cone is observed around the dewatered basin. The impermeable barrier isolated a portion of the phreatic aquifer, resulting in a progressive groundwater desalinization. Electrical conductivity profiles show that seawater intrusion has not been enhanced by construction work...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Ground-water monitoring is the primary method used to protect our ground-water resources. The primary objectives of monitoring programs are to detect, to attribute, and to mitigate any changes in-water quality or quantity. Previous monitoring programs have had numerous problems including the failure to produce usable information and the failure to balance the competing factors of cost-effectiveness and environmental protection. A cost-effective, environmentally-responsive ground-water procedure was designed which consists of eight steps and two feedback loops. The reason for monitoring must first be determined before clear monitoring goals can be set. Characterization of the site allows proper design of the monitoring network. Data is then collected and analyzed creating usable information. Applying this new information to the information expansion loop permits {{a better understanding of the}} initial site characterization. Finally evaluating the entire routine to determine the effectiveness of the program allows the optimization loop to modify the system for greater efficiency. The value of this procedure was tested at selected sites in the Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine in Grimes County, Texas. The mine, which is currently in compliance with state regulations, is not operating an efficient monitoring program. The problems included over-monitoring of metals in and around reclaimed mine blocks, over-monitoring by monitoring wells in the same aquifer, and the failure to attribute changes in a monitoring well near a <b>dewatering</b> <b>well.</b> The feedback loops helped to optimize the entire program by recognizing problems in the stratigraphic column and modifying the monitoring program to lower monitoring costs. Three major benefits are gained by using this procedure: the ground-water monitoring routine can be made more cost-effective, environmental protection will be increased, and environmental liability will be decreased...|$|E

This dewatering design presented some unique challenges due {{to the size of}} the pit and the climate of the region. The objective of this evaluation was to design a dewatering system for a 2. 2 square kilometer pit, with special consideration for dewatering unstable clay-rich saprolite pit slopes, in an area that receives over three meters of rain a year. Using a MODFLOW-SURFACT groundwater model, an optimized dewatering system was designed that uses a combination of permanent <b>dewatering</b> <b>wells,</b> in-pit temporary wells, and in-pit sumps.

In addition, on-going work utilizes the groundwater model to predict pit lake filling times and the steady-state interaction between the pit lake and the regional system...|$|R
40|$|Fluid flow {{characteristics}} of cleat systems in coalbed methane reservoirs are crucial in reservoir management and field development plans. This paper aims {{to evaluate the}} cleat system properties including cleat porosity, permeability, and aperture {{as well as the}} impact of permeability growth on production performance in the Bandanna Coal Formation of the Fairview Field, eastern Queensland. Owing to the presence of bad hole conditions and poor core recovery of the coal intervals, the petrophysical well logs and laboratory measurements cannot be used as a source of information for this purpose. Hence, a new approach is employed that utilises early water production data to measure water in place and absolute permeability of the coal. In addition, micro-computed tomography (CT) scan method is used to investigate the cleat system that is preserved in a core sample and results are compared with the ones obtained by analysis of production data. Cleat system evaluation by analysis of production data and micro-CT scan technique provides a comprehensive approach that brings confidence in measurements and helps to obtain cleat properties at the sufficient scale for reservoir engineering purposes. The necessary information including production data and core samples are collected from a <b>dewatering</b> <b>well</b> and the nearby observation well in the study area. Analysis of early water production data (single-phase flow) indicates that coal permeability is 189 mD and the average cleat porosity is approximately 5 %. High cleat porosity describes the large volume of water produced {{over the life of the}} study well. The 3 D model of the fossilised cleat system constructed by the micro-CT scan method reveals that coal is well-cleated and cleat spacing and mean cleat aperture are 4 and 0. 136 mm, respectively. The average cleat porosity that is measured by the micro-CT scan method is 5. 7 %, which is fairly close to the cleat porosity measured by analysis of production data. Production data analysis indicates that effective permeability to gas starts to grow at the midlife of the well and it strongly controls the shape of the production profile. The results of this study help in future field development and infill drilling programs in the Fairview Field and provide important insights into cleat system of Bandanna Coal Formation. Z.

40|$|The Continental {{porphyry}} Cu‐Mo mine, located 2 km east of {{the famous}} Berkeley Pit lake of Butte, Montana, contains two small lakes that vary in size depending on mining activity. In contrast to the acidic Berkeley Pit lake, the Continental Pit waters have near-neutral pH and relatively low metal concentrations. The main reason is geological: whereas the Berkeley Pit mined highly‐altered granite rich in pyrite with no neutralizing potential, the Continental Pit is mining weakly‐altered granite with lower pyrite concentrations and up to 1 ‐ 2 % hydrothermal calcite. The {{purpose of this study}} was to gather and interpret information that bears on the chemistry of surface water and groundwater in the active Continental Pit. Pre‐existing chemistry data from sampling of the Continental Pit were compiled from the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology and Montana Department of Environmental Quality records. In addition, in March of 2013, new water samples were collected from the mine’s main <b>dewatering</b> <b>well,</b> the Sarsfield well, and a nearby acidic seep (Pavilion Seep) and analyzed for trace metals and several stable isotopes, including dD and d 18 O of water, d 13 C of dissolved inorganic carbon, and d 34 S of dissolved sulfate. In December 2013, several soil samples were collected from the shore of the frozen pit lake and surrounding area. The soil samples were analyzed using X‐ray diffraction to determine mineral content. Based on Visual Minteq modeling, water in the Continental Pit lake is near equilibrium with a number of carbonate, sulfate, and molybdate minerals, including calcite, dolomite, rhodochrosite (MnCO 3), brochantite (CuSO 4 · 3 Cu(OH) 2), malachite (Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2), hydrozincite (Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6), gypsum, and powellite (CaMoO 4). The fact that these minerals are close to equilibrium suggests that they are present on the weathered mine walls and/or in the sediment of the surface water ponds. X‐Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis of the pond “beach” sample failed to show any discrete metal‐bearing phases. One of the soil samples collected higher in the mine, near an area of active weathering of chalcocite‐rich ore, contained over 50 % chalcanthite (CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O). This water‐soluble copper salt is easily dissolved in water, and is probably a major source of copper to the pond and underlying groundwater system. However, concentrations of copper in the latter are probably controlled by other, less‐soluble minerals, such as brochantite or malachite. Although the acidity of the Pavilion Seep is high (~ 11 meq/L), the flow is much less than the Sarsfield Well at the current time. Thus, the pH, major and minor element chemistry in the Continental Pit lakes are buffered by calcite and other carbonate minerals. For the Continental Pit waters to become acidic, the influx of acidic seepage (e. g., Pavilion Seep) would need to increase substantially over its present volume...|$|E
40|$|Chemical Fe-clogging is a {{major factor}} {{strongly}} interfering with the performance of vertical filter wells. All over the world, groundwater is pumped by means of vertical filter wells to locally dewater aquifers for mining or construction purposes or to reliably meet daily demand for drinking water. Especially considering the increase in global population, rising production of natural soil resources and rapidly increasing demand for high quality drinking water, a sustainably high performance of vertical filter wells is essential from an economic as well as ecological point of view. In this dissertation, the influence of different gravel materials and well operation concepts on the performance of open-pit dewatering wells in the Rhenish lignite mining district in Germany was assessed in an experimental laboratory approach. Special focus was laid on long-term elution and chemical Fe-clogging affinity of different filter pack materials and the distribution of chemical Fe-clogging products, when aeration of the screen pipe in a <b>dewatering</b> <b>well</b> is avoided. Long-term elution and release of different (semi-) metals from different gravel materials were evaluated with column experiments, whereas for evaluation of the affinity towards chemical Fe-clogging, a combined hydraulic and hydrochemical experimental model of a well filter section was developed and optimised. With the experimental Fe-clogging model, the relevant parameters that controlled the progression of chemical Fe-clogging were identified. The affinity towards chemical Fe-clogging of different gravel materials was evaluated in comparison to that of artificially produced glass beads. Apart from these material tests, the influence of screen pipe aeration was evaluated by application of a shortened screen pipe. For comparison, spatial distribution and temporal development of Fe(III) -precipitation was additionally calculated by a computed hydrochemical model of kinetic Fe(II) -oxidation with the hydrogeochemical modelling programme PhreeqC. Varying the input data of the computed model allowed for a sensitivity analysis of the hydrochemistry applied in the experimental model. Further comparison of type and spatial distribution of the Fe-clogging products produced in the experimental model was possible by samples taken from the gravel pack of wells in the field that had been excavated during succession of the open-pit Garzweiler. Chemical Fe-clogging in the model was found to exclusively develop in the unsaturated zone of the gravel pack and the screen pipe. In rough agreement with the hydrogeochemical PhreeqC-model, the highest Fe-clogging-intensity in the gravel pack was concentrated close to the boundary of the aquifer. This was due to unsaturated, vertical flow components {{in the vicinity of the}} material boundary. Similar distributions of the Fe-clogging zones were observed during field sampling. Intense Fe-clogging was found to be heterogeneously distributed in zones of unsaturated vertical flow that allowed mixing with the gaseous phase, as well as homogeneously distributed in zones of water level fluctuations. Fine-grained muddy or dusty plumes of Fe-precipitations on the inner surface of screen tubes in the field were found to be products of biological Fe-clogging that had been strictly excluded in the experimental model. Mineralogical analyses revealed Fe-encrustations produced in the experimental model to be of higher crystallinity than those sampled in the field. Whereas in the model goethite (α-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) were primarily formed, the percentage of ferrihydrite (Fe 5 HO 8 ∙ 4 H 2 O) was higher in the field samples. Quickly precipitated feroxyhyte (δ’-FeOOH) was found in the laboratory samples only. With the XRD-measurements a gypsum phase was identified in the field samples, presumably originating from evaporation of residual mine water in the gravel pack of the sampled wells. The, however subtle, differences in mineralogy of the Fe-precipitates in the model occurred as a result of deviations in the hydrochemistry of the process water, especially the dominating anion (chloride in the model instead of sulphate or bicarbonate in the field) and the amount of dissolved silicon. As discovered with the computed hydrogeochemical model, apart from pH and temperature, the strongest effects on the reaction rate of Fe(II) -oxidation with Fe(III) -precipitation were the amount of dissolved oxygen in the process water as well as its pH-buffering content of bicarbonate. Microscopic analyses showed the surface structure of the gravel grains to be responsible for the thickness of Fe(III) -hydroxide coatings. Especially irregularly formed monocrystalline quartz grains, weathered feldspar grains and polycrystalline quartzite grains were found to develop a higher thickness of Fe(III) -hydroxide coatings, when their surface area was uneven. All of the different gravels and filter pack materials were found to perform similarly with respect to long-term elution as well as Fe-clogging affinity. Despite initial contents of ferric iron minerals in the Quaternary gravel materials, no significant autocatalytic effect of Fe(II) -oxidation and Fe(III) -precipitation was observed. Application of the alternative Quaternary gravel materials should therefore be possible without having to expect any substantial drawbacks or disadvantages when compared to the Tertiary Weilerswist gravel. However, application of the glass bead filter pack in the model did not result in a significantly better performance with respect to Fe-clogging-affinity, when compared to the natural gravel materials. Therefore, amortisation of the high investment cost of a glass bead filter pack during the relatively short lifetime of a <b>dewatering</b> <b>well</b> is uncertain and can thus not be recommended for the dewatering wells in the Rhenish lignite district, where no regeneration methods are applied. A new concept of multi-layered dewatering through the annular space of dewatering wells was implemented in three test wells by RWE Power AG, transferring the results of the filter aeration experiments to the field scale. The vertical hydraulic conductivity of the annular space and the functionality of the concept were then tested by tracer experiments. Improved hydraulic conductivities and flow rates in the annular space – filled with gravel pack material instead of the usual filling material – were confirmed by the field experiments. The decreased Fe-clogging affinity of such wells was confirmed in the Fe-clogging model. Avoiding aeration of the screen lead to preclusion of Fe(II) -clogging, so long as the filter pack stayed fully saturated and the screen pipe submerged. Further optimisation and automatisation of model operation could allow quicker evaluation of the Fe-clogging affinity of further well assembling materials and operating concepts. A more realistic situation could be simulated when considering sulphate or bicarbonate as the dominating anions. Matters that could be investigated by application of the proposed Fe-clogging model include optimising the screen pipe material and geometry, inert gas treatment and electrochemical methods for preventing chemical Fe-clogging, optimisation of regeneration measures, biological aspects of Fe-clogging and identification of relevant air-flow pathways...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{both the}} UK and the US, low permeability, {{vertical}} barriers (slurry walls) {{are widely used}} in systems designed and constructed for the control of groundwater such as in to temporary excavations. These vertical barriers may result in more economical dewatering for larger and/or more complex underground excavation projects than <b>dewatering</b> <b>wells,</b> the conventionally used alternative. In the US, soil-bentonite slurry wall technology is the predominant method {{for the construction of}} these low permeability barriers. In contrast, slag-cement-bentonite slurry wall technology is the most widely employed me thod in the UK. These barriers are made with water, cement, and granulated ground blast furnace slag. This paper presents an examination, comparison, and assessment of each of these practices. It is concluded that slag-cement-bentonite techniques could readily be adopted by US designers and contractors. Permeability data developed in the US using US sourced ingredients are presented which show that a mixture of about 20 % cementitious material to 80 % slurry (where the cementitious material is about 25 % Portland cement and 75 % slag) results in a barrier having a hydraulic conductivity less than 1 x 10 - 7 cm/s.

Since the grouting platform was located on the mat foundation {{in the basement of}} underground parking and was under the groundwater table, a series of <b>dewatering</b> <b>wells</b> were installed before the 177 columns were constructed to prevent intrusion of the groundwater flowing upward from sandy soil to basement through grouting hole during wash boring and grouting stages from happening. Several quality control measures were undertaken prior to quality assurance testing. Two measurements of spoil return and spoil flow rate for each column were implemented. From a back analysis from the mean values of spoil density and spoil flow rate, the column diameter was estimated at around 1. 56 m, slightly smaller than the design diameter by 2. 5 %. In addition, a control chart with upper and lower control limits, established from a large dataset of flow rate of spoil return, was a means to recognize the likelihood of sand boiling and to serve as an early warning indicator of abnormal conditions for the jet grouting works below the groundwater table. As the mean spoil density of the infill column was larger than perimeter column, an optimal grouting sequence for clusters was suggested in this paper.

40|$|AbstractResidential {{areas of}} Kuwait have been {{affected}} by rising groundwater levels for many years. The main reason for this problem is the increased recharge derived from the excessive irrigation of gardens and parks, and leaks from sewage networks, where the hydraulic characteristics of the lithology {{play an important role in}} intensifying the impacts of this phenomenon at local scale. The objective of this paper is to assess the hydrological conditions of Al-Qurain residential area to identify the extent and the causes of the water rise problem. A total of 25 wells of various depths were drilled, constructed and sampled at the study area. Water level loggers installed in the drilled wells indicated that water levels are fluctuating on daily bases and increasing up to 50 cm during winter months due to the reduction of evapotranspiration and recharge from rainfall. Combining the water level records and the results of the isotopic, chemical and biological analysis, it was concluded that the top 20 m of the aquifer water is made up of mostly irrigation, waste and rain water in addition to the aquifer groundwater. It was also observed that the intruding water from lower Dammam aquifer is dominating the aquifer beneath 40 m depth. This conclusion along with the steep topography of the area explained why this area is naturally prone to water rise. The study recommended the utilization of integrated system of <b>dewatering</b> <b>wells</b> along with desalination units to lower the water level and re-utilize the groundwater.

Drilling {{of large}} {{diameter}} wells {{to be used}} for dewatering of lignite deposits is inefficient due to the presence of large packages of loose Quaternary and Tertiary strata. Moreover, considerable dewatering of the rock mass favors serious complications and drilling break-downs connected with the sliding of wellbore walls. Accordingly, new technical and technological solutions, which enable faster drilling, are searched for. In this way the time of operation of drilling mud on the near-wellbore zone can be shortened and the safety of drilling works increased. For the sake of obtaining higher rates of drilling in large diameter dewatering wellbores a new cutter bit 0. 96 m of diameter was designed. Drillability tests in industrial conditions followed. These tests were performed in separated, loose and low-compaction, macroscopically homogeneous rocks of similar drillability. The tests were performed on selected sections 0. 3 to 1. 0 m long, and each of the sections was drilled at constant rotational velocity and weight on bit. Prior to these tests there were established limitations regarding weight on bit and rotational velocity of the bit, in reference to the technical characteristic of the rig, strength of the string and the cutter bit. Two different regression models were considered to find a dependence of mechanical drilling rate on weight on bit and rotational velocity of the bit for selected macroscopically homogeneous strata. The most favorable results were obtained for a power model representing impact of axial stress and rotational velocity of the bit on the drilling rate. They have been confirmed by calculated regression coefficients and statistical parameters. Industrial tests were performed to assess the efficiency of drilling large diameter <b>dewatering</b> <b>wells</b> with a cutter bit of 0. 96 m diameter {{on the basis of the}} presented model of average drilling rate.

It was assumed that the resistance to flow caused by the dewatered bed could be {{described in terms of}} Darcy's law for laminar flow. Specific cake resistances were extremely low due to the formation of channels through the dewatered bed. Owing to the complex particle-fluid interactions in the system, both the cake resistance and the electro-osmotic coefficient had to be estimated from experimental dewatering data and could not be predicted accurately from fundamental equations. Any change in the temperature of the system was accounted for by a change in the conductivities of the slurry and the dewatered bed. The temperature profiles were not predicted, but merely simulated by empirical equations. Independent measurements showed that the conductivity of the slurry increased linearly with temperature. The conductivity of the dewatered cake decreased linearly with temperature owing to the enhanced conversion of water to steam.

Since the sludge is a highly complex colloidal system, the key factors affecting sludge dewatering and settling performance were not well understood. In this study, the dynamic variation in distribution and chemical composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), floc size distribution, charge property and settling and dewatering performance was investigated at four full scale WWTPs over 100 days. It was found that the change in EPS distribution and composition from different WWTPs showed a very similar pattern with operating time. The temperature rather than wastewater composition had more significant influence on content and chemical constituents of different EPS fractions. Additionally, more EPS was extracted from activated sludge at lower temperature (< 15 degrees C), indicating that the binding strength of EPS with microbial cells was weak.

A field trial of an ejector <b>well</b> <b>dewatering</b> system {{was carried out in}} laminated glacial lake deposits at Conwy, North Wales, in connection with the construction of the A 55 Conwy Crossing. During the trial groundwater extraction flow rates and pore water pressures were monitored. Some of the ejector wells terminated in the bedrock underlying the lake deposits: in many of these, the groundwater extraction flow rates were high and the drawdowns achieved were relatively low. Back-analysis using conventional methods modelled closely the observed response of near-by piezometers. On the other hand, wells terminating in the lake deposits yielded low groundwater extraction flow rates and vacuums at about 500 millibar developed. In this case, conventional analysis substantially overpredicted both the rate and magnitude of drawdown in the surrounding ground. The reasons for this are as yet uncertain: nonetheless, the results of the trial demonstrate clearly the influence of the hydraulic boundary conditions on the performance of a dewatering system. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. [125]. In {{the course}} of the mature gas fields {{exploitation}} there are many technical problems including the corrosion damage, formation of hydrates and water cut. In many cases, an effective solution of these problems is the dosage of appropriately selected chemicals. Commercially available corrosion inhibitors, hydrate inhibitors, demulsifiers and foaming agents are injected in a form of single, multifunctional mixture through one liner which reduces injection costs. The paper presents the results of laboratory tests, which aim was to investigate synergism and antagonism in multifunctional mixture containing different commercially available surfactants, corrosion and hydrate inhibitors. Correlations between final product composition and performances such as liquid unloading efficiency, corrosion protection and pour point were studied. The described approach allows to adapt the tertiary mixture composition (foaming agent + corrosion inhibitor + hydrates inhibitor) to the current production conditions. The polarization behavior of electrodes in brines with and without mixture of additives has been studied by a cyclic voltammetric method. The addition of increasing concentrations of each chemicals causes the reduction in the corrosion current density. The measurements using a modified method of the US Bureau of Mines show synergistic effect of surfactants and corrosion inhibitor on foamabilities. Multifunctional mixtures are stable under storage conditions and not cause any compatibility problems with reservoir fluids. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Abstract: The Yangtze River is {{the third}} longest river in the world. City groups are {{concentrated}} along the two banks of the river. This results in {{a change in the}} flow of the water transporting detritus sediment. This causes environments such as flood plains, lakes and shores to form. Typical binary-layer structural sedimentation rhythms are formed, which have an upper soft soil and lower sandy strata. Such geological structures make the geotechnical problems of deep excavation complicated in these regions. Firstly, because of the lower strength of the material powerful bracing foundation pit structures must be undertaken. Secondly, as high permeability sand, gravel and cobble layers are encountered such methods as high-pressure spinning and spraying, grouting with pressure, deep mixing to shape curtain for cutting off water along all sides of foundation pit are needed. Deep <b>well</b> <b>dewatering</b> methods are used to lower water and control underground water by decompression dewatering or depletion dewatering when there is confined water in a foundation pit. The deformation of a deep excavation within these areas are caused by the unloading and plastic deformation of soil mass, piping and seepage failure, dewatering. This causes lateral displacement, base heave and subsidence, even collapse and environmental impact.

40|$|Generally, sludge {{conditioned}} with inorganic coagulants exhibits rigid {{structure and}} {{is suitable for}} high pressure dewatering process. Sludge flocs possess multilayered structure, and the sludge dewaterability is mainly dependent on the properties of soluble extracellular polymeric substances (SEPS). However, few {{studies have focused on}} influence of chemical conditioning on the characteristics of SEPS. In this study, the surplus sludge obtained from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was conditioned with two inorganic polymer flocculants (IPFs), PACl and HPAC, for improving the sludge dewaterability which was measured using specific resistance to filtration (SRF). Meanwhile, the variation in SEPS properties was investigated with combined high performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPESC) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM). According to the experimental results, HPAC showed better performance in improving sludge dewaterability due to higher charge density and better bridging properties. EEM coupled to fluorescence region integration (FRI) demonstrated that protein-like substances were dominant fraction of soluble EPS. HPSEC analysis indicated that most of the SEPS with high molecular weight (> 2000 Da) were effectively removed from aqueous phase after conditioning, they might play more important roles in sludge <b>dewatering.</b> SRF correlated <b>well</b> with zeta potential, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and EPS content located in all four EEM regions under chemical conditioning. This result revealed that EEM in conjunction with FRI was an attractive way to evaluate the sludge conditioning efficiency of IPFs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Salinity is a {{major problem}} {{throughout}} the world. The present work was carried out on seventy samples collected from Zian and Qalabshu. Analysis carried out of selected ten drainage and four subsoil water samples represent the water resources of the study area. Aim of the present work was to suggest the best and scientific method of utilization and conservation of soil and water for the future development in the area. The results showed that, samples of El-Nil canal fall in high saline water class. Though such water is permissible for irrigation but may cause a harmful effect on crops. It may be suitable for plants of moderate tolerance. Samples of El-Sokar factory canal at the front of factory gate, rejection area of drain- 2 -station and suction area of drain- 2 station, El-Gamaiat canal and subsoil- 1 fall in very high saline class which is of doubtful quality for irrigation. Samples of El-Sokar factory canal 1 km away from factory gate, immersed area by water, El-Moheet drain and subsoil samples fall in the excessive saline water class which is of unsuitable quality for irrigation. The depth to water in the area ranges between 75 cm and 175 cm. The closeness of the subsoil water to the ground surface is harmful to the crop yield in the agricultural areas. To avoid the serious problem of salinity, the subsoil water has to be lowered either horizontally by relatively deep surface drains or vertically <b>dewatering</b> from the <b>wells...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} absorption refrigeration (DAR) {{cycle is}} a promising technology for fully thermally driven cooling. It {{is well suited}} to applications in medicine refrigeration and air-conditioning in off-grid settings. However, design and engineering knowhow for the technology is limited; therefore, system development has historically been an iterative and expensive process. Additionally, conventional system designs require high-grade energy input for operation, and are unsuitable for low-temperature solar- or waste-heat activated applications. In the present effort, component- and system-level DAR engineering analyses are performed. Detailed bubble-pump generator (BPG) component models are developed, and are validated experimentally and with direct simulations. Investigations into the BPG focus on the Taylor flow pattern in the intermediate Bond number regime, which {{has not yet been}} thoroughly characterized in the literature, and has numerous industry applications, including nuclear fuel processing and <b>well</b> <b>dewatering.</b> A coupling-fluid heated BPG design is also investigated experimentally for low-source-temperature operation. Phase-change simulation methodologies are developed to rigorously study the continuously developing flow pattern in this BPG configuration. Detailed component-level models are also formulated for all of the other DAR heat and mass exchangers, and are integrated to yield a complete system-level model. Results from these modeling studies are applied to develop a novel fully passive low-source-temperature (110 - 130 °C) DAR system that delivers refrigeration grade cooling. This design achieves operation at target conditions through the use of alternate working fluids (NH 3 -NaSCN-He), the coupling-fluid heated BPG, and a novel absorber configuration. The complete DAR system is demonstrated experimentally, and evaluated over a range of operating conditions. Experimental results are applied to assess and refine component- and system- level models.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Successful {{dewatering}} and filtration of {{coal fines}} remain the major obstacles in preventing the extensive re-use of large reserves of high calorific quality coal fines {{as an additional}} energy source in South Africa. The high levels of final moisture in coal fines make it uneconomical to transport, handle and use. The industry is rapidly reaching the limit of current technology of mechanical dewatering; this limit is defined by fundamental coal properties, like amongst others, particle size, porosity and mineral content. This thesis describes research investigating a shift in approach from high vacuum or pressure systems, to high air flow systems. Results from various projects at laboratory scale showed {{that it was possible}} to decrease the fine coal filter cake moisture to as low as 15 %. This was obtained by allowing air to flow freely through a filter cake, even at ambient temperatures, and replacing the necessity for high applied vacuum levels. There was also an increase in the <b>dewatering</b> rate, as <b>well</b> as a lower breakthrough pressure. Such an approach can utilise existing equipment with minor modifications. Other investigations showed that forced air-drying, both at ambient and elevated temperatures, could be used to overcome this mechanical limit. Again, an increased air flow rate at ambient pressure was used. Using air drying, moisture levels down to zero were possible. These investigations led to the conclusion that increased air flow through a fine coal cake was more advantageous than an increase in the applied vacuum, or a longer dewatering time. This new approach to lowering the final moisture content in coal fines is crucial in any advancement of the use of this largely untapped energy source. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Mine {{dewatering}} is {{a critical}} part of the mining process to prevent flooding of underground or open pits, to allow for the excavation of the available resources. Groundwater is abstracted from underground pits to the surface through extraction bores. The issue of where to discharge the excess water is a major concern. The use of natural wetlands is one option for mine water discharge. Saline lakes in arid areas are ideal receiving environments for discharge options, acting as evaporation facilities for the storage and disposal of excess mine water. Mine water discharge into ephemeral lake systems modifies the volume of water in the lake on an annual basis; parts of the wetland are thus subjected to prolonged inundation. An experiment was carried out to determine whether the biotic composition was altered accordingly to the degree of seasonal inundation by mine <b>dewatering,</b> as <b>well</b> as whether the salinity of the discharge water affects the composition and assemblage of biota emerging from lake sediment. Sediments from two lakes: Lake Austin and Lake Wownaminya, located within arid regions of Central Western Australia, were sampled to determine which invertebrates responded to dewatering regimes and to investigate the nature of biofilm. Laboratory experiments were carried out to test I he emergence of invertebrates from sediments as they responded to mimicked dewatering regimes under controlled laboratory conditions. Two hypotheses were tested. The first hypothesis tested states that the biotic composition emerging from sediments will be the same irrespective of the salinities of the mine water discharge. The second hypothesis states that there is no difference in the biotic composition (biofilm and aquatic invertebrates) in accordance to the whether or not the sediments have been previously exposed to prolonged inundation. The responses of emerging invertebrates were monitored and recorded over a four week period. The results obtained indicated that changes do occur in the assemblages and composition of the aquatic biota in accordance with the salinity of the mine water discharge. Areas that are exposed to a longer period of inundation also showed altered biotic compositions compared to areas with less frequent inundation due to mine dewatering. Statical analysis (MANN - Whitney test and ANOV A) and tho use of configuration diagrams (Dendrograms and MDS plots) were used to determine the interaction between mine water discharge and species composition. It was concluded that salinity is a major factor clearly influencing the occurrence of species in the lakes. The timing and the period of inundation is a factor that has also lead to altered compositions of species at Lake Wownaminya. Dewatering operations alter the composition and species richness in the receiving wetland environments causing some concern of the overall impacts on these lakes. Altered characteristics of wetland hydrology can be detrimental to the endemism of crustacean or molluscan forms that only occur within saline lake systems, and may lead to the extinction of local forms...|$|R
40|$|The {{south-west}} Grampian Highlands, {{as defined}} here, include the Inner Hebridean islands of Islay and Jura, and extend north-east {{as far as}} Dalmally at {{the northern tip of}} Loch Awe. Due to a favourable combination of excellent coastal exposures and low tectonic strain, the late-Neoproterozoic rocks of the Dalradian Supergroup in this region are ideal for studying sedimentary structures. In addition, the diversity in protolith lithology from carbonate rocks to siliciclastic rocks of all grain sizes and volcanic rocks makes it possible to establish a very detailed lithostratigraphical succession and to recognize lateral facies changes. The stratigraphical range extends {{from the base of the}} Appin Group to the base of the Southern Highland Group and the area provides type localities for many regionally extensive formations of the Argyll Group. Rocks forming part of the basement to the Dalradian basins, the Rhinns Complex, are seen on Islay, where they are overlain by the Colonsay Group, a thick metasedimentary siliciclastic sequence of uncertain stratigraphical affinity. The structure of the Dalradian rocks in the south-west Grampian Highlands is controlled by early (D 1) major folds (Islay Anticline, Loch Awe Syncline, and Ardrishaig Anticline), associated with a ubiquitous, penetrative, slaty or spaced cleavage. Most of the Dalradian rocks have been regionally metamorphosed under greenschist-facies conditions and amphibolite-facies (garnet zone) assemblages occur only in a narrow central zone, strongly affected by the D 2 deformation. The area provides GCR sites of international importance for studying Neoproterozoic glacial deposits, splendidly preserved stromatolite bioherms and calcite pseudomorphs after gypsum. Deformed and undeformed sandstone dykes and interstratal <b>dewatering</b> structures are <b>well</b> displayed at several sites. Other features include thick sills of basic meta-igneous rock with unusual minerals such as stilpnomelane, and greenschist-facies rocks containing regional metamorphic kyanite. The area is of historical interest for the first recognition in Scotland, prior to 1910, of sedimentary way-up structures and pillow lavas in regionally deformed and metamorphosed rocks. ...|$|R
