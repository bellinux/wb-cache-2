5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly {{earned him a}} {{reputation}} in science fiction circles, although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> only have received a few fans' letters {{a year in the}} pre-internet days. The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main Ice and Fire fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> work with his intellectual equals.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton {{thought it was a good}} idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Professor Ümit Sayın {{summed up}} {{the effect of the}} BAV's {{campaign}} when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> The Pitch:In 1998, I was able to motivate six members of the Turkish Academy of Sciences to speak out against the creationist movement.

25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E
25|$|During Ajaan Mun's life, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Ajaan Lee that Ajaan Lee {{would have}} to write down and codify {{the teachings of the}} forest tradition. Later in Ajaan Lee's career, he wrote several books which {{recorded}} the doctrinal positions of the forest tradition, and explained broader Buddhist concepts in the Forest Tradition's terms. Ajaan Lee emphasized his metaphor of Buddhist practice as a skill, and reintroduced the Buddha's idea of skillfullness — acting in ways that emerge from having trained the mind and heart.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the tenth}} issue of his {{periodical}} The Moment could be published, Kierkegaard {{collapsed on the}} street. He stayed {{in the hospital for}} over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he did not think it so.|$|E

When the con man repeats the same words to Henry that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> the music teacher, he is exposed as a fraud; the teacher thanks Henry by giving Punky several free lessons.|$|E

25|$|While {{recording}} {{his second}} solo album after collaborating on Le Petit Prince, Sébastien attended an audition for the musical The Sun King. While waiting, he met Geraldine Larrosa, (Innocence) and her then-partner Carlos Marín, {{who spoke to}} him after hearing Sébastien sing in online videos. Carlos said it was worth a try, so Sébastien went to the Bastille in Paris, where the auditions were being held by Sonny Takhar.

25|$|Horthy clearly saw {{his country}} as trapped between two {{stronger}} powers, {{both of them}} dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could — not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide yearning to recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance. The {{means by which the}} regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged. Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one – largely due, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> his unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.|$|E
