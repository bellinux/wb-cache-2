5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E

500|$|Trump further {{increased}} speculation of {{a full-scale}} campaign when his publisher Renaissance Books announced a January 2000 release date for The America We Deserve. [...] The publisher's press release announced a book tour and teased, [...] "Donald Trump for President? Run or not, Donald Trump's ideas {{will have a}} major impact on the next presidential election." [...] Trump set January also as the month on which he would decide whether to run. [...] He expressed, [...] "I’m not interested in being the [...] candidate who gets the most votes in the history of the world outside of the Democratic and Republican parties, I would only consider this <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I could win." [...] On September 30, Trump wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled, [...] "America Needs a President Like Me" [...] in which he argued that he would be [...] "the kind of president America needs in the new millennium." [...] He cited the [...] "repugnant" [...] comments of Buchanan and Ventura's personal encouragement as factors contributing to his decision. [...] In an October 6 interview on Dateline NBC, Trump affirmed that he was [...] "very serious" [...] about his run.|$|E

You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Stefanakis {{the lyrics}} {{in the chorus}} about being In {{the middle of a}} dream relate to two main ideas: [...] "I'm dreaming <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> my friends would rush to my defence ... he has been betrayed by those he felt would be loyal..." [...] and [...] "Reality check. Let down by chick? Double whammy. Let down by friends".

Oh, it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world." [...] In a {{discussion}} with Donohue on CBS's Early Show, Ellen Johnson, president of American Atheists, said that rather than promote atheism, the film would encourage children to question authority, saying {{that would not be}} a bad thing for children to learn. Director Weitz says that he believes His Dark Materials is [...] "not an atheistic work, but a highly spiritual and reverent piece of writing," [...] and Nicole Kidman defended her decision to star in the film, saying that [...] "I wouldn't {{be able to do this}} film <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it were at all anti-Catholic." ...|$|E

2500|$|A guitar-dominated album, its {{musical styles}} range from thrash, art pop and power pop to {{psychedelic}} folk featuring acoustic guitar. Pitchfork described Red Barked Tree as a [...] "shrewdly sequenced album", a necessity {{arising from the}} variety of different styles represented on it: [...] "its 11 songs {{are more or less}} positioned along a logical arc, where a sense of ominous unease gives way to violent release before simmering into a peaceful comedown". Grey stated in an interview with The Quietus, [...] "I was asked to propose a track sequence for the album, and I found it difficult initially. Then I realised that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of the tracks as a series of scenes in a play or a film, it made it easier. I like the idea of the tracks telling a story: the story was the album from beginning to end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under the Arras {{agreement}} {{the southern}} states of the Spanish Netherlands, today in Belgium and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais (and Picardy) régions in France, expressed their loyalty to the Spanish king Philip II and recognized his Governor-General, Don Juan of Austria. In 1580, this gave King Philip the opportunity to strengthen his position when the last member of the Portuguese royal family, Cardinal Henry of Portugal, died. Philip asserted his claim to the Portuguese throne and in June sent the Duke of Alba with an army to Lisbon to assure his succession. Though the Duke of Alba and the Spanish occupation were little more popular in Lisbon than in Rotterdam, the combined Spanish and Portuguese empires placed into Philip's hands almost {{the entirety of the}} explored New World along with a vast trading empire in Africa and Asia. In 1582, when Philip II moved his court back to Madrid from the Atlantic port of Lisbon, where he had temporarily settled to pacify his new Portuguese kingdom, the pattern was sealed, in spite of what every observant commentator privately noted: [...] "Sea power is more important to the ruler of Spain than any other prince", wrote one commentator, [...] "for it is only by sea power that a single community can be created out of so many so far apart." [...] A writer on tactics in 1638 observed, [...] "The might most suited to the arms of Spain is that which is placed on the seas, but this matter of state is so well known that I should not discuss it, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it opportune to do so." [...] Portugal and her kingdoms including Brazil and her African colonies were under the dominion of the Spanish monarch.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
