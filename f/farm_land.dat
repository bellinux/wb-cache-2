40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on discourses and {{representations}} of open spaces and particularly <b>farming</b> <b>lands</b> at the urban-rural interface. Two case studies of municipal land management in French periurban areas analyze these discourses and their translation in terms of land use ; they rely more on an opposition between rurality and urbanity (in its spatial but also social meaning) than on a representation of rural areas as farming areas. Considering farmers as landowners, the municipal land management policy favoured dispersed urbanisation and compromised the persistence of small farms. Urban proximity amplified discourses on <b>farm</b> <b>lands,</b> but the periurban context didn?t translate in a differentiate model of farming. The inclusion of <b>farm</b> <b>lands</b> in urban management allowed to control and qualify urban dwelling. actor, <b>farming,</b> <b>land</b> management, periurban area, rurality...|$|R
5|$|M-156 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. The highway is entirely within Lenawee County and begins in Morenci at the Ohio state line with State Route108 (SR108) and runs north to M-34 at Clayton. The highway runs through <b>farm</b> <b>land</b> along Lime Creek outside of the two communities, providing access to the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area.

The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn. M-125 (Summit Street) north of town. That unsigned connector is a state highway that links M-125 with I-75 to the south. Continuing north, M-125 intersects Luna Pier Road, which to the west is the unsigned Conn.

This area is {{the western edge of}} Saginaw's suburbs. Along the road towards Freeland, there are periodic small farms in between small residential subdivisions. In the community of Freeland, M-47 runs near the MBS International Airport off Freeland Road. North of town, M-47 leaves Midland Road and becomes a freeway near Tittabawassee Park.

5|$|Seattle {{was one of}} {{the major}} cities that benefited from {{programs}} such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA. The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern <b>farm</b> <b>land</b> faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing people into town.|$|E

There are a few businesses adjacent to the interchange and an intersection with State Road, which provides access to another partial interchange with US127 as well as the Bus. US127 for St. Louis. Continuing westward along Lincoln Road, the landscape along the southern leg of Bus. US127 comprises <b>farm</b> <b>land.</b> Once the highway enters Alma, the street name changes to Superior Street. Bus. US127 crosses the Pine River and runs through residential neighborhoods on the eastern side of Alma before entering the downtown area. At an intersection with Wright Avenue to the east of the campus of Alma College, Bus. US127 turns northward. North of downtown, the business loop crosses another residential area before passed the hospital and more commercial properties. In Pine River Township north of the city, Bus. US127 intersects M-46 (Monroe Road). M-46 connects the Alm{{a business}} loop to the St. Louis business loop and a partial interchange with US127, while the Alma business loop continues less than half a mile (0.6km) to the partial interchange with US127 that serves as the business loop's northern terminus.|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality <b>farm</b> <b>land</b> in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
5|$|M-82 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with M-120 and B-96 west of Fremont. This junction is at a tripoint of county lines. M-120 forms the north–south Newaygo–Oceana and Newaygo–Muskegon county lines. B-96, which forms the east–west Oceana–Muskegon county line runs due {{west of the}} intersection. M-82 exits the intersection to the east. The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of Fremont. The road, now called Main Street, passes through the downtown area and M-82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town. The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more <b>farm</b> <b>land.</b> As the trunkline approaches Newaygo, the terrain becomes more wooded near the Muskegon River. M-82 follows Fremont Street east to a junction with M-37. The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street. South of downtown, M-82 turns east again, independent of M-37, and runs along 82nd Street on {{the southern edge of}} the Manistee National Forest. The east end of M-82 is at exit118 on US131/M-46 west of Howard City.|$|E

In 1642, its ownership passed on to Hans Detterman Cronman (c.1600-c.1645). In 1753, it was purchased by the Stackelbergs and inherited by the Nolckens in 1870. Baron Arved George de Nolcken (1845–1909) rebuilt the castle between 1876–1885 according to his own designs, in the Scottish baronial style, designed as a smaller version of Queen Victoria's Balmoral Castle in Scotland, which he had visited in 1875.
