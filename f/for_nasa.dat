Mejdal studied sleep patterns of astronauts on the International Space Station in order to optimize their sleep schedules.|$|E

At this point, Lunney became Vice President and Program Manager of the United Space Alliance's spaceflight operations in Houston; he stayed in this position until his retirement in 1999.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1994, NASA {{declared}} the mission a complete success {{and showed the}} first sharper images.

5|$|The {{continued}} {{exploration of}} Saturn {{is still considered}} to be a viable option <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions.

5|$|The project {{also served}} as a {{political}} ruse {{on the part of the}} American government, providing a diplomatic channel <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> to take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly fledged Russian government to keep Mir operating, in addition to the Russian space program as a whole, ensuring the Russian government remained (and remains) friendly towards the United States.|$|E
5|$|Thomas David Jones was {{a member}} of the United States Air Force prior to working <b>for</b> <b>NASA.</b> As Jones was a United States federal {{employee}} at the time of the book's publication, he did not receive profits from sales of the work. English and Jones later produced another collaborative work, Scholastic Encyclopedia of the United States at War, which was published in 1998. Jones wrote another book about his experiences in space, Sky Walking: An Astronaut's Memoir, which was published in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Carlos I. Noriega– NASA {{astronaut}}— USMC: Born in Peru, Noriega is a NASA employee, {{a former}} NASA astronaut and a retired U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel. Noriega flew on STS-84 in 1997 and STS-97 in 2000. He logged over 461 hours in space, including over 19 EVA hours in three space walks. Following STS-97, Noriega trained as the backup commander for IIS Expedition 6 {{and later as}} a member of the crew of STS-121. In January 2005, Noriega retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps, but continued working <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> as the manager, Advanced Projects Office, Constellation Program, Johnson Space Center.|$|E

5|$|Deeply {{involved}} {{in the investigation of}} the 1967 Apollo 1 fire, Shea suffered a nervous breakdown {{as a result of the}} stress that he suffered. He was removed from his position and left NASA shortly afterwards. From 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts, and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. While Shea served as a consultant <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> on the redesign of the International Space Station in 1993, he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle <b>for</b> <b>NASA.</b> Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
5|$|SIM Lite was {{originally}} proposed for a 2005 launch, aboard an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). As {{a result of}} continued budget cuts, the launch date was pushed back at least five times. NASA had set a preliminary launch date for 2015. As of February 2007, many of the engineers working on the SIM program had {{moved on to other}} areas and projects, and NASA directed the project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction. However, the preliminary budget <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> for 2008 included zero dollars for SIM.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
5|$|Big Gemini, or Big G, {{grew out}} of a 1963 {{proposal}} called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets. It was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space, {{and to be able to}} dock with space stations, in support of Apollo Applications and MOL missions. It would have been launched by a Heavy lift launch vehicle; either a Titan IIIG or Saturn INT-20, the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended <b>for</b> <b>NASA</b> missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply MOL space stations later in the program. NASA also proposed several Saturn IB derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to the INT-20, offering similar payload capacity.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions <b>for</b> <b>NASA.</b> After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E
