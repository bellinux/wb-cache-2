500|$|A smaller team reconvened {{during the}} morning of February 3, as Biller was {{preparing}} for work on the episode [...] "One", while Menosky was completing the script for [...] "Living Witness". There were general concerns about {{the pace of the}} episode being slowed by an exploration of the new ship and the budget that such scenes would require. It was suggested that if the episode had a single guest star that this cost could be offset. Menosky and Biller joined the group after lunch, with the duo agreeing that the alien's ruse was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> instead suggesting that the episode should be played [...] "straight" [...] with the main drama focused around the Janeway/Seven conflict. Braga took the work on the episode away, in order to work on it overnight. He later said that this was the first [...] "wall" [...] the writers had hit all season. In the early hours of February 4, Braga worked out how to fit everything together by having the episode become a retrospection of the entire season and called Menosky during the night to discuss it. The following day, Braga sent a beat-sheet crediting himself, Berman and Menosky as writers to the department heads on the show. This set the episode out in five acts, which appeared very similar to those in the final version. February 17 saw the delivery of a 68-page teleplay to production staff. The episode received the title [...] "Hope and Fear", and the alien vessel was named Dauntless. This name had originated from a conversation between Berman and Braga from over a year earlier, and it had been kept by Braga for a future purpose.|$|E

5000|$|He {{argued that}} {{the billions of dollars}} of credit default swap (CDS) {{protection}} MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> He also argued that it was not proper for MBIA, which was legally restricted from trading in CDS, to instead do it through a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an [...] "orphaned subsidiary". Ackman bought CDS against MBIA corporate debt as a way to bet that it would crash. When MBIA did, in fact, crash as the financial crisis of 2008 came to a head, he sold the swaps for a large profit. Ackman reportedly attempted to warn regulators, rating agencies and investors about the bond insurers' high risk business models. The story of Ackman's battle with MBIA was turned into a book called Confidence Game (Wiley, 2010) by Bloomberg News reporter Christine Richard. He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009 according to the 13D filed with the SEC.|$|E

The stage manager asked if it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for us, but we both said no. It was like everybody’s arm was around us. It was absolutely incredible, there was not a sound. It was like everyone was holding their breath. In a way, we were all doing it together.
