40|$|The United States and the Soviet Union {{recently}} signed a treaty that eliminates an entire class of nuclear arms, and allows more <b>intrusive</b> <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> than ever before. As technology improves and verification {{becomes even more}} central in arms control negotiations, Professor Koplow warns that the United States Constitution limits the types of <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> to which the United States can agree. After reviewing existing United States-Soviet Union arms control treaties and agreements, Professor Koplow examines potential <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> {{in light of the}} fourth amendment 2 ̆ 7 s protection of United States citizens from government intrusion. He argues that although many contemplated <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> could be implemented in this country, there are some that would not pass constitutional muster; some could be implemented only with a warrant of some kind, others could not be implemented at all. Professor Koplow concludes that the time is ripe for the United States to rethink its attitude toward verification of arms control agreements and to use the fourth amendment to guide and shape future negotiations and <b>verification</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

30|$|Hearing {{instrument}} verification involves {{measuring the}} performance of modulation-based noise reduction systems. The article proposes a systematic <b>procedure</b> for their <b>verification.</b> The <b>procedure</b> {{has the potential for}} application in the verification of other signal processing systems, because it is independent of the hearing instrument domain. Its key concept, the separation of abstract and concrete design of test signals, has been adopted from the embedded systems domain. Specifically for modulation-based noise reduction systems in hearing instruments, the article shows a complete implementation of the <b>verification</b> <b>procedure,</b> proposing improvements of existing measurement techniques. To fully cover the <b>verification</b> <b>procedure,</b> a new measurement approach based on maximum length sequences and DFT processing is introduced, revisiting concepts of system identification that came up in the 1970 s. These can easily be used with the computational resources of today's microcomputers. Sample measurements with existing hearing instruments demonstrate the <b>verification</b> <b>procedure</b> with different measurement techniques.|$|R

30|$|In {{the context}} of the Finite Element Method, <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> have been {{introduced}} since the late 1970 s [60 – 62]. They enable a posteriori discretization error estimates to be computed and mesh adaptivity to be driven. In this work, a <b>verification</b> <b>procedure</b> based on the concept of constitutive relation error (CRE) [61] is implemented. It leads to robust error estimates for both linear and nonlinear time-dependent problems [63 – 66]. The CRE concept, which is particularly suited to Computational Mechanics models, is based on duality and rests on a simple idea, namely, after constructing so-called admissible fields satisfying all equations of the model except (part of) the constitutive law, the residual associated with the constitutive relationship is evaluated.|$|R
