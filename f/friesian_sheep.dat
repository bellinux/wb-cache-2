In all the three sheep breeds, while the difference between the first and last lactation months was of exceptionally high significance. The average protein content in the milk yielded by the East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep</b> and crossbreeds is very similar and amounts to 5. 32 % and 5. 37 %, while in the Svrljig Pramenka it was 5. 53 %. Based on the statistical significance appraisal of the differences in mean values of protein content in each stated breeds for the whole lactation period a highly significant difference between the Svrljig Pramenka and East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep</b> (p 0. 05). The crossing of the stated breeds {{had an impact on the}} increase in the total yield of milk protein in the hallfbreeds (5948. 72 g), which is an increase of 1755. 36 g compared with that in the Svrljig Pramenka, and a decrease of only 237. 36 g in relation to that in the East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep</b> breed.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} breeds of sheep, used for the milk production in Croatia, are the sheep from Pag, Brač, Cres, Istrian and Travnik΄s sheep, different crossbreeds and, recently, East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep.</b> The {{aim of the research}} was to determine the genotype effect on lactation period, milk yield and protein and fat content, which are important in cheese making. The longest lactation period (213 days) had East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep,</b> while the highest total milk production (294 kg) and the highest production of milk fat (13. 38 kg) and proteins (11. 88 kg) had crossbreeds (Cres sheep x East Friesian x Awassi). However, the highest content of milk fat (8. 12 and 7. 81 %) and proteins (6. 36 and 6. 26 %) were established in Istrian and Pag sheep milk. The longest milking period (145 days) and the shortest suckling period (28 days) was found in Pag sheep, while the longest suckling period was found in Istra (78 days) and East Friesian (74 days) sheep. The least milk in suckling period (17. 46 kg or 13. 38 %) was sucked by lambs of Pag sheep, and the most by East Friesian (111. 18 kg or 39. 39 %) and Istra sheep lambs (94. 3 kg or 42. 95 %) ...|$|E
40|$|East <b>Friesian</b> dairy <b>sheep</b> {{are on the}} {{one hand}} loners and individualists. In practice, however, it has become {{increasingly}} common to keep animals of this breed in larger herds too. The social behaviour was examined as well as the marching and milking order of three herds with 24, 35 and 39 lactating ewes. In all three herds a marked social ranking could be proven. The social rank was correlated with both the age and the weight of the animal. A significant relationship was found in two of the three herds between rank and milk yield. As well as this, it was proven that East <b>Friesian</b> dairy <b>sheep</b> have quite a marked marching and milking order. Each animal constantly takes on more-or-less the same position in the order. The close bond of this breed with human beings seems to be a result of intensive contact with the animals.

The study was conducted during 2004 and 2005 years on a 100 sheep sample. The milk samples were taken during morning and evening milking after weaning, every 30 days during lactation. The physical-chemical properties and the hygienic quality of milk were determined by reference and standard methods. The collected data were statistically analysed by the PROC ANOVA, SAS programme. The East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep</b> in the lactation of 217 days, produced in average 1040 mL milk/day. A significant effect (P < 0, 001) of the herd was determined on the daily milk yield, dry matter non fat, freezing point, protein content (P < 0, 01) and pH value (P < 0, 01). The stage of lactation had a significant effect (P < 0, 001) on all analyzed parameters except on somatic cell count. The highest content of fat (6. 53 %), proteins (5. 44 %), dry matter (17. 45 %) and dry matter non fat (10. 98 %) were determined at the end of lactation, while the content of lactose (4. 61 %) was the lowest.

40|$|Though East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep</b> {{are known}} to have very high milk yield, their various degree crosses may have {{different}} levels of milk yield under different conditions due to genotype × environment interaction. The major {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether increasing milking frequency for a short period (21 days) increases milk yield in two East Friesian crosses, Tahirova and Sonmez sheep. Tahirova is 75 % East Friesian and 25 % Kivircik, while Sonmez is 75 % Tahirova and 25 % Sakiz (Chios). Two milking groups were formed and were treated the same in terms of feeding and management. The sheep in the 4 × group were milked 4 times a day after weaning for a short period, namely 21 days and then were milked twice a day for the rest of the lactation. The sheep in the 2 × group were milked twice a day throughout the whole milking season. Repeated measures analyses indicated that overall differences between the 2 × (520. 68 g) and 4 × (873. 03 g) groups were highly significant for milk yield (P < 0. 01). Parity differences were significant in the treatment group and the 3 rd lactation animals responded better to the 4 × treatment (P < 0. 01), but they were non-significantly different than the 2 nd lactation animals in the 2 × group. Sheep in the 4 × group had higher milk fat yield (P = 0. 02) but the groups were similar in terms of fat percentage (P = 0. 11). Differences between the breeds were highly significant (P < 0. 01) also. Tahirova breed, which has a higher percentage of East Friesian had a daily milk yield of 566. 66 g, while Sonmez breed with a lower percentage of East Friesian produced a higher daily milk yield of 827. 05 g. Results of this study suggests that increasing milking frequency for a short time increases milk yield throughout lactation, especially for older animals, and sheep with too high East Friesian breeding may have lower milk yield than those with lower East Friesian breeding...|$|E
40|$|In my bachelor's thesis I give an {{overview}} of sheep farming and grazing using sheepdogs. In the first part, I focus on rearing sheep [...] especially {{on the characteristics of}} types and breeds reared for profit, on nutrition, housing and grazing. In the second part, I focus on rearing sheepdogs, especially on their characteristics and selected breeds, choice of pups, upbringing, care, and problem behaviour. I have tried to point out the differences in temperament and type of sheepdogs compared with regularly reared dog breeds. Sheep farming has a long tradition in the Czech Republic and remains an important sector of livestock production. The importance of sheep farming lies mainly in the versatile usableness of sheep (meat, milk, wool and by-products, e. g. manure) and, in the recent years, also in ecological farming. Sheep are being reared in sheepfolds or adapted buildings. Sheep are typical grazing animals. There are various grazing systems: set stocking, paddock grazing, strip grazing, and grazing of sheep in combination with other farm animals. To feed sheep, we usually either let them graze or [...] in the winter [...] feed them hay; alternatively we use sillage, high-energy feeds or root crops. There are a large number of breeds of sheep used for grazing. Based on their purpose, we distinguish combined breeds (e. g. Merino, Merinolandschaf, Tsigai), meat- (e. g. Suffolk, Charollais, Texel) and milk-breeds (e. g. East <b>Friesian</b> <b>sheep),</b> and prolific breeds (e. g. Romanov sheep). Both pure breeding and crossbreeding are being used. Together with the return to sheep grazing, breeders are increasingly using sheepdogs for the protection of their herds. A sheepdog can independently guard a herd and its constant presence deters predators, stray dogs and thieves. Sheepdogs live with herds on pastures. The breeds used include Bernese Mountain Dog, Caucasian, Anatolian Shepherd Dog and Central Asian Shepherd Dog. These dogs are strong and massive, confident, and fearless even when facing large predators. These breeds have no tests of performance so we choose pups from litters where the parents work and use their instincts on a daily basis. These dogs have genetic dispositions for guarding and only need time for the development of their skills. Training sheepdogs is therefore focused primarily on managing unwanted behaviour and upbringing near herds of sheep so that the dog can form a strong bond with sheep...|$|E

The study was conducted at Harrismith and Kestell and in Qwa-Qwa from March 2000 to May 2001. Cattle of various breeds (including Bonsmara, Simmentaler and <b>Friesian),</b> Merino <b>sheep</b> and Angora goats were sampled. Faecal samples were analysed using the McMaster and Visser sieve techniques for egg counts and faecal cultures for 3 rd-stage nematode larvae identification. Haemonchus and Oesophagostomum were the dominant nematode genera found to be infecting the animals. The socioeconomic status of the farmers in the study area was determined through a questionnaire survey aimed at recording their management strategies. It indicated that 81 % of farmers take care of their livestock by feeding them with supplements. The low to moderate faecal egg counts from cattle showed that helminth infections in this region are still under control even though helminthosis seems to be a problem in small-stock, since EPG counts of more than &gt; 1000 were found. Cattle farmers in this region are encouraged to continue with good animal husbandry practices that have ensured that helminth infections rates are kept low.

40|$|New Zealand sheep fanning {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} over the past 20 years as it has adjusted to a market-led and unsubsidised economy. Despite this, new technology and management practices such as cross breeding offer exciting opportunities for improving sheep industry profitability. The introduction of new genetic material into the sheep flock can provide benefits through improved productivity and product attributes {{but it may also}} have negative consequences for industry growth if used incorrectly. The advantages of introducing a new sheep breed to a farm are usually widely published but not necessarily well researched. The East Friesian (EF) was made available to farmers in autumn 1996. It has a reputation for being highly fertile, a good milk producer and heavy-weight-lamb producer. However, no research has been published on how to develop a profitable management strategy for adopting EF's onto a hill country property. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that the EF would improve the productivity and profitability of a lower North Island hill country farm. A case farm analysis using the STOCKPOL farm simulation model was used to compare the productivity and profitability of the current Romney (Rn x Rn) flock with either an East Friesian (EF) x Rn crossbred flock or a purebred EF x EF flock. The STOCKPOL model was calibrated to simulate the existing sheep and beef cattle policy for the 324 ha hill country farm, Tuapaka. Pasture growth rate data were adjusted to sustain the reordered levels of animal production and establish a basis against which the EF x Rn and EF x EF flocks could be compared. The cattle policy was fixed for all options. Ewe numbers, with a 20 % replacement rate, were adjusted for the live weight profiles and production levels of the EF x Rn (67 kg at mating; 148 lambs born: 100 ewes mated) and EF x EF (80 kg at mating; 230 lambs born: 100 ewes mated) breeds until the farm system was just biologically feasible. This indicated 1315 EF x Rn sheep or 909 EF x EF could be farmed compared to 1930 Romneys (52 kg; 117 lambs born: 100 ewes mated). In stock unit terms (SU) the EF x Rn was 1. 25 and the EF x EF 1. 54 compared to the Rn x Rn ewe (1. 00) which consumed 526 kgDM per year. The STOCKPOL outputs were copied into an enterprise margin (EM) format and the profitability of the sheep breeds calculated after adjusting for the cost of capital (CoC) of sheep wintered. The EM's (per ha) were $ 324, $ 340 and $ 351 for the Rn x Rn, EF x Rn and EF x EF breeds, respectively. The EF x EF was the preferred option for all risk preferences. A sheep age structure model was developed to simulated the transition to an EF x Rn crossbred flock. This took six years. The additional net present value (NPV) in 1998 dollars of the EF x Rn vs. the Rn x Rn was $ 92, 133. The transition to a purebred EF flock would take 24 years if a grading up strategy were adopted. An important finding was the breed x pasture production interaction. Annual pasture consumption was 869 t DM for the Rn x Rn flock, 780 t DM for the EF x Rn policy and 647 t DM for the EF x EF flock. Reduced pasture production occurred because of the higher lamb:ewe ratio of the EF sheep contributed to increased pasture senescence and decay in the summer and autumn. Ways to prevent this occurring need to be explored through further modelling studies using STOCKPOL and by evaluating the experience of famers who have adopted EF's. The study confirmed the hypothesis: EF sheep would improve production and profit on the hill country case farm. Recent farmer experience with the East Friesian should now be evaluated against this result.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether offering either binary or multiple choice among low quality forages {{has an effect}} on intake and feeding behaviour compared to no-choice situations where only one single low-quality forage is offered. Forages from different woody plants and straw were tested in lactating sheep either in Syria (Exp. 1; Awassi sheep) or in Switzerland (Exp. 2; East <b>Friesian</b> Dairy <b>sheep).</b> Artemisia herba-alba, Atriplex leucoclada, Haloxylon articulatum, Noaea mucronata, and Salsola vermiculata were used in Exp. 1. The three most preferred plants (A. leucoclada, H. articulatum and S. vermiculata) were tested again in Exp. 2 together with Betula pendula, Castanea sativa and Juglans regia. Both experiments started with a binary choice test where one plant and barley straw were offered separately for 4 h in the morning to six sheep (test period) in a random sequence in consecutive 7 -day sub-periods. A control group (n = 6 per experiment) received only straw in the test period. For the rest of the day, a basal diet composed of straw ad libitum and concentrate was offered. After the binary choice test, two 2 -week periods followed, where in the first straw only and in the second all test plants were offered to all animals from both groups to ascertain equal familiarisation with all plants. For the following 7 -day multiple choice test animals were allocated to two new groups. The ‘multiple choice’ group could choose among all test plants and straw during the 4 -h test period, the ‘control’ group received only the basal diet. Intakes of test feeds during 4 h and 24 h as well as feeding behaviour during the first 30 min were recorded. Additionally, nutrient intake was determined. Total daily test feed intake was always higher in the choice groups, but this was more pronounced in the multiple choice situation (Exp. 1 : 30 and 48, Exp. 2 : 49 and 74 g dry matter/kg live-weight 0. 75 with ‘control’ and ‘multiple choice’, respectively). A. leucoclada (Exp. 1; proportionately 0. 73 of total test plant intake) and B. pendula (Exp. 2; 0. 87) were the preferred plants in the multiple choice test and also with binary choice. Most other feeds were only consumed in low amounts in the binary and even less in multiple choice situations. In conclusion, giving sheep the choice among low quality forages seemed to be advantageous.

Two groups of five adult lactating East <b>Friesian</b> milk <b>sheep</b> and Saanen dairy goats were kept on pastures at 2000 to 2600 m a. s. l. (SA: sheep alpine; GA: goats alpine) and 400 m a. s. l. (SL: sheep lowland; GL: goats lowland). The animals were milked twice daily and the milk yield was measured. Blood, milk, skin and forage samples were collected and the left metatarsi were measured with peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The relative humidity and air temperature were recorded and the ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation was measured with a solar meter at both research stations. In addition, animals from the alpine group were equipped with a global positioning system receiver. The UVB radiation was higher at the alpine station (P < 0. 05) compared to the lowland station. In contrast, both the relative humidity and the air temperature were higher at the lowland station (P < 0. 04). The group GA produced more milk than GL (P < 0. 043). No differences in milk production between SA and SL were detected. Only minor differences between the alpine and lowland species groups {{were found in the}} total 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) and 1. 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D serum concentration and in the 25 (OH) D milk concentration. 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 2 concentration in serum was higher in sheep compared to goats and the 25 (OH) D 3 concentration in serum increased in all four groups but was higher in the alpine groups during the experiment. In addition, no differences in 7 -dehydrocholesterol (7 -DHC) concentrations in the skin at high altitude and lowland groups were detectable. However the 7 -DHC concentrations in the skin of sheep were less than a tenth of the concentrations in the skin of goats and were nearly not detectable. In both groups SA and SL bone strength index increased during the trial (P = 0. 043). Bone strength index was lower in GA compared to GL at week 12 (P = 0. 047). Mean serum Ca concentrations were higher and P concentrations were lower in the alpine groups than in the lowland groups (P = 0. 047). In both groups SA and GA the distance travelled increased during the trial. In conclusion, no effect of altitude on vitD status, vitD milk concentration and bone strength could be detected. Both sheep and goats are able to produce vitD in the skin, but sheep depend more on vitD intake with feedstuff, whereas goats rely more on cutaneous vitD production...|$|R
