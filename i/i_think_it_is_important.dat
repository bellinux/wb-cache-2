5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{that people}} see that spirituality {{is at the}} base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the {{mechanics}} of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity.
