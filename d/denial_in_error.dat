40|$|Based on Weissman and Hackett's {{comprehensive}} {{definition of}} denial, a semi-structured interview {{was developed to}} measure <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> cancer patients. The <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> cancer interview (DCI) covers both the patients' recount of their illness experience and the expert's impression {{of the level of}} <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> the patient story. This paper describes the development and first psychometric analyses of the instrument. The development of the DCI was based on clinical observation, the expert opinion of eight specialised psychiatrist as well as three small pilot studies to assess feasibility. The DCI is composed of two parts: a semi-structured interview consisting of nine specific items to be answered by the patient and two items covering the interviewer's clinical impression of the patient's type and level of denial. Follow-up interviews were held at 8, 16 and 32 weeks after the baseline assessment (T 2 - 4). To measure the inter-rater reliability, interviews were recorded and rated independently by one interviewer and one of the study's co-workers. One hundred and ninety-five consecutive newly diagnosed lung cancer patients were interviewed. The internal consistency of the DCI (Cronbach's alpha) was 0. 84 at first interview and 0. 85, 0. 82 and 0. 83 at T 2 - 4, respectively. The inter-rater agreement was good for the DCI overall and the patient's assessment scale, and satisfactory for the clinical impression items. Content validity was supported by clinical observation, in depth open interviewing and expert opinion. The DCI proved to be a feasible and reliable instrument for measuring <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> lung cancer patients. Further testing in other oncology settings will provide insight in wider applicability. The DCI can be used in future studies concerning <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> cancer patients. Insight <b>in</b> <b>denial</b> and its background will help us to adequately address <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> patients and communicate with the...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{function}} of denial for sexual offenders, examining the role of shame and guilt. Chapter One {{provides an overview of}} the literature on the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders, drawing links to findings relating to shame/guilt and denial. Chapter Two reports the first systematic review to specifically examine existing research on shame/guilt and <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> sexual offenders. It highlights the lack of strong research exploring this relationship, although provides tentative evidence that shame is positively correlated with denial, while guilt is negatively correlated with <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> sexual offenders. In Chapter Three the correlation between shame/guilt and <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> sexual offenders is directly assessed. The findings are mixed, with some limited support for the positive relationship between shame and denial, and the negative relationship between guilt and <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> this population being generated. Possible reasons for the seemingly conflicting results are discussed, along with applications of the findings to theory, research and practice. Chapter Four is a critique of one of the psychometrics used in Chapter Three, including the background to its development, evidence for (and against) its reliability and validity and potential applications in research and applied settings. The thesis concludes in Chapter Five with a discussion of the findings of all chapters in relation to the aims set at the outset. While limitations are acknowledged, the unique contribution that the thesis makes to our understanding of {{the function of}} <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> sexual offenders, specifically in relation to shame and guilt, is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} extent and the {{significance}} of the psychologic mechanism of <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> coronary heart disease. This problem is known to be frequent, but its significance remains controversial. DATA SOURCES: From the bibliographies of recent publications, the author traced 21 empirical studies on <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> coronary heart disease published during the last 25 years. STUDY SELECTION: For a chronologic and historical approach all the studies were retained. The oldest had a qualitative and descriptive approach; the most recent used a scale of measurement. DATA EXTRACTION: This review examines the clinical data found in the publications and does not critically analyse the measurement tools. RESULTS: The results show that the ambiguity of the question arises from three aspects that have to be clarified: (1) {{there is a difference between}} the short-term effect and the long-term effect of <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> coronary heart disease; (2) part of the contradictory results could be linked to the scale of measure; and (3) the concept of denial is a notion that is used in an equivocal way that is not clarified even by the precision of the scale of measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of denial would have negative effects in the long term. The scale of Hackett and Cassem is useful <b>in</b> measuring <b>denial</b> <b>in</b> the acute stage but not in the rehabilitation stage. The very notion of denial is used ambiguously in several of the studies examined...|$|R
