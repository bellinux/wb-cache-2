5000|$|... “…the useful is not {{something}} that lasts, but varies with the moment; so, when what made them be friends has been removed, the friendship is dissolved as well, in so far as it existed in relation to what brought it about.” Friendship of Utility is the kind of friendship where people use one another for a particular purpose.  For example, you may have a grandparent who is always friendly towards the mailman. They may say hello or talk about the weather but when it is all said and done, there really is not a concrete relationship there.  With that being said, this kind of friendship is typically seen amongst the elderly and middle-aged. “This sort don’t really even live together with each other, for sometimes they are not even pleasant people; and so neither <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> an additional need for that kind of company, unless the people concerned are of some use, since they are pleasant just {{to the extent that they}} have hopes of some good accruing to them.” This kind of friendship can be seen in those middle-aged people who are pursuing their own advantages in life.  For example, one could have a colleague that they have to work with on a day-to-day basis. They may not even like this particular colleague but because they are a benefit to their success, they take advantage of that connection and they use it for their own good. “And in fact these friendships are friendships incidentally; for the one loved is not loved by reference to the person he is but to the fact that in the one case he provides some good and in the other some pleasure.  Such friendships, then, are easily dissolved, if the parties become different; for if they are no longer pleasant or useful, they cease loving each other.”  Aristotle views this type of friendship as unstable and constantly subject to abrupt change.|$|E
5000|$|After {{explaining}} how acts follow with strict necessity from a given character and its response to different motives, and after presenting various views of famous thinkers hitherto, Schopenhauer addressed {{the question of}} moral freedom and responsibility. Everyone has a feeling {{of the responsibility for}} what they <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> accountable for their actions. They are certain that they themselves have done their deeds. In order to have acted differently, a person would have had to be entirely different. Schopenhauer claimed that the necessity of our actions can coexist with the feeling of freedom and responsibility {{in a way that was}} explained by Kant. In his Critique of Pure Reason (A533-558) and Critique of Practical Reason (Ch. III), Kant explained this coexistence. When a person has a mental picture of himself as a phenomenon existing in the experienced world, his acts appear to be strictly determined by motives that affect his character. This is empirical necessity. But when that person feels his inner being as a thing-in-itself, not phenomenon, he feels free. According to Schopenhauer, this is because the inner being or thing-in-itself is called will. This word [...] "will" [...] designates the closest analogy to that which is felt as the inner being and essence of a person. When we feel our freedom, we are feeling our inner essence and being, which is a transcendentally free will. The will is free, but only in itself and other than as its appearance in an observer's mind. When it appears in an observer's mind, as the experienced world, the will does not appear free. But because of this transcendental freedom, as opposed to empirical necessity, every act and deed is a person's own responsibility. We have responsibility for our acts because what we are is a result of our inner essence and being, which is a transcendentally free will (its effects are the inborn characters of all people). We are what the transcendental will, which we are, has made us. Man does at all times only what he wills, and yet he does this necessarily. But this is because he already is what he wills. Ch.
