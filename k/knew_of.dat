5|$|Four {{days prior}} to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) issued storm {{advisories}} for potentially affected areas. Subsequently, the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall, high winds, and rough seas. However, few citizens <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> {{the passage of the}} rare storm.|$|E
5|$|Treasure {{hunters who}} <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> them and beachcombers searching at random found traces of Spanish coins and {{fragments}} of ships on the Padre Island beaches throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the other's work.|$|E
50|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> their service, {{although}} the Americans captured one in November 1918. Nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> their disposition after the Armistice.|$|R
6000|$|HIGGINS. You see, we're all savages, more or less. We're {{supposed}} to be civilized and cultured--to know all about poetry and philosophy and art and science, and so on; but how many <b>of</b> us <b>know</b> even the meanings of these names? [To Miss Hill] What do you <b>know</b> <b>of</b> poetry? [To Mrs. Hill] What do you <b>know</b> <b>of</b> science? [Indicating Freddy] What does he <b>know</b> <b>of</b> art or science or anything else? What the devil do you imagine I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> philosophy? ...|$|R

5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{trade with}} the Roman Empire, {{confirmed}} by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> wild silk harvested on Cos (coa vestis), {{but they did not}} at first make the connection with the silk that was produced in the Pamir Sarikol kingdom. There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{with safety}} when using {{electrical}} appliances, {{and no doubt}} drawing on her own experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on resuscitation, advising that conventional resuscitation should proceed for up to thee-quarters of an hour following electrocution. She <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> one case where recovery took 4 hours.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, what DO you <b>know</b> <b>of</b> him?' inquired the old gentleman. 'Speak out, my friend, if {{you have}} {{anything}} to say. What DO you <b>know</b> <b>of</b> him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] {{said the}} angry wife. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> {{no cause for}} his displeasure. Displeasure! I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no cause to justify a step so terrible as this." ...|$|R
50|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his background, {{except he}} had been a royal chaplain. So little was <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him, that the medieval historians, William of Malmesbury and Florence of Worcester mistakenly called him William instead of Godfrey.|$|R
5|$|Hoover {{accompanied}} Harding on the Western {{trip and}} later wrote that Harding asked then what Hoover {{would do if}} he <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> some great scandal, whether to publicize it or bury it. Hoover replied that Harding should publish and get credit for integrity, and asked for details. Harding stated {{that it had to}} do with Smith but, when Hoover enquired as to Daugherty's possible involvement, Harding refused to answer.|$|E
5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the existence of the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|McColley <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> {{only one}} {{surviving}} {{copy of the}} first edition, held at the British Museum (now British Library C.56.c.2), which {{was the basis for}} his 1937 edition of The Man in the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, an edition criticised by literary critic Kathleen Tillotson as lacking in textual care and consistency. H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, what of that? Them I don't <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> and so I ain't {{responsible}} for them; {{but this one}} I do <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> and so--there, I can't argue; but, Tom, {{if you want the}} money, you know where to find it." ...|$|R
5|$|No {{official}} {{action was}} taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that the}} convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the presence of both Irish Oak and U-607, {{there was no need}} for Irish Oak to have warned the convoy.|$|E
5|$|On 3 October, royalists in Paris {{declared}} a {{rebellion against the}} National Convention. Paul Barras, {{a leader of the}} Thermidorian Reaction, <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> Bonaparte's military exploits at Toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the Convention in the Tuileries Palace. Napoleon had seen the massacre of the King's Swiss Guard there three years earlier and realised that artillery would be the key to its defence.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1862, , {{commanded}} by Commander Franklin Buchanan, {{was ready to}} engage the Union flotilla blockading the James River. Virginia was powered by Merrimack's original engines, which had been condemned by the Union Navy before her capture. The ship's chief engineer, H. Ashton Ramsay, served in Merrimack before the Civil War broke out and <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the engine's unreliability, but Buchanan pushed forward undaunted.|$|E

50|$|What {{little is}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> Powhatan is {{by way of}} wordlists {{recorded}} by William Strachey (about 500 words) and Captain John Smith (about 50 words). Smith also reported a pidgin form of Powhatan, but almost nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|Field Marshal Sir William Slim said of him [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> few commanders {{who made}} as many {{immediate}} and critical decisions on {{every step of}} the ladder of promotion, and I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> none who made so few mistakes".|$|R
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine {{the wreckage of the}} crashed helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Peringskiöld {{commented that}} the stone was {{reclining}} backwards in a hop-garden at the eastern farm of Lövsta, which was later confirmed by Celius in 1726. Stolpe tried to find it, but noted in 1869 that the landowner <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the runestone, but that the latter had reported it to be completely covered in soil, and in 1951, a runologist tried to locate the runestone but failed.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy {{caused a}} breach between Smith {{and his first}} wife, Emma. Although Emma <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> some of her husband's marriages, she almost {{certainly}} {{did not know the}} extent of his polygamous activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith's marriage to four women boarded in the Smith household, but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. In July 1843, Smith dictated a revelation directing Emma to accept plural marriage, but the two were not reconciled until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You should <b>know</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} that is more powerful elsewhere, as I judge,' she returned. 'Do you <b>know</b> nothing <b>of</b> a woman's anger?' ...|$|R
60|$|And so it ended! Not as I {{thought it}} would end; not perhaps as you {{thought it would}} end. What do we <b>know</b> <b>of</b> our own lives? What do we <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the {{fulfillment}} of our dearest wishes? God knows--and that is best.|$|R

5|$|The {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Encomium Emmae (written in the early 1040s) was apparently acquainted with the Life, {{though it is not}} known how he <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> it. The author was a monk of St Bertin's in Flanders, but may have learned of the work in England.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave overt clues {{that they were}} displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely {{had little to do with}} that transaction, if they even <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E
5|$|While Jenner was alive, {{very few}} people <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> him, {{and the effects of}} his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is contradicted by interviews with family members.|$|E
