Later, they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was facing. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. The circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey.|$|E

25|$|Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow {{over the}} volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he {{attended}} with his wife. The judge said in a lawsuit {{he has had a}} constant ringing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter and the city of Tucson, Arizona, which runs the convention center where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to American Tinnitus Association, an ear-disorder association.|$|E

Stossel stated that he suffered from pain and buzzing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> eight weeks after the assault. Stossel sued and obtained a settlement of $425,000 from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In his book, Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity, he writes that {{he has come to}} regret doing so, having adopted the belief that lawsuits harm many innocent people. Schultz maintains that he attacked Stossel on orders from Vince McMahon, the head of the then-WWF.|$|E
500|$|Despite his defeat, American Pharoah {{was moved}} up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3. He was ridden by Victor Espinoza {{for the first time}} and started as the 3.2–1 second {{favorite}} behind Best Pal Stakes winner Skyway, with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field. American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator, with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third. Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, [...] "We took the blinkers off, put cotton <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and schooled him a lot.

500|$|While Pixar usually designs their {{characters}} to be caricatured, Carl {{was even more}} so, being only three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks on his nose, a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible {{near the end of}} the film, transforming into an [...] "action hero".|$|E

2500|$|Indigenous {{cultures}} {{also use}} instructional ribbing— a playful form of correcting children's undesirable behavior— in their stories.

2500|$|The {{stage in}} his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's Faust to music (1844–53) was a {{critical}} one for his health. He spent {{the first half of}} 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for Dresden, where he suffered from persistent [...] "nervous prostration". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs.

He brought a case for unfair dismissal against Lancashire to an employment tribunal, and in April 2005 the panel found in his favour. Meanwhile, Schofield returned to play in club cricket, for Cheshire and Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship, as well as having several games for the Durham, Sussex and Derbyshire second teams. In 2006 he played for Ormskirk Cricket Club in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition's Premier League.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the gags {{focus on}} Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and {{any form of}} exertion; his {{constant}} shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon {{as well as his}} obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing through the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with [...] "Nancy", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting [...] "shot down by three generations"). When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.|$|E
2500|$|England won the toss and understandably {{decided to}} bat, with a 1–0 {{lead in the}} series they had no {{incentive}} to hurry and spent ten {{and a half hours}} making 470. Bill Lawry gave the new ball to 'Froggie' Thomason and had debutant Dennis Lillee bowling into a strong southerly wind, even so Lillee was yards faster than Thomson, and more accurate. Geoff Boycott (58) and John Edrich (130) added 107 for the first wicket before Boycott was given run out despite his strong opinion to the contrary. E.W. Swanton in the commentary box shouted [...] "He's out!" [...] when Ian Chappell threw down the stumps and as he had failed to ground his bat when reaching the crease Umpire O'Connell had given him out. Convincing Boycott that he was out was always a difficult business and his displeasure was obvious when he threw his bat to the ground, he caused further trouble when he pointedly refused to apologise to the umpires for his behaviour (Boycott later apologised to Umpire O'Connell in private). He stormed off the field with the crowd howling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and to wide condemnation by the press when a photograph showed he was clearly out. Some called on David Clark to withdraw Boycott's £150 good conduct bonus and Keith Miller said [...] "This will cost Boycott the England and maybe also the Yorkshire captaincy". Keith Fletcher returned to form with 80 out of a stand of 169 with Edrich before the Surrey opener was caught by Stackpole to give Lillee his first, hard earned, Test wicket. Lillee (5/84) dismissed Alan Knott, Alan Thomson bowled Fletcher and England lost three wickets for 13 runs, but soon found their way again. Basil D'Oliveira (47), John Hampshire (55), Ray Illingworth (24) and John Snow (38) took them to 458/6 before Lillee cleared up the tail, the last four wickets falling for twelve runs.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{songs were}} set to music by Francesco Berger and Lady Charlesmont, and later on by Margaret Ruthven Lang, Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, and many others. Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, {{it seems to me}} we have not yet fully {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] that it was one of the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light girdling darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E
2500|$|PEF {{also became}} embroiled in major battles with Governor Paterson {{over the state}} budget, which {{occupied}} much of the remainder of Brynien's first term and {{the first few years}} of his second. When the late-2000s recession severely depressed New York state tax revenues, Paterson demanded that PEF and other state employee unions re-open their contracts and adopt a wage freeze and other concessions to help the state balance its budget. PEF refused. PEF countered by suggesting a program of early retirement, which lawmakers began discussing. PEF also demanded that the state cut the number of independent contractors working for the state, arguing that New York could save up to $700 million by reducing the number of contractors or reducing payments to them. PEF also urged the state to adopt higher taxes on the very wealthy and for-profit health maintenance organizations, which the legislature did. Governor Paterson, determined to achieve spending cuts, ordered the layoff of more than 8,900 state workers on March 24, 2009. Brynien and other PEF leaders were deeply angered by Paterson's proposal. Led by PEF, the state's public employee unions produced television commercials and newspaper advertisements depicting Paterson with his fingers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and unwilling to listen to voters. The New York Times said that attacks were some [...] "of the nastiest and most personal against a governor in memory ... rare even by Albany's relaxed standards of political decorum." [...] Brynien said Paterson should be faulted for forcing the unions into such an aggressive stand. Brynien also announced PEF would sue the state to prevent the layoffs from occurring. In response, Paterson said he would not lay off any workers if the state's unions agreed to a pension plan ("Tier V") for new workers that would provide much lower benefits. PEF reached an agreement with the governor under which Paterson agreed not to lay off workers in exchange for a $20,000 bonus to 4,000 highly paid workers if they retired early within the next year; the abolition of 2,500 vacant jobs; the creation of a new tier in the pension system which would save $440 million over two years; and the introduction of a plan for workers to voluntarily cut back their working hours.|$|E
2500|$|Peter May {{had missed}} the two Tests in 1961 and {{declined}} to make the gruelling 8 Test tour of India and Pakistan in 1961–62, as did Colin Cowdrey, Fred Trueman and Brian Statham. Ted Dexter {{was put in charge}} of a weakened team, like Barrington he had made his name in the West Indies and they had shared several big stands together. In an odd schedule the England team played Pakistan before going to India for a 5 Test series and returning to complete the series against Pakistan. In the First Test at Lahore England made a slow 380 batting second with Barrington adding 192 with M.J.K. Smith until he ran out his partner for 99 and himself for 139 after batting for over 7 hours. Pakistan collapsed suddenly in the second innings and England won a surprise victory by 5 wickets. In India they played the Combined Universities at Poona and Barrington made 149 not out in 290 minutes, but mimicked Slasher Mackay (who had toured India two years before) and when he took two wickets there was a pitch invasion as the crowd gave him presents, including a pair of sunglasses, which he used {{for the rest of the}} match, even when bowling. The match was broadcast on radio and Barrington became a star, which he played up to throughout the tour with imitations of Gary Sobers and a pompous Colonel, playing football with the ball and putting his fingers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> when the crowd shouted [...] "Mora, Mora" [...] (have a go). On a more practical side he forsaked local food, lived off egg and chips for almost the entire tour and kept an array of medicines to ward off illness (he lost 8lbs before the First Test). He was a great success in the series with innings of 151 not out, 52 not out, 21, 172, 113 not out, 14, 3, 20 and 48; a total of 594 runs (99.00). He made four centuries in four successive Tests for the first time, but the hosts won the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Returning to Pakistan he made 84 in the Second Test, but missed the Third due to fibrositis, an ailment suffered by Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He finished with 229 runs (76.33) in the series against Pakistan and 1,329 runs (69.94) on the tour, nearly 300 more than anyone else and top of the averages. It was no surprise that he was named the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year 1962.|$|E
