Granular flow through a constant radius chute is modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in which a multiphase simulation is considered. This approach provides valuable information about the <b>flow</b> of <b>dust</b> and the results are confirmed by experimental observations. An expanded approach is then considered for a conveyor transfer in which CFD modelling is combined with the well known continuum model, as well as drawing on qualitative results obtained utilising the discrete element method (DEM).

40|$|Fluid <b>flow</b> and <b>dust</b> {{transportation}} in a realistic urban residential community under dust storm weather conditions are investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) with a grid resolution of several meters. The dust transportation and concentration distribution are obtained through the Lagrangian-formulated discrete particle model by integrating the particle velocity between certain time intervals. The fluid flow is solved by the realizable k - ε model. It is found that the dust transportation and distribution are very {{closely related to the}} flow field. The flow field in a real residential community is very complicated. When the building axes are perpendicular to the wind direction, the flows resemble the classic street canyon flow. Places with a low wind speed and high vorticity usually have a high dust concentration. As the wind direction changes, the fluid <b>flow</b> and <b>dust</b> distribution differ from case to case, but the general features are kept.

The experiments {{have been carried out}} in a Π shaped DC glow discharge experimental device using kaolin particles as the dust component in a background of Argon plasma. A strong supersonic <b>flow</b> of the <b>dust</b> fluid is induced by adjusting the pumping speed and neutral gas flow into the device. An isolated copper wire mounted on the cathode acts as a potential barrier to the <b>flow</b> of <b>dust</b> particles. A sudden change of gas flow rate is used to trigger the onset of high velocity dust acoustic shocks whose dynamics are captured by fast video pictures of the evolving structures. The physical characteristics of these shocks are delineated through a parametric scan of their dynamical properties over a range of flow speeds and potential hill heights.

40|$|We perform {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the Kelvin-Helmholtz {{instability in the}} mid-plane of a protoplanetary disc. A two-dimensional corotating slice in the azimuthal [...] vertical plane of the disc is considered where we include the Coriolis force and the radial advection of the Keplerian rotation <b>flow.</b> <b>Dust</b> grains, treated as individual particles, move {{under the influence of}} friction with the gas, while the gas is treated as a compressible fluid. The friction force from the dust grains on the gas leads to a vertical shear in the gas rotation velocity. As the particles settle around the mid-plane due to gravity, the shear increases, and eventually the flow becomes unstable to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence saturates when the vertical settling of the dust is balanced by the turbulent diffusion away from the mid-plane. The azimuthally averaged state of the self-sustained Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence is found to have a constant Richardson number in the region around the mid-plane where the dust-to-gas ratio is significant. Nevertheless the dust density has a strong non-axisymmetric component. We identify a powerful clumping mechanism, caused by the dependence of the rotation velocity of the dust grains on the dust-to-gas ratio, as the source of the non-axisymmetry. Our simulations confirm recent findings that the critical Richardson number for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is around unity or larger, rather than the classical value of 1 / 4...|$|R

40|$|We are in {{the third}} year of a three-year Mars Data Analysis Program project to map the {{morphology}} of the Olympus Mons volcano, Mars, using ArcGIS by ESRI. The final product of this project is to be a 1 : 1, 000, 000 -scale geologic map. The scientific questions upon which this mapping project is based include understanding the volcanic development and modification by structural, aeolian, and possibly glacial processes. The project s scientific objectives are based upon preliminary mapping by Bleacher et al. [1] along a approx. 80 -km-wide north-south swath of the volcano corresponding to High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) image h 0037. The preliminary project, which covered approx. 20 % of the volcano s surface, resulted in several significant findings, including: 1) channel-fed lava flow surfaces are areally more abundant than tube-fed surfaces by a ratio of 5 : 1, 2) channel-fed flows consistently embay tube-fed flows, 3) lava fans appear to be linked to tube-fed flows, 4) no volcanic vents were identified within the map region, and 5) a Hummocky unit surrounds the summit and is likely a combination of non-channelized <b>flows,</b> <b>dust,</b> ash, and/or frozen volatiles. These results led to the suggestion that the volcano had experienced a transition from long-lived tube-forming eruptions to more sporadic and shorter-lived, channel-forming eruptions, as seen at Hawaiian volcanoes between the tholeiitic shield building phase (Kilauea to Mauna Loa) and alkalic capping phase (Hualalai and Mauna Kea) ...|$|R
