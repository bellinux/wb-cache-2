In contrast to this organic and dynamic version of self-managing that is naturally practised by consumers, common practitioner and policy representations of self-management tend to discount consumer agency and overlook the daily ways in which people manage their own body, experiences and health choices.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{proposes a}} vibration-based damage {{evaluation}} method that can detect, locate, and size damage utilizing {{only a few}} of the lower mode shapes. The proposed method is particularly advantageous for beam-like structures with uncertain applied axial load, mass density, and foundation stiffness. Based on a small <b>damage</b> <b>assumption,</b> a linear relationship between damaged and undamaged curvatures is revealed in the context of elasticity. It turns out that the resulting damage index equation inherently suffers from singularities near inflection nodes. The transformation of the problem into the multi-resolution wavelet domain provides a set of coupled linear equations. With the aid of the singular value decomposition technique, the solution to the damage index equation is achieved in the wavelet space. Next, the desired physical solution to the damage index equation is reconstructed from the one in the wavelet space. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two existing damage detection methods using a set of numerical simulations. The proposed method attempts to resolve the mode selection problem, the singularity problem, the axial force problem, and the absolute severity estimation problem, all of which remained unsolved by earlier attempts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} Australian data {{to examine the}} nature of what has popularly {{come to be known}} as the {{feminisation}} of higher education. It is argued that the standard approach to feminisation, which is apt to adopt a strong focus on the percentage shares of women and men (see Vincent-Lancrin 2008), is incapable of capturing the complexity of gender relations in the contemporary university (Quinn 2003). A much more richly nuanced conceptualisation of feminisation is required. This is important not only in terms of producing informed academic analyses but, critically, also in terms of countering potentially <b>damaging</b> <b>assumptions</b> that the numerical dominance of women symbolises the achievement of gender equity. This paper addresses the statistical profile of women's employment (academic and professional) in Australian universities using a range of data sources. The undoubted gains made over recent years are mapped and linked to various societal, political and institutional factors, especially the national system of monitoring organisational equity plans. The gains made cannot be formulated as a unilinear, upward trajectory of progressive achievements for women. Indeed the growing female presence has the potential to mask the underlying resilience of deeply-entrenched structures and practices that routinely stymie the achievement of gender equity. The feminisation process that is occurring is distinctively shaped into feminised segments, both vertically and horizontally, and this segmented feminisation ensures that the universities remain strongly masculinist enterprises.

40|$|The post- 9 / 11 era has {{resulted}} in the emergence of incompatible narratives in a propaganda war between Western governments, particularly the US and UK, and violent and non-violent global Islamic movements. One side seeks to maintain a hegemonic geopolitical order whilst the other seeks to replace it. This resulting conflict has indirectly and inadvertently impacted the British education system in a number of ways. This paper seeks to reveal the political, ideological and educational discourses influencing state ordained teaching imperatives and proscriptions relating to “fundamental British values” (FBV) originating in the Teaching Standards of 2012. A macro-analysis traces the educational policies reflecting liberalism, multiculturalism and securitisation aimed at assimilating ethnic minorities into a national framework of (neo-) liberal values. Muslims and Islam are increasingly problematised in their resistance to assimilation and potential as a fifth column. The emergence of FBV, underpinning a broader counter-terrorism security narrative as a new policy instrument to assimilate Muslims, is argued to be the latest twist in the war on terror. The selection of these values is dialectically shaped by corresponding Islamist values, which in turn underpin an effective Islamist narrative contesting Western hegemony. A meso-analysis considers the operationalisation of FBV into education policy through pre-determined consultations, Machiavellian political interventions and alliances with ideologically cognate think tanks and actors. A micro-analysis looks at how FBV related policy within a securitised context seeks to reshape teacher identity, recreating the teacher as a Foucauldian panopticon ideologue, objectifying Muslim students and pathologising their culture and values. The paper concludes this discourse is obscuring <b>damaging</b> <b>assumptions</b> in education, increasingly marginalising critical thinking, statutorily forcing teachers to indoctrinate students with liberal values and police their thoughts, resulting in increasing fear, suspicion and doubt across the schooling system. Critical discourse analysis and untellability theory are employed to explain how the current discourse has been shaped and privileged by the ideology of state whilst competing values are marginalised, deprivileged and “othered”...|$|R

In assessing damages for post-traumatic epilepsy the courts {{are faced with a}} number of considerations: epilepsy can appear several years after the injury; epilepsy is not a homogeneous condition; the eventual prognosis is unknown; the epilepsy may not have been directly due to the trauma; and epilepsy affects life expectancy and employment. Damages were originally fixed at the point of compensation, and these rather crude calculations led to both over- and under-compensation. This situation was improved in 1985, when courts were permitted to award <b>damages</b> on the <b>assumption</b> that epilepsy would not occur or worsen, and further <b>damages</b> should these <b>assumptions</b> prove to be incorrect. The courts in England still depend, however, upon the evidence of expert witnesses chosen by the plaintiff and defendant.

Growth was unaffected by CPF, even at concentrations causing severe effects on survival and reproduction. Model analysis suggests that CPF directly affects the process of egg production. For the short-term response (45 days), this single mode of action accurately agreed with the data. However, the full data set (120 days) revealed a dose-related decrease in reproduction at low concentrations after prolonged exposure, not covered by the same mechanism.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a critical}} ethnography about the power that storytelling offers in creating sustainable community literacy programs. The research for this dissertation was conducted at a ten year-old grassroots community literacy organization, VOICES: Community Stories Past and Present, Inc., {{which is based in}} Tucson, Arizona. Interviews for this project were conducted over a period of two years and includes feedback from thirty-three board members, staff members, volunteers, and youth participants at the organization. The dissertation begins with the assertion that gaps in understanding between theory and practice lead to <b>damaging</b> <b>assumptions</b> about difference and inequality, especially in the realm of community-based programming. I argue that an expanded understanding of storytelling as reciprocal and transformative can bridge these misunderstandings. In order to bridge the divide between theory and practice, this project offers the concept of reciprocity, fleshed out by the work of Ellen Cushman and Pierre Bourdieu, to encourage both participants in community literacy programs, as well as administrators, to be more transparent about their goals by sharing individual experience. This concept of reciprocity is the foundation on which storytelling as an agent of transformation rests. The process of storytelling that this project proposes establishes advocacy journalism and witnessing as a precedent. In the stories about interviewing and storytelling that the narrators from VOICES share, reciprocity is performative in that it can be manipulated to fit the needs of specific rhetorical situations. But this performance is dependent on the audience. I suggest that contrary to many discussions in composition and rhetoric, the tension between "addressed" and "invoked" audiences is an accurate one, and can be used to generate conversation about the assumptions and expectations of low-income youth and community literacy participants. An addressed audience is necessary in order for stories to be transformative; which is ultimately the way that they create large-scale social change. The conclusion of this project argues that administrators and literacy workers must foster an ethic of sustainability, which can be achieved through storytelling in order to both honor difference and challenge inequality in ways that are meaningful to the participants in these programs...|$|R

40|$|A {{major concern}} {{affecting}} the {{efficient use of}} composite laminates in aerospace industry {{is the lack of}} understanding of the effect of low-velocity impact (LVI) damage on the structural integrity. This project aims to develop further knowledge of the response and damage mechanisms of composite laminates under LVI, and to explore the feasibility of assessing the internal impact damage with a visually inspectable parameter. The response and damage mechanisms of composite laminates under LVI have been investigated experimentally and numerically in this project. Various parameters including the laminates thickness, lay-up configuration, repeated impact, and curing temperature have been examined. The concept and the phenomena of delamination threshold load (DTL) have been assessed in details. It was found that DTL exists for composite laminates, but the determination of the DTL value is not straightforward. There is a suitable value of range between the impact energy and the laminates stiffness/thickness, if the sudden load drop phenomenon in the impact force history is used to detect the DTL value. It is suggested that the potential menace of the delamination initiation may be overestimated. The composite laminates tested in this project demonstrate good damage tolerance capacity due to the additional energy absorption mechanism following the delamination initiation. As a result, the current design philosophy for laminated composite structure might be too conservative and should be reassessed to improve the efficiency further. To explore the feasibility of linking the internal damage to a visually inspectable parameter, quasi-static indentation (QSI) tests have been carried out. The dent depth, as a visually inspectable parameter, has been carefully monitored and assessed in relation to the damage status of the composite laminates. It is proposed that the damage process of composite laminates can be divided into different phases based on the difference in the increasing rate of dent depth. Moreover, the internal damage has been examined under the optical microscope (OM) and the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Residual compressive strength of the damaged specimen has been measured using the compression-after-impact (CAI) test. The results further confirm the findings with regard to the overestimated potential menace of the delamination initiation and the proposed <b>damage</b> process <b>assumption.</b> The proposed <b>damage</b> process <b>assumption</b> has great potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of both the analytical prediction and the structural health monitoring for damages in composite laminates under low-velocity impact...|$|R

Significant damage was observed to many residential and business structures in the northern portions of the town, across the intersections of Louisiana Highways 1, 308, and 70.

40|$|Dependence of <b>damage</b> {{estimates}} upon <b>assumptions</b> {{of economic}} growth and technological development • Greater economic growth could, by increasing emissions, lead to greater damages from climate change. On the other hand, by increasing wealth and advancing technological development and human capital, economic growth would also increase a society’s adaptive capacity and reduce those damages. Although analyses of the impacts (or damages) of climate change generally incorporate economic growth into the emissions and climate change scenarios that they use as inputs, these analyses do not adequately account for the increase in adaptive capacity resulting from that very growth. Because of this inconsistency, these analyses generally tend to overstate impacts. • For instance, the average GDP per capita for developing countries in 2100 is projected to be $ 11, 000 (in 1990 US$, at market exchange rates) under A 2, the slowest economic growth scenario, and $ 66, 500 under A 1, the scenario with both the greatest economic growth and largest climate change.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} stylized economy-energy-climate model and discuss {{the role of the}} atmosphere, fossil fuels, and a stock of {{accumulated}} knowledge about renewable energy technologies in collaboratively and competitively managed worlds. The model highlights that assumptions about the 'degree of competition' and about choices of lumping economic regions, and hence their heterogeneity, strongly affect model predictions about the rate of fossil fuel use and, consequently, the rate of climate change. In the model, decisionmakers (actors) make decisions about investment allocations into the goods producing economy and into carbon-based and non-carbon-based (renewable) energy supply, the remainder being for consumption. Actors are faced with the following dilemma situation. Economic growth requires energy and will therefore accelerate fossil fuel depletion and generate growth in carbon emissions, the latter leading to global warming and climate change induced damages. By developing non-carbon energy sources, which come initially at a higher cost than fossil fuels, growth of carbon emissions can be curtailed. Trying to optimize a consumption-related utility, actors base their decisions on the economically most rational investment portfolio for a finite time horizon. However, in their decisionmaking, they are constrained by the choices of other actors. We consider two prototypical situations: (i) a collaborative environment where all actors strive to maximize a world utility - the global optimum - and (ii) a situation where actors optimize the utility of their own country - a solution that corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. The difference between both outcomes can be used to classify the severity of the 'tragedy of the commons effect'. We present results about the dependence of the severity of this effect on several key parameters (i) the number of actors, (ii) the heterogeneity and severity of expected climate <b>damages,</b> (iii) <b>assumptions</b> about technology diffusion and (iv) fossil fuel depletion...|$|R

Eval. 22 (2003) 1615 – 1622] is investigated addressing the essential effects of applying the discrete form of the Fourier diffraction theorem for solving the inverse problem as discussed by Kak and Slaney [A. C. Kak, M. Slaney, Principles of Computerized Tomographic Imaging, IEEE Press, New York, 1988] for the acoustic case, viz. diffraction limited sensitivity, influence of weak scatterer <b>assumption,</b> <b>damage</b> location and scatter field data processing in time and Fourier space as well as experimental limitations such as finite receiver length and limited views. The feasibility of the imaging technique is investigated for cylindrical inhomogeneities of various severities and relative position within the interrogation space and a normal incident interrogation configuration. The results show that plate-wave diffraction tomography enables the quantitative reconstruction of location, size and severity of plate damage with excellent sensitivity and offers the potential for detecting corrosion thinning, disbonds and delamination damage in structural integrity management applications...|$|R
40|$|This study {{begins with}} an inquiry into the <b>damaging</b> myths and <b>assumptions</b> that pervade the idea of {{physical}} impairment in Western culture. Its primary purpose, though, is to explore the way rhetoric is used towards therapeutic ends in the life-writing of several contemporary American writers who have sustained disfiguring disabilities {{as a result of}} accidents or debilitating illnesses. To this end, it investigates the underpinnings of a “rhetoric of self address” as articulated in the work of Kenneth Burke, David Payne and others to show how writers evolve notions of compensation and consolation to gain new perspectives on the losses they have suffered from physical trauma to the body. ^ Attention to the features of rhetoric and to the way writers inflect conventional rhetorical elements to reformulate themselves after the onset of illness or injury reveals, among other things, the liberatory possibilities for pedagogy. Thus, this study also provides rhetorical guidelines for a writing pedagogy that can be readily used by students who are struggling with some form of disability. Authors whose texts provide evidence in support of the argument of this study include Andre Dubus, Stanley Elkin, Lucy Grealy, Natalie Kusz, Nancy Mairs, Reynolds Price and Alice Walker. Essays by members from several writing workshops designed specifically for people with multiple sclerosis add a different but important dimension to the findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Based on bed {{occupancy}} ratio (BOR) in 2010, it {{was known}} {{that the number of}} inpatient visit atPermata Bunda hospital was relatively high. As a consequence, the need of linen increased. Basedon preliminary study, {{it was known}} that planning, implementation, and controlling of linen werenot adequate. The objective {{of this study was to}} know how linen in Permata Bunda hospital Purwodadi was managed. This was a descriptive explorative study with cross sectional approach. Study population was workersof Permata Bunda hospital Purwodadi who were involved in linen management. Main informantswere chief of nurse in the general ward, chief and assistance chief of linen logistic unit, chief andassistant chief of laundry unit. Triangulation informants were general manager, logistic unit chiefand patients. Results of the study showed that planning for linen requirement estimation was not good because it wasdone based on lost or <b>damaged</b> linen <b>assumptions.</b> Ordering process was still insufficient due to nospecial staff who ordered the linen. Supply linen was inadequate due to no standard for linen supply. Maintenance of linen was good; it was performed according to the right phases and procedures. Distribution of linen was not good due to separation of the rooms by the street. Linen service to patientwas inadequate; not all patients 2 ̆ 7 linen was changed once a day. Linen management organization wasnot good; it was still done together. Linen stock control was not good; calculation for linen requirementwas still lacking, and it had not used the standard of 3 times of the number of bed. Implementation oflinen inventory was still inadequate; no specific recording was done according to the dirtiness level ofthe linen. Linen coding or identification was still inadequate; coding was not in detail. Based on the results of the study, it is suggested that calculation of linen requirement should bedone based on the number of bed with availability of 3 par stock linen in each bed. Written standardoperating procedure in linen management should be produced; it will be used as guideline orstandard by linen staffs or management. Identification or coding of linen should be improved; itincludes hospital name, room name, type of linen and type of material...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerotic renal {{artery disease}} {{represents}} {{a cause of}} which little is known but not a cause to be neglected for hypertension and renal insufficiency. Even though its occurrence remains badly defined, atherosclerotic renal artery disease is constantly on the rise due to the aging population, the never prevailing hypertension and diabetes mellitus. This review aims to give a clinical profile of patients presenting with atherosclerotic renal artery disease and to discuss, {{in the light of}} study results, which diagnostic evaluation should be used considering the sequence and the benefit and risk of each in order to initiate a personalized treatment. Patients affected by atherosclerotic renal artery disease are likely to have more complications and more extensive target-organ damage than patients without renal artery stenosis. The evolution of the atherosclerotic renal artery disease is in general slow and progressive. Nevertheless, certain clinical cases manifest themselves with the onset of acute renal failure bought upon by the administration of blockers of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or by some other causes responsible for a sudden drop in renal plasma flow (e. g., thrombosis of the renal artery). The relationship between atherosclerotic renal artery disease and atherosclerosis is complex, and mediators implicated in the pathophysiology of renovascular disease may also contribute to the progression of cardiovascular <b>damage.</b> An early <b>assumption</b> of the atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is warranted to determine the adapted treatment (i. e., medical treatment, revascularisation [...] .) just as the assumption and the correction of the more general cardiovascular risk factors...|$|R
