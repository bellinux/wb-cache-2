25|$|The city's TIF <b>financing</b> <b>proposal</b> was controversial. Critics such as Charles W. McMillion (chief {{economist}} at the business consulting firm MBG Information Services) argued that the convention headquarters hotel would lead to lower sales tax revenue by reducing pressure on hotel room rates throughout the city and by keeping attendees away from local restaurants and retail businesses. The convention headquarters hotel, critics also noted, would not have enough attendance {{to make up the}} lost sales tax revenue. Executives at other hotel chains said the city's financing deal projected sales tax revenue of $40 million to $48 million a year, but a more reasonable estimate was $25 million to $30 million a year. City officials countered by pointing to the two studies conducted in 2000 which came to different conclusions, and by noting that the convention center had promised those booking large meetings at the site that a headquarters hotel would be open by 2007. Without the hotel, these groups could cancel completely, they said.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{specified}} of a representative defense contractor. The contractor {{is assumed to}} maximize the expected utility of managerial emoluments, performance of the contractor's product and corporate annual net income over a finite planning horizon. This maximization is constrained by the technology of research and development, test and evaluation, manufacturing and a centralized warehouse-inventory operation. There are commercial sales {{as well as a}} number of on-going and potential DOD projects. An extensive accounting model of the contractor is included. Corporate financial management involves the issuing the retiring of short- and long-term debt and equity in addition to the choice with respect to dividends and retained earnings. The inputs of the contractor include plant and equipment (both contractor and government supplied in T and E), engineering support labor (both contractor and government supplied in T and E). administrative labor, manufacturing labor, weapon system operators (both contractor and government supplied in T and E), material, purchased parts, subcontracted items, and government furnished items. Risk is introduced by considering each possible alternate event due to such factors as rivals' actions, technological risk, capital market conditions and variation in government and commercial sales to be grouped in states-of-nature. Thus, the contractor is assumed to plan for a variety of future state-of-nature (contingencies) and chooses a complete plan (inputs, outputs, <b>financing,</b> <b>proposal</b> bids, etc.) for each contingency.
