25|$|Farming {{and fishing}} {{are the two}} main industries. Major {{products}} include rice, corn, sugarcane, and tilapia. Pampanga is the tilapia capital of the country because of its high production reaching 214,210.12 metric tons in 2015. In addition to farming and fishing, the province supports thriving cottage industries that specialize in wood carving, furniture making, guitars and handicrafts. Every Christmas season, the province of Pampanga, especially {{in the capital city}} of San Fernando becomes the center of a thriving industry centered on handcrafted lighted lanterns called parols that display a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> light and color. Other industries include its casket industry and the manufacturing of all-purpose vehicles in the municipality of Santo Tomas.|$|E

500|$|The final album Smith {{completed}} in his lifetime, Figure 8, {{was released on}} April 18, 2000. It featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England, with an obvious Beatles influence in the songwriting and production. The album garnered very favorable reviews, peaking at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and 37 on the UK Album Charts. The album received praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a [...] "sweeping <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> layered instruments and sonic textures". However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had {{lost some of its}} subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to [...] "the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary".|$|E
500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him. McCain's shift of {{political}} stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering {{what had happened to}} the McCain they thought they had known. [...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E

The moody tune finds Ocean moaning over ethereal swirls and pulses while cooing about [...] "working at the pyramid" [...] and finding [...] "my Black queen Cleopatra."

500|$|In 1921 Ketèlbey {{moved from}} his home in St John's Wood, where he had been living for the {{previous}} seven years, to Frognal, an area of Hampstead, north west London. He installed a billiards table in the basement, which became his favoured form of relaxation. He produced a series of orchestral pieces {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, including Bells Across the Meadows released in 1921, and Suite Romantique (1922), which the music critic Tim McDonald considers [...] "impressive". In the following year Ketèlbey wrote In a Chinese Temple Garden, followed in 1924 by Sanctuary of the Heart and Cockney Suite. The last of these contained the finale [...] "'Appy 'Ampstead", which the writers Lewis and Susan Foreman describe as [...] "...a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> passing images, mouth organs, a cornet playing,... a band,... shouts of a showman... with his rattle and a steam engine and roundabout".|$|E
500|$|According to Encyclopedia of Popular Music writer Colin Larkin, Something/Anything? {{has since}} been [...] "rightly {{regarded}} as one of the landmark releases of the early 70s". AllMusic especially praised the album's endearing tone and often adventurous variety of styles, commenting that [...] "Listening to Something/Anything? is a mind-altering trip in itself, no matter how many instantly memorable, shamelessly accessible pop songs are scattered throughout the album." [...] Robert Christgau also applauded the strong variety: [...] "The many good songs span styles and subjects in a virtuoso display... And the many ordinary ones are saved by Todd's confidence and verve." [...] Rolling Stone found the songs [...] "perfectly composed" [...] while deeming the record Rundgren's [...] "best-selling, most-enduring work born of desperation", one that [...] "demonstrates his command of the studio, unfurling his falsetto over a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> rock genres". Axl Rose declared in a 1989 Rolling Stone interview that [...] "Today, my favorite record is Todd Rundgren's Something/Anything".|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} well {{received}} by most readers and critics. Two months after publication, all 210,000 {{copies of the}} first printing had been sold. The New York Times published two positive reviews of the book: Basil Davenport compared Clarke to Olaf Stapledon, C. S. Lewis, and H. G. Wells, a [...] "very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas." [...] William DuBois called the book [...] "a first rate tour de force that is well worth the attention of every thoughtful citizen {{in this age of}} anxiety." [...] Don Guzman of the Los Angeles Times admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke's role as a writer to that of an artist, [...] "a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words".

500|$|Kenny Ortega, {{a common}} {{collaborator}} with The Walt Disney Company at the time, {{was hired as}} the tour's director and main choreographer. Ortega, along with set designer Michael Cotten, assembled an experienced personnel and developed the show, which was made fairly simple because Cyrus did not feel confident enough as a vocalist to perform stunts and use props while singing. Therefore, fixation was turned to video. Cotten envisioned the set to be [...] "an interactive mobile <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> flash and style", a conceptualization that involved a massive amount of video. Nineteen individual LED video screens were located throughout the stage. Four high definition V9 LED video screens served as walls surrounding the main stage. Five Barco MiTrix cubes, which consisted of three LED panels that faced towards the audience and one supporting panel that faced the stage, were suspended by rigs throughout the stage. Nocturne Productions partnered with equipment supplier Video Equipment Rentals (VER) to accomplish the design. The lightweight and adaptability of the V9 LED screens allowed for designers to add more lighting elements than in most shows at the time.|$|E

500|$|The album's lyrics {{generally}} {{deal with}} themes of adult love, meaningful sex, and romance. Andrew Ryce from Pitchfork interprets its [...] "overarching theme" [...] to be [...] "the highly sexualized {{seen through the}} lens of the eager and innocent." [...] Miguel's lyrics express modesty, yearning, vulnerability, and cheeky humor. Kelley likens his songwriting to Tony! Toni! Toné! and observes [...] "Little Richard-level insinuations" [...] and [...] "absurd provocations in the style of Akinyele". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis views that Miguel eschews braggadocio and is [...] "man enough to admit his own insecurities and question whether he's worthy of love—or lustful indulgence." [...] Kaleidoscope Dream also explores the anxiety and momentary nature of sex and clubbing. Consequence of Sound's Jeremy D. Larson views that Miguel employs a [...] "fangs-out approach to R" [...] similar to Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, writing that [...] "nothing shrouds Miguel and his directives, and worries, and prayers, and cat calls– it's all there, full of light and love, refracting through a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> rocks glasses, rainy windshields, and blood-shot eyes." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> legal and moral issues". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the American Journal of International Law, writing, [...] "In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, Targeted Killings is a welcome addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners." [...] University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the Boston University International Law Journal, [...] "Targeted Killings also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict". He concluded, [...] " [...] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on the willing use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group".|$|E

Minogue promoted the song by appearing in a Pepsi commercial, having the track as background music; it was included on the official soundtrack for 2001, and was singled out by the AllMusic staff {{as one of the best}} tracks. It has appeared on three of Minogue's greatest hits compilation albums: Ultimate Kylie (2004), Hits (2011), and most recently on The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012). It has appeared on one of Minogue's remix albums, this being Boombox (2008), which was remixed by Italian DJ's Bini & Martini.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} added to the set list and {{performed}} live during the second European leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in February and March 2014. For the performance, Beyoncé danced on a chair in a catsuit as <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> lights illuminated her. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the track became a stadium sing-along like the other hits performed by the singer. Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the singer's ad libs made listeners feel like she [...] "got tipsy and had the hots for her husband". Jay-Z joined her on stage to perform the song together at all six London shows of the leg, {{as well as at the}} final tour stop in Lisbon. A professionally recorded live performance of the song with Jay-Z from the tour aired on August 4, 2014 on Beyonce: X10, an HBO series documenting renditions of the song performed during The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.

[...] "Drunk in Love" [...] was part of the set list of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014). For the performance of the song, Beyoncé performed a chair dance and was accompanied by Jay-Z for his part which contained a short snippet of Kanye West's [...] "On Sight". While reviewing the opening concert of the tour, Rebecca Thomas writing for MTV News described the performance of the song as [...] "intoxicating".|$|E

500|$|Mike Wass {{from the}} website Idolator called the show a [...] "concert extravaganza {{in the style}} of Michael Jackson or Madonna" [...] praising the fact that the singer made a {{progress}} in the production values compared with her previous performances, mostly due to the expensive and high-quality visual projections which [...] "create atmosphere and add another layer to the production". He further praised the singer's [...] "extraordinary talent" [...] during the performances hailing her as [...] "the greatest entertainer of her generation" [...] after seeing the show which showcased [...] "an icon at top of her game". Tiffany Poole from The Oklahoman praised the fashion, video backdrops and [...] "some of the most impersonated dance moves on YouTube" [...] concluding, [...] "To say that Beyoncé puts on a good show would be grossly understated." [...] Billboard writer Gail Mitchell hailed the concert as a [...] "musical and visual extravaganza" [...] complete with a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> colorful imagery and dancing, which according to him enhanced the music complete with the singer's strong vocals, rather than overshadowing it. He concluded that the tour claimed [...] "the multi-talented artist's intent to join the rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer". Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that the tour followed the stadium trends containing [...] "big-budget movie clips and Broadway musical dance moves, with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras" [...] further hailing it as a [...] "Cecil B. DeMille spectacle". He finished his reviews by concluding, [...] "what makes this show's largely enervating juggernaut breathe is Beyoncé's tireless physical effort. She has created a literal body of work".|$|E
500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, if you ask me, is not a bad thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a <b>kaleidoscope</b> <b>of</b> prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E
