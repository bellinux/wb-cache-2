60|$|I am greatly grieved to {{say that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> It has {{gradually}} grown apparent, to my astounded gaze, that the ruling classes in England are still proceeding {{on the assumption that}} Prussia is a pattern for the whole world. If parts of my book are nearly nine years old, most of their principles and proceedings are a great deal older. They can offer us nothing but the same stuffy science, the same bullying bureaucracy and the same terrorism by tenth-rate professors that have led the German Empire to its recent conspicuous triumph. For that reason, three years after the war with Prussia, I collect and publish these papers.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the first}} {{essential}} element in government, coercion; a necessary but not a noble element. I may remark in passing that when people say that government rests on force they give an admirable instance of the foggy and muddled cynicism of modernity. Government does not rest on force. Government is force; it rests on consent or a conception of justice. A king or a community holding a certain thing to be abnormal, evil, uses the general strength to crush it out; the strength is his tool, but the belief is his only sanction. You might as well say that glass is {{the real reason for}} telescopes. But arising from whatever reason the act of government is coercive and is burdened with all the coarse and painful qualities of coercion. And if anyone asks what is the use of insisting on the ugliness of this task of state violence since all mankind is condemned to employ it, I have a simple answer to that. It would be useless to insist on it if all humanity were condemned to it. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to insist on its ugliness so long as half of humanity is kept out of it.|$|E

60|$|Ambrose's famous saying, that 'it hath {{not pleased}} the Lord {{to give his}} people {{salvation}} in dialectic,' has a profound meaning far beyond its application to theology. It is deeply true that our ruling convictions are less the product of ratiocination than of sympathy, imagination, usage, tradition. But from this {{it does not follow}} that the reasoning faculties are to be further discouraged. On the contrary, just because the other elements are so strong that they can be trusted to take care of themselves, it is expedient to give special countenance to the intellectual habits, which alone can check and rectify the constantly aberrating tendencies of sentiment on the one side, and custom on the other. This remark brings us to another type, of whom <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to speak shortly in this place. The consequences of the strength of the political spirit are not all direct, nor does its strength by any means spring solely from its indulgence to the less respectable elements of character, such as languor, extreme pliableness, superficiality. On the contrary, it has an indirect influence in removing the only effective restraint on the excesses of some qualities which, when duly directed and limited, are among the most precious parts of our mental constitution. The political spirit is the great force in throwing love of truth and accurate reasoning into a secondary place. The evil does not stop here. This achievement has indirectly countenanced the postponement of intellectual methods, and the diminution of the sense of intellectual responsibility, by a school that is anything rather than political.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to Clemens to {{say that}} Grant seemed to like finding himself in company with two {{literary}} men, one of whom at least he could make sure of, and unlike that silent man he was reputed, he talked constantly, and so far as he might he talked literature. At least he talked of John Phoenix, that delightfulest of the early Pacific Slope humorists, whom he had known under his real name of George H. Derby, when they were fellow-cadets at West Point. It was mighty pretty, as Pepys would say, to see the delicate deference Clemens paid our plain hero, and the manly respect with which he listened. While Grant talked, his luncheon was brought in from some unassuming restaurant near by, and he asked us {{to join him in}} the baked beans and coffee which were served us in a little room out of the office with about the same circumstance as at a railroad refreshment-counter. The baked beans and coffee were of about the railroad-refreshment quality; but eating them with Grant was like sitting down to baked beans and coffee with Julius Caesar, or Alexander, or some other great Plutarchan captain. One of the highest satisfactions of Clemens's often supremely satisfactory life was his relation to Grant. It was his proud joy to tell how he found Grant about to sign a contract for his book on certainly very good terms, and said to him that he would himself publish the book and give him a percentage three times as large. He said Grant seemed to doubt whether he could honorably withdraw from the negotiation at that point, but Clemens overbore his scruples, and it was his unparalleled privilege, his princely pleasure, to pay the author a far larger check for his work than had ever been paid to an author before. He valued even more than this splendid opportunity the sacred moments in which their business brought him into the presence of the slowly dying, heroically living man whom he was so befriending; and he told me in words which surely lost none of their simple pathos through his report how Grant described his suffering.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{was young}} once, even Frederick the Great. It was an {{appropriate}} {{preface to the}} terrible epic of Prussia that it began with an unnatural tragedy {{of the loss of}} youth. That blind and narrow savage who was the boy's father had just sufficient difficulty in stamping out every trace of decency in him, to show that some such traces must have been there. If the younger and greater Frederick ever had a heart, it was a broken heart; broken by the same blow that broke his flute. When his only friend was executed before his eyes, there were two corpses to be borne away; and one to be borne on a high war-horse through victory after victory: but with a small bottle of poison in the pocket. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> thus to pause upon the high and dark house of his childhood. For the peculiar quality which marks out Prussian arms and ambitions from all others of the kind consists in this wrinkled and premature antiquity. There is something comparatively boyish about the triumphs of all the other tyrants. There was something better than ambition in the beauty and ardour of the young Napoleon. He was at least a lover; and his first campaign was like a love-story. All that was pagan in him worshipped the Republic as men worship a woman, and all that was Catholic in him understood the paradox of Our Lady of Victories. Henry VIII., a far less reputable person, was in his early days a good knight of the later and more florid school of chivalry; we might almost say that he was a fine old English gentleman so long as he was young. Even Nero was loved in his first days: and there must have been some cause to make that Christian maiden cast flowers on his dishonourable grave. But the spirit of the great Hohenzollern smelt from the first of the charnel. He came out to his first victory like one broken by defeats; his strength was stripped to the bone and fearful as a fleshless resurrection; for the worst of what could come had already befallen him. The very construction of his kingship was built upon the destruction of his manhood. He had known the final shame; his soul had surrendered to force. He could not redress that wrong; he could only repeat it and repay it. He could make the souls of his soldiers surrender to his gibbet and his whipping-post; he could 'make the souls of the nations surrender to his soldiers. He could only break men in as he had been broken; while he could break in, he could never break out. He could not slay in anger, nor even sin with simplicity. Thus he stands alone among the conquerors of their kind; his madness was not due to a mere misdirection of courage. Before the whisper of war had come to him the foundations of his audacity had been laid in fear.|$|E

We extend the standard LDA method {{in order to make it}} incremental so that (i) it does not re-learn everything from scratch given new interactions (i. e., <b>it</b> <b>is</b> online) and (ii) it can discover and add a new context into its model when necessary.

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} {{a review of}} the field of humor research {{from the point of view}} of linguistics, and offers a pragmatic analysis and a discourse analysis of humorous examples from Modern Family. The applied (sub) fields, pragmatics and Critical Discourse Analysis, provide the methodology, and the field applied to, humor research, {{provides a}}ll of the questions. Although the amount of linguistically relevant research on humor is fairly minor, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> Therefore, the intention is not to make a case against the theory of any particular scholar, but rather to make a case against certain types of theories. Attardo‚Äôs pragmatic approach to humor explores the cooperative aspects of humor as a NBF mode of communication, as well as the need for a revision and extension of the idealized BF mode of communication. The most important consequence of this fact is that speakers are not committed to the truth of what they say in the NBF mode. At this point, considering a text humorous is simply being aware of its perlocutionary goal and/or effect. However, Attardo‚Äôs pragmatic approach to humor, although very useful when it comes to the individual humorous texts, cannot on itself account for the ‚Äúfunniness‚Äù of the mockumentary style of Modern Family. In this sense, CDA has proven itself to be the ideal discipline for investigating the contextual aspects of humor in connection to the mockumentary. It is emphasized that only a broad-based contextual theory is useful for the (pragmatic) study of humor, and it is demonstrated that a new theory which could accommodate the context much better than any of its predecessors is needed...|$|E
40|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{scholarly}} attention {{has been devoted to}} the low fertility situation experienced by a growing number of developed countries. In this context, the theoretical framework explicitly incorporating the issues of gender in explanations of low fertility has been gaining notable popularity. This dissertation is focused primarily on the application of McDonald's theory of gender equity to the fertility context of two post-communist "low" and "very low" fertility countries, namely Poland and Estonia. Additionally, it tests the relative importance of gender equity at the societal level and the level of the family, contrasts the results of using different operationalizations of gender equity in the family, and compares the effects of gender equity on male and female fertility. I estimate two sex-specific models for Poland and two-sex specific models for Estonia, which respectively use three and two independent variables capturing gender equity in different institutions {{as well as in the}} family. All the models use intended fertility as the dependent variable operationalized as either the intention to have the second or higher order birth or the number of additional children intended. The main findings of this dissertation support the gendered explanation of low fertility in Poland and Estonia. More specifically, they indicate that gender equity in the family significantly increases fertility intentions of Polish men and women and Estonian women but not men. However, in none of the models there is evidence that gender equity in institutions outside the family matters to fertility. All in all, the findings support the gendered approach to fertility. The results of my dissertation indicate that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important to pay attention to how we measure gender equity. I observe some variation in the findings depending on how stringent definition of equity is used. Finally, my research suggests that the importance of gender equity for women's fertility might be more universal but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also <b>not</b> completely <b>irrelevant</b> to the fertility of men. I conclude this dissertation with a discussion of the implications of my findings and the potential for future development of research in this area...|$|R

Die beiden Subsektoren haben h√§ufig unterschiedliche Interessen und Schwierigkeiten, beklagen sich aber dar√ºber, dass sie einer enorm hohen Steuerbelastung ausgesetzt sind, wobei der Bergbausektor besonders belastet wird. Diese hohe Steuerlast wird sowohl im nationalen als auch im internationalen Vergleich beklagt. Der erste Teil des Beitrages besch√§ftigt sich mit der relativen Besteuerung des MBS in den neunziger Jahren, unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Umsatzsteuer, der Exportauflagen und der Ressourcensteuer. Dar√ºber hinaus wird der Frage nachgegangen, ob der MBS als Teil einer allgemeinen Ausbeutung des Ressourcensektors steuerlich benachteiligt ist. Der zweite Teil des Papiers beleuchtet die Bem√ºhungen um die Steuerreform, seit der Amtszeit Putins. Da viele der Reformen, die den MBS betreffen, noch nicht verabschiedet wurden, kann in diesem Kontext noch keine abschlie√üende Bewertung vorgenommen werden. (ICD√úbers) "The {{mining and}} metals (M&M) sector has {{with regard to}} tax, as indeed with respect to other aspects of its existence, a dual character, being made up of miners and metal producers, usually {{in the guise of}} juridically {{independent}} enterprises. The two sub-sectors often have different interests and difficulties. Both claim to be harshly treated by the taxation system, with it being said that the M&M sector bears a tax burden double that of the economy as a whole, with the miners' burden being double that of the metal producers. Further, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> claimed, an enterprise in the Russian M&M sector bears a tax burden double that of the typical Western M&M firm. The miners claim to suffer from liability to a range of particular taxes related to their resource exploitation activities as well as heavy liability to assets tax. The difficulties claimed by the metal producers are based on their VAT liability at each stage of a multi-stage production process; they also find themselves subject to the sudden imposition of export duties. The claimed difficulties of the M&M sector {{can be seen in the}} context of the general discussion of whether the resource sector is the milk cow or wolf of the Russian economy. That discussion is generally focused on the oil and gas sector, but the complaints of the M&M sector of an unfair tax burden, on the one hand, and accusations of massive tax evasion and capital flight against the sector, on the other, suggest that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an <b>irrelevant</b> issue here. The main tasks, therefore, in the first part of this paper, dealing with taxation in the M&M sector in the 1990 s, is to examine relative tax rates in the two branches of the sector; the specific issues of the VAT and export duty liabilities of metal producers and the resource taxes faced by the miners; the tax evasion issue among metal producers, something generally although not always related to their export activities; and finally whether or not the M&M sector is being exploited through the tax system as part of a general exploitation of the resource sector. These questions will necessarily be approached with a degree of vagueness, given the paucity, inconsistency and uncertain reliability of the data. The second part of the paper will deal with efforts at tax reform since Putin came to the presidency, including an account of lobbying by the M&M sector within the tax reform process.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, to persuade {{us of the}} fact that the doubts of those times were not unfounded, in more recent years (from 1995 onwards) the {{theoretical}} acquisitions were added that I had achieved in the research I was carrying out on the verbal structure of the Sardinian language. We are a people that use the indicative little or are used to speaking as if its existence were almost unknown. We prefer to entrust the definition of our way of relating with reality to the hypothetic-dubitative triangulations of the conditional and the subjunctive, mainly because we tend to measure the reliability of what is apparent by using the yardstick of its paradigmatic ‚Äòshould be‚Äô. It is known that when I speak or write, the indicative is the more direct, frontal way of speaking the language I speak and that, on the contrary, the subjunctive and the conditional are more indirect, transversal ways of the mental-linguistic posture I can adopt in relating with those different from me and with the world. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> that when faced with an object (for example, a glass), the Sard who really speaks Sardinian will never say ‚ÄúThis is a glass‚Äù, but ‚ÄúThis should be a glass‚Äù (Custa diat essere una tazza): it means that his forma mentis immediately imposes a distancing, doubting attitude on him, rather than a simple, frontal assertive attitude, somehow diverging from a normal confident exchange with reality. It means that if, on the plane of objects, he manages to be sufficiently rich in ontological and designative assurance, on the plane of reality concerning action, on the other hand, it transpires that he is incredibly dilemmatic and inquiring. As if a form of split conscience were forbidding him to confidently immerse himself in his own reality or prevented him from feeling it entirely his. Or as though he were systematically opposing the world of appearances with the world of ‚Äúshould be‚Äù. All this does not have a mysterious genesis. It is perhaps the scarred outcome of wounds inflicted on the deep tissues of our internal physiognomy by the repeated expropriations of the world, subsequent to the great deal of external domination that came our way.|$|E
40|$|At {{least since}} Schumpeter {{published}} his work 'The Theory of Economic Development' (1912), a wide {{body of literature}} {{has focused on the}} evolutionary process behind firm growth and survival. Recently a growing interest is devoted to the variable 'location' as a critical factor, shaping firm performance. However, less {{attention has been paid to}} the region-specific characteristics that may play a relevant role in determining the growth and survival of a firm. Some works see university-based knowledge spillovers as one such factor (Audretsch and Lehmann 2005, Cassia et al. 2009). We extend this approach to the regional innovator network (RIN), promoting region-specific knowledge spillovers. RINs can be defined as networks that are built up by actors which cooperatively engage in the creation of new ideas and then economize the results (Cantner and Graf 2007). This economization can be realized within an existing firm or by the formation of a new venture. We focus in this paper on new ventures and investigate the influence a RIN has on their performance. If a new venture is connected to a well functioning RIN, knowledge spillovers may result in new ideas, promoting firm's survival. Moreover, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to which network a firm is connected since RINs may have different network characteristics. This paper intends to analyze those hypotheses theoretically and to test them empirically. Two data bases are used. First, patent data delivers RINs for all Thuringian sub-regions. The second data base we use contains information on innovative ventures founded in the period between 1990 and 2006, drawn from the register for commercial and private companies in Thuringia. Preliminary results for the innovator network of Jena show that there is a significant influence of the connection to the RIN of Jena on the survivability of Thuringian firms. Additionally, we find that the effect is promoted by regional proximity. Moreover, the effect is increasing until the eighth year and decreases afterwards until it vanishes. This result may confirm studies which found that there is a significant influence of social capital at the early stages of a firm's life...|$|E
40|$|When a {{dependency}} severs {{its formal}} {{connection with the}} mother country - irrespective of the century in which such severance occurs - the act of independence can neither eradicate the past nor solve all problems of the future. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the United States of America discovered that independence from Great Britain in itself did not abolish the need for rules and regulations by which men could anticipate {{with some degree of}} certainty the consequences of particular actions. Wholesale adoption of such English statutes as were suited to their condition offered a solution to the need for a body of laws. At the same time it avoided the need to draft and enact a comprehensive body of legislation at the moment the newly independent jurisdictional entities were faced with a wide assortment of internal and external problems. As colonists, the citizens of these newly independent states had clamored for the untrammelled use of the English statutes and the common law and had made much of Great Britain 2 ÃÜ 7 s refusal to concede such use. After 1776 they were free to use, adapt, or reject the statutes and the common law which they had claimed as their birthright and heritage. This study is designed to show the extent to which British statutes without re-enactment were declared to be or were considered to be in force or not in force in the twenty-eight separate jurisdictions of the United States during the first sixty years of the nation 2 ÃÜ 7 s independence. To keep the scope of the study within reasonable limits, no substantial effort was made to learn the extent to which English statutes were re-enacted as state or territorial statutes. That this re-enactment did occur in some jurisdictions is apparent upon an examination of the early state or territorial statutes, especially those dealing with subjects such as wills or uses or waste. That such re-enactment, together with the enactment of state or territorial acts geared to local needs, lessened the use of and emphasis upon English statutes is likewise apparent. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to note that codification of a jurisdiction 2 ÃÜ 7 s laws was more frequently than not coupled with a repeal of all English statutes heretofore in force.

40|$|Two recent {{criticisms of}} summary fiscal {{indicators}} are appraised: first, {{that they and}} the conventionally measured public sector balances from which they <b>are</b> derived <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently broadly defined; second, that they are meaningless {{because they do not}} reflect changes in the distribution of wealth between generations.
