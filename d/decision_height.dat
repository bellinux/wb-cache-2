The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the aircraft's passing the outer marker above the glide slope at an excessive airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flightcrew's preoccupation with the questionable information presented by the flight director system. The poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of nonstandard air traffic control services.|$|E

As the flight approached Anniston, confusion developed in the cockpit regarding the aircraft’s position and correct course to Anniston. While a visual approach was considered, visual conditions necessitated an instrument landing system approach to Runway 5 at Anniston. The crew experienced difficulty establishing the glideslope to Runway 5 and discussed minimum <b>decision</b> <b>heights</b> and missed approach procedures immediately before the aircraft impacted a heavily wooded ridge approximately 7.5 {{miles north of the}} Anniston airport in conditions of fog and low-lying clouds.

To meet this potential, research is needed for effective technology development and implementation of regulatory and design guidance to support introduction and use of SVS/EFVS advanced cockpit vision technologies in Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. A fixed-base pilot-in-the-loop simulation test was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center that evaluated the use of SVS/EFVS in NextGen low visibility ground (taxi) operations and approach/landing operations. Twelve crews flew approach and landing operations in a simulated NextGen Chicago O Hare environment. Various scenarios tested the potential for EFVS for operations in visibility as low as 1000 ft runway visibility range (RVR) and SVS to enable lower <b>decision</b> <b>heights</b> (DH) than can currently be flown today. Expanding the EFVS visual segment from DH to the runway in visibilities as low as 1000 RVR appears to be viable as touchdown performance was excellent without any workload penalties noted for the EFVS concept tested.

2500|$|At , the [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] warning again sounded on {{the flight}} deck. The crew {{continued}} the descent. According to MAK's report, at [...] (<b>Decision</b> <b>Height)</b> there was no [...] "landing" [...] or [...] "go-around" [...] call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, {{take control of the}} airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point the captain said [...] "Go around", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying [...] "go around". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. [...] One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert [...] "PULL UP" [...] activated and continued to sound {{for the remainder of the}} flight. [...] "PULL UP" [...] only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when [...] "PULL UP" [...] sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as [...] "terrain inhibit" [...] mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a [...] "SINK RATE" [...] warning followed by a [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to [...] and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, [...] "landing additionally, 120, 3 m"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.|$|E
