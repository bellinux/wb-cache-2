5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} {{because he was a}} Stalwart. The office-seeker decided {{that the only way to}} end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E

5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply {{in the coming days}} and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|In 1936–37, with Bradman back in {{the team}} as captain, Fingleton made a century in the First Test {{to become the first}} player to score {{consecutive}} centuries in four Test innings. He then made 136 in the Third Test, featuring in a partnership of 346 with Bradman after Australia <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> first two Tests; their stand set up victory and Australia came back to win the series 3–2. Fingleton made his only tour of England in 1938, and he was not successful, averaging only 20.50 in the Tests. Upon returning to Australia he played sporadically for his state before retiring in 1939–40.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, and determined that its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> ability to glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E
5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} political support, but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts {{to get rid of}} Antony.|$|E
5|$|Modern use of AAC {{began in}} the 1950s with systems for those who <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> ability to speak {{following}} surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and speech synthesis, have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with physical disabilities.|$|E

5|$|The 1965 FA Cup Final was an {{association}} football match between Liverpool and Leeds United on 1 May 1965 at Wembley Stadium, London.

Liverpool were appearing in their third final, they <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> previous two in 1914 and 1950, while Leeds were appearing in their first.|$|E
5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name refers {{to the fact that}} it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset is the result of a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> war, {{had no interest in}} dying {{for the sake of the}} Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1935, Barber {{was chosen}} to {{represent}} England in the Test series against South Africa. He played {{in the third and}} fourth Tests after England <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> second match to be 1–0 down in the series. He was one of six Yorkshire players selected that season. He scored 83 runs in four innings with a highest score of 44 in the fourth Test but England only drew these matches and he was left out of the final game. He also took a wicket with his second (and final) ball in Test cricket, when the match was heading towards an obvious draw. Following these matches, he {{was chosen to}} go on the non-Test playing tour by the Marylebone Cricket Club of Australia and New Zealand that winter under the captaincy of Errol Holmes. He was the senior professional but was not as effective as had been expected in Australia. However, in New Zealand he scored 365 runs in the matches against a New Zealand representative team, at an average of 60.83. He scored 797 runs in all first-class matches, average 41.94, including two centuries.|$|E
5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E
