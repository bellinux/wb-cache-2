I can compare them and I do compare them, because I {{know what it means to}} be called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E

[...] Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse.|$|E

500|$|As {{the smoke}} cleared, the Prussian {{infantry}} reformed its lines, preparing {{to pursue the}} fleeing Austrians. Snow began to fall and Frederick halted the pursuit. A few soldiers, perhaps only one, started to sing the well-known chorale, Nun danket alle Gott (Now Thank We All Our God); eventually the entire army may have joined in the song, although this story is likely apocryphal. Frederick pushed toward Lissa. Refugees from the battle had filled the town, and he found {{the courtyard of the}} local castle crowded with startled Austrian officers.

However, [...] "Ruleta" [...] was made available for digital download and streaming on 21 June 2017 by Global Records instead. Musically, it is an EDM and reggaeton track, containing influences of Indian and Caribbean music.

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> say I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 2013, Modern Vampires of the City {{had been}} named the year's best album {{in a number of}} polls; {{according}} to Acclaimed Music, it was the highest ranked record on average in critics' year-end lists. AllMusic named it one of the year's 50 best records, and it was voted the second best album of 2013 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it first in his own list for The Barnes & Noble Review, writing in an accompanying essay that Vampire Weekend had made an art pop record that [...] "simulates predigital warmth by tinkering with a dizzying panoply of studio stratagems and divides the most emotional songs of the band’s career into distinct parts impossible to enumerate due to how often the arrangements change up gorgeous drum tracks, but <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> you to dance to them". At the 2014 Grammy Awards, Modern Vampires of the City won in the category of Best Alternative Music Album.|$|E
500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." [...] Speaking of his manga in general, he said, [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> say I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, {{as long as they have}} entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, manga {{critic and}} editor of Viz's editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far the}} most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on Dragon Balls global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy. The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> say I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E

UGO Networks counted Mileena among the best-looking female ninja-type characters in all media, and ranked her as the [...] "seventh-finest" [...] female fighter in 2010, but advised to [...] "be careful around that big scary demon mouth she keeps under the skarf."

Bedford of WhatCulture placed her fourth on his list of [...] "most sexually charged" [...] female characters in gaming history, stating she [...] "has been confusing penises the world over since her creation".
