5|$|The Autobiography of Malcolm X was {{published}} in 1965, {{the result of a}} collaboration between human rights activist MalcolmX and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and MalcolmX's 1965 assassination. The Autobiography <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> conversion narrative that outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of MalcolmX's life.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|Most critics gave Ultima Underworld II {{positive}} {{reviews and}} lauded its graphics, design and nonlinearity. Complaints focused on its high system requirements and unrefined pacing. It {{has been placed}} on numerous hall of fame lists since its release. In reaction to the game's difficult development, Looking Glass altered its design approach: they streamlined ideas from the Ultima Underworld series to create System Shock. The team pitched a sequel to Ultima Underworld II multiple times, but Origin Systems rejected the idea. Arkane Studios' Arx Fatalis (2002) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> successor to the franchise originally pitched as a sequel. OtherSide Entertainment's upcoming Underworld Ascendant will be the first officially licensed entry in the series in over 23 years.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} core {{mechanics}} of Red Dead Revolver (2004), to which Redemption <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>spiritual</b> successor, by scaling {{it up to the}} standard of other Rockstar games. The fundamental goal for the game was to maintain the shooting mechanic and expand on other game features; like Revolver, the game's weapons were inspired by real weaponry. Carson explained that the team attempted to achieve realism with every feature of the game, including the horses, lassos, animal ecosystem, and the open world. To assure that the horse movements were as realistic as possible, the team motion captured a stunt horse, recording all movement. This created various problems; a gesture used by the stunt rider to communicate with the production team while on the horse was also the same command that made the horse rear. Furthermore, creating the horse's skeletal and muscular systems also presented a problem, and took several years to overcome. In the early stages of development, Rockstar decided which elements from Red Dead Revolver could be carried over; beyond the Dead Eye feature and the Western setting, very few other features remained. While Revolver represented many myths and iconic images of the American frontier, in Redemption the team tried to represent the reality of the time period. The tone of Redemption was aimed to be a combination of the primitive Wild West and early 20th century America; with the latter, America was developing into a modern and contemporary society, which the team tried to portray. In addition, while they felt that Revolver was constrained by its level-based structure, the team saw potential in creating a game similar to that of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series, in terms of quality, scope and detail.|$|E
