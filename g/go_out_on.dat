5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} {{from their}} Europa League group. Celtic played Inter Milan {{in the last}} 16 stage of the Europa League, rallying to draw 3–3 at Parkhead from an early 0–2 deficit in a pulsating encounter, then losing 1–0 in Milan to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> aggregate despite a highly credible performance.|$|E
5|$|When {{the album}} {{virtually}} failed to chart, {{the band was}} ready to split but had to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> tour to pay off its debts. On 27 January 1986, their final Melbourne concert was recorded and released as the live album The Final Wave in October. The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton did <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> {{the softer}} tyres in Q2, setting the fastest {{time of the}} session, the first to lap in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen {{went out on the}} harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after spinning in turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come. Max Verstappen put in a fast lap {{towards the end of the}} session, demoting his teammate Sainz, Jr. out of the top ten. Also eliminated were both Lotus and the second Sauber of Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn {{that he no longer}} lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers were able to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last {{to go out in}} Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of the}} session.|$|E

5|$|Cogan joined Gillingham in June 2007, being tipped by {{new manager}} Ronnie Jepson {{to fill the}} void left by Matt Jarvis, who had joined Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut for Gillingham in the 3–0 defeat at Watford in the League Cup on 14 August, and scored his first goal for the club in the 3–1 home victory over Leyton Orient on 2 October 2007. Following a string of bad results, Jepson resigned, and Mark Stimson was named as his {{permanent}} replacement in November 2007. Stimson saw Cogan as surplus to requirements, and offered him a chance to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> loan in February 2008. He rejected this initial chance, but subsequently joined Grays Athletic for a month on 14 March 2008, scoring five goals in thirteen Conference National matches. Gillingham released Cogan {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season, after he made just 21 appearances in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) is {{recruiting}} {{for the new}} all-girl show choir {{directed by}} Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), and asks Santana (Naya Rivera)—a member of the school's existing glee club, New Directions—to join. Santana balks at leaving Brittany behind, and when she and Brittany <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a dinner date, Santana tries to recruit her, but Brittany is unwilling to leave her New Directions friends. She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling Brittany that Santana has wished for her to join Shelby's glee club. Brittany believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings. New Directions co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) tries to persuade Brittany not to leave: he tells her that leprechauns are not real and that she is being stupid. Brittany, insulted, quits anyway.|$|E

5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, {{on the night of the}} planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Celtic's league title win in 1998 {{gave the}} club their first {{opportunity}} {{to compete in the}} rebranded UEFA Champions League in 1998–99. Two qualifying rounds had first to be negotiated, however. St Patrick's Athletic were knocked out, but Celtic were then paired up against a strong Croatia Zagreb side comprising several players who had helped Croatia to third place at the 1998 World Cup. The first leg took place in Glasgow amidst a row between Celtic players and the club bosses over bonuses. A Darren Jackson goal gave Celtic a 10 win to take over to Zagreb, but an insipid second leg performance in match dominated by Robert Prosinečki saw Celtic beaten 30 to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> aggregate. Only a fine showing from Jonathan Gould in goal saved Celtic from a more emphatic defeat. The club dropped into the UEFA Cup. Portuguese side Vitória de Guimarães were defeated 21 in both legs in the first round, but Celtic crashed out in the second round against Zürich 53 on aggregate as a public row between captain Paul Lambert and managing director Jock Brown raged behind the scenes.|$|E
5|$|When Tony fires him, Ste starts {{working at}} Chez Chez nightclub as a barman. Ste grows {{suspicious}} of Brendan Brady after he uses Carmel to smuggle drugs. Ste's former co-worker and love interest Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) returns following a {{stay with her}} ill grandmother. Brendan is jealous of their relationship, so gets Veronica (Lynsey McLaren) to kiss Ste, which Rae witnesses. They later make up after Ste convinces Rae that the kiss meant nothing. Following a drunken night, Ste kisses Brendan, who then throws him out. The next day, Brendan corners Ste and kisses him again. In the club a further day later, Ste follows Brendan to a cellar and moves to kiss him. However, Brendan punches Ste, who falls to the ground. Brendan then makes Ste tell Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) he was mugged. Ste avoids Brendan, still shaken by his actions. They resume their relationship and Ste tells Amy of his relationship. This prompts Brendan to attack Ste again. Amy realises that Ste is being abused. To hide their relationship, Brendan tells Ste to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a date with Rae. When Rae and Ste finally sleep together, Amy is hospitalised after being involved in a fire. Ste suspects Brendan started the fire. However, he denies it. Ste discovers Brendan's former lover Macca (Drew Dillon) is in hospital after being beaten up by Brendan. Macca and Ste end up kissing. Ste later confides in Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) about Brendan and the fire, however Dom is later charged.|$|E
