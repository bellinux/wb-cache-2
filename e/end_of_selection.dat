40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic basis of clinal adaptation by determining the evolutionary response of life-history traits to laboratory natural selection along a gradient of thermal stress in Drosophila serrata. A gradient of heat stress {{was created by}} exposing larvae to a heat stress of 36 degrees for 4 hr for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days of larval development, with the remainder of development taking place at 25 degrees. Replicated lines were exposed to each level of this stress every second generation for 30 generations. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>selection,</b> we conducted a complete reciprocal transfer experiment where all populations were raised in all environments, to estimate the realized additive genetic covariance matrix among clinal environments in three life-history traits. Visualization of the genetic covariance functions of the life-history traits revealed that the genetic correlation between environments generally declined as environments became more different and even became negative between the most different environments in some cases. One exception to this general pattern was a life-history trait representing the classic trade-off between development time and body size, which responded to selection in a similar genetic fashion across all environments. Adaptation to clinal environments may involve a number of distinct genetic effects {{along the length of}} the cline, the complexity of which may not be fully revealed by focusing primarily on populations at the ends of the cline...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the three-way interaction between symbionts, insect herbivores and their host plants during adaptation to resistant crop varieties. We conducted a long-term selection study (20 generations of continuous rearing) with a monophagous phloem-feeder, the brown planthopper [Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) ], on several resistant rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties. Planthopper fitness and {{the abundance of}} yeast-like symbionts (YLS) were monitored throughout the selection process. N. lugens populations collected from six regions in the Philippines adapted to the resistant varieties as noted by increasing body size and increased egg-laying. Adaptation was partially through physiological and behavioral changes apparent during feeding: Planthoppers on resistant plants had relatively high levels of xylem feeding compared with planthoppers on susceptible plants. YLS densities were highly dependent on the host rice variety. However, there were no consistent trends in YLS density during host plant switching and virulence adaptation: Compared to densities in planthoppers on the standard susceptible variety Taichung Native 1 (TN 1), YLS densities were consistently higher on PTB 33 (resistant), similar on IR 62 (resistant) and IR 65482 (moderately resistant) but lower on IR 22 (susceptible). Furthermore, YLS densities often remained the same despite improved planthopper fitness over generations. Our results {{do not support the}} hypothesis that changes in YLS density mediate planthopper adaptation to resistant varieties. However, slight reductions in YLS densities toward the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> on TN 1, IR 22 and IR 62 may indicate that YLS have lower functional significance where varieties and environmental conditions are constant between generations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the distribution of progressive selection generations in order to define the maximum efficiency of increasing yield in relation to the stage of selection procedure. Experimental procedure lasted five years on open-pollinated lines selected in two contrasting environments under low plant population. Mean grain yield of individual maize plants increased by 79 % from C 0 to C 4 generation in environment A and 32 % in environment B. Yield of individual plants was increased by 58 % from C 0 to C 2 when selection was fully practiced in environment B. The progressive reduction of CV values through the selection generations revealed gene fixation and lack of segregation in selected lines which tended to be more uniform and homozygous. Low to medium negative kurtosis and low to medium positive skewness, accompanied by a more “squared” shape of distribution curve may indicate more homozygous genetic material that was categorized in clusters of similar C 4 lines as was observed in environment A, depicting the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> procedure. In C 4, a breeder may choose from the upper part of distribution curve (higher yielding plants) in order to avoid possible selection of deleterious genes at the kurtosis-biased lower part of the distribution curve. Our findings suggested the selection of cultivars of narrow adaptation, because at the initial stages of the selection program the effect of environment lead to different genetic materials, favouring certain genotypes. In our study environment B favoured selection procedure for developing high yielding open-pollinated lines for breeding and farming purposes...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of 135 generations of selection for high scutellar bristle number in two lines M and M 3 {{derived from the}} same original mating of one female with 5 bristles by one male with 4 bristles, the latter being the wild-type canalised phenotype. Results are also given of two relaxed lines per line and of a reselection line M 2 derived from the first relaxed line of line M which had regressed almost to base population level. The effect of introducing the sc 1 allele into the M and M 3 selected backgrounds was studied at generations 39 – 44. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> the effect of an extra dose of sc+ was also studied in males of all selected backgrounds. The correlated responses in abdominal bristles were followed in all lines. —Considering their common origin, the selection lines differed markedly in pattern of scutellar response and in most other aspects observed, namely correlated responses in abdominals and p. c. scutellars, sex differences, and behaviour on relaxation. Selection limits for scutellar bristles in lines M and M 2 were {{equal to or greater}} than the most extreme reported in the literature. —The probit span of the canalised 4 bristle class decreased in each selection line as the mean scutellar bristle number increased, and increased again in the relaxed lines as the mean bristle number decreased. In the context of an hypothesis that canalisation at 4 bristle is due to regulation of the scute locus, this result is now interpreted as being due mainly to selection for poor regulators of sc+, in contrast to a previous interpretation that only the minor gene background was altered by selection, the canalisation (regulation) genotype not being affected. —Introducing the sc 1 allele into the selected backgrounds M and M 3 showed a reduced effect on sc 1 flies compared with sc+ flies, and an interaction of sc 1 and sc+ with selected background. sc 1 flies had about the same number of bristles in both backgrounds though the mean of sc+ flies in line M was about 3 σ higher than in line M 3. Dominance of sc+ to sc 1 was reduced slightly in M 3. However, the effect of an extra dose of sc+ at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> was about the same as in unselected in all lines, so the first or dominance level of regulation of the scute locus was not significantly affected by selection, though the second or canalisation level of regulation was. —A large positive correlated response in abdominal bristles occurred in all lines. The response in line M was about twice that in M 2 and M 3 and was in fact as large as can be obtained from direct selection on abdominals. In line M some genes may have been selected with a proportionately greater effect on abdominals than on scutellars. This is supported by the further observation in line M that the abdominal scores of flies with particular scutellar bristles scores increased as the scutellar mean increased. An attempt was made to apply to these results Rendel's (1962) model of competition between scutellars and abdominals for common bristle-making resources. This could not be done satisfactorily mainly because the assumptions in the model about the similarity of effects in scute and wild-type flies were not met in the present material...|$|E
40|$|Insecticides {{based on}} Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis {{have been used}} for {{mosquito}} and blackfly control for more than 20 years, yet no resistance to this bacterium has been reported. Moreover, in contrast to B. thuringiensis subspecies toxic to coleopteran or lepidopteran larvae, only low levels of resistance to B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis have been obtained in laboratory experiments where mosquito larvae were placed under heavy selection pressure for more than 30 generations. Selection of Culex quinquefasciatus with mutants of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis that contained different combinations of its Cry proteins and Cyt 1 Aa suggested that the latter protein delayed resistance. This hypothesis, however, has not been tested experimentally. Here we report experiments in which separate C. quinquefasciatus populations were selected for 20 generations to recombinant strains of B. thuringiensis that produced either Cyt 1 Aa, Cry 11 Aa, or a 1 : 3 mixture of these strains. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>selection,</b> the resistance ratio was 1, 237 in the Cry 11 Aa-selected population and 242 in the Cyt 1 Aa-selected population. The resistance ratio, however, was only 8 in the population selected with the 1 : 3 ratio of Cyt 1 Aa and Cry 11 Aa strains. When the resistant mosquito strain developed by selection to the Cyt 1 Aa-Cry 11 Aa combination was assayed against Cry 11 Aa after 48 generations, resistance to this protein was 9. 3 -fold. This indicates that in the presence of Cyt 1 Aa, resistance to Cry 11 Aa evolved, but at a much lower rate than when Cyt 1 Aa was absent. These results indicate that Cyt 1 Aa is the principal factor responsible for delaying the evolution and expression of resistance to mosquitocidal Cry proteins...|$|E

Carless* Monash University, Australia This longitudinal field study {{examined the relationship between}} perceived person–job (PJ) and person–organization (PO) fit and organizational attraction, intentions to accept a job offer, and actual job offer decision. Data were collected from 193 graduate applicants prior to the selection process, during the selection process, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>selection</b> process, and after job acceptance decision. The findings showed support for the hypothesis that perceptions of PJ and PO fit influenced attraction at different stages <b>of</b> <b>selection.</b> The second hypothesis that the relationship between perceptions of PJ and PO fit and intentions to accept a job offer are mediated by organizational attraction was partially supported. Mid-selection, the relationship between PJ fit perceptions and intentions to accept a job offer was mediated by organizational attraction; in contrast, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>selection</b> process, there was a direct relationship between PJ fit perceptions and intentions. PO fit perceptions were unrelated to intentions to accept a job offer. PJ and PO fit perceptions (before and during the selection process) were unrelated to actual job acceptance decision. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring that applicants have sufficient information about the job during the recruitment and selection process. Person–environment (PE) fit theories propose that positive responses occur when individuals fit or match the environment.
