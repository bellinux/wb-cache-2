50|$|Certain {{laminating}} techniques use {{two steps}} of applying the epoxy to form resin impregnated fiber <b>glass</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first step}} there is a resin solvent mixture which is partially cured so it will not redissolve in a second coating of the same mixture. The same resin mixture is subsequently given to the covered fiberglass with moderately cured resin in the second step. This second glaze which covers the first fills in the empty spaces between the fibers. The second coating is also only partially cured. This partial curing of the second layer furthers the curing of the first epoxy layer. This process also produces a thin sticky layer. The first coating acts like a sealed insulating sheet, preventing glass fiber contact with conductive planes. The second coating fills the planes and can form adhesive bonds to cores and conductive layers.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} work aims to replace <b>glass</b> fibres <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> molding compounds (SMC) by renewable natural fibres. These eco-efficient and cost effective SMC with natural fibres are gaining much {{attention in the}} automotive industry because of their specific properties. The specific objective of the work {{was to develop a}} high performance natural fibre hybrid SMC to meet the specifications required for automotive parts such as front fenders, body panels etc. Hemp fibres with and without a combination of a small amount of glass fibres were used to reinforce vinyl ester resin for making SMC. Different combinations of layers of hemp and glass fibres were made to prepare SMC. Mechanical properties, such as tensile and flexural properties and impact strength of the SMC prepared were found to be highly promising. The current OEM specifications for automotive parts, for example, rare lift gate and front fenders, recommend the composite should have tensile strength of 62 MPa and tensile modulus of 2 GPa (Source of Automotive Engineers Car Technology yearbook 2000 ” USA 2000, Body panels Properties). SMC prepared by the combination of 45 % of hemp fibres and 5 % of glass fibres showed tensile strength and modulus were more or less same or better than that of the requirements for car body parts such as rare lift gate and front fenders (Tensile strength greater than 62 MPa and tensile modulus of 2 GPa). Use of this SMC with natural fibre is an economically viable alternative to SMC with glass fibres {{and at the same time}} it helps reducing the green house gas emission, as there is lesser amount of synthetic resins and plastics...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we derive {{mathematical}} {{models for the}} glass sheet redraw process {{for the production of}} very thin <b>glass</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>In</b> the redraw process, a prefabricated glass block is fed into a furnace, where it is heated and stretched by the application of draw rollers to reduce its thickness. Redrawn sheets may be used in various applications including smartphone and battery technology. Our aims are to investigate the factors determining the final thickness profile of a glass sheet produced by this process, as well as the growth of out-of-plane deformations <b>in</b> the <b>sheet</b> during redraw. Our method is to model the glass sheet using NavierâStokes equations and free-surface conditions, and exploit small aspect ratios <b>in</b> the <b>sheet</b> to simplify and solve these equations using asymptotic expansions. We first consider a simple two-dimensional sheet to determine which physical effects should be taken into account in modelling the redraw process. Next, we derive a mathematical model for redraw of a thin threedimensional sheet. We consider the limits in which the heater zone is either short or long compared with the sheet half-width. The resulting reduced models predict the thickness profile of the redrawn sheet and the initial shape required to redraw a product of uniform thickness. We then derive mathematical models for buckling of thin viscous sheets during redraw. For buckling of a two-dimensional glass sheet due to gravity-induced compression, we predict the evolution of the centreline and investigate the early- and late-time behaviour of the system. For a three-dimensional glass sheet undergoing redraw, we use numerical solutions to investigate the behaviour of the sheet mid-surface. </p...|$|R
