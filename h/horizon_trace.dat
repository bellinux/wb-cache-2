The delta C- 13 records of phytane and lycopane confirmed the stratigraphic position of the positive carbon isotope excursion associated with OAE- 2, previously reported for total organic carbon (TOC) and beta,beta-homohopane. Sediments {{before and after the}} OAE- 2 interval were poor in organic matter (OM) and comprised numerous gravity flow deposits. The interval itself was composed of pelagic sediments with occasionally a much higher TOC content of up to 12. 7 %. The OAE- 2 sediments were characterized by a low amount of terrestrial OM since the dominant biological sources of the biomarkers were aquatic in origin. High hopane, pentamethylicosane (PMI), and squalane abundances in the OM-rich sediments pointed to a relatively high input of prokaryotes, partly derived from cyanobacteria, as suggested by the occasional occurrence of 2 -methylhopanes. PMI comprised both the regular and irregular isomer and changes in the delta C- 13 of PMI are thought to reflect contributions from methanogenic and methanotrophic archea. The high relative concentration of lycopane indicated that bottom water conditions were anoxic during large parts of the OAE- 2 interval. In one <b>horizon,</b> <b>trace</b> amounts of isorenieratane provided evidence for the occasional occurrence of photic zone anoxia. Taken together, the data imply that oceanic anoxia, and probably also high productivity, reached the northernmost part of the proto-North Atlantic during OAE- 2, albeit that photic zone anoxia was much less common than in the southern proto-North Atlantic...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands in}} world-wide energy {{consumption}} and oil depletion of large reservoirs {{have resulted in}} the need for exploring smaller and more complex oil reservoirs. Planning of the reservoir valorization usually starts with creating a model of the subsurface structures, including seismic faults and horizons. However, seismic interpretation and <b>horizon</b> <b>tracing</b> is a difficult and error-prone task, often resulting in hours of work needing to be manually repeated. In this paper, we propose a novel, interactive workflow for horizon interpretation based on well positions, which include additional geological and geophysical data captured by actual drillings. Instead of interpreting the volume slice-by-slice in 2 D, we propose 3 D seismic interpretation based on well positions. We introduce a combination of 2 D and 3 D minimal cost path and minimal cost surface <b>tracing</b> for extracting <b>horizons</b> with very little user input. By processing the volume based on well positions rather than slice-based, we are able to create a piecewise optimal horizon surface at interactive rates.

40|$|Hydrated {{minerals}} on {{the surface}} of Mars record past aqueous conditions and permit assessment of whether, where, and when the planet may have been habitable. Both phyllosilicates (e. g., clays) and hydrated sulfate minerals were recently identified via orbital near-infrared spectroscopy. This work uses the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) to characterize these and other aqueous mineral deposits, determining their composition, stratigraphy, and morphology. These properties and observations from other Mars-orbiting instruments allow formulation and testing of hypotheses on how Martian environments varied across space and time. The Mawrth Vallis region hosts the largest areal exposure of phyllosilicates, and CRISM spectral maps show these are compositionally stratified, with Al-clays overlying Fe/Mg-clays throughout the region. Geometric measurements reveal that the Al-clay <b>horizon</b> <b>traces</b> the Mawrth Vallis topography, implying that the Al-clays postdate this channel and may have formed via surface weathering. CRISM data further reveal the Ca-sulfate bassanite in outcrops underlying Fe/Mg-clays. Each hydrated unit exhibits ubiquitous meter-scale polygons or other fracture patterns, which correlate with composition. A CRISM-based survey of Mars' ancient southern highlands uncovers numerous aqueous deposits undetected at lower resolution. Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates are widespread, in some cases exposed by craters and elsewhere spanning the intercrater plains. Sulfates occur at higher latitudes than those observed previously, and are associated with phyllosilicates in some locations. Elsewhere, phyllosilicates co-occur with other hydrated silicates or putative chlorides. Fe/Ca-carbonate is also identified for the first time. These diverse mineral assemblages likely reflect diverse aqueous conditions. Columbus crater and others in Terra Sirenum contain layered deposits with diverse clays and sulfates. Digital elevation models, crater counts, thermal emission spectra, and hydrologic modeling results are added to CRISM and HiRISE image analyses to test several different hypotheses for these deposits, including their possible formation in a deep lake within Columbus crater during the Late Noachian Epoch.

40|$|Rays {{propagating}} through strongly laterally varying media exhibit chaotic behaviour. This {{means that}} initially close rays diverge exponentially, rather than {{according to a}} power law. This chaotic behaviour is especially pronounced if the medium contains laterally varying interfaces. By studying simple 2 -D and 3 -D versions of models with laterally varying interfaces, the importance of chaotic ray behaviour is determined. A model of the Moho below Germany produces sharp variations with epicentral distance {{of the number of}} arrivals. In addition, the number of caustics grows dramatically: up to 1200 caustics are present between a distance of 0 and 800 km. Using the theory of Hamiltonian systems, a more in-depth study of the chaotic character of the ray equations is obtained. It is found that for realistic heterogeneous models most of the relevant rays will exhibit chaotic behaviour. The degree of chaos is quantified in terms of predictability horizons. Beyond the predictability <b>horizons</b> ray <b>tracing</b> cannot be carried out accurately. For the models under consideration, the length from the source to the predictability horizon has an order of magnitude of 1000 km. The chaotic behaviour of the rays makes it necessary to use extensions of asymptotic ray theory, such as Maslov theory, to compute seismic waveforms. It is shown that pseudo-caustics, an important obstacle in computing Maslov synthetics, are a generic feature of the 2 -D laterally varying models that are studied. Eventually, the use of asymptotic methods is restricted because of the inaccuracy in the computation of the ray paths. Key words: chaos, layered heterogeneous media, Lyapunov exponent, ray tracing, regional seismology. ...|$|R

Statistical analysis identified antimony and arsenic as the two best pathfinders for gold. Arsenic, mercury and gold were discovered as the best pathfinders for antimony and mercury was also found to be a pathfinder for tungsten. Acceptable maximum thresholds in the O <b>horizon</b> for the <b>trace</b> element concentrations of gold (0. 0025 ppm), antimony (22 ppm) and tungsten (0. 65 ppm) as well as the pathfinders, arsenic (24 ppm) and mercury (0. 11 ppm) were calculated. The distribution of trace element concentrations was mapped over the study area using the calculated threshold values to identify possible locations of mineral occurences. A potential stibnite vein was identifie...|$|R
40|$|A radio echo-sounding {{profile of}} about 1200 km length was flown by the Alfred-Wegener Institute between the Kohnen and Dome Fuji deep {{drilling}} sites, providing a continuous record of internal ice layers which links both sites. Assuming these layers are isochronous surfaces, they provide an internal check on independently derived datings for both drilling sites. Here we use these internal layers to infer average accumulation rates. This is done {{both for the}} Holocene as for the last glacial period for the time intervals which separate the individual layers. Internal reflection <b>horizons</b> can be <b>traced</b> to about half the ice thickness and have a maximum age of ca. 70 ka BP. We use a high-resolution higher-order flow model of Dronning Maud Land nested into a 3 D thermomechanical model of the Antarctic ice sheet to reconstruct the flow history {{over the last few}} glacial cycles. A Lagrangian back-tracing algorithm provides the times of deposition of the layers along the profile for a forward experiment with a prescribed accumulation history. We then apply an inverse method to find the accumulation history which best fits the observed layer architecture. The model predicts no basal melting at Kohnen station, but gives evidence of basal melting at the Dome Fuji drill site. We further investigate the strain history around Dome Fuji to estimate the effect of normal stresses on the derived age-depth profile...|$|R
40|$|We used {{internal}} ice layers from a radio-echo sounding profile {{between the}} Kohnen and Dome Fuji deep drilling sites to infer the spatio-temporal pattern of accumulation rate {{in this sector}} of Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Continuous internal reflection <b>horizons</b> can be <b>traced</b> to {{about half of the}} ice thickness and have a maximum age of approximately 72. 7 ka BP. To infer palaeoaccumulation rates from the dated layers, we derived the thinning functions from a flow calculation with a high-resolution higher-order model of Dronning Maud Land embedded into a three-dimensional thermomechanical model of the Antarctic ice sheet. The method takes into account complex ice-flow dynamics and advection effects that cannot be dealt with using traditional local approaches. We selected seven time intervals over which we determine the average accumulation rate and average surface temperature at the place and time of origin of the layer particles. Our results show lower accumulation rates along eastern parts of the profile for the late Holocene (05 ka BP) than are shown by existing maps, which had no surface control points. During the last glacial period we find a substantially lower accumulation rate than predicted by the usual approach linking palaeo-accumulation rates to the condensation temperature above the surface inversion layer. These findings were used to fine-tune the relation between accumulation rate and temperature...|$|R

A Lagrangian back-tracing algorithm provides the places of deposition of the layers along the profile to correct for flow advection. Further corrections are made for local elevation changes.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a design methodology for op-timal transmission energy allocation at a sensor equipped with energy harvesting technology for remote state estimation of linear stochastic dynamical systems. In this framework, the sensor measurements as noisy {{versions of the}} system states are sent to the receiver over a packet dropping communication channel. The packet dropout probabilities of the channel depend on both the sensor’s transmission energies and time varying wireless fading channel gains. The sensor has access to an energy harvesting source which is an everlasting but unreliable energy source compared to conventional batteries with fixed energy storages. The receiver performs optimal state estimation with random packet dropouts to minimize the estimation error covariances based on received measurements. The receiver also sends packet receipt acknowledgments to the sensor via an erroneous feedback communication channel which is itself packet dropping. The objective is to design optimal transmission energy al-location at the energy harvesting sensor to minimize either a finite-time horizon sum or a long term average (infinite-time <b>horizon)</b> of the <b>trace</b> of the expected estimation error covariance of the receiver’s Kalman filter. These problems are formulated as Markov decision processes with imperfect state information. The optimal transmission energy allocation policies are obtained {{by the use of}} dynamic programming techniques. Using the concept of submodularity, the structure of the optimal transmission energy policies are studied. Suboptimal solutions are also discussed which are far less computationally intensive than optimal solutions.
