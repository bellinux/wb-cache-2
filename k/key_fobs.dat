Such an anti-theft device is designed to prevent hot-wiring of the vehicle. We have reverse-engineered all proprietary security mechanisms of the <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> and have found several weaknesses in the cipher and also in their usage and configuration by carmakers. We exploit these weaknesses in three practi-cal attacks that recover the 96 -bit <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> secret <b>key.</b> We end our article with suggestions to mitigate some of our attacks, something that knowledgeable users can do themselves. Electronic vehicle immobilizers have been very effective at reducing car theft. Such an immobilizer is an electronic device that prevents the engine of the vehicle from starting when the corresponding <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> is not present. This <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> is a low-frequency RFID chip typically embedded in the vehicle’s key. When the driver starts the vehicle, the car authen-ticates the <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> before starting the engine, thus preventing hot-wiring. In newer vehicles the mechanical ignition key has often been removed and replaced by a start button (see Figure 1 a). In such vehicles the immobilizer <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> is the only anti-theft mechanism that prevents a hijacker from driving away with the vehicle. In some countries, having such a...|$|R

50|$|Access control <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> are {{electronic}} <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> {{that are}} used for controlling access to buildings or vehicles. They are used for activating such things as remote keyless entry systems on motor vehicles. Early electric <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> operated using infrared and required a clear line-of-sight to function. These could be copied using a programmable remote control. More recent models use challenge-response authentication over radio frequency, so these are harder to copy and do not need line-of-sight to operate. Programming these remotes sometimes requires the automotive dealership to connect a diagnostic tool, {{but many of them}} can be self-programmed by following a sequence of steps in the vehicle and usually requires at least one working key.|$|E

50|$|NFC {{is a set}} of {{short-range}} wireless technologies, typically {{requiring a}} separation of 10 cm or less. NFC operates at 13.56 MHz on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s. NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an RF field that can power a passive target. This enables NFC targets to take very simple form factors such as unpowered tags, stickers, <b>key</b> <b>fobs,</b> or cards. NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.|$|E
40|$|Remote keyless-entry {{systems are}} {{systems that are}} widely used to control access to {{vehicles}} or buildings. The system is increasingly secured against hacking attacks by use of encryption and code algorithms. However, there are effective hacker attacks that rely on jamming the wireless link from the <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> to the receiver, while the attacker is able to receive the signal from the <b>key</b> <b>fob.</b> In this paper, we show that typical envelope receivers that are often used in remote keyless-entry systems are highly vulnerable to pulsed interference as compared to continuous interference. The effects of pulsed interference on envelope detectors are analyzed through both simulations and measurements. An improved receiver design would use synchronous receivers instead, which are not very sensitive against pulsed interference...|$|R
50|$|The {{functions}} of a remote {{keyless entry system}} are contained on a <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> or built into the ignition key handle itself. Buttons are dedicated to locking or unlocking the doors and opening the trunk or tailgate. On some minivans, the power sliding doors can be opened/closed remotely. Some cars will also close any open windows and roof when remotely locking the car. Some remote keyless fobs also feature a red panic button which activates the car alarm as a standard feature. Further adding to the convenience, some cars' engines with remote keyless ignition systems can be started by {{the push of a}} button on the <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> (useful in cold weather), and convertible tops can be raised and lowered from outside the vehicle while it's parked.|$|R
