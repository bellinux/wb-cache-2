We investigated whether speeded responses to potential emergency driving situations could be facilitated by the presentation of spatially-predictive (80 % valid; Experiment 1) or spatially-nonpredictive (50 % valid; Experiment 2) vibrotactile cues. Participants responded significantly more rapidly following both spatially-predictive and spatially-nonpredictive vibrotactile cues from the same rather than the opposite direction as the critical driving events.
