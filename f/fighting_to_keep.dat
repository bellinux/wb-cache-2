5|$|The Godesburg {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid on 15 October 1210 upon {{the order of}} Dietrich of Hengebach, the Archbishop of Cologne, who was himself in disputed possession of the Electorate and <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his position. Although his competitors deposed Dietrich in 1212, his successors finished and enlarged the fortress; it featured in chronicles of the subsequent centuries as both a symbolic and physical embodiment {{of the power of}} the archbishop of Cologne in his many struggles for regional authority in secular and ecclesiastical matters. Furthermore, by the late 14th century, the fortress had become the repository of the Elector's valuables and archives. By the mid-16th century, with the inclusion of residential facilities, the castle was popularly considered the Lieblingssitz, or the favorite seat (home), of the Electors.|$|E

Gradually more visitors went to {{the islands}} to enjoy their beaches and mild climate. Since the late 20th century, the Gullah people—led by Penn Center and other determined community groups—have been <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> control of their traditional lands. Since the 1960s, resort development on the Sea Islands has greatly increased property values, threatening to push the Gullah off family lands which they have owned since emancipation. They have fought back against uncontrolled development on the islands through community action, the courts, and the political process.|$|E

As the situation in Normandy deteriorated for Germany and the front was pushed back to the Seine, Mohnke {{was one of the}} few to lead organized resistance on the western bank in order to protect the river crossings there. After hard fighting, Mohnke was awarded the Knight's Cross on 11 July 1944. He led this Kampfgruppe until 31 August, when he replaced the badly wounded Theodor Wisch as commander of the Leibstandarte (LSSAH).|$|E
25|$|Because of Wang Yanzhang's abilities, he was {{promoted}} gradually {{in the ranks of}} Zhu Quanzhong's army and often served under Zhu in Zhu's campaigns. In 909, by which time Zhu had forced Tang's last emperor Emperor Ai (Emperor Yizong's grandson) to yield the throne to him and established Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu, Later Liang forces were attacking Later Liang's western rival Qi as the Qi general Liu Zhijun was attacking the Later Liang vassal Han Xun (韓遜) the military governor of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). The Later Liang forces, commanded by the general Kang Huaizhen (康懷貞), fell into a trap that Qi forces laid for them, and it was said that they would have been completely annihilated had not for Wang's efforts in <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> an escape path open.|$|E
25|$|The format {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1987, after {{the decision was made}} to reduce the top flight from 22 to 20 clubs over the next two seasons; initially, the play-offs involved the team finishing immediately above the relegation places in a given division and the three teams who finished immediately below the promotion places in the division below – essentially one team was <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their place in the higher division while the other three teams were attempting to take it from them. In 1989, this was changed—instead of teams from different divisions playing each other, the four teams below the automatic promotion places contested the play-offs. The first season of this arrangement saw the final being contested in home and away legs. The four teams play-off in two semi-finals and a final, with the team winning the final being promoted. Originally the semi-finals and the final were all two-legged home-and-away affairs, but from 1990 onwards the final is a one-off match. It is in this format that the play-offs continue today. A proposal to have six teams rather than four competing for the final place was defeated at the league's AGM in 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Blizzard, {{who were}} now {{being run by}} former Sting President Clive Toye, {{were one of the}} franchises <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the NASL afloat. Though it was a battle, Chicago took game one of the series at Comiskey Park, 2–1 on a late goal by Manny Rojas. This gave the Roy's Sting the unique {{opportunity}} to earn a second league title in the same city as their first. This time they would be playing at the more intimate Varsity Stadium instead of Exhibition Stadium, the site of the Soccer Bowl '81 triumph. After 68 minutes Chicago had built a 2–0 lead on goals by Mark Simanton and Pato Margetic. Toronto stormed back by scoring two goals in a 1:30 span to level the match in the 73rd minute. With 8:27 remaining in regulation Margetic notched his 6th goal of the playoffs off a pass from Rojas. Chicago goalkeeper Victor Nogueira was impressive in both matches, especially in the final minutes and the Sting held on to win their second title in four years. Margetic, with three of Chicago's five goals, was named the MVP of the finals.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November, 5,000 {{soldiers}} {{belonging to}} 12th Regular Army were deployed to Swat {{to bolster the}} already 15,000 para-military and police that were already <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> what ground of the district they still held. The Pakistan Army mounted a number of operations to counter the militants and their expanse. However, on November 15, militants advanced from Swat, which was now under their control, into the next district to the east, Shangla. That day Alpuri, which is the district headquarters of Shangla, fell to the Taliban insurgents. As the militant force was coming towards the town the police force deserted without a fight. The military quickly turned the focus of their operations now not to take back Swat but to keep Shangla. By 17 November, an estimated 100 militants {{were killed in the}} fighting. On November 25, Taliban forces decided to leave Alpuri because of the huge Pakistani infantry forces moving towards the area. The Taliban evacuated Alpuri and took up positions on the mountaintops around the town. Meanwhile, in Swat on 26 November, Pakistani artillery resulted in the death of two top Taliban commanders. With artillery fire and ground forces, the Pakistani Army tried to recapture many strategic hilltops from the Taliban and indeed, they managed to capture some of the hilltops and drove the Taliban back to the Swat district. The fighting for the hilltops left 4 Pakistani soldiers and 45 Taliban forces, led by Mullah Fazlullah, dead. On 27 November, Pakistani forces secured Shangla.|$|E
25|$|While {{the cannon}} were roaring, Maréchal Masséna was near Raasdorf, forming his men for their march south. Towards 11:00, he rallied {{many of the}} men who had routed during the attack on Aderklaa and then had rations of brandy distributed, in order to boost morale. With a part of his troops still <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Aderklaa, Masséna {{directed}} his men towards Essling, aiming to threaten Klenau's Corps, which was by now in an advanced position behind the French line, but which had made no attempt to threaten the rear of Napoleon's army. The passive posture of the Austrian Corps was due partly to a lack of orders to advance further and partly to the fact that Klenau's relatively small force was by now {{out of touch with the}} main Austrian force. Nevertheless, Masséna's task remained daunting. Some of his troops had to march no less than eight kilometers in vulnerable column formations, moving along the front of an enemy who had deployed numerous cavalry and artillery. Masséna displayed his usual skill and tenacity, using his available cavalry to screen his men and taking advantage of the high corn crops to hide his advance. The French troops, although out of range from enemy musketry, were under constant bombardment from the Austrian artillery. The Austrian cavalry attempted an attack, which nearly reached the carriage of Masséna, whose aides were forced to draw swords and defend him as French cavalry stepped in to repulse their Austrian counterparts. Towards noon, after marching some six and half kilometers in 90 minutes, the leading elements from Masséna's Corps, namely Marulaz's cavalry and Legrand's infantry were within sight of the enemy-occupied village of Essling.|$|E

Clevett gave his highest match rating of 8 out of 10 in his review to the X Division and World Tag Team Championship matches. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to The Outlaw versus Ron Killings, Samoa Joe versus Sonjay Dutt, and AMW versus the 3Live Kru bouts. Clevett gave the main event a 7 out of 10.|$|E
