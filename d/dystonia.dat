5|$|Physiotherapy and {{occupational}} therapy are beneficial {{for patients with}} the neurologic form of the disease. The copper chelating treatment may take {{up to six months}} to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, <b>dystonia,</b> and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from <b>dystonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mouthguards {{and other}} {{physical}} protective devices {{may be useful}} in preventing damage to the lips and tongue due to the orofacial chorea and <b>dystonia</b> typical of chorea acanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with neuroacanthocytosis {{also often}} suffer from parkinsonism, the {{uncontrolled}} slowness of movements, and <b>dystonia,</b> abnormal body postures. Many affected individuals also have cognitive (intellectual) impairment and psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} anxiety, paranoia, depression, obsessive behavior, and pronounced emotional instability. Seizures {{may also be a}} symptom of neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E
25|$|Some focal <b>dystonias</b> {{have been}} proven treatable through {{movement}} retraining in the Taubman approach, {{particularly in the case}} of musicians. However other focal <b>dystonias</b> may not respond and may even be made worse by this treatment.|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} and classification of the <b>dystonias</b> was recently revisited. In the new 2013 classification, the <b>dystonias</b> are subdivided {{in terms of}} their etiology according to whether they are the result of pathological changes or structural damage, have acquired causes or are inherited. As hereditary <b>dystonias</b> are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, we sought to classify them according to the new recently defined criteria. We observed that although the new classification is still the subject of much debate and controversy, it is easy to use in a logical and objective manner with the inherited <b>dystonias.</b> With the discovery of new genes, however, {{it remains to be seen}} whether the new classification will continue to be effective...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{cervical}} <b>dystonias</b> (CD), {{the most}} prevalent form of defined <b>dystonias</b> in adults, are characterized by involuntary, abnormal movements of the head, and/or by the involuntary adoption of various head postures.

5|$|Gaven {{performed}} in a cabaret, called The Girly Show, at a fundraising gala for the Blank Theatre Company on August 15, 2005. It consisted of an all-female cast singing songs by Michael John LaChiusa, with LaChiusa playing the piano. On December 15, 2008, celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of The Who's Tommy, Gaven {{and the rest of}} the original Broadway cast reunited for a concert at August Wilson Theatre in New York City. This performance was a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, the Broadway Dreams Foundation, and the Bachmann-Strauss <b>Dystonia</b> & Parkinson Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Dodd {{was born}} on 27 April 1992, and is from Arcadia, New South Wales. She has sacral {{agenesis}} and spina bifida with upper limb <b>dystonia,</b> and is missing four vertebrae in her back. When she was about a year old, her kidneys started failing. Her entire renal system needed to be reconstructed. She has two older brothers. She can walk with the aide of a caliper, and also uses a wheelchair. , she is a horse riding teacher and student at the University of Western Sydney where she is majoring in sports and exercise science.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (<b>dystonia,</b> akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
40|$|A {{new form}} of {{clinical}} treatment is proposed for <b>dystonias</b> and torticollis using flunitrazepan (FN), a powerful agonist of all benzodiazepine receptors of GABA neurons. FN has a specific effect in dystonic patients, specially those in which the hypnotic effect of this drug is absent or diminished, thus suggesting the existence of two different neurochemical categories of <b>dystonias...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: The exact {{origin of}} focal <b>dystonias</b> {{has not been}} elucidated so far. Aberrant {{plasticity}} of the brain cortex is suspected to be a crucial factor {{in the development of}} this group of movement disorders. The aim {{of this article is to}} summarize recent findings on the etiopathogenesis of focal hand <b>dystonias</b> with a focus on the role of abnormal cortical plasticity...|$|R
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or <b>dystonia</b> may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and <b>dystonia</b> and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, <b>dystonia</b> and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
40|$|The primary <b>dystonias</b> are a {{particular}} group of <b>dystonias</b> of presumed genetic origin, with a wide age of onset and variable progression.  The diagnosis is, therefore, a challenge {{and the issue of}} the genetic investigation presents frequently in clinical practice. In the past few years several gene mutations have been identified as causative of primary <b>dystonias.</b> The choice of molecular testing is complex, given the clinical specificities and low frequency of these entities and the cost of genetic testing. It must follow observation by specialized clinicians highly differentiated in this area and be supported by a rational plan of investigation. The Centro Hospitalar São João Neurogenetics Group, a multidisciplinary team of Neurologists and Geneticists with special interest in neurogenetic disorders, devised consensus recommendations for the investigation of the genetic etiology of the primary <b>dystonias,</b> based on international consensus documents and recent published scientific evidence. This manuscript adopts the new classification system for genetic movement disorders, allowing for its systematic and standardized use in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Though {{multiple}} {{medical and}} psychiatric causes of torticollis have been described, cervical <b>dystonias</b> resulting from distant somatic dysfunctions have not. This {{article describes the}} treatment of a 62 -year-old woman in whom refractory retrotorticollis of surmised pelvic etiology developed after a fall. Structurally, cervical <b>dystonias</b> have been addressed as problems that originate {{in the head and}} neck, but this limited view of the musculoskeletal component of torticollis may prevent physicians from directing osteopathic manipulative treatment to the underlying problem...|$|R
25|$|Secondary <b>dystonia</b> {{refers to}} <b>dystonia</b> {{brought on by}} some {{identified}} cause, such as head injury, drug side effect (e.g. tardive <b>dystonia),</b> or neurological disease (e.g. Wilson's disease).|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{conditions}} have similar symptoms to SPS, including myelopathies, <b>dystonias,</b> spinocerebellar degenerations, primary lateral sclerosis, neuromyotonia, and some psychogenic disorders. Tetanus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperpyrexia, chronic spinal interneuronitis, serotonin syndrome, Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Isaacs syndrome {{should also be}} excluded.|$|R
50|$|Blepharospasm {{may also}} come from {{abnormal}} {{functioning of the}} brain basal ganglia. Simultaneous dry eye and <b>dystonias</b> such as Meige's syndrome have been observed. Blepharospasms {{can be caused by}} concussions in some rare cases, when a blow {{to the back of the}} head damages the basal ganglia.|$|R
25|$|These {{forms were}} {{previously}} considered independent disorders and were mainly classified among neuroses. A modern definition of <b>dystonia</b> was worded some years later, in 1984. During {{the following years}} it became evident that <b>dystonia</b> syndromes are numerous and diversified, new terminological descriptors (e.g., <b>dystonia</b> plus, heredodegenerative dystonias, etc.) and additional classification schemes were introduced. The clinical complexity of <b>dystonia</b> was then fully recognized.|$|E
25|$|Oromandibular <b>dystonia</b> {{is a type}} of <b>dystonia</b> {{marked by}} {{forceful}} contractions of the lower face, which causes the mouth to open or close. Chewing motions and unusual tongue movements may also occur with this type of <b>dystonia.</b>|$|E

40|$|Twenty two {{patients}} with cervical and axial <b>dystonias</b> {{were treated with}} Japanese type A botulinum toxin. Injections were given repeatedly at intervals of 28 - 30 days to carefully chosen muscles with increased activities, with a maximum dose per session of 300 units. The maximum improvements in subjective and objective ratings were obtained only after repeated injections. No anti-toxin antibodies were detected; nor did any muscle fail {{to respond to the}} toxin. During the treatment, previously "silent" muscles were activated to reproduce the original abnormal posture, as if driven by a central motor programme. This resistance to treatment was overcome by injecting the toxin into newly activated muscles. Repeated injections are thus required to override central mechanisms in <b>dystonias</b> or to maximise drug delivery to large muscles. Antibody development may be controlled by the use of a less immunogenic toxin...|$|R
40|$|Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a catecholamine-depleting agent {{initially}} {{developed for}} the treatment of schizophrenia, when tested for other indications, has proven to be more useful {{for the treatment of}} a variety of hyperkinetic movement disorders. These disorders include neurological diseases characterized by abnormal involuntary movements such as chorea associated with Huntington’s disease, tics in Tourette’s syndrome, dyskinesias and <b>dystonias</b> in tardive dyskinesia, also primary <b>dystonias</b> and myoclonus. This review will include and discuss studies published during the period of 1960 – 2006 regarding the clinical efficacy and tolerability of TBZ in Huntington’s disease (HD). It will also review the chemistry, pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug and its mechanism of action compared to that of reserpine, the only similar compound. This review emphasizes the advantage of TBZ over dopamine-depleting compounds used in the treatment of chorea and reveals its clinical efficacy and side effects...|$|R

40|$|Botulinum A toxin (Botox) is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of many muscular <b>dystonias.</b> However, the relief of the sustained and abnormal postures induced by Botox administration is not fully explained. In this work the possibility was considered that Botox can produce a block not only at the alpha motor endings, but also at the gamma motor endings, consequently reducing the spindle inflow to the alpha motoneurons, which have a great role in maintaining the tonic myotatic reflex. Jaw muscle spindle discharge was recorded before and after Botox injection in the deep masseter muscle. The drug consistently reduced the spindle afferent discharge. Such an effect is suggested to be direct on gamma endings as: i) muscle tension was not modified by Botox during the recording time; ii) saline administration never changed the spindle discharge. The Botox effect on muscle spindles suggests that the relief from <b>dystonias</b> could be due not only to a partial motor paralysis, but also to a decrease of the reflex muscular tone...|$|R
