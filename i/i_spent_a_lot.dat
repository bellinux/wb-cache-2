500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the method of making a payment can influence the willingness to pay and consumption behavior. In this manuscript, we argue that payment mechanisms differ from each other along the dimensions of transparency, and that the degree of transparency correlates positively with the pain of paying using the mechanism, and negatively with consumption and spending. We replicate previous experimental results using quasi-experiments from the field, and find that the lower the payment transparency, the greater is the consumption. However, this effect is weak for products whose consumption rates are inflexible.

40|$|The {{occasion}} for this colloquium is that Dirac was born 100 years ago last August. But why am I giving this talk, you should ask? Well, I took my first quantum mechanics course 51 years ago, and struggled with his great book.

40|$|Much of my (KMF) {{writing and}} {{research}} has focused on the exploration of individual and cultural values. I began my academic work using ideas and methods borrowed from the field of social psychology and carried these same tools with me when I undertook a cross-cultural study of values and aspirations. However, over time, I have come to see that the limited perspective of social psychology so narrows the field of vision that it crops out portions of the human landscape that imbue values with meaning. I have since widened my scope to incorporate rich ideas from social and political theory (and other disciplines), and through this interdisciplinary inquiry on hatred hope that a broadened perspective will enrich our understanding of social values. In particular, it seems fruitful to examine hatred not only by looking at the causes and cures long promulgated by social psychologists (empathy, social contact, group dynamics, etc.), but also by attending to concerns of social theorists who explicate the risks (alienation? emotional isolation? hate?) that accompany modern society’s emphasis on individualism. After a number of years working mainly in the field of academic and professional counseling psychology, my (FCR) interests turned sharply in the direction of theoretical and philosophical psychology, including the philosophy of social science. <b>I</b> have <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time trying to identify what I and others call “hidden assumptions, ” potent but commonly unidentified conceptual and moral underpinnings of psychological theories and the interpretations of research findings. Exploring the topic of hate seems quite valuable in this regard, given that efforts to cope with the enduring threat of hate and violence, in ways that are often not fully appreciated or acknowledged, seems to me to motivate and shape a great deal of modern social science and professional psychology. I hope the reverse is true as well, that these reflections shed some light on the broad topic of hate and violence. Shame exists everywhere there is a mystery...|$|R
5000|$|The major talking {{point in}} 1992 and {{possibly}} ever since, was {{the debut of}} a new car at Hednesford on 12 April. The car in question {{is probably the most}} famous Hotstox ever. Its builder has often been accused of being responsible for the near extinction of the Hotstox formula. Andy Smith takes up the story [...] "I had run Ray Witts close in the ‘91 points and decided to build a new car for ’92. <b>I</b> had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time around the F1 scene and gathered <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of ideas for the car. One of them was offset. No one had actually used <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of offset and I soon realised that to get the engine over {{to the inside of the}} chassis, I needed to get it lower too. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of the other cars had massive cabs, mine featured a much smaller cab and my car was the first to feature spring boxes for weight jacking. It was a rush to get it ready for Hednesford and I’d had no help from my dad until right at the last minute when I was struggling to get the car finished in time. We managed to get it down to Hednesford the day before for some practice but that didn’t go too well as we had a misfire. We managed to cure that and make it to Hednesford the next day. I really didn’t know how well the car would go but it went like a rocket !. I won heat, Final and GN from the lap handicap, it just flew. The car was then weighed and found to be underweight and I was banned for 3 or 4 meetings and had my points and prize money taken away. It was a genuine mistake, I’d rushed to get the car done and didn’t even consider the weight. What made it worse was that they had weighed some cars the previous week and found some cars under and overweight but had let them go as long as the drivers put it right for the next meeting. I totally agree that I should have had my points and money taken off me but I can’t help but think that they had been harsh with me." ...|$|R
