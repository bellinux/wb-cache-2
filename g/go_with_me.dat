25|$|President Young amongst {{other things}} {{said he knew}} the {{goodness}} of the people, and the Lord bears with our weakness; we must serve the Lord, and those who <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> will keep the Word of Wisdom, and if the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever them from the Church. I will draw the line, and know who is for the Lord and who is not, and those who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will {{cut off from the}} Church; I throw out a challenge to all men and women.|$|E
500|$|The bass aria {{illustrates}} the words [...] "" [...] (Soon to the right, soon {{to the left}} my erring steps lean) in jagged motifs and a frequent switch between winds and strings. In the middle section steady steps picture [...] "" [...] (Yet <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> my Savior). The final part combines both elements. Gardiner notes that Bach uses the winds and strings in concerting choirs (cori spezzati), enforced by positioning them on galleries, one of them right, the other left of the singers. The technique had been practised in Venice in the late sixteenth century and introduced in Germany by composers such as Heinrich Schütz who studied in Venice. Gardiner observes also a hint at the style of French opera which Bach may have heard, traveling as a boy in northern Germany, at the Hamburg opera, in Celle or Lüneburg.|$|E

500|$|After {{the deputies}} {{went into the}} basement, he was asked by Arnaud to come with him, who said to him, [...] "You've got to come and <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> now." [...] However, Logan adamantly refused, saying [...] "I told you, I'm not going with you anywhere". Logan then ran up the {{staircase}} and went into his former bedroom, now used as a guest bedroom, and closed the door. Arnaud and Magruder {{followed him to the}} room and stood outside the door. Arnaud tried to convince Logan {{to come out of the}} room, as Logan's parents and Magruder, who had joined the department in February 2001, stood by, watching. After Logan's parents left the scene and went to the house's master bedroom, Logan became belligerent and uncooperative. Partially hidden behind a closet door, Logan retrieved a semi-automatic 9mm-chambered handgun and fired at Arnaud, where a bullet struck him in the throat and severed his carotid artery. Logan then shot Arnaud fatally in the chest.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E

500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you without end / When will you <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
500|$|Within a few weeks, Hall {{was making}} {{preparations}} for a sledging trip {{with the aim}} of beating Sir William Parry's furthest north record. Mistrust amongst the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that [...] "I cannot trust that man (Captain Budington). I want you to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship." [...] There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for preservation of specimens. Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior, and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition. With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sledges with first mate Chester, and the native guides Ebierbing and Hendrik, leaving on Oct 10, 1871. The day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the chronometers at the right time every day. In his book Trial by Ice, Richard Parry postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Jena. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence. This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20years of experience.|$|E

2500|$|Rav Nachman {{taught that}} the angel of whom God spoke in [...] was Metatron (...)

Once a heretic asked Rav Idit why [...] says, [...] "And to Moses He said, ‘Come up to the Lord,'" [...] when surely God should have said, [...] "Come up to Me." [...] Rav Idit replied {{that it was the}} angel Metatron who said that, and that Metatron's name {{is similar to that of}} his Master (and indeed the gematria (numerical value of the Hebrew letters) of Metatron (...) equals that of Shadai (...) , God's name in [...] and elsewhere) for [...] says, [...] "for my name is in him." [...] But if so, the heretic retorted, we should worship Metatron. Rav Idit replied that [...] also says, [...] "Be not rebellious against him," [...] by which God meant, [...] "Do not {{exchange}} Me for him" [...] (as the word for [...] "rebel," [...] ( [...] , tameir) derives from the same root as the word [...] "exchange"). The heretic then asked why then [...] says, [...] "he will not pardon your transgression." [...] Rav Idit answered that indeed Metatron has no authority to forgive sins, and the Israelites would not accept him even as a messenger, for [...] reports that Moses told God, [...] "If Your Presence does not <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> do not carry us up from here." ...|$|E
