500|$|Artist Brian Bolland's {{version of}} the Joker stemmed in part from his having {{recently}} seen the film The Man Who Laughs. Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker. He recounted, [...] "I thought about {{it in terms of}} who's my favorite writer at the moment, what hero <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> love to do, and which villain? I basically came up with Alan, Batman and the Joker." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the album's release, it was {{reported}} that A Little More Personal (Raw) was certified Gold in Taiwan, and that Lohan was going on tour with the album in the country. [...] "I just found this out today - my album went gold there. It was a great feeling because it was very unexpected", the singer revealed. [...] "I would love to (tour Taiwan). I haven't toured at all at this point, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> love to do that. It's a great feeling to know that people in other places and other countries are aware of my music and what I do". The tour, however, didn't happen for unknown reasons. Lohan promoted the album in a few television appearances, including at MTV's Total Request Live {{on the day of the}} album's release, and at The Ellen DeGeneres Show on December 14, 2005. The singer performed [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and her cover of [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] in the 2005 American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2010 US Open tennis tournament Pakistan's Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi said, [...] "For me, as a Muslim, that's {{what makes}} America the {{greatest}} {{country in the}} world – freedom of religion, freedom of speech.

2500|$|Amy Sherman-Palladino, {{who came}} from a {{background}} of writing for half-hour sitcoms, had Gilmore Girls approved by The WB after several of her previous pitches were turned down. On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I {{thought that would be}} wonderful ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ... There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought—that's something that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> love to put out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles Saatchi, who {{was best}} known as the most high-profile, high-spending {{collector}} of contemporary British art, bought My Bed (1998) for £150,000 ($248,000) from Lehmann Maupin's [...] "Every Part of Me's Bleeding," [...] the exhibition that won the artist a nomination for the 1999 Turner Prize. In 2013, on the occasion of a Christie's London sale that raised a total of 3.1million pounds ($5million) in aid of the Saatchi Gallery's policy of free entry, To Meet My Past (2002) sold for $778,900, establishing a new record for the artist. At another Christie's auction in 2014, My Bed was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5million pounds, including buyer's commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery's foundation. It was estimated that the price of My Bed would sell between 800,000 and 1.2 million pounds. Before the sale, Emin said that [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> love is that someone did buy it and they donated it to the Tate." ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 2003, Australian {{performance}} artist Stelarc's {{plan to have}} a human ear grafted onto his forearm drew virulent criticism from UK Stuckists.

2500|$|Additionally, in an {{interview}} with Geoff Keighley, when a fan asked [...] "which game do you want to direct or reboot?" [...] Kojima stated without hesitation, [...] "Silent Hill". Keighley jumped in and asked [...] "What {{do you want to do}} with Silent Hill?" [...] Kojima responded: [...] "A guy [...] that is such a chicken and is so easily scared – making a scary game – I'm very confident that something horrifying would come out from that. But on the other hand I would have to prepare myself to have nightmares every single day. Hopefully sometime in the future I'm able to work on this, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> need to prepare to have daily nightmares." [...] In August 2014, P.T. was released on the PlayStation Store revealed that a new game in the Silent Hill franchise titled Silent Hills was being directed by Kojima for the PlayStation 4, alongside Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro. In April 2015, the playable trailer was removed and the game was officially cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|After their finals defeat, Qureshi {{spoke to}} the crowd to [...] "say {{something}} {{on behalf of all}} Pakistanis, [...] every time I come here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." [...] He then made a political appeal to the controversial [...] "Ground Zero mosque" [...] saying [...] "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> appreciate it."

Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said [...] "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nadal's {{withdrawal}} {{elevated the}} first alternate, Gilles Simon, into the draw, {{making him the}} second Frenchman of the eight-men field, alongside Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and marking {{the first time that}} two Frenchmen participated in the year-end event since the Masters Grand Prix event of 1986, in which Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte competed. Simon was ranked eighth in the ATP Race entering the Paris Masters thanks to his final in Madrid and his semifinal at the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, where he lost to eventual champion Robin Söderling, but was knocked out of the Top Eight when he lost to Andy Roddick in the third round, and Tsonga qualified by winning the title. Simon, who flew to Shanghai with countryman and friend Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on November 5, commented on Nadal's withdrawal and his first selection for the year-end event: [...] "I was unhappy that he had to pull out. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> have preferred to qualify directly by finishing eighth. It's not in my nature to wish that another player can't play. [...] I'm really happy to be going there and I really want to experience this." ...|$|E
