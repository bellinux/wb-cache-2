40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 119 - 130) A {{description is}} given {{of some of}} the pressures, particularly the promulgation of federal occupational noise standards, which have prompted an expanding necessity and usage of hearing protection from industrial noise. The attenuated and non-acoustical properties of hearing protectors, specifically the insert type, are discussed in detail. Further, an analysis of the methods evaluating the degree of protection afforded by intra-aural devices is presented. It is suggested that current audiometric methods of assessing insert <b>ear</b> <b>protector</b> attenuation may not necessarily indicate the actual sound reduction provided under live industrial conditions. Finally, a study was conducted in which four workers were exposed to a monitored, high-intensity industrial noise source while wearing common, specified insert hearing protectors to determine if temporary auditory fatigue would develop from a given protected exposure. Following a 48 hour rest period, the procedure was repeated. While minimal temporary threshold shifts were observed subsequent to the protected noise exposure (TTS adjusted to 2 minutes post-exposure), insufficient data were generated from the noise exposure to quantitatively ascertain that the protectors provided adequate attenuation to preclude significant temporary aural fatigue. Limitations of the study and recommendations for further research are indicated...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the {{practice}} of dentistry, dentists and dental auxiliaries are exposed to noise of different sound levels. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of hearing problems among dental personnel from Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Two hundred and four dental personnel (91 dentists, 72 dental assistants, 29 dental technicians and 12 dental hygienists) completed a questionnaire, were interviewed and observed during practice. The response rate was 82 %. RESULTS: The data obtained showed that 34 candidates (16. 67 %) had tinnitus, 30 (14. 71 %) had difficulty in speech discrimination and 63 (30. 88 %) had difficulty in speech discrimination in a background noise. Dental technicians were the most affected groups. The incidence of these symptoms was more in personnel exposed in dental field noise for more than 4 hours daily. None of the candidates with complaint had sought medical advice. CONCLUSION: Hearing problems among dental personnel are not of a severe nature. However, the hearing problems can happen due to dental field noise. Dental technicians are more prone to hearing problems. It is recommended that the dental field team should wear <b>ear</b> <b>protector</b> to reduce the hazards of dental field noise. King Saud Universit...|$|R

FEM can account for realistic <b>ear</b> and hearing <b>protector</b> geometries, materials with complicated physical behavioral laws and complex transmission phenomena through the different coupled domains in particular the tissues surrounding the ear canal. Several comparisons between numerical predictions and experimental results are presented. The sound transmission through the system is investigated using power balances and sensitivity analyses are carried out to identify the key parameters which govern the acoustic behavior of the system. The importance of parameters such as the system geometry, the coupling between the different domains and the loadings is discussed together with the characterization of the physical properties of each domain...|$|R

One year later 506 questionnaires were mailed to these same individuals querying their attitudes toward the availability of hearing testing at the show, the hearing conservation brochure, and the use of ear protection. Attention was also focused on recommendations regarding further examination/ evaluation, and on the purchase of hearing aids. There were 239 of the 506 questionnaires completed and returned for a response rate of 47 %. Results indicated that 92 % valued the hearing test, and the hearing conservation brochure. Fifty- seven percent reported using the <b>ear</b> <b>protectors</b> provided them at the show, and 57 % indicated an increased usage of <b>ear</b> <b>protectors.</b> In 1988, 37 % of the males reported using <b>ear</b> <b>protectors,</b> whereas in 1989 usage had increased to 73 %. Use of <b>ear</b> <b>protectors</b> by females increased from 19 % in 1988 to 67 % in 1989. A x² analysis for each group revealed that the increase in ear protector usage was significant (p <. 01). Results also revealed that 5 % of the respondents had purchased amplification systems during the intervening year. Of those who had received a recommendation to see a doctor and/or audiologist, 24 % followed that instruction. It was concluded that this single intervention program focusing on hearing conservation in the agricultural population was effective in motivating farmers and spouses to increase their use of hearing protective devices when in noisy environments.
