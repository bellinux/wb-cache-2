40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> on cone-beam breast-CT (CBBCT) could aid in discrimination {{of breast cancer}} subtypes and receptor status. METHODS: This study included female patients age > 40 years with malignant breast lesions identified on contrast-enhanced CBBCT. <b>Contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> of malignant breast lesions was standardized to breast fat tissue <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement.</b> All breast lesions were approved via image-guided biopsy or surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted for expression of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER 2) and Ki- 67 index. <b>Contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> of breast lesions was correlated with immunohistochemical breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER 2 positive, triple negative), receptor status and Ki- 67 expression. RESULTS: Highest <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> was seen for Luminal A lesions (93. 6 HU) compared to Luminal B lesions (47. 6 HU, P = . 002), HER 2 positive lesions (83. 5 HU, P = . 359) and triple negative lesions (45. 3 HU, P = . 005). <b>Contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> of HER 2 positive lesions was higher than Luminal B lesions (P = . 044) and triple negative lesions (P = . 039). No significant difference was evident between Luminal B and triple negative lesions (P = . 439). Lesions with high Ki- 67 index showed lower <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> than those with low Ki- 67 index (P = . 0043).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> within primary {{stimulus}} representations is {{a common}} feature of sensory systems that regulates the discrimination of similar stimuli. Whereas most sensory stimulus features can be mapped onto one or two dimensions of quality or location (e. g., frequency or retinotopy), the analogous similarities among odor stimuli are distributed high-dimensionally, necessarily yielding a chemotopically fragmented map upon {{the surface of the}} olfactory bulb. While olfactory <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> has been attributed to decremental lateral inhibitory processes among olfactory bulb projection neurons modeled after those in the retina, the two-dimensional topology of this mechanism is intrinsically incapable of mediating effective <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> on such fragmented maps. Consequently, current theories are unable to explain the existence of olfactory <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement.</b> Results We describe a novel neural circuit mechanism, non-topographical <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> (NTCE), which enables <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> among high-dimensional odor representations exhibiting unpredictable patterns of similarity. The NTCE algorithm relies solely on local intraglomerular computations and broad feedback inhibition, and is consistent with known properties of the olfactory bulb input layer. Unlike mechanisms based upon lateral projections, NTCE does not require a built-in foreknowledge of the similarities in molecular receptive ranges expressed by different olfactory bulb glomeruli, and is independent of the physical location of glomeruli within the olfactory bulb. Conclusion Non-topographical <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> demonstrates how intrinsically high-dimensional sensory data can be represented and processed within a physically two-dimensional neural cortex while retaining the capacity to represent stimulus similarity. In a biophysically constrained computational model of the olfactory bulb, NTCE successfully mediates <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> among odorant representations in the natural, high-dimensional similarity space defined by the olfactory receptor complement and underlies the concentration-independence of odor quality representations. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} transient response second harmonic imaging (HI) by means of ultrasound to assess abnormalities of cerebral echo <b>contrast</b> agent <b>enhancement</b> in patients with acute stroke.  METHODS—The study comprised 25 patients with acute onset of hemispheric stroke (< 24 h) with sufficient insonation conditions and 14 control subjects without cerebrovascular disease. All stroke patients had HI, extracranial and transcranial colour coded duplex examinations of the arteries supplying the brain, and clinical examinations (European stroke scale) performed in the acute phase, on day 2,and within 1 week. Acute CT was repeated within 1 week and facultatively accompanied by angiography. Examinations using HI were performed in an axial diencephalic plane of section using the transtemporal acoustic bone window. After bolus application of galactose based microbubbles, 61 ultrasound images with a cardiac cycling triggering frequency of once every 2 seconds were recorded and evaluated off line. Focal perfusion deficit was identified if no <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> was visualised in a circumscribed region of interest and insufficient temporal bone window was excluded. In cases of reappearance of <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> reperfusion was assessed.  RESULTS—Adequate cerebral <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> {{could be seen in}} 21 subjects. In seven, a large hemispheric deficit of <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> affecting the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory was detectable; the lentiform nucleus was affected in three subjects. Assessment of cerebral contrast abnormalities was possible in two patients with superficial MCA infarctions but in none of the patients with lacunar ischaemias. None of the control persons had focal deficits of cerebral echo <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement.</b> In all patients with complete MCA infarction and striatocapsular infarction, presumed ischaemic areas in HI examinations correlated with final CT findings. Overall sensitivity and specifity of HI examinations for predicting size and localisation of the infarction were 75 and 100 %, respectively. During follow up, reappearance of <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> was determined in three patients, in two patients circulatory arrest due to malignant brain oedema with missing <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> in the entire cerebral hemisphere could be seen. Extent of <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> deficits significantly correlated with the clinical status on admission and after 1 week (p< 0. 01).  CONCLUSIONS—Second harmonic imaging is the first ultrasonic technique that enables visualisation of pathological cerebral echo <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement.</b> Because this method identifies deficits of focal <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> in patients with acute stroke and allows estimation of the final infarct size and clinical prognosis, it may help to select and monitor patients for invasive therapies. ...|$|R
30|$|To {{preserve}} important visual details, {{the techniques}} developed in second group are usually {{combined with a}} local <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> algorithm. For local <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement,</b> histogram equalization (HE)-based <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> algorithms, such as adaptive HE (AHE) [10] and contrast-limited AHE [11], are well established for image enhancement. However, the existent HE-based methods generally produce strong <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> and may lead to excessive artifacts when processing color images. To achieve local <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> with reduced artifacts, Tao and Asari [12] proposed an AINDANE algorithm which is comprised of two separate processes, namely, adaptive luminance and adaptive <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancements.</b> The adaptive luminance enhancement is employed to compress the dynamic range of the image and the adaptive <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> is applied to restore the <b>contrast</b> after luminance <b>enhancement.</b> The authors also developed a similar but efficient nonlinear image enhancement algorithm to enhance the image quality for improving the performance of face detection [13]. However, the common drawback of these two methods is that the procedure is separated into two stages and may induce undesired artifacts in each stage. Retinex-based algorithms, such as multi-scale Retinex (MSR) [14] and perceptual color enhancement [3, 4, 15], are effective techniques to achieve dynamic range <b>enhancement,</b> local <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement,</b> and color consistency based on Retinex theory [16], which describes {{a model of the}} lightness and color perception of human vision. However, Retinex-based algorithms are usually computational expensive and require hardware acceleration to achieve real-time performance. Monobe et al. [17] proposed a spatially variant dynamic range compression algorithm with local contrast preservation based on the concept of local contrast range transform. Although this method performs well for enhancement of LDR images, the image enhancement procedure is transformed to operate in logarithmic domain. This requirement takes high computational costs with a large memory and leads to an inefficient algorithm. Recently, Unaldi et al. [18] proposed a fast and robust wavelet-based dynamic range compression (WDRC) algorithm with local <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement.</b> The authors also extended WDRC algorithm to combine with a linear color restoration process to cope with color constancy problem [19]. The main advantage of WDRC algorithm is that the processing time can be reduced rapidly since WDRC algorithm fully operates in the wavelet domain. However, WDRC algorithm empirically produces weak <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> and could not preserve visual details for LDR images.|$|R

The techniques such as non-dynamic based stochastic resonance are implemented but the technique provides less accuracy of contrast improvement. Hence an efficient technique is implemented here by segmented the low contrast region of the image and then filtering is performed on the segmented region using transformation. The proposed methodology greatly improves the <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> of the images...|$|R
