40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> on wage {{inflation}} in Japan, the US and the UK. <b>Excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> is not simply measured as officially registered unemployed persons but includes a measure of excess supply within the firm, i. e. work intensity. The empirical analysis confirms the importance of broadening the unemployment definition. Interesting differences arise in the cross-country comparison.

30|$|This {{conceptualization}} of migration pressure and actual migration is applicable to situations in poor and wealthy nations. In countries where income {{is low and}} unemployment benefits and social security systems absent, increase of <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> {{can be considered as}} a thermometer or early warning system for rising emigration intentions. Unemployment and low income undermine {{the quality of life in}} households, especially in the long term. This puts pressure on household members to migrate to places where employment and income prospects are brighter. In wealthier nations, increase of <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> generally does not lead to migration but only to a rise of the non-employed population—and unemployment rates—because income prospects elsewhere are mostly lower and because loss of employment is to some extent financially compensated by the unemployment and social security benefit system (Bruni and Venturini 1995, p. 380).|$|E

In line with the predictions of the crowding out hypothesis, we find that the level of protection afforded by field-specific skills against the risk of overeducation is higher when the degree of <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> in the occupational domain of the graduate's field of study is higher. Conversely, academic skills offer more protection against the risk of overeducation when <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> in the overall labour market is higher.

Contrary to the previous two definitions, focus is almost entirely on conditions in countries of origin.

40|$|After {{decades of}} full labour force participation, the {{activity}} rate of Hungarian women has {{ranked among the}} lowest of all European Union and EU accession countries {{for the past several}} years. This is partly due to the disappearance of about a third of all jobs in the early 1990 s; to an ideological backlash against women’s engagement in paid work, and to child care and labour market regulations which discourage the labour force participation of mothers of young children. Such policy patterns are clearly untenable in the context of low and declining birth rates and a rapidly aging population. In addition, European policy directives explicitly encourage an increase in female activity rates. For these reasons, it is time to reconsider Hungarian labour market policies, and especially how they relate to child care regulations and child care availability. Legislative history Policies concerning child care changed radically several times during the past 50 years in Hungary as various political regimes imagined and re-imagined women’s position in society. In the 1950 s, women’s labour force participation was posited as a critical political goal, thus birthing leaves were short, parental leaves non-existent and children were supposed to be looked after in nurseries and kindergartens. By the late 1960 s, however, an <b>excess</b> of <b>labour</b> <b>supply,</b> the financial burden o...|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} {{is such that}} {{the ratio of the}} number of workers to the total working-age population, i.e. the employment ratio, increases. However, the annual increase in jobs is smaller than the number of persons with which the working-age population grows each year.

40|$|Abstract: Underemployment is {{generally}} conceived as <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> associated with employed persons – that is, as {{a situation where}} employed persons would like to work more hours at prevailing wage rates. Using information collected by the 2001 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, this study examines the effects of underemployment on outcomes such as income, welfare dependence and subjective well-being. Results obtained imply that, while unemployment clearly has greater adverse consequences, underemployment is nonetheless associated with significant {{detrimental effects on the}} outcomes examined. Negative effects are found for both part-time employed and full-time employed workers who would prefer to work more hours, but effects are greater for underemployed part-time workers, and are particularly large for part-time workers who would like to work full-time. Indeed, for part-time workers seeking full-time employment, adverse effects attributable to underemployment are, for some outcomes, not far short of those attributable to unemployment...|$|E
3000|$|Research {{questions}} {{addressed in}} this paper are very important for economic policy. The labour market situation of low-educated workers is particularly critical in most industrialised countries. This {{is also the case}} in Belgium (Eurostat 2016 a). The unemployment rate in Belgium among the low-educated (i.e. people with less than upper secondary education) is three times larger than that among tertiary educated workers (16.4 vs. 4.7 % in 2014). As regards the employment rate, it is found to be more than 40 percentage points lower among the former group of workers (37.3 versus 81.9 % in 2014). 5 Various theories, including skilled-biased technological change and competition from low-wage countries, have been put forward to explain this phenomenon (Cahuc and Zylberberg 2014). A key argument here is that low-educated workers are too costly relative to their added value. As a result, firms are willing to substitute low-educated workers by capital, to outsource part of their activities to cheap-labour countries and (especially in the case of <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply)</b> to hire more educated workers as their productivity to wage cost ratio is more favourable. 6 [...]...|$|E

The aim is to understand how <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> and employment probabilities in Italy differ by gender and by regions. Therefore married women’s and married men’s employment and participation probabilities are analysed at national level and by macroareas. The microdata used is the 1995 Bank of Italy Survey on household income and wealth. The analysis by gender highlights the expected discouraging effect of children on their mothers’ <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> and a higher effect of education on married women’s <b>labour</b> <b>supply.</b> The estimation of the same model on different regions shows higher differences across regions for women’s <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> behaviour than for men. Tests for added versus discouraged worker effects are provided by areas and by gender. At national level, married women’s <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> is significantly lower if regional unemployment rates are higher, at regional level there is evidence in favour of the added worker effect only for married women {{who live in the}} South West of Italy. Previous analyses on women’s <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> in Italy show higher participation rates for women with a higher level of education; our analysis is consistent with this research and shows a different <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> behaviour for married women by education level.

40|$|Unemployment in Europe is a {{worrying}} phenomenon not so {{much because}} it hits 18 million people, but because it almost exclusively affects particular population segments. Italy represents a textbook case of a European country where labour market imbalances only weigh upon certain social components: namely long-term unemployed, women, young people, depressed areas and particularly the Mezzogiorno, a poor region within a rich country. In all European countries suffering from <b>excess</b> <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> - with the only exception of France and Spain - some regions enjoy full employment, while others have a very high unemployment rate. Thus, understanding the Italian unemployment and finding effective solutions for it, is useful to understand and treat the main European labour market pathologies.

The findings emphasise the role of the labour market variables over social security generosity for explaining older worker labour force participation trends.
