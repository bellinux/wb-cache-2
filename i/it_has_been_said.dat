5|$|In 2009, after Jackson's sudden death, La Toya Jackson {{said that}} she had {{discovered}} two hard disks at her brother's home which contain more than 1,000 songs that were never released and that are even not registered by any bodies (excluding some). <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that Jackson, in his lifetime, recorded more than 50,000 songs but many of the songs were not released.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that Jehovah's Witnesses do {{not entirely}} oppose {{the idea of}} {{national}} service, but rather the notion of armed military service.

5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> he {{made quite}} a good {{impression}} on the ladies flying over the red hills in this gully jumper with his black sideburns, wearing a hard top derby hat.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that Paul McCartney and U2's Bono {{would wear}} Sgt. Pepper costumes during their {{performance}} together.

5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse {{and in front of}} the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> of Hannah de Rothschild {{that she}} {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that {{an error}} of fact {{involves}} {{a situation where there}} are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
6000|$|... (M64) This {{distinction}} {{brought with}} it the duty of attending the funeral of a writer eminent among the philosophers and men of letters of his day. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> of him that three days in the week he was absurd, three days mediocre, and one day sublime. The verdict seems to be confirmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen of the National Guard," [...] {{said the}} Prince, {{taking off his}} hat and bowing to Odillon Barrot, [...] "will ye be so igsthramely obleeging as to fire first." [...] This he <b>said</b> because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> at Fontenoy, but chiefly because his own men were only armed with shillelaghs, and {{therefore}} could not fire.|$|R
60|$|While {{the others}} were hunting here and there for the gold which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> could <b>be</b> picked up in Virginia as one gathers acorns in the old world, Captain Smith set about making a house of logs such as would protect him from the storms of winter {{as well as from}} the summer sun.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> to be {{the largest}} non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
6000|$|His sister {{looked at}} him still, with a ray of {{penetration}} in her charming eyes; then she turned away again. [...] "You see, at all events," [...] she presently went on, [...] "that if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> of me that I had come over here to seek my fortune <b>it</b> would <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> added that I have found it!" ...|$|R

The defenders were all too few to make head against the surging tide of war.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Thompson {{had lived}} on the next farm to Mr. Simpson's, but when he left it, he went to Bradford, and from there <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that he <b>had</b> gone to Babcock. Where he was living at that time Mr. Simpson neither knew nor did he know of any one else who might be acquainted with Mr. Thompson's whereabouts.|$|R
5|$|The European Parliament (EP) {{shares the}} {{legislative}} and budgetary {{authority of the}} Union with the Council of the European Union (not {{to be confused with}} the European Council). Its 751 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. They represent nearly 500million citizens (the world's second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some sensitive areas, and does not have legislative initiative. It does, however, have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|In June 1460 {{the exiled}} Yorkists {{successfully}} invaded England, and on 10 July they defeated a royal army at the Battle of Northampton, and captured the king. As a result, Clifford was now ordered to surrender Penrith castle and Honour {{back to the}} earl of Salisbury. But although the now-Yorkist government repeatedly sent messages, orders and instructions to Clifford in the north, he did not acknowledge them, and with Northumberland and Lord Roos, remained in control {{of most of the}} region. In October 1460, the duke of York claimed the throne, and a parliament was summoned to discuss this. The result of its deliberations was the Act of Accord, which disinherited the Prince of Wales in favour of York and his heirs. This, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said,</b> was 'repugnant' to Clifford and his colleagues and strengthened their support for the queen. It seems that, although Clifford was summoned to attend, he stayed away, and probably met with Queen Margaret in Kingston upon Hull, where she was gathering Lancastrian lords and their retainers to her. Together, they had soon gathered a fighting force of thousands. Clifford was one of these lords who was subsequently accused of 'systematically' pillaging and looting the Yorkshire estates and tenants of York and Salisbury. In response to these attacks, York, Salisbury, and the latter's son Thomas led an army to the north. Encamped at York's castle at Sandal, on 30 December 1460, the two armies met at the Battle of Wakefield, where Clifford commanded one of the wings of the Lancastrian army. The Yorkist army was routed, and all three Yorkist lords were killed. Clifford was knighted by the Lancastrian commander, Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset prior to the battle commencing.|$|E

60|$|Lapham {{appreciated}} all {{the intent}} of this subtle suggestion, and understood as plainly as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> in so many words, that if they paid him a larger price, it was to be expected that a certain portion of the purchase-money was to return to their own hands. Still he could not move; and {{it seemed to him that}} he could not speak.|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not Maruja's way to {{encounter}} man, woman, or child, old or young, without {{an attempt at}} subjugation. Strong in her power and salient with fascination, she leaned gently over the fence, and with the fan raised to her delicate ear, made him repeat his question under the soft fire of her fringed eyes. He did so, but incompletely, and with querulous laziness.|$|R
50|$|Liberation Theology {{had come}} under attack for not being a {{theology}} at all. At times it was compared to Marxism. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an ideology masquerading as theology. Younger Christians {{at the time were}} seeking an ideology and not finding it in the Christian faith. Segundo responds to this climate by addressing these words and their meaning and how a Biblical perspective {{can be applied to the}} political world.|$|R
