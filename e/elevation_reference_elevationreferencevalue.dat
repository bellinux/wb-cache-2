The gauge measures coastal water level in relation to an <b>elevation</b> <b>reference.</b> A summary of previously available tide gauges is made with advantages and disadvantages noted. The gauge sensor consists of a high resistance wire within a mercury-filled capillary. The mercury level in the capillary is pressure-linked to the sea water column and responds to changes of water level over a wide period range. The mercury column height changes the current-conducting length of the resistance wire in the capillary. the change in resistance is, therefore, linear with column height. The resistance element forms one arm of a Wheatstone bridge, Laboratory evaluation and calibration are described.

30|$|At {{the high}} <b>elevation</b> <b>reference</b> site, fire {{increased}} CO 2 production by 89 % ± 19 % (P < 0.05). Similar to {{trends in the}} restored site, CO 2 production was suppressed in burn plots by one month. Rates averaged (16 ± 1) mg CO 2 -C g− 1 MBC d− 1 and (53 ± 14) mg CO 2 -C g− 1 MBC d− 1 from burned soils and control soils, respectively (P < 0.05); however, by one year, no effect of fire on this parameter was observed (Figure 5 B). At the low-elevation site, CO 2 was elevated following fire; rates increased from (27 ± 8) mg CO 2 -C g− 1 MBC d− 1 to (39 ± 4) mg CO 2 -C g− 1 MBC d− 1 in control plots and burned plots, respectively (P < 0.1). At one month, CO 2 was still elevated in the burned plot (P < 0.05), although this trend was no longer observed one year following the fire. The burn:control ratio suggests that CO 2 from the burned plot was steadily increasing relative to production from the control plot with time (Figure 5 E).|$|R
40|$|The {{automatic}} {{reconstruction of}} buildings for {{the generation of}} city models is of great interest for different tasks. 3 D information can be directly obtained from both, laser (LIDAR) and radar (InSAR) measurements. The features of both sensors are compared. The data acquisition by SAR is described, with emphasis on the special properties of the interferometric SAR principle. A segmentation approach for building reconstruction is proposed. The results show that building reconstruction is possible from InSAR, but the achievable level of detail cannot compete with LIDAR. The main source of limitation is the inherent side-looking scene illumination of SAR, giving rise to disturbing phenomena interfering with often {{large parts of the}} scene. Geometric constraints for the location and size of such problem areas are derived. In order to identify areas of unreliable data in SAR images of a built-up area corresponding elevation data are analysed. The impact of the phenomena layover, shadow and dominant scattering at building locations is considered. For this task a hybrid <b>elevation</b> <b>reference</b> is required.

40|$|Traditional glaciological {{mass balance}} {{measurements}} of mountain glaciers are a demanding and cost intensive task. In this study, we combine {{data from the}} Ice Cloud and Elevation Satellite (ICESat) acquired between 2003 and 2009 with air and space borne Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in order to derive surface elevation changes of the Grosser Aletschgletscher in the Swiss Alps. Three {{different areas of the}} glacier are covered by one nominal ICESat track, allowing us to investigate the performance of the approach under different conditions in terms of ICESat data coverage, and surface characteristics. In order to test the sensitivity of the derived trend in surface lowering, several variables were tested. Employing correction for perennial snow accumulation, footprint selection and adequate reference DEM, we estimated a mean mass balance of − 0. 92 ± 0. 18 m w. e. a− 1. for the whole glacier in the studied time period. The resulting mass balance was validated by a comparison with another geodetic approach based on the subtraction of two DEMs for the years 1999 and 2009. It appears that the processing parameters need to be selected depending on the amount of available ICESat measurements, quality of the <b>elevation</b> <b>reference</b> and character of the glacier surface...|$|R

40|$|To {{conduct an}} {{elevation}} survey, a surveyor needs {{a starting point}} for which the exact elevation above mean sea level is known. These starting points are called benchmarks. State and federal agencies install benchmarks throughout every State, creating a network of elevation points which covers the entire continental United States. These benchmarks are considered to be permanent, and usually consist of a brass, bronze, or aluminum disc about 4 inches in diameter mounted in a cement post or in a drill hole in a permanent foundation. Each benchmark also has the installing agency's name and an identification number stamped into it. In December of 1980 the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allotted the State of Delaware funds to determine the number and condition of federal benchmarks and other <b>elevation</b> <b>reference</b> control points.

40|$|Using sparsely glaciated {{southern}} Norway {{as a case}} study, we {{assess the}} potential and limitations of ICESat laser altimetry for analysing regional glacier elevation change in rough mountain terrain. Differences between ICESat GLAS <b>elevations</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>elevation</b> data are plotted over time to derive a glacier surface elevation trend for the ICESat acquisition period 2003 – 2008. We find spatially varying biases between ICESat and three tested digital elevation models (DEMs) : the Norwegian national DEM, SRTM DEM, and a high-resolution lidar DEM. For regional glacier elevation change, the spatial inconsistency of reference DEMs – a result of spatio-temporal merging – {{has the potential to}} significantly affect or dilute trends. Elevation uncertainties of all three tested DEMs exceed ICESat elevation uncertainty by an order of magnitude, and are thus limiting the accuracy of the method, rather than ICESat uncertainty. ICESat matches glacier size distribution of the study area well and measures small ice patches not commonly monitored in situ. The sample is large enough for spatial and thematic subsetting. Vertical offsets to ICESat elevations vary for different glaciers in southern Norway due to spatially inconsistent reference DEM age. We introduce a per-glacier correction that removes these spatially varying offsets, and considerably increases trend significance. Only after application of this correction do individual campaigns fit observed in situ glacier mass balance. Our correction also has the potential to improve glacier trend significance for other causes of spatially varying vertical offsets, for instance due to radar penetration into ice and snow for the SRTM DEM or as a consequence of mosaicking and merging that is common for national or global DEMs. After correction of <b>reference</b> <b>elevation</b> bias, we find that ICESat provides a robust and realistic estimate of a moderately negative glacier mass balance of around − 0. 36  ±  0. 07  m ice per year.
