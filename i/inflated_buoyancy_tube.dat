50|$|The <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tubes</b> of Zodiac boats {{have several}} compartments, {{separated}} by waterproof partitions. Thanks to its important air reserves, the boat keeps {{its ability to}} float and stays conceptually unsinkable when fully loaded, even with a deflated compartment.|$|R
50|$|Made with an {{inflatable}} <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tube</b> and a rigid hull, these boats combine {{the advantages of}} traditional inflatable boats - security, stability, portability, {{and ease of use}} - with those of rigid-hulled boats - comfort, agility and speed.|$|R
50|$|Difficult water {{conditions}} were implicated in 36% of fatalities in the Edmonds et al. summary. These included current {{stronger than the}} diver could manage, rough water, surf, surge from wave movement, and impaired visibility caused by these conditions. These conditions were frequently encountered when the diver was obliged to surface in an unsuitable place due to earlier problems, and were often exacerbated by overweighting and/or the high drag of an excessively <b>inflated</b> <b>buoyancy</b> compensator, leading to exhaustion or panic which resulted in drowning.|$|R
2500|$|A {{downstream}} {{demand valve}} {{serves as a}} fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a demand valve malfunctions and jams in the open position, the demand valve will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without <b>inflating</b> <b>buoyancy</b> devices. The effect of unintentional inflation might be to carry the diver quickly to the surface causing the various injuries that can result from an over-fast ascent. There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in over pressure valve, so that over-pressurization does not <b>inflate</b> any <b>buoyancy</b> devices connected to the regulator.|$|R
2500|$|In {{almost all}} cases {{the centre of}} {{buoyancy}} of a diver with an <b>inflated</b> <b>buoyancy</b> compensator is nearer the head than the centre of gravity, and buoyancy compensators are all designed to provide this as the default condition, as an inverted diver floating at the surface is at risk of drowning. The offset in the forward/backward axis is quite frequently significant, and is usually the dominant factor in determining static trim attitude. At the surface, it is generally undesirable to be trimmed strongly face down, but {{it is useful to}} be able to trim face down at will. Vertical trim is acceptable providing it can be overcome for swimming ...|$|R

50|$|K1A2: Upgraded K1A1. Originally {{named as}} K1A1 PIP. Developed from 2008 to 2010, and {{mass-production}} started in 2012. First upgraded vehicle was rolled out on December 20, 2013. Technology benefit from K2 Black Panther {{has been applied}} to this model. Upgrades include <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tubes,</b> automatic commanding control with identification friend or foe, GPS and INS position recognition, and digital wireless communications and displays. It also has air conditioning and a soft-kill active protection system to defend against missiles and rockets. The K1A2 project provides upgrade kits for South Korean Army and Marines Corps K1 and K1A1 tanks. All K1A1 will be upgraded to K1A2 by 2022.|$|R

For future applications and in particular for loads of various sizes and load distribution a circular planfom canopy should be considered, togetherwith alternative methods of slinging, inflation and propulsion.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{procedure}} was modified to estimate rumen buoyancy of corn bran and fiber types. Inoculum {{was obtained from}} two beef heifers and mixed with McDougall’s buffer then distributed to the in vitro tubes for 30 hours incubation at 100 °F. Fibrous material formed a matte layer which was measured to describe <b>buoyancy.</b> <b>Tubes</b> contained 6 g of a feedlot-type diet with 7. 5 % fiber type (alfalfa hay, grass hay, corn silage, or corn stalks), with no replacement or 25 % replacement of the remaining corn with corn bran. Buoyancy declined over time. Alfalfa hay had the most positive effect on buoyancy of corn bran. This new method offers promise for describing rumen buoyancy...|$|R
50|$|Divers {{who are out}} of air will {{probably}} not be able to <b>inflate</b> their <b>buoyancy</b> compensator or drysuit using the normal and simple technique of pressing the direct feed injection valve. If their equipment allows it, and this is anlmost always the case, {{they may be able to}} inflate these devices orally or use an integrated gas cylinder (if fitted).|$|R
25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for <b>inflating</b> <b>buoyancy</b> compensators and/or dry suits. These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|R
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to <b>inflate</b> <b>buoyancy</b> compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|R
2500|$|If {{the first}} stage leaks and the {{inter-stage}} over-pressurizes, the second stage downstream valve opens automatically resulting in a [...] "freeflow". With an upstream valve, the result of over-pressurization may be a blocked valve. This will stop the supply of breathing gas and possibly result in a ruptured hose or the failure of another second stage valve, such as one that <b>inflates</b> a <b>buoyancy</b> device. When a second stage upstream tilt valve is used a relief valve should be included by the manufacturer on {{the first stage}} regulator to protect the intermediate hose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of rigid hull and large inflatable <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tubes</b> was initially conceived by a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) team working under Inspector of Lifeboats Dag Pike in 1964 {{as a means}} of reducing the wear and tear of the fabric bottoms of the existing inflatable inshore lifeboats. Although working versions were built, the plywood rigid hulls were not strong enough and broke up in waves. Development was being simultaneously undertaken by students and staff at Atlantic College in South Wales, where the rigid section was formed as a deep vee hull to add strength and which worked. The Atlantic College RIB's were developed to be an effective rescue craft for the college's fleet of sailing boats on the often perilous Bristol Channel, and the college had become an Inshore Lifeboat Station for the [...] RNLI in 1963, carrying out countless rescues over the next 50 years. The first commercial RIB was introduced in 1967 by Tony and Edward Lee-Elliott of Flatacraft, and patented by Admiral Desmond Hoare in 1969 after research and development at Atlantic College.|$|R
50|$|If a diver {{is out of}} gas and is {{breathing}} gas {{supplied by}} the rescuer, the rescuer and casualty must remain close {{to one another and}} ascend together. Starting the ascent may be complicated by the casualty's lack of gas to <b>inflate</b> the <b>buoyancy</b> compensator to become buoyant {{at the start of the}} ascent and later, at the surface. At the start of the ascent the casualty may need to fin upwards and keep pace with the rescuer until, with the drop in ambient pressure, the gas already inside buoyancy devices such as the buoyancy compensator or diving suit, expands and provides sufficient buoyancy.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Floating and sinking {{demonstration}} (Cartesian diver). The tube {{is filled}} with water and air. When pressing the bottle, the additional water enters the test tube, thus increasing the average density of the system tube-water-air, resulting with negative <b>buoyancy</b> and the <b>tube</b> sinks.|$|R
5000|$|Less-toxic modern {{imitations of}} bubble lights {{are made from}} acrylic or other clear plastic rods, with {{permanent}} bubbles deliberately manufactured into them, lit with fixed-color or color-changing LEDs. Other bubbling lights are much larger and sit on a table or floor, occasionally with fake fish which [...] "swim" [...] {{up and down as}} they change <b>buoyancy.</b> These <b>tubes</b> are usually filled with distilled water, and have one or more airstones at the bottom, and normally a light, along with an air pump.|$|R
50|$|On {{reaching}} a dive site the lead boat drops an anchor, {{and the others}} tie on to the back or use separate anchors. The divers <b>inflate</b> their <b>buoyancy</b> compensators attached to their diving cylinders {{and put them into}} the water to float while remaining tethered to the boat. Then they put on their masks, fins, and weight belts, slide overboard, and put on their scuba sets while floating. Once the divers are ready, they descend and proceed with the dive. The boat may be tethered to the divers via their surface marker buoy system if they are drift diving, or it may be anchored or fastened to a mooring buoy if one is available at the dive site.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{circulation}} of matter in AGB stars above the H-burning shell, which is known to yield the appearance of p-rich isotopes like 13 C, 17 O and the unstable 26 Al at the stellar surface. These nuclei were observed in presolar grains of AGB origin {{and in some cases}} (e. g. C isotopes) in spectroscopic observations of evolved stars. For the physical mechanism driving the mixing we consider magnetic flux <b>tube</b> <b>buoyancy.</b> Magnetic <b>tubes</b> are formed below the convective envelope and one can express the parameters of the required mixing phenomena in terms of the magnetic field intensity |−→B |. We show that the required values of |−→B | can span a considerable range. If the mixing arrives only at the innermost layers of the convective envelope, fields smaller than the solar ones are sufficient, according to our previous analysis. If instead magnetic fields have to appear at the surface, as is suggested by recent observations, than field intensities in the Megagauss range are necessary...|$|R
5000|$|Catastrophic bladder failure due to puncture, tearing {{or failure}} of the dump valve or {{inflation}} assembly can leave the diver with inadequate buoyancy to make a safe ascent, particularly if diving deep with large gas supply and insufficient ditchable weight. The risk can be mitigated by diving in a dry suit, which can be <b>inflated</b> to add <b>buoyancy</b> in an emergency, by carrying a DSMB, which can be deployed to provide a surface float, and by using distributed ditchable weights - ditching the whole weightbelt may result in the opposite problem of excessive buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|Underwater divers are {{a common}} example {{of the problem of}} {{unstable}} buoyancy due to compressibility. The diver typically wears an exposure suit which relies on gas filled spaces for insulation, and may also wear a buoyancy compensator, which is a variable volume buoyancy bag which is <b>inflated</b> to increase <b>buoyancy</b> and deflated to decrease buoyancy. The desired condition is usually neutral buoyancy when the diver is swimming in mid-water, and this condition is unstable, so the diver is constantly making fine adjustments by control of lung volume, and has to adjust the contents of the buoyancy compensator if the depth varies.|$|R
50|$|The Queensland state coroner {{found in}} 2008 {{evidence}} regarded as {{enough to try}} Watson for murder. He travelled voluntarily from the United States to Australia in May 2009 to face trial. At the trial on 5 June 2009, Watson {{pleaded not guilty to}} murder and guilty to manslaughter. He was convicted of manslaughter. Crown prosecutor Brendan Campbell pointed out that over time Watson had given police 16 different versions of what had happened to Tina and that none of those versions matched what the only eyewitness had seen. When Tina was brought to the surface her regulator was still in her mouth, her tank still had air, and tests indicated no faults with her equipment. The prosecutor described Watson as an experienced diver trained in rescuing panicked divers, who had allowed his wife to sink to the ocean floor without making any serious attempt to retrieve her. He did not <b>inflate</b> her <b>buoyancy</b> control device (BCD) or remove her weight belt, and he failed in his duty as her dive buddy by not sharing his (alternate) air source with her.|$|R

40|$|We discuss {{nucleosynthesis}} {{results obtained}} following the recent suggestion that extramixing phenomena in red giants might {{be driven by}} magnetic buoyancy. We explore for this model {{the production of the}} short-lived radioactive isotope $^{ 26 }$Al and of stable light nuclei, considering both the case of the general <b>buoyancy</b> of flux <b>tubes</b> and that of the intermittent release of magnetized unstable structures. We show that abundant $^{ 26 }$Al can be produced, up to, and above, the highest levels measured in presolar grains. This level would be also sufficient to explain the early solar system $^{ 26 }$Al as coming from a nearby AGB star of low mass. The case of fast-moving instabilities is the most efficient, reaching almost the same effectiveness as hot bottom burning (HBB) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cyclically}} varying {{magnetic field}} of the Sun {{is believed to be}} produced by the hydromagnetic dynamo process. We first summarize the relevant observational data pertaining to sunspots and solar cycle. Then we review the basic principles of MHD needed to develop the dynamo theory. This is followed by a discussion how bipolar sunspots form due to magnetic <b>buoyancy</b> of flux <b>tubes</b> formed {{at the base of the}} solar convection zone. Following this, we come to the heart of dynamo theory. After summarizing the basic ideas of a turbulent dynamo and the basic principles of its mean field formulation, we present the famous dynamo wave solution, which was supposed to provide a model for the solar cycle. Finally we point out how a flux transport dynamo can circumvent some of the difficulties associated with the older dynamo models...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of buoyancy and Coriolis forces on heat transfer in turbine blade internal coolant passages. The experiments {{were conducted}} with a large scale, multi-pass, smooth-wall heat transfer model with both radially inward and outward flow. An analysis of the governing flow equations showed that four parameters influence the heat transfer in rotating passages (coolant-to-wall temperature ratio, Rossby number, Reynolds number and radius-to-passage hydraulic diameter ratio). These four parameters were varied over ranges which are typical of advanced gas turbine engine operating conditions. It was found that both Coriolis and buoyancy effects must be considered in turbine blade cooling designs and that the effect of rotation on the heat transfer coefficients was markedly different depending on the flow direction. Local heat transfer coefficients were found to decrease by as much as 60 percent and increase by 250 percent from no rotation levels. Comparisons with a pioneering stationary vertical <b>tube</b> <b>buoyancy</b> experiment showed reasonably good agreement. Correlation of the data is achieved employing dimensionless parameters derived from the governing flow equations...|$|R
40|$|Micro-particle image {{velocimetry}} {{measurements of}} the 3 D (three-dimensional) convection patterns generated near an evaporating meniscus in horizontally oriented capillary tubes are presented. Analysis of the vapor diffusion away from the meniscus reveals a zone of intense heat flux near the solid-liquid-vapor junction which creates a temperature gradient along the meniscus. This results in a surface tension gradient which, coupled with buoyancy effects, causes buoyant-thermocapillary convection in the liquid film. The relative influence of buoyancy and thermocapillarity on the flow was investigated for tube diameters ranging from 75 to 1575 µm. A transition from a pure 2 D thermocapillary flow to a 3 D buoyant-thermocapillary flow is observed {{with an increase in}} tube diameter. For the 75 µm tube, a symmetrical toroidal vortex is observed near the meniscus. For larger <b>tubes,</b> <b>buoyancy</b> effects become apparent as they dominate the flow field. The high mass fluxes in smaller-diameter tubes drive stronger vortices. Particle streaks and µPIV images obtained in multiple horizontal and vertical planes provide an understanding of this three-dimensional flow behavior. A scaling analysis shows the importance of thermocapillary convection in evaporating menisci...|$|R
