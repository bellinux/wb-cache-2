40|$|ABSTRACT: Malignant bone-forming tumors {{that arise}} from the {{surfaces}} oflong bones are far less common than those {{that arise from}} within bone. These surface osteosarcomas are clinically and radiographically simi-lar, yet histologically they are quite distinct. In reviewing the literature, we classified the tumors according to three subgroups: parosteal (<b>juxtacortical)</b> <b>osteosarcoma,</b> pen-osteal osteosarcoma, and high-grade surface osteosar-coma. We also studied the clinical, radiographic, and histological findings in eighty patients who had been treated for an osteosarcoma over a forty-four-year pe-nod. Adequate follow-up data existed for forty-eight of the eighty patients. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to fifteen years after the initial operation (am...|$|E
40|$|Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} tumor of bone but only 5 % of these tumours occur in the jaws. Of all the varieties of osteosarcoma, the juxtacortical type is rare and comprises only less than 4 % of all osteosarcomas. <b>Juxtacortical</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> is further subdivided into parosteal (low grade) and periosteal (high grade). Osteosarcomas can be categorized histologically mainly into chondroblastic, osteoblastic, fibroblastic and numerous others. One of the rare histological variant is small cell osteosarcoma which consists of sheets of round cells that produce an osteoid matrix. The aim {{of this article is to}} present a rare case of periosteal osteosarcoma of mandible which on histopathological examination showed characteristics of small cell tumour...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOsteosarcomas are a {{heterogeneous}} group of tumors with diverse anatomical, clinical, and progressional characteristics. Parosteal osteosarcoma, or <b>juxtacortical</b> <b>osteosarcoma,</b> {{is a rare}} form of osteosarcoma that develops at the bone surface, but has a better prognosis than other conventional osteosarcomas. We report the observation of a 22 -year-old female patient whose initial presentation was an enormous tumefaction of the knee that had been progressing for 10 years. The biopsy concluded in PO of the lower third of the femur. Staging was negative. The tumor had reached an enormous size and required amputation of the left lower extremity. A custom external prosthesis was manufactured {{to get her back}} to walking. Eight years after surgery, no local recurrence or metastasis has been detected. Parosteal osteosarcoma is a rare form of osteosarcoma with very slow progression (in spite of the particularly dramatic presentation in our observation), with an excellent prognosis and very rare metastasis...|$|E
