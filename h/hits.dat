5|$|Dance Again... the <b>Hits</b> is {{the first}} {{greatest}} <b>hits</b> album of American singer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, {{to coincide with the}} launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest <b>hits</b> album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, Love?, which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest <b>hits</b> album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether she wanted to go along with plans to release a greatest <b>hits</b> album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former.|$|E
