5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Croatian courts indicted Veljko Kadijević and Blagoje Adžić, former {{commanders of}} the Yugoslav Army, {{for war crimes}} in Vukovar.

He was granted Russian citizenship in 2008, and died <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> November 2014. In 2011, a Serbian court indicted more than 40 Croatians for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar, but an earlier indictment against a Croatian soldier was dropped because of irregularities in the investigation.|$|E

Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E

After leaving prison, Carl Winter resumed Party activities, became editor of the Daily Worker in 1966, and died in 1991. Gil Green was released from Leavenworth prison in 1961 and continued working with the CPUSA to oppose the Vietnam War. Party leader William Z.

5|$|Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, {{then turned to}} Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The Polish sejm refused to agree to the treaty, believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were a {{difficult}} time financially, with less foreign work coming through; though they headed the consortium that built the Mosul Dam in Iraq from 1981-84. There was domestic growth, highlighted by the architecturally radical Messe Torhaus in Frankfurt, completed in 1984. It was later involved {{in the construction of}} the Messeturm in the same city; once completed in 1991 it was Europe's tallest building. In the mid-1990s, Hochtief was involved in yet another major skyscraper development in Frankfurt, the Commerzbank Tower, which overtook the Messeturm to become Europe's tallest building, losing the record to Triumph-Palace <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> 2003.|$|E

5|$|The film premiered with {{a single}} {{screening}} at the Dom Kino <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> 1966. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, despite some criticism of the film's naturalistic depiction of violence. In February 1967, Tarkovsky and Alexei Romanov complained that the film was not yet approved for a wide release and refused to cut further scenes from the film. Tarkovsky's refusal resulted in Andrei Rublev not being released for years, despite being a topic of discussion at the top level of Mosfilm, Goskino and even during {{a meeting of the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E
5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born <b>in</b> <b>Moscow</b> <b>in</b> April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E
