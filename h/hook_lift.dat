50|$|For {{the most}} part the {{replacement}} of older fire trucks takes the form of new AB units in Germany. The AB units may be built from standard containers with equipment installed from different suppliers as required by the fire department. The WLF loader vehicle can be purchased independently with the availability {{of a wide variety of}} trucks on the market (that are not originally designed for firefighting) - the trucks are sent to specialized workshops that can convert them to WLF fire trucks by adding a <b>hook</b> <b>lift,</b> siren and communications. The AB units may be used far longer than the WLF trucks as the latter can be exchanged independently - this makes maintenance cheaper especially for special equipment that is only rarely needed. Additionally some firefighting equipment like the decontamination pod have advantages for military conversion dispatching them by standard NATO container transport.|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note presents {{stress analysis}} calculations for the below the <b>hook</b> <b>lifting</b> fixture {{which will be}} used to move the D-Zero solenoid magnet during installation work at the D-Zero Assembly building. Load bearing structural members are shown to have a minimum design factor of 3 based on yield strength as required by ASME B 30. 20. All bolts were analyzed and shown to be kept below allowable loads/stresses listed in the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) manual. The lifting fixture will be manufactured at Fermilab using some material scavenged from an existing lifting fixture that was shipped with the magnet from the magnet manufacturer, Toshiba Corporation. The fixture is designed with built in versatility so that the solenoid magnet can be maneuvered through the stages of preparation and installation into it's final mounted position. The structure has been analyzed for all phases of its use, although the analysis of the structure as a below the <b>hook</b> <b>lifting</b> device is the main purpose of this note...|$|R

Appropriate solution of shape and materials of hooks enables the increase of loading capacity of hoisting machines. The inner diameter of hooks should be sufficient to accommodate two strands of chains or rope which carry the load. More often than not hooks have a trapezoidal section, made wider on the inside.

If this must be done with the diver suspended from the hoist, the divers body must remain in the water to help preserve blood supply to the upper body and head by hydrostatic pressure.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1985, H. P. Baxxter and Rick J. Jordan met in Hannover, Germany {{through a}} small ad and founded the synthpop/new wave band Celebrate the Nun. While the lead vocals were {{performed}} by Baxxter and female vocals were delivered by Baxxter's sister Britt Maxime, Rick J. Jordan {{took care of the}} keyboards and sound engineering. The band released their first album Meanwhile in 1989. Allmusic wrote that [...] "During the mid-'80s, numerous synth pop acts dreamed of becoming the next Depeche Mode. Celebrate the Nun could have been buried in the glut of Depeche Mode doppelgangers; however, top-drawer songwriting and consistently catchy <b>hooks</b> <b>lifted</b> Celebrate the Nun above the mass of wannabes". The single [...] "Will You Be There" [...] off Meanwhile peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Dance/Club play chart on June 23, 1990, whereas the single [...] "She's a Secretary/Strange" [...] peaked at No. 12 on Dance/Club play chart on December 8 of the same year. Slin Tompson, who was the fourth person in the band's original line-up, left the band in 1990 to start a project on his own. In 1991, the band released their second album Continuous, but this was less successful due to synthpop's declining popularity. Two singles were released off the second material, [...] "Patience" [...] and [...] "You Make Me Wonder" [...] both of which went without charting. Not finding the expected success in the New Wave arena, Baxxter kept working at the former Hamburg based Indie label (currently Edel Records) in the Distribution and Sales department where he met Scooter's future manager Jens Thele.|$|R
6000|$|To {{which the}} answer was this time, with a smile, in briefest Italian. [...] "Che!" [...] The dealer waived the question--he {{practically}} disposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle {{to which he had}} not yet resorted and from which, after unlocking it, he extracted a square box, of some twenty inches in height, covered with worn-looking leather. He placed the box on the counter, pushed back a pair of small <b>hooks,</b> <b>lifted</b> the lid and removed from its nest a drinking-vessel larger than a common cup, yet not of exorbitant size, and formed, to appearance, either of old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt. He handled it with tenderness, with ceremony, making a place for it on a small satin mat. [...] "My Golden Bowl," [...] he observed--and it sounded, on his lips, as if it said everything. He left the important object--for as [...] "important" [...] it did somehow present itself--to produce its certain effect. Simple, but singularly elegant, it stood on a circular foot, a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base, and, though not of signal depth, justified its title by the charm of its shape {{as well as by the}} tone of its surface. It might have been a large goblet diminished, to the enhancement of its happy curve, by half its original height. As formed of solid gold it was impressive; it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer. Charlotte, with care, immediately took it up, while the Prince, who had after a minute shifted his position again, regarded it from a distance.|$|R
50|$|Hart faced three future champions in his career. He {{suffered}} a 9 round TKO loss {{at the hands}} of future middleweight champion Marvin Hagler on September 14, 1976. Future light heavyweight champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammad knocked Hart out in the fourth round on August 26, 1974, and future middleweight king Vito Antuofermo KOed Hart in the fifth round of their March 11, 1977 match. The Antuofermo fight was typical of Hart's inability to get by championship caliber fighters. Hart came out throwing powerful left hooks to the head and body of Antuofermo. Some of Hart's left <b>hooks</b> actually <b>lifted</b> Antuofermo off the ground. When Antuofermo didn't wilt under the furious attack, Hart lost confidence and the tide of battle turned. Appearing completely spent, Hart became defenseless and was knocked out.|$|R
