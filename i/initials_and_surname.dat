The Outlaws happened to be playing in the league's first nationally televised game (the one that would, ultimately, be the most widely watched game, as the league's viewership plummeted after that point), and the league's choice of camera angles more akin to video games meant that Smart's jersey was prominently featured on the telecasts. The jersey was the XFL's best seller.|$|R

50|$|Rotherham {{was born}} in Coventry in 1869 to Alexander Rotherham of Coundon Hall. He was educated at Uppingham School before being {{accepted}} into Trinity College, Cambridge in 1888, gaining a BA in 1891. Rotherham began his medical career at St Thomas' Hospital, London before becoming a house surgeon at Nottingham General Hospital. He later became an Assistant Medical Officer at several asylums; London County Asylum in Purley, Horton Asylum and Manor Asylum in Epsom, before becoming a superintendent at the Dareth mental home in 1911. Arthur was also the cousin of Alan Rotherham, who {{was the son of}} Arthur's father's older brother John. In the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, players were listed by their <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> the two cousins are often confused with each other. Compounding the confusion is {{the fact that they had}} similar backgrounds and playing careers and as Alan's ended so Arthur's began.

50|$|Alan Rotherham {{was born}} on 31 July 1862 in Coventry, Warwickshire. He {{was the son of}} John Rotherham, a watch {{manufacturer}} from Coventry and his wife Margaret.
