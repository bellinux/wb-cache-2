5|$|Usually made of silver, the <b>Greek</b> <b>drachma</b> coin, {{including}} the tetradrachm, was the standard currency {{used throughout the}} Parthian Empire. The Arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana. They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well. From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5g or more than 4.2g. The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known coins of the Western {{world were}} minted {{in the kingdom}} of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the <b>Greek</b> <b>drachma,</b> the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the Indian rupee {{from the time of the}} Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.|$|E
