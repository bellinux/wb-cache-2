5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power <b>forward</b> <b>position.</b> Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability {{made him one of the}} few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{played the}} power <b>forward</b> <b>position,</b> but {{occasionally}} played small forward and center. He {{was known for}} his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility.|$|E

5|$|In {{its defense}} of {{that part of}} Sobuk-san south of Battle Mountain and P'ilbong, the 1st Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, also had nearly {{continuous}} action {{in the last week}} of the month. During this time, Master Sergeant Melvin O. Handrich of C Company, 5th Regimental Combat Team posthumously won the Medal of Honor for actions on August 25 and 26. From a <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> he directed artillery fire on an attacking North Korean force and at one point personally kept part of the company from abandoning its positions. Although wounded, Handrich returned to his <b>forward</b> <b>position,</b> to continue directing artillery fire, and engaged North Korean troops alone until he was killed. When the 5th Regimental Combat Team regained the area, it counted over 70 dead North Koreans in the vicinity, all likely killed by Handrich. By the end of August, the fighting in the mountains west of Masan remained a stalemate. Neither side had secured a definite advantage.|$|E
5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (<b>forward)</b> <b>position.</b> The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in <b>forward</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the 2013 season, the coach met with Osvaldo Alonso, Clint Dempsey, and Evans since they were a core group of players. The group agreed on the aforementioned changes to the team. Starting striker Eddie Johnson was later traded while a new central defender, winger, midfielder, goalkeeper, and depth at the <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> were brought in. The team played 2014 with Dempsey and Obafemi Martins playing more through the middle as the Sounders won the US Open Cup and the Supporters Shield.|$|E

5|$|After the {{war there}} were several plans (Project 27) to {{reconstruct}} Petropavlovsk, as she was now known, using the bow of Frunze and moving her third turret to the <b>forward</b> <b>position,</b> {{but they were not}} accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948.

On May 18, Syria attacked the Israeli <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> in Samakh (Tzemah), and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan. The attack on Degania Alef was a failure, after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet.

Barclay's reinforcements, however, were sent into the fray only to be torn to pieces by French artillery, leaving Friant's Division {{in control of the}} Russian <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> at 11:30. Dust, smoke, confusion, and {{exhaustion}} all combined to keep the French commanders on the field (Davout, Ney, and Murat) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back, were in confusion, and ripe for the taking.|$|E

Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team in September 1893, but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, {{after months}} of {{lobbying}} by Potts—who was keen {{to get back into}} action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign—the 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island, where the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the island where they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> in the Wakunai Valley. Over {{the course of the next}} three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers.|$|E

Georgetown was named by some voters as the number one team in the nation in the preseason polls due to its highly touted recruiting class.

In the 2006–07 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50–40–90 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle.

The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{base for}} the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea was Wilhelmshaven {{on the western side}} of the Jade Bight; the port of Cuxhaven, located on the mouth of the Elbe, was also a major base in the North Sea. The island of Heligoland {{provided}} a fortified <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> in the German Bight. Kiel was the most important base in the Baltic, which supported the forward bases at Pillau and Danzig. The Kaiser Wilhelm Canal through Schleswig-Holstein connected the Baltic and North Seas and allowed the German Navy to quickly shift naval forces between the two seas. In peacetime, all ships on active duty in the High Seas Fleet were stationed in Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, or Danzig. Germany possessed only one major overseas base, at Kiautschou in China, where the East Asia Squadron was stationed.|$|E

5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more <b>forward</b> <b>position</b> on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's {{division}} would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E
