50|$|As {{opposed to}} the {{previous}} generation's single coil, the third generation brought two smaller coils in each damper. With the single electromagnetic coil, {{there was a small}} delay from when the ECU turned off the current to when the damper lost its magnetic field. This was caused by a temporary electric current, or eddy current, in the electromagnet. This phenomenon resulted in a 20 ms delay in reaction time of the dampers. BWI eliminated this delay with its <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> system. The two coils are wound in opposite directions to each other, cancelling out the eddy currents. The <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> system effectively eliminated the delay, causing a quicker responding suspension system.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>coil</b> [...] "humbucker" [...] pickups, {{sometimes}} {{abbreviated to}} DC pickups, have two signal-producing coils that are reverse-wound around opposed polarity magnets (similar {{in principle to}} the two individual J-pickups or {{the two halves of}} a modern Precision pickup, only in a single housing). This significantly reduces unwanted noise from electromagnetic interference compared to single coil pickups. Humbuckers also often produce a higher output level than single coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils. <b>Dual</b> <b>coil</b> pickups come in two main varieties; ceramic or ceramic and steel. Ceramic-only magnets have a relatively [...] "harsher" [...] sound than their ceramic and steel counterparts, and are thus used more commonly in heavier rock styles (heavy metal music, hardcore punk, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{latching}} relays can have either single or dual coils. On a single coil device, the relay will operate {{in one direction}} when power is applied with one polarity, and will reset when the polarity is reversed.

5000|$|A {{successful}} early humbucking pickup was {{the so-called}} PAF (literally [...] "Patent Applied For") invented by Seth Lover in 1955. Because of this, {{and because of}} its use on the Gibson Les Paul guitar, popularization of the humbucker is strongly associated with Gibson, although humbuckers {{had been used in}} many different guitar designs by many different manufacturers before. Humbuckers are also known as dual-coil, double-coil, or hum-canceling pickups. Rickenbacker offered <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> pickups arranged in a humbucking pattern beginning in late 1953 but dropped the design in 1954 due to the perceived distorted sound, which had stronger mid-range presence. The Gibson Les Paul was the first guitar to use humbuckers in substantial production, but since then, even some models of Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters, traditionally fitted with single-coil pickups, are factory-equipped with humbuckers. Stratocasters fitted with one humbucker in the bridge position, resulting in a pickup configuration noted as H-S-S (starting at bridge pickup: H for humbucker, S for single coil) are referred to as [...] "Fat Strats", because of the [...] "fatter", [...] "rounder" [...] tone offered by the humbucking pickup.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>dual</b> voice <b>coil</b> actuator which {{is suitable for}} both long travel and high speed short stroke movements. The actuator is arrange {{in the form of}} two voice coils motors (VCM), with the small one responsible for high speed/short travels, and the larger one for lower speed and longer travels. However, this arrangement introduced problems of inter-VCM motion coupling disturbances, and undesirable mechanical characteristics on the small VCM. To overcome them, this paper proposed to investigate the full control model of the <b>dual</b> voice <b>coil</b> actuator, and to use this knowledge as compensation blocks in the control system to reduce the control nonlinearities and coupling effects. Due to the nonconventional geometry of the dual VCM actuator, a novel method of obtaining the model parameters has been developed. Results show that the proposed control structure has substantial improvement over traditional dual PID control in terms of speed, accuracy, disturbance rejection and control robustness. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|At {{least one}} company, Audiovox, built {{and may have}} offered an {{electric}} solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, [...] "Bud-Electro" [...] until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum cancelling <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled Rickenbacker and may have passed on Tutmarc's magnetic pickup technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and pole-piece pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, beginning in 1933.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{proposal}} of electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) in <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> configuration with consequent application of signal de-noising algorithm {{is presented in}} detail. Dual EMAT contains two operated coils in a single housing. Both coils transmit and receive the ultrasonic signal. Based on the proposed coil configuration, two signals characterizing material structure {{at the same place}} are received and consequently evaluated. This configuration makes the flaw detection process more accurate and the noise level can be efficiently suppressed using advanced signal processing algorithms. In this study, we also investigate {{the proposal}} of signal processing algorithm used for signal and noise separation. The proposed algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) uses the statistical information to separate useful signal as fault echo from the undesirable echoes that are caused by the scattering from grains contained in materials. Using our proposed algorithm it is possible to recognize the fault echo that is hidden under the noise level from backscattering noise.

Nine patients, eight with unruptured and one with ruptured aneurysms {{were included in the}} study. Of aneurysms embolized with a hybrid (with two different stents) and non-hybrid (with two identical stents) technique, three were lo-cated in the anterior communicating artery, three at the tip and one at the distal site of basi-lar artery, and two in the middle cerebral artery. All aneurysms included the orifices of bifurca-tion vessels. All aneurysms were stented and embolized during the same session. While Neu-roform and Enterprise stents were used in the hybrid technique, two Enterprise stents were used in the non-hybrid technique. <b>Dual</b> Y-stent assisted <b>coil</b> embolization was performed successfully in eight of nine patients (88. 9 %), including five patients (55. 6 %) with hybrid and three patients (33. 3 %) with non-hybrid technique.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{application}} of lean homogeneous combustion in SI engines using a passive SCR after treatment system. By implementing this concept a decrease in fuel consumption and engine out NOx is expected. The data and results are obtained through engine experiments. Under lean conditions the ignition system faces harder conditions, in order to reliably ignite a lean fuel/air mixture an advanced ignition system is necessary. A literature study revealed that among, standard ignition, <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> ignition, laser ignition, corona ignition and pre-chamber ignition the pre-chamber ignition system was capable of igniting the highest diluted mixture. The corona system however was second best and {{does not require a}} modification to the engine. The <b>dual</b> <b>coil</b> ignition system was installed on a multi-cylinder engine. This system uses a standard spark plug but by firing two coils in consecutive order a long duration spark is created. By applying this system and optimizing the timing of the existing adjustable cam shafts for lean conditions, substantial decreases in fuel consumption and NOx were achieved. Another part of this thesis {{is about the}} after treatment system. An ammonia formation catalyst produces ammonia under rich engine conditions and stores it.

40|$|Background: A compact {{theory that}} predicts quantitatively {{when and where}} {{magnetic}} neurostimulation will occur is needed {{as a guide to}} therapy, ideally providing a single equation that defines the target volume of tissue excited by single or <b>dual</b> <b>coils.</b> Methods: A first-principles analysis of magnetic stimulation incorporating a simplified description of electromagnetic fields and a simplified cable theory of the axon yields a mathematical synthesis predicting how to aim. Results: Nerve stimulation produced by a single circular coil having one or more closely packed turns occurs in donut shaped volume of tissue beneath the coil. Axons spanning several millimeters are the sites of magnetic stimulation. The sites of maximal transmembrane depolarization in nerve fibers correspond to points where the axons enter or exit this volume of magnetically induced voltage and current. The axonal membrane at one end is depolarized locally during the rising phase of current in the coil. The axonal membrane at the opposite end is depolarized locally during the falling phase of current in the coil. Penetration depths of several centimeters from the skin surface or approximately one to two coil radii are practical. With two coils placed in a figure-of-eight configuration the separate clockwise and counterclockwise currents generate magnetic fields that add, producing maximal stimulation of a spindle shaped volume, centered at a depth of one-third to one-half coil radius from the body surface. Conclusions: This condensed synthesis of electromagnetic theory and cable theories of axon physiology provides a partial solution to the targeting problem in peripheral and in transcranial magnetic stimulatio...|$|R
