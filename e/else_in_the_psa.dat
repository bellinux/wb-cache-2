40|$|OBJECTIVE: • To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of radical prostatectomy (RP) {{in a series of}} patients with prostate cancer with very high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by comparing the clinical outcomes of different PSA thresholds (20. 1 - 50 ng/mL, 50. 1 - 100 ng/mL and > 100 ng/mL, respectively). PATIENTS AND METHODS: • Within a multicentre European retrospective database of 712 RP in patients with a baseline PSA level > 20 ng/mL, we identified 48 patients with prostate cancer with a preoperative PSA level > 100 ng/mL, 137 with a PSA level between 50. 1 and 100 ng/mL and 527 with PSA values between 20. 1 and 50 ng/mL. • Comparisons between groups were performed using chi-square test, analysis of variance and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test. RESULTS: • Ten-year projected cancer-specific survival (79. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> > 100 ng/mL group vs 85. 4 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> 50. 1 - 99 ng/mL group vs 90. 9 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> 20. 1 - 50 ng/mL interval; P= 0. 037) but not overall survival (59. 6 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> > 100 ng/mL group vs 71. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> 50. 1 - 99 ng/mL group vs 75. 3 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> 20. 1 - 50 ng/mL interval; P= 0. 087) appeared significantly affected by <b>the</b> different <b>PSA</b> thresholds. • At a median follow-up of 78. 7 months, 25. 8 %, 6. 6 % and 8. 3 % of patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> level groups for 20. 1 - 50 ng/mL, 50. 1 - 100 ng/mL and > 100 ng/mL respectively, were cured by surgery alone. CONCLUSIONS: • Ten-year cancer-specific survival, while showing significant reduction with increasing PSA values intervals, remain relatively high even for PSA levels > 100 ng/mL. • As part of a multimodal treatment strategy, RP may therefore be an option, even in selected patients with prostate cancer whose PSA level is > 100 ng/mL. status: publishe...|$|R

The aim of {{this retrospective cohort study}} was to determine the outcome of purse string approximation (PSA) compared to primary linear closure (PLC) of the skin after loop ileostomy reversal. MethodsData of 140 patients operated between 2005 and 2012 were analyzed in this two-center-study to determine the outcome of patients with either PSA (n =  44) or PLC (n =  96) after loop ileostomy reversal. ResultsPatients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> group were significantly older than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PLC group (64  ±  15 vs. 57  ±  18; p =  0. 026).

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} tamsulosin on reducing the serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and an elevated PSA level. METHODS From June 2004 to July 2006, patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, a PSA level of >= 4 ng/mL, and a maximal flow rate of < 15 mL/s received tamsulosin 0. 4 mg daily for 2 months. They were then scheduled for 12 -core prostate biopsy. PSA determination and a uroflow study were performed before biopsy. RESULTS A total of 80 patients completed the present study. The mean patient age was 66. 3 years, and <b>the</b> mean <b>PSA</b> level was 7. 8 +/- 8. 4 ng/mL at baseline and 7. 1 +/- 9. 1 ng/mL after treatment (P <. 001). A total of 29 patients (36. 25 %) were diagnosed with prostate cancer from the biopsy findings. A significant increment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> level was observed in patients with prostate cancer (6. 7 versus 7. 9 ng/mL; P =. 002). A significant decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> level was observed in patients with negative biopsy findings (6. 9 versus 5. 1 ng/mL, P =. 000). Of the 38 patients with a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> level, 1 (2. 6 %) was diagnosed with prostate cancer and 37 (97. 4 %) with an benign prostatic hyperplasia/prostatitis. Of the 42 patients with no change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> level, 28 (66. 7 %) had prostate cancer and 14 (33. 3 %) had negative findings.

40|$|PurposeDue to the {{low rate}} of {{screening}} for prostate cancer <b>in</b> Japan, <b>the</b> incidence rates of cancer are high. We have established a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) -based screening system for prostate cancer in our region. We analyzed recent trends of clinical symptoms and prognosis of prostate cancer patients aged 55 to 69 years old in our institution. MethodsBetween 2000 and 2007, 162 cases of prostate cancer in patients aged 55 to 69 years old were newly diagnosed. The study population was divided into 119 cases with high PSA without symptoms, 36 cases with urological symptoms, and 7 cases with systemic symptoms. We analyzed the clinical courses of <b>the</b> patients <b>in</b> each group. ResultsThe rate of localized disease was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> testing group than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other groups. <b>The</b> median serum <b>PSA</b> levels were 1, 600 ng/mL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> systemic symptom group, 13. 3 ng/mL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urological symptom group, and 7. 1 ng/mL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> testing group. <b>The</b> probability of nonrecurrence of <b>the</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> testing group {{was significantly higher than}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other groups.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of proteins which bind to hormone-dependent nuclear receptors and mediate their effects on gene expression are being identified. The human prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein 2 (KLK 2) genes are regulated by the androgen receptor (AR). Using electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA), a common nuclear protein(s) which binds upstream of the androgen-responsive elements (AREs) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> and KLK 2 promoters was identified. Binding occurred between bp - 539 and - 399 and bp - 349 and - 224 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> and KLK 2 promoters respectively, which were shown previously to be necessary for AR-mediated transactivation.

40|$|Pannexins are newly {{discovered}} proteins that were first discovered by Panchin <b>in</b> 2000. <b>The</b> pannexin family has three isomers, i. e. pannexin- 1, pannexin- 2, and pannexin- 3. In 2011, Billaud et al suggested that pannexin 1 channels {{contribute to the}} spread of vasoconstriction after activation of α 1 D-adrenoceptors present on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) of thoracodorsal resistance arteries (TDA) isolated from mice. Phenylephrine acting upon the α 1 D-adrenoceptors activated pannexin 1 channels present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell to release ATP, which in turn activated P 2 Y receptors on neighbouring cells to produce a co-ordinated contractile response. This aim of this work was to further investigate the role of pannexin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulation of contractile responses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vasculature. To this end, the present study examined the presence and function of pannexins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> porcine splenic artery (<b>PSA)</b> and <b>the</b> rat aorta (RA), in which α 1 A- and α 1 D-adrenoceptors are present respectively. The role of pannexin channels and ATP (via activation of P 2 purinoceptors) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> response to exogenous NA-induced contractile responses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> and <b>the</b> RA were investigated, as were responses to sympathetic nerve activation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA.</b> <b>The</b> involvement of pannexin channels was studied using several pannexin inhibitors, i. e. mefloquine (a non-selective pannexin inhibitor), probenecid (a selective pannexin 1 inhibitor at low concentrations), carbenoxolone (a selective pannexin 1 inhibitor) and Brilliant Blue FCF (a selective pannexin 1 inhibitor). Additionally, the involvement of ATP in NA-induced responses was examined using P 2 purinoceptor antagonists (PPADS, suramin and NF 449). Further experiments examined the role of pannexins in contributing to endothelium-dependent responses in a large vessel i. e. the porcine coronary artery (PCA). The results showed that both pannexin 1 and pannexin 2 are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> and <b>the</b> RA. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA,</b> mefloquine and probenecid reduced the responses to both NA-induced contractions and the frequency-dependent response curves generated to sympathetic nerve stimulation, whereas carbenoxolone, suramin and PPADS had no effect on responses to either exogenous NA or those caused by activating <b>the</b> sympathetic nerves. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> RA, mefloquine and probenecid reduced the response to NA-induced contractions, whereas BB-FCF had no effect. Purinoceptor antagonists (suramin, PPADs and NF 449) had no effect on responses mediated by either α 1 A–adrenoceptors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> or α 1 D–adrenoceptors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RA, arguing against the role of ATP (via activation of P 2 receptors) in mediating NA-induced responses <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> or <b>the</b> RA. Conflicting results were obtained, in some cases, upon the use of three different pannexin inhibitors. The most likely {{reason for this is that}} mefloquine demonstrated non-selective inhibitory actions on contractile responses since it was also shown to inhibit responses to KCl, 5 -HT, U 46619 (the thromboxane mimetic), and responses to re-addition of calcium to depolarised preparations, suggesting that it acts to block L-type Ca 2 + currents. Both mefloquine and probenecid demonstrated non-selective inhibitory effects when used at relatively high concentrations. Therefore, mefloquine and probenecid should only be used in low concentrations as pannexin 1 inhibitors. It has been suggested that pannexin proteins may be involved in mediating endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) responses (Gaynullina, Shestopalov et al 2015). Bradykinin (BK) was shown to induce relaxation in PCA and to a lesser extent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> after inhibition of NO-synthase and cyclooxygenase. The evidence for the involvement of pannexin in mediating an EDHF response was limited <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> and <b>the</b> PCA, since neither carbenoxolone nor probenecid had any effect. While mefloquine reduced EDH-mediated responses to bradykinin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PCA, the questions about its selectivity make this observation difficult to interpret. The present work therefore provided some evidence for the involvement of pannexin channels in conducting responses to NA-induced α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in blood vessels <b>in</b> <b>PSA</b> and <b>the</b> RA, although great care must be taken in interpreting this data on the basis of a lack of selectivity of the pharmacological agents currently available as pannexin inhibitors. In addition, there was no evidence that activation of α 1 -adrenoreceptors causes the release of ATP from inside cells to act as an intercellular messenger, leading to P 2 receptor-mediated contractions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Need for {{undertaking}} prostate biopsies for {{detection of}} prostate cancer is often decided {{on the basis of}} serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Aim: To evaluate the case detection rate {{of prostate cancer}} among patients presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) on <b>the</b> basis of <b>PSA</b> levels and to assess the scope of prostate biopsy in these patients. Setting and Design: A retrospective study from a tertiary care center. Materials and Methods: The clinical and histopathological data of 922 patients presenting with LUTS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last five years was obtained from the medical record section. They had been screened for prostate cancer using PSA and /or digital rectal examination examination followed by confirmation with prostate biopsy. Statistical Analysis Used: Detection rate and receiver operating characteristic curve were performed using SPSS 16 and Medcalc softwares. Results: The detection rate of prostate cancer according to <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> levels was 0. 6 &#x 0025;, 2. 3 &#x 0025;, 2. 5 &#x 0025;, 34. 1 &#x 0025; and 54. 9 &#x 0025; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> range of 0 - 4, 4 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 50 and&# 62; 50 ng/ml, respectively.
