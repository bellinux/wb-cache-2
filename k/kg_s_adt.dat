40|$|Optimisation of S {{release from}} decomposing {{soil organic matter}} and S {{fertiliser}} related to plant S uptake is a central issue and goal in applied research in agricultural systems. Two lysimeter experiments were conducted in central Italy in two subsequent seasons on two commercial durum wheat cultivars to investigate the effects on yield, S and N uptake and leaching of different rates of N and S fertilisers, soil type and split applications of S. Sulphur fertiliser increased grain yield and N and S uptake of both varieties. Grain yield increase was mainly due to an increase {{of the number of}} kernels per spike, which was interpreted as a stimulation of the initiation of spikelets and/or florets, or to a reduction the floret mortality. As an average of the two seasons, S leaching during wheat cycle was 35 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1. Sulphur fertiliser rate increased S concentration in drainage water and consequently S leached during wheat cycle. Compared to unfertilised control, S leached was by 13 kg ha− 1 higher at 60 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1 and by 19 kg ha− 1 higher at 120 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1. The splitting of sulphur fertiliser during crop cycle modified both grain yield and S leaching. The highest grain yield and S plant uptake was obtained with the splitting of S rate into 60 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1 before seeding and 60 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1 at stem elongation and the lowest amount of S lost by leaching occurred with the application of 36 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1 before seeding and 84 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha− 1 at stem elongation. Sulphur output was equally accounted for by leaching and plant uptake. The input–output balance of S was positive in both experiments only when the higher S rate was applied, as more S was imported than removed. Thus, no substantial S deficit may be expected in short term, provided that high S fertiliser rate is applied and the availability of S is synchronised with plant needs...|$|R

40|$|Inadequate {{nutrition}} and helminthiasis {{were among the}} important constraints to smallscale dairy production identified in a 4 -country survey among traditional dairy producers. Consequently, multi-locational trials to study helminth control and supplementary feeding to grazing cattle are being implemented in the 4 countries, Ghana, Senegal, Mali and Nigeria. In one such trial in Nigeria, 60 lactating cows of the Bunaji breed were studied in a 2 x 2 factorial design (supplement, no deworm (T 4)). The supplement was provided during 2 periods of 6 wk duration each and cows were dewormed 3 times during a 10 -mo trial period. The supplement was dry brewer's spent grain (24 percent CP) fed at 4 kg/d. The dewormer drug was Albenzal adminstered at 250 mg/kg. Cows consumed an average of 3. 5 kg/d of the supplement. Mean monthly milk offtake extracted from cows in group T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4 during the first 2 mo of supplementation and 1 mo after initial deworming were 42. 1, 46. 4, 45. 9 and 40. 8 <b>kg</b> (<b>S.</b> E. = 4. 25), respectively, which were 8, 6, 5 and 0 percent increase over pretreatment values.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} the frequency of offi cial milk recording {{and the number of}} recorded samples per test-day on the accuracy of predicting daily yield and cumulative 305 -day yield was investigated. A control data set consisting of 58 210 primiparous cows with milk test-day records every 4 weeks was used to investigate the infl uence of reduced milk recording frequencies. The accuracy of prediction of daily yield with one milk sample per test-day was investigated using 41 874 test-day records from 683 cows. Results show that fi ve or more test-day records taken at 8 -weekly intervals (A 8) predicted 305 -day yield {{with a high level of}} accuracy. Correlations between 305 -day yield predicted from 4 -weekly recording intervals (A 4) and from 8 -weekly intervals were 0 · 99, 0 · 98 and 0 · 98 for milk, fat and protein, respectively. The mean error in estimating 305 -day yield from the A 8 scheme was 6 · 8 <b>kg</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 191 <b>kg)</b> for milk yield, 0 · 3 <b>kg</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 10 <b>kg)</b> for fat yield, and- 0 · 3 <b>kg</b> (<b>s.</b> d. 7 <b>kg)</b> for protein yield, compared with the A 4 scheme. Milk yield and composition taken during either morning (AM) or evening (PM) milking predicted 24 -h yield with a high degree of accuracy. Alternating between AM and PM sampling every 4 weeks predicted 305 -day yield with a higher degree of accuracy than either all AM or all PM sampling. Alternate AM-PM recording every 4 weeks and AM + PM recording every 8 weeks produced very similar accuracies in predicting 305 -day yield compared with the offi cial AM + PM recording every 4 weeks...|$|R
40|$|The {{decreased}} inputs of S from atmospheric acidic deposition, {{the use of}} low S-containing fertilisers, and {{the decrease}} of organic matter content in soil resulted in S deficiency in many agricultural regions of the world. Sulphur fertilisation significantly affects grain yield and protein composition of cereals, thus altering the technological quality of grain. Field experiments were conducted in central Italy in two subsequent seasons to investigate the effects of N and S application on five commercial wheat cultivars known to differ in yield potential and grain N content. Fertiliser treatments were two levels of N fertiliser (120 kg N ha(- 1) and 180 kg N ha(- 1)) and three levels of S fertiliser (not applied, 60 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha(- 1). and 120 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha(- 1)). Analyzed characters were dry weight and N and S uptake of grain and vegetative plant part, and grain quality characters. Variations in weather pattern - and especially in rainfall - between years significantly influenced grain yield and N and S content of grain, but did not affect quality parameters. Nitrogen and S application also significantly affected grain yield and the quality characteristics W, P/L, dry gluten and SDS. although no interactive effect between treatments was observed. The highest protein content and Win grain was obtained with {{the combination of the}} highest fertiliser rates: 180 kg N ha(- 1) and 120 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha(- 1). Genotypes differed for yield stability between years, in that grain production was decreased in the driest year only in the varieties Claudio and Creso, but they responded similarly to N and S fertilisation. Genotypes differed also for protein concentration and quality parameters, and, on average, the varieties Duilio, Simeto and Svevo gave better performances. Differences in grain quality parameters were maintained through years, indicating that these traits are under strong genetic control. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study. SUBJECTS: Healthy women, aged 18 - 35 y, using DMPA for contraception (n= 178) and women using no hormonal contraception (n= 145). MEASUREMENTS: Weight, body fat, and the central distribution of fat, measured at 3 -month intervals for 30 months, by electronic scale and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The ratio of central to peripheral distribution of body fat was computed by dividing the body fat in the conventional DEXA trunk region of interest (ROI) by the ROI 2 ̆ 7 s that encompass the arms, hips and legs. RESULTS: Women using DMPA had a significantly greater increase in all measures of fatness than women using no hormonal method of contraception (P 3 ̆c 0. 03).

Potential impact includes acidification of soil and surface water and mobilisation of metal ions, with the resultant loss of plant productivity, changes in plant species diversity and changes in biotic communities in aquatic ecosystems. Rates of <b>S</b> (8 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha- 1 year- 1) and N (> 6 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha- 1 year- 1) deposition to the grasslands of the South African Highveld are comparable to other industrialised areas where ecosystem impacts have been observed. As part of a larger project, this work investigated four aspects of ecosystem impact: changes in soil and river water chemistry as well as S and N mineralisation rates. Reassessment of the soil chemistry at 18 sites on the South African Highveld after a 16 -year period showed increases in both acidic and basic ion concentrations for individual sites and when the values for these sites were averaged to represent the study region.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years fast-sampling {{ultraviolet}} (UV) imaging cameras have been developed for use in measuring SO 2 emissions from industrial sources (e. g. power plants; typical emission rates ~ 1 – 10 <b>kg</b> <b>s</b> − 1) and natural sources (e. g. volcanoes; typical emission rates ~ 10 – 100 <b>kg</b> <b>s</b> − 1). Generally, measurements have been made from sources rich in SO 2 with high concentrations and emission rates. In this work, for the first time, a UV camera has been used to measure the much lower concentrations and emission rates of SO 2 (typical emission rates ~ 0. 01 – 0. 1 <b>kg</b> <b>s</b> − 1) in the plumes from moving and stationary ships. Some innovations and trade-offs have been made so that estimates of the emission rates and path concentrations can be retrieved in real time. Field experiments were conducted at Kongsfjord in Ny Ålesund, Svalbard, where SO 2 emissions from cruise ships were made, and at the port of Rotterdam, Netherlands, measuring emissions from more than 10 different container and cargo ships. In all cases SO 2 path concentrations could be estimated and emission rates determined by measuring ship plume speeds simultaneously using the camera, or by using surface wind speed data from an independent source. Accuracies were compromised in some cases {{because of the presence of}} particulates in some ship emissions and the restriction of single-filter UV imagery, a requirement for fast-sampling (> 10 Hz) from a single camera. Despite the ease of use and ability to determine SO 2 emission rates from the UV camera system, the limitation in accuracy and precision suggest that the system may only be used under rather ideal circumstances and that currently the technology needs further development to serve as a method to monitor ship emissions for regulatory purposes. A dual-camera system or a single, dual-filter camera is required in order to properly correct for the effects of particulates in ship plumes...|$|R

Four levels of S (0, 20, 40 and 60 <b>kg</b> <b>S</b> ha - 1) and three levels of N (80, 120 and 160 kg N ha - 1) and a control treatment with both nutrients at zero level were applied as a sole dose at sowing, or in two split applications (50 % at sowing + 50 % at leaf rosette stage), or three split applications (1 / 3 rd at sowing + 1 / 3 rd at leaf rosette stage+ 1 / 3 rd at flowering). The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block (RCB) Design with split plot arrangement having four replications. Treatments comprising N and S levels were applied to main plots while time of application treatments were assigned to sub plots. Analysis of the data collected from the experiments indicated that maturity of canola was delayed as N rate was increased. Increasing levels of N had progressively enhanced plant height, leaf area index and CGR up {{to the highest level}} of 160 kg N ha - 1. However, harvest index, was increased up to 120 kg N ha - 1.

40|$|A straight, {{single channel}} {{membrane}} humidifier was constructed to measure temperature and moisture profiles along both the donor and receiver channels. A persulfonic Nafion membrane {{was used as}} the water exchange medium. We report on results obtained with single-phase vapour-to-vapour, counter flow operation. First, the heat loss to the surroundings was quantified and found to affect the overall performance significantly. Second, the results from varying flow rates indicate that lower flow rates lead to higher outlet dew point values of the receiver stream which can be related to longer residence times. It was also found that moisture transfer is more strongly influenced by the flow rate through the receiver side than the donor side. Finally, five-point dew point profiles for both donor and receiver sides are reported for various temperature conditions.
