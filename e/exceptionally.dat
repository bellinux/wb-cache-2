5|$|Although most {{countries}} whose music {{falls into the}} Western tradition {{have contributed to the}} organ repertoire, France and Germany in particular have produced <b>exceptionally</b> large amounts of organ music. There is also an extensive repertoire from the Netherlands, England, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 an <b>exceptionally</b> strong {{composite}} of aluminium oxide and silicon carbide whiskers was discovered. Development of this laboratory-produced composite {{to a commercial}} product took only three years. In 1985, the first commercial cutting tools made from this alumina and silicon carbide whisker-reinforced composite {{were introduced to the}} market.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have <b>exceptionally</b> sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{transistors}} {{have been}} produced in the laboratory. They are functional at much higher temperatures than silicon devices, and are resistant to chemical and radiation damage. While no diamond transistors have yet been successfully integrated into commercial electronics, they are promising for use in <b>exceptionally</b> high-power situations and hostile non-oxidizing environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{church at}} Østerlars {{on the island}} of Bornholm was built around 1150. Like three other churches on the island, it is a round church. The three-storeyed {{building}} is supported by a circular outer wall and an <b>exceptionally</b> wide, hollow central column.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} {{hatching}} to pupation lasts 10 days to two years, <b>exceptionally</b> {{up to six}} years. Climate is a major factor, because development is slower in colder regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are <b>exceptionally</b> large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated {{around the perimeter of}} a large, central atrium. Originally the atrium was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E

5|$|Two {{most popular}} multi-pitch routes for {{technical}} climbing {{are on the}} eastern and south-western walls. Both are <b>exceptionally</b> long and situated on solid granite walls. The best season for climbing is mid September to mid October or until the snow falls. Another good season lasts from late June to early August.|$|E
5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an <b>exceptionally</b> low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the creator}} of BackupHDDVD, he or she first set out to {{circumvent}} AACS to bypass a restriction in software HD DVD players which reduced the quality of AACS restricted 1080p high definition video to that of standard definition DVD video or refused to play outright unless an HDCP compliant chain of video hardware was present. At the time only a few computer monitors and video cards supported HDCP. As a result, configurations {{that would have allowed}} high-definition HD DVD viewing in software players were <b>exceptionally</b> rare.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their <b>exceptionally</b> acute {{eyesight}} and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Cornell (the first time), Warner became {{head coach}} of the {{football}} team at Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1899, a flagship Indian boarding school founded to teach children and young men skills to advance in American society. Its late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century football teams were nationally prominent, and Warner was paid $1,200 (approximately $33,000 in 2016), an <b>exceptionally</b> high salary for a coach at the time.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed to push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion {{was not involved in}} any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid <b>exceptionally</b> muddy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} it first reached peak intensity, Greta was an {{extraordinarily}} large hurricane, with the gale-diameter of the storm extending roughly 1,200mi (1,930km). After attaining its peak intensity, the storm began to move over cooler waters, resulting in the circulation becoming elongated, however it did not weaken {{over the next couple}} days. On the morning of November 6, Greta transitioned into an <b>exceptionally</b> large and intense extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, <b>exceptionally</b> constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was <b>exceptionally</b> stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., Ltd was an English {{ironmaking}} {{and mining}} company founded in 1864, {{based on the}} partnership since 1840 of its two founders, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan. The firm drove the dramatic growth of Middlesbrough {{and the production of}} coal and iron in the north-east of England in the 19th century. The two founding partners had an <b>exceptionally</b> close working relationship which lasted until Vaughan's death.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, French {{observers}} remarked favorably on the industriousness {{and intelligence}} {{of the people of}} Rurutu, as well as the success of Teuruarii in increasing revenues through maritime trade with neighboring islands. In 1899, Rurutu's annual exports were valued at 59,881 French francs, of which 37,919 were exported to the Tahitian port of Papeete - <b>exceptionally</b> high trade volumes in light of the relatively small size of the island and its population.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed <b>exceptionally</b> high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also <b>exceptionally</b> has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role and is not very toxic.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is <b>exceptionally</b> well-preserved; it {{provides}} {{one of the}} finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire.|$|E
5|$|Development was {{initially}} slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once {{clear of the}} unfavorable region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment <b>exceptionally</b> conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several <b>exceptionally</b> cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium carbonate, Dy2(CO3)3, and {{dysprosium}} sulfate, Dy2(SO4)3, {{result from}} similar reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy2(C2O4)3·10H2O) are both insoluble in water. Two {{of the most}} abundant dysprosium carbonates, tengerite-(Dy) (Dy2(CO3)3·2–3H2O) and kozoite-(Dy) (DyCO3(OH)) are known to form via a poorly ordered (amorphous) precursor phase with a formula of Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O. This amorphous precursor consists of highly hydrated spherical nanoparticles of 10–20nm diameter that are <b>exceptionally</b> stable under dry treatment at ambient and high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Favourable {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an <b>exceptionally</b> high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
