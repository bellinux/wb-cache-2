Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{flew the}} most sorties of any Australian bomber squadron and dropped more bomb tonnage than any squadron {{in the whole}} of Bomber Command—24,856 tons, which it dropped over 6,262 sorties. <b>In</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> it lost 188 aircraft and suffered 1,018 combat deaths (589 of whom were Australian). This was the most of any Australian squadron during the war, with No. 460 Squadron effectively wiped out five times over its existence. RAF Bomber Command represented only two percent of total Australian enlistments during World War II, but accounted for almost 20 percent of personnel killed in action. Total Bomber Command losses were 55,573 for all nationalities.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} {{the large numbers of}} illegal {{immigrants}} present in the United States is the termination of the bracero program. This bi-national program between the U.S. and Mexico existed from 1942 to 1964 to supply qualified Mexican laborers as guest workers to harvest fruits and vegetables in the United States. During World War II, the program benefited the U.S. war effort by replacing citizens' labor in agriculture to serve as soldiers overseas. The program was designed to provide legal flows of qualified laborers to the U.S. Many Mexicans deemed unqualified for the program nonetheless immigrated illegally to the United States to work. <b>In</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> they broke both U.S. and Mexican law. Many legal temporary workers became illegal when they chose to continue working in the U.S. after this program ended. The change in law was not accompanied by a change in economic incentives for Mexican workers and the American growers.|$|E

According to Paul himself, it will not cost a thing, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, [...] "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> through the internet. But, I believe we can do better.

[...] Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last years}} of Ludlow’s life {{seem to have been}} a {{constant}} struggle with addiction. Family letters, when they mention him, usually either hopefully discuss his latest release from habit or mourn his latest relapse. His cousin wrote in March 1870, that “Dr. Smith has been treating him for a while but he said to a lady the other day — that there was no use in his wasting his strength [...] Mr. Ludlow, for he took a teaspoonful of morphine in a glass of whisky every day — and while he persisted <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> it was only time & strength thrown away...” ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in May 1833 {{while he}} was in London, a {{significant}} change in Bellini's relationship with Giuditta followed from the discovery by her husband of a compromising letter from Bellini. The result was that he decided to seek a legal separation and have her removed from his house. For Bellini, it meant the possibility of taking on responsibility for her, and he had no interest <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> having cooled in his feelings for her. [...] When he wrote to Florimo from Paris the following year, he clearly stated that [...] "I constantly am being threatened from Milan with Giuditta's coming to Paris", at which point he says he'll leave that city if that were to happen. Then he continues: [...] "I no longer want to be put in the position of renewing a relationship that made me suffer great troubles". Ultimately, he resisted any long-term emotional commitment, and never married.|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the study were {{politically}} sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications {{on the eve of a}} contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq. I was opposed to the war and I still think that the war was a bad idea, but I think that our science has transcended our perspectives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lichtenstein's works {{based on}} {{enlarged}} panels from comic books engendered a widespread debate about their merits as art. Lichtenstein himself admitted, [...] "I am nominally copying, but I am really restating the copied thing in other terms. <b>In</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> the original acquires {{a totally different}} texture. It isn't thick or thin brushstrokes, it's dots and flat colours and unyielding lines."
