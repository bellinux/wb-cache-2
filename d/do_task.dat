5000|$|Byrne and Pew (2009) {{consider}} {{an example of}} a basic workload question: [...] "To what extent <b>do</b> <b>task</b> A and B interfere?" [...] These researchers indicate this {{as the basis for the}} psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Participants perform two choice reaction-time tasks, and the two tasks will interfere to a degree - especially when the participant must react to the stimuli for the two tasks when they are close together in time - but the degree of interference is typically smaller than the total time taken for either task. The response selection bottleneck model (Pashler, 1994) models this situation well - in that each task has three components: perception, response selection (cognition), and motor output. The attentional limitation - and thus locus of workload - is that response selection can only be done for one task at a time. The model makes numerous accurate predictions, and those for which it cannot account are addressed by cognitive architectures (Byrne & Anderson, 2001; Meyer & Kieras, 1997). In simple dual-task situations, attention and workload are quantified, and meaningful predictions made possible.|$|E
50|$|Tracking these 6 {{pieces of}} info on a timely basis creates an {{accurate}} and complete record and gives both employee and employer {{a substantial amount}} of performance data for that individual. It also assists in avoiding common miscommunications in the workplace and helps solidify and reinforce the role/importance of the task at hand. This type of activity management is influenced heavily from Peter Drucker’s theory on time management among knowledge workers, and the belief that the closest thing to our thoughts that we can measure are our actions and activities. David Allen, whose Getting Things Done method rests similarly on the idea that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by recording them externally, thus freeing the mind from the job of remembering to concentrate on performing tasks, also plays a significant influence on this method.The main obstacle, according to Drucker, still at hand in the work force is the persistence among managers to continue to embrace 20th century management practices instead of adapting to a more modern approach to the current business landscape. The antiquated command and control approach used in past centuries does not work for knowledge workers because the employees themselves own the means of production (their minds). For this reason, the most important people to practice activity management are the senior leaders and management team at a company. The ability to open communications through tracking their own activities for their workforce to view effectively sends a culture message communicated throughout the organization, and helps reinforce the fact that it’s the manager’s job to lead by example. At PARC, researcher Victoria Bellotti also found that email is the main place where most people <b>do</b> <b>task</b> or activity management.|$|E

40|$|Task {{sheets are}} written texts {{generated}} specifically for assessment purposes {{in high schools}} in Queensland, Australia. They attempt to make assessment transparent by explaining the criteria used to assess performance. The criteria and statements of standards describe how a grade is awarded and provide evidence of teacher accountability for assessment. In this paper, task sheets from two Year 8 English classes in two such schools are described and analysed to investigate three questions: (1) What <b>do</b> <b>task</b> sheets reveal about practices and relationships operating in classroom-based literacy assessment?(2) How <b>do</b> <b>task</b> sheets document what counts as literacy and performance in literacy at this level of schooling? (3) Can any task sheet be ‘transparent’ and how much interpretation is required {{to make sense of}} it? The analysis was guided by a framework of methods drawn from Fairclough (1992), Gee (1990),and critical linguistic approaches. It found that task sheets are complex texts which communicate dimensions of assessment relating to teachers’ and students’ roles, the purposes of assessment, and criteria for what counts as performance. It is argued that assessment task sheets are themselves documents of the assessment culture, part of the socialisation of students into assessment practices in the classroom...|$|E

40|$|Major {{theories}} of team effectiveness position emergent collective cognitive processes as central drivers of team performance. We meta-analytically cumulated 231 correlations culled from 65 independent studies of team cognition and its relations to teamwork processes, motivational states, and performance outcomes. We examined both broad relationships among cognition, behavior, motivation, and perfor-mance, {{as well as}} 3 underpinnings of team cognition as potential moderators of these relationships. Findings reveal there is indeed a cognitive foundation to teamwork; team cognition has strong positive relationships to team behavioral process, motivational states, and team performance. Meta-analytic regressions further indicate that team cognition explains significant incremental variance in team performance after the effects of behavioral and motivational dynamics have been controlled. The nature of emergence, form of cognition, and content of cognition moderate relationships among cognition, process, and performance, as <b>do</b> <b>task</b> interdependence and team type. Taken together, these findings not only cumulate extant research on team cognition but also provide a new interpretation {{of the impact of}} underlying dimensions of cognition as a way to frame and extend future research...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to combine the concept of {{wireless}} power transfer and GSM controlled robot for the application of home automation. The wireless power transfer concept can be well utilized to charge battery of the GSM controlled robot. When the robot has completed its task, it can come to the origin where it can charge itself. Robot can be charged wirelessly, when it is not performing any task. Combination of GSM controlled robot and wireless power transfer provides greater advantage such as; no wastage of charge stored in the battery when the robot is not doing any task. This provides greater reliability that at any instant, robot can do its work once it receives a message through GSM module. GSM module of the robot and user mobile phone must be interfaced properly, so that robot can <b>do</b> <b>task</b> when it receives message from same user mobile phone, not from any other phone.

In order to answer this question for visual word recognition, we used EEG/MEG as well as fMRI to determine the latency ranges and spatial areas in which brain activation to words is modulated by task demands. We presented letter strings in three tasks (lexical decision, semantic decision, silent reading), and measured combined EEG/MEG as well as fMRI responses in two separate experiments. EEG/MEG sensor statistics revealed the earliest reliable task effects at around 150 ms, which were localized, using minimum norm estimates (MNE), to left inferior temporal, right anterior temporal and left precentral gyri. Later task effects (250 ms and 480 ms) occurred in left middle and inferior temporal gyri. Our fMRI data showed task effects in left inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal and precentral cortices. Although there was some correspondence between fMRI and EEG/MEG localizations, discrepancies predominated. We suggest that fMRI may be less sensitive to the early short-lived processes revealed in our EEG/MEG data. Our results indicate that task-specific processes start to penetrate word recognition already at 150 ms, suggesting that early word processing is flexible and intertwined with decision making...|$|E
