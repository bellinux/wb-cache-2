The PuC content in the mixedcarbide specimens was near 20 wt%. The specimens were irradiated as fuel rods in the fast reactor EBR-I. Maximum fuel burnup and temperature during irradiation were respectively 0. 10 metal atom percent and 650 deg C. The cast PuC specimens {{were found to have}} fractured to a greater extent under irradiation than did the cast mixed-carbide specimens. Dimensional chandges in those specimens which did not fracture were negligible. Fission gas release from the cast specimens was 0. 24 % of the theoretical yield. The pressed andd sintered pellets did not <b>fracture</b> <b>under</b> <b>irradiation</b> and showed negligible dimensional chandges. Fission gas release from the pellets was 12. 0 % of theoretical. The high gas release from the pressed and sintered specimens is attributed to a relatively high degree of open porosity which existed in the pellets. (auth...|$|E

40|$|In this {{reply to}} the comment of Cowern et al., we {{demonstrate}} {{on the basis of}} full numerical simulations of radiation enhanced dopant diffusion via the kick-out mechanism that the g/λ analysis fails to consistently describe boron (B) diffusion in germanium (Ge) <b>under</b> <b>irradiation.</b> Cowern et al. missed to perform a consistency check with results for the diffusivity DI of Ge interstitials (I) determined from Ge self-diffusion <b>under</b> <b>irradiation.</b> Data deduced for DI from the exponential B profile reported by Cowern et al. deviate several orders of magnitude from the self-diffusion study. This clearly disproves the validity of the kick-out mechanism to control radiation enhanced B diffusion in Ge. Exponential B profiles like those established in Ge <b>under</b> <b>irradiation</b> are also reported for silicon by Venezia et al. [Phys. Rev. B 69, 125215 (2004) ]. The characteristic shape is not described by the kick-out mechanism but rather explained qualitatively by the complex formation and dissolution of defect clusters. Modeling of B diffusion in Ge <b>under</b> <b>irradiation</b> performed by Schneider et al. [Phys. Rev.
