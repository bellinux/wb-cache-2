40|$|We {{present a}} new model that {{describes}} the process of electing a group of representatives (e. g., a parliament) {{for a group of}} voters. In this model, called the voting committee model, the elected group of representatives runs a number of ballots to make <b>final</b> <b>decisions</b> regarding various issues. The satisfaction of voters comes from the <b>final</b> <b>decisions</b> made by the elected committee. Our results suggest that depending on a decision system used by the committee to make these <b>final</b> <b>decisions,</b> different multi-winner election rules are most suitable for electing the committee. Furthermore, we show that if we allow not only a committee, but also an election rule used to make <b>final</b> <b>decisions,</b> to depend on the voters' preferences, we can obtain an even better representation of the voters...|$|R

5|$|After being {{sworn in}} as premier, Dunderdale {{announced}} {{that she would not}} be seeking the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a leadership election was held in the spring of 2011. However, on December 17, 2010, Dunderdale announced that she was reconsidering running for the leadership of the party and that she would make a <b>final</b> <b>decision</b> after Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Although most justices were {{immediately}} convinced, Warren {{spent some time}} after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided to drop their dissent. The <b>final</b> <b>decision</b> was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by {{all the members of}} the Court. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E

5|$|In December 2008, Mosley {{said that}} he still {{intended}} to stand down when his term ran out in October 2009, but would take the <b>final</b> <b>decision</b> in June of that year. Mosley's close relationship with Ecclestone, the sport's promoter, was criticised in early 2009 by Sir Jackie Stewart, who suggested that Mosley should resign in favour of a CEO from outside motorsport.|$|E

In October 1986, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Ray Corns issued an initial ruling that the package did not violate the state constitution, but both sides asked the Kentucky Supreme Court to make a <b>final</b> <b>decision.</b> On June 11, 1987, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled 4–3 that the package served a public purpose and were therefore constitutional.|$|E

5|$|Sørkjosen was {{launched}} {{as part of}} a national network of regional short take-off and landing airport which was proposed in the mid-1960s. The <b>final</b> <b>decision</b> to build the airport was taken by Parliament in 1972. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized regional routes in Finnmark, which included the route to Sørkjosen. Widerøe was awarded the contract in 1973. Sørkjosen Airport opened on 1 August 1974, the same day as four regional airports in Finnmark.|$|E

They all reached the same conclusion, that the detention scheme was constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a <b>final</b> <b>decision</b> on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E

In 1993, {{he was asked to}} audition for the role of Chandler Bing on Friends, while doing a play in London.

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the <b>final</b> <b>decision,</b> sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Azaria {{began dating}} former actress Katie Wright in 2007, {{and the two}} later married. They have a son together, Hal, {{who was born in}} 2009. In 2013, the family moved to New York, renting a home on 80th Street, with plans to make a <b>final</b> <b>decision</b> on where to live in two years. They {{previously}} lived in a four-bedroom house in Pacific Palisades, which Azaria bought from his The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta in 2011. Several weeks earlier, Azaria sold his home in Bel Air. Azaria previously owned the fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, which he bought in 2005 from photographer Cindy Sherman, before selling it in 2013.|$|E

Instead, the board asked Larsson to make a different painting.

40|$|Decision making {{processes}} usually involve time-consuming {{activities of}} collecting, processing and communicating information and computing and implementing the <b>final</b> <b>decisions.</b> Typically, if the environment does not change, {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>final</b> <b>decisions</b> improves with {{the amount of time spent}} on these activities. On the other hand, if the environment is changing with time, the <b>final</b> <b>decisions</b> will become more obsolete with longer delays, because the conditions for which they were designed will have changed. The problem of choosing optimal delays by balancing improvement against obsolescence is treated in this paper. Upon providing motivational examples the problem is formulated and illustrated, first in the single stage and then in the dynamic programming framework in two different ways. An economically interesting and informationally efficient optimal stopping policy is indicated. ...|$|R
