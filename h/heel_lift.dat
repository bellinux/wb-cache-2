40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} orthotic <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> on Achilles tendon (AT) force and strain during running. Ten females ran barefoot over a force plate in three conditions: no <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> (NHL), with 12 mm <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> (12 HL) and with 18 mm <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> (18 HL). Kinematics for the right lower limb were collected (200 Hz). AT force was calculated from inverse dynamics. AT strain was determined from kinematics and ultrasound images of medial gastrocnemius (50 Hz). Peak AT strain was less for 18 HL (5. 5 ± 4. 4 %) than for NHL (7. 4 ± 4. 2 %) (p =. 029, effect size [ES] = 0. 44) but not for 12 HL (5. 8 ± 4. 8 %) versus NHL (ES = 0. 35). Peak AT force was significantly (p =. 024, ES = 0. 42) less for 18 HL (2382 ± 717 N) than for NHL (2710 ± 830 N) but not for 12 HL (2538 ± 823 N, ES = 0. 21). The 18 HL reduced ankle dorsiflexion but not flexion-extension ankle moments and increased the AT moment arm compared with NHL. Thus, 18 HL reduced force and strain on the AT during running via a reduction in dorsiflexion, which lengthened the AT moment arm. Therefore, <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> {{could be used to}} reduce AT loading and strain during the rehabilitation of AT injuries...|$|R

40|$|Conventional <b>heel</b> <b>lift</b> with a {{flat surface}} {{increases}} the risk of foot problems related to higher plantar pressure and decreased stability. In this study, an optimized design of in-shoe heel lifts developed to maintain the midfoot function was tested to investigate if the plantar pressure distribution was improved. The design was based on three dimensional foot plantar contour which was captured by an Infoot 3 D scanning system while the heel was elevated by a heel wedge. To facilitate midfoot function, an arch support was designed to support the lateral longitudinal arch, while allowing functional movement of the medial longitudinal arch. Twenty healthy male subjects were asked to walk along an 8 m walkway while wearing high-cut footwear with and without the optimized <b>heel</b> <b>lift.</b> Peak pressure, contact area and force-time integral were measured using the Pedar insole system. Range and velocity of medial-lateral center of pressure during forefoot contact phase and foot flat phase were collected using a Footscan pressure plate. Compared to the shoe only condition, peak pressure under the rearfoot decreased with the optimized <b>heel</b> <b>lift,</b> while no increase of peak pressure was observed under the forefoot and midfoot regions, indicating improved plantar pressure distribution. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} this optimized <b>heel</b> <b>lift</b> has better biomechanical performance than a conventional flat <b>heel</b> <b>lift.</b> Results from this study may have implications for insole and shoe last design, especially for people who need additional heel height without sacrificing midfoot function. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{symmetry}} index (SI), as one {{of methods}} to evaluate gait pattern in patients with leg-length discrepancy (LLD), helps to estimate the acceptable range of inequality and to determine symmetry in the kinematic and kinetic data before and after a <b>heel</b> <b>lift,</b> although this parameter has a large standard deviation that undermines its accuracy. Thirty patients with LLD were studied by a motion-analysis system and a force plate. Joint motion of the lower extremity in the sagittal plane, back movement in the coronal plane, and three-dimensional ground-reaction forces (GRFs) were registered. From a linear-regression analysis, a mean value of inequality of 2. 33 cm (range, 2. 12 - 2. 54) was found to correspond to an acceptable gait symmetry. After a <b>heel</b> <b>lift,</b> the SI of the pelvic tilt at midstance and of the vertical GRF at initial contact increases significantly, but the SI of the medial GRF at terminal stance decreases. Patients with an inequality of a mean value of 0. 51 cm determined by palpating bilaterally {{the top of the}} iliac crest (the TIC 1 subgroup) showed a lesser value of the SI of the center of pressure in the forward direction during stance compared with the group with a mean value of inequality of 1. 39 cm (the TIC 2 subgroup).

40|$|Background: Measurement {{accuracy}} {{is critical for}} biomechanical gait assessment. Very few studies have determined the accuracy of common clinical rearfoot variables between cameras with different collection frequencies. Research question: What is the measurement error for common rearfoot gait parameters when using a standard 30 Hz digital camera compared to 100 Hz camera? Type of study: Descriptive. Methods: 100 footfalls were recorded from 10 subjects (10 footfalls per subject) running on a treadmill at 2. 68 m/s. A high-speed digital timer, accurate within 1 ms served as an external reference. Markers were placed along the vertical axis of the heel counter and the long axis of the shank. 2 D coordinates for the four markers were determined from heel strike to <b>heel</b> <b>lift.</b> Variables of interest included time of heel strike (THS), time of <b>heel</b> <b>lift</b> (THL), time to maximum eversion (TMax), and maximum rearfoot eversion angle (EvMax).

40|$|Background: Prosthetic {{alignment}} {{is usually}} unchanged once optimized.

This study investigated the effects of alignment changes (by inserting a <b>heel</b> <b>lift)</b> on gait of a transtibial amputee before and after treadmill walking. Case Description and Methods: The subject walked, without heel lifts, on a treadmill until perception of fatigue. Gait changes upon heel lifting at the prosthetic side were studied {{before and after the}} treadmill walking Findings and Outcomes: For this subject before the treadmill walking, heel lifting induced drop-off with increased prosthetic-side knee flexion at mid-stance and pre-swing. The sound limb outreached to stabilize the gait. After the treadmill walking, the same <b>heel</b> <b>lift</b> did not induce drop-off. It reduced the plantar flexor power generation, potentially delaying its fatigue. Conclusion: After walking prosthetic-side heel lifting could be beneficial. Clinical relevance Many lower-limb amputees have difficulties in long-distance walking due to muscle fatigue. This case study proposes that appropriate alignment changes after some walking potentially relieve fatigue and encourage them to walk longer distances.

40|$|Tendons are {{inherently}} elastic materials: they strain {{in response to}} the stress that is applied to them. When muscles contract and produce force, this force is transferred to the skeleton via the tendon and hence causes the tendon to stretch and store elastic strain energy which can be used later for propulsion. The Achilles tendon is the best example of this, because its tendon is very long compared to the muscle fibres it attaches to. We have used B-mode ultrasound imaging in combination with motion analysis to examine the strain on the Achilles tendon during walking, running and hopping. We have found that the Achilles tendon is capable of strains much higher than that which was previously thought possible; approximately 5 % during walking, 6 - 7 % during running and up to 10 % during hopping. It is likely that repetitive tasks that require such large strains will cause both heating and micro-damage, which makes the Achilles tendon susceptible to overuse injuries. We have also been able to examine the influence of using <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> to reduce Achilles tendon strain. Our results indicate that although the ankle is significantly more plantar flexed during walking and running with two different sized <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> (12 and 18 mm), there is no significant reduction in the Achilles tendon strain. This supports previous findings that indicate there is no reduction in the Achilles tendon force with heel lifts; therefore the benefits of such orthoses for degenerative disorders may be limited. Advances in ultrasound imaging techniques make it possible to better quantify the changes in mechanical properties and structure that occur as a result of therapeutical interventions.

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Much {{of the research}} on running injuries {{is in the form of}} expert opinion and comparison trials. Recent systematic reviews have summarized research in orthotics, stretching before running, and interventions to prevent soft tissue injuries. MAIN MESSAGE: The most common factors implicated in running injuries are errors in training methods, inappropriate training surfaces and running shoes, malalignment of the leg, and muscle weakness and inflexibility. Runners can reduce risk of injury by using established training programs that gradually increase distance or time of running and provide appropriate rest. Orthoses and <b>heel</b> <b>lifts</b> can correct malalignments of the leg. Running shoes appropriate for runners' foot types should be selected.
