25|$|Crème fraîche is {{produced}} by adding a starter culture to heavy cream, and allowing it to stand at appropriate temperature until thick. The culture {{is made up of}} a mix of bacteria including Lactococcus species L. cremoris, L. lactis, and L. lactis biovar diacetylactis. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> it the taste that distinguishes it from similar dairy products like sour cream. Procedures for cooks making crème fraîche at home may substitute cultured buttermilk with active cultures for the starter culture.|$|E
25|$|Switching {{regulators}} rapidly switch {{a series}} device on and off. The duty {{cycle of the}} switch sets how much charge is transferred to the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> the switching design its efficiency. Switching regulators are also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of opposite polarity — something not possible with a linear design.|$|E

25|$|The {{balls are}} then hard ground. They are {{ground in the}} same type of machine as used before, but either an {{abrasive}} is introduced into coolant or the rotating plate is replaced with a very hard fine-grain grinding wheel. This step can get the balls within ±. If the balls need more precision then they are lapped, again in {{the same type of}} machine. However, this time the rill plates are made of a softer material, usually cast iron, less pressure is applied, the plate is rotated slowly. This step <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> bearing balls their shiny appearance and can bring the balls between grades 10 and 48.|$|E
25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion heat engines (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This {{is achieved by}} combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-shaped nozzle <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists such as Ken Ham and Doug Phillips {{believe that}} God created the Earth {{within the last}} ten {{thousand}} years, literally {{as described in the}} Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the Ussher chronology). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. Creationist cosmologies give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer timelines.|$|E

25|$|Brut Rose Champagnes {{came along}} in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular Brut Champagne. They are {{produced}} either by leaving the clear juice of black grapes to macerate on its skins {{for a brief time}} (known as the saignée method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still Pinot Noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuvée. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> red wine its colour. Rosé Champagne {{is one of the few}} wines that allow the production of Rosé by the addition of a small amount of red wine during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant Rosé colour from year-to-year. Popular in many countries and especially well-welcomed in Estonia where it was first introduced by an Estonian entrepreneur Henry-Jörgen Rautits, pink Champagne is very popular amongst high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is highly appreciated by wealthier customers.|$|E

Gambotto-Burke considered her not purely evil, and felt even {{at the end of}} the game [...] "you can't help but see her as a flawed visionary". GameSpot considered it the point to be for the player to move on from her [...] "self-defeating" [...] nihilism and realize [...] "the act of choice <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> form and pattern to the universe".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{insists that}} Angelou's {{treatment}} of racism <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores {{one of their}} central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it.

Walker calls Momma's way a [...] "strategy of subtle resistance" [...] and McPherson calls it [...] "the dignified course of silent endurance".|$|E

500|$|Wind {{flows from}} areas of high {{pressure}} to areas of low pressure. [...] This {{is due to}} density {{differences between the two}} air masses. [...] Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts. [...] The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The coriolis force caused by the Earth's rotation <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure). [...] Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction. This is known as a geostrophic wind.|$|E
500|$|The Coriolis force {{caused by}} the Earth's {{rotation}} <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> winds around low-pressure areas (such as in hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons) their counter-clockwise (anticlockwise) circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves inward and is deflected right {{from the center of}} high pressure) and clockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves inward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure). [...] A cyclone differs from a hurricane or typhoon only on the basis of location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean. Friction with land slows down the wind flowing into low-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more inward, or flowing more ageostrophically, toward their centers. [...] A low-pressure area is commonly associated with inclement weather, while a high-pressure area is associated with light winds and fair skies. [...] Tornados are often too small, and of too short duration, to be influenced by the Coriolis force, but may be so-influenced when arising from a low-pressure system.|$|E
500|$|The {{final version}} of the episode {{differed}} from the original concept. It was initially intended for Dean to be a [...] "huge loser" [...] in his new life; being a hunter <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> him structure and purpose. Without hunting, he would be a jobless barfly. Kripke compared the new reality to a Charles Bukowski novel, but noted that the selfless Dean still preferred the new universe, with Sam happy and living a good life. However, executive producer Robert Singer and others convinced him to change this, because they did not think Dean would be happy suddenly waking up in such a reality. Another variation stemmed from Dean's lack of someone to confide innormally Sam is his confidant. Because the writers found it difficult to communicate Dean's feelings, early drafts of the script included a number of internal monologues. These were ultimately replaced by a scene in which he discusses the djinn with a professor. The studio wanted the scene of Dean and his girlfriend Carmen kissing on the sofa to include sex. However, Kripke could not work it into the script, because he found it unrealistic that she would deliberately be late for her job as a hospital nurse.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the islands}} of Vanuatu in the South Pacific, people believe that illness usually is caused by sexual {{misconduct}} or anger. [...] "If you are angry {{for two or three}} days, sickness will come," [...] said one local man. The therapy that counters this sickness is confession. The patient, or a family member, may confess. If no one confesses an error, the patient may die. The Vanuatu people believe that secrecy <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>gives</b> power to the illness.
