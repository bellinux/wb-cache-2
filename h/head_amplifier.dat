50|$|A Tower Mounted Amplifier or Mast <b>Head</b> <b>Amplifier</b> is a low-noise {{amplifier}} (LNA) mounted {{as close as}} practical to the antenna in mobile masts or base transceiver stations. A TMA reduces the base transceiver station noise figure (NF) and therefore improves its overall sensitivity; in other words the mobile mast is able to receive weaker signals.|$|E
50|$|The series {{included}} <b>head</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{with matching}} cabinets, {{as well as}} combos, and was produced until the 1990s. It quickly became a very successful amplifier, and ubiquitous amongst hard rock and heavy metal bands.|$|R
50|$|Early cameras used {{thermionic}} valves (vacuum tubes) in {{the first}} stages of the <b>head</b> <b>amplifiers</b> but later FET amplifiers were introduced, such cameras being designated type 2001/1. All other circuitry in the cameras, apart from the pick-up tubes, was solid state.|$|R

50|$|In 1982 the Twin Reverb II was {{introduced}} to compete with Mesa Boogie's very successful products; it had an output rating of 105 watts {{and a return to}} Blackface era cosmetics albeit with a different, channel-switching cascading gain circuit with a more modern mid-range voicing and without the 'traditional' vibrato. The Twin Reverb II was produced until 1986, and was available as a <b>head</b> (<b>amplifier</b> alone) or 2×12 combo. The circuits for this series of 1982 Fender amplifiers were designed by amp guru Paul Rivera; the 60w Concert amplifier was by far the most successful in terms of sales, but all models in this range and the next are now becoming highly sought-after by collectors and players.|$|E
40|$|A low-noise <b>head</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for the extra low energy antiproton ring beam trajectory, orbit, and intensity measurement system at CERN. This system is based on 24 double-electrode electrostatic beam position monitors installed around the ring. A <b>head</b> <b>amplifier</b> is placed close to each beam position monitor to amplify the electrode signals and generate a difference and a sum signal. These signals are sent to the digital acquisition system, about 50 m away from the ring, where they are digitized and further processed. The beam position can be measured by dividing the difference signal by the sum signal while the sum signal gives information relative to the beam intensity. The <b>head</b> <b>amplifier</b> consists of two discrete charge preamplifiers with {{junction field effect transistor}} (JFET) inputs, a sum and a difference stage, and two cable drivers. Special {{attention has been paid to}} the amplifier printed circuit board design to minimize the parasitic capacitances and inductances at the charge amplifier stages to meet the gain and noise requirements. The measurements carried out on the <b>head</b> <b>amplifier</b> showed a gain of 40. 5 and 46. 5 dB for the sum and difference outputs with a bandwidth from 200 Hz to 75 MHz and an input voltage noise density lower than 400 pV Hz. Twenty head amplifiers have been already installed in the ring and they have been used to detect the first beam signals during the first commissioning stage in November 2016...|$|E
40|$|The CERN Extra Low ENergy Antiproton (ELENA) Ring {{is a new}} {{synchrotron}} {{designed for}} cooling and further decelerating the 5. 3 MeV antiprotons delivered by the CERN Antiproton Decelerator (AD). The ring is equipped with two magnetic pick-ups used for longitudinal beam diagnostics. These ultra low noise AC beam transformers consist of a doubly shielded, ferrite-loaded cavity with a ceramic gap in the beam pipe, a secondary winding to which an ultralow noise JFET <b>head</b> <b>amplifier</b> with feedback is connected. The JFET <b>head</b> <b>amplifier</b> is mounted close to the cavity and the AC beam transformers are covering respectively the 0. 003 - 3 MHz frequency range (low frequency type) and 0. 8 - 30 MHz frequency range (high frequency type) [1]. The ferrite material used to couple primary and secondary in the beam transformer, has a key impact in the noise characteristics of the amplifier. For this reason a magnetic characterization of the selected ferrite rings {{has been carried out}} and is reported in the following...|$|E

50|$|The EMI 2001 Broadcast studio {{camera was}} an early, very {{successful}} British made Plumbicon studio camera {{that included the}} lens within {{the body of the}} camera. Four 30 mm tubes allowed one tube to be dedicated solely to producing a relatively high resolution monochrome signal, with the other three tubes each providing red, green or blue signals. Even though semiconductors were used in most of the camera, the highly sensitive <b>head</b> <b>amplifiers</b> still used thermionic valves in the first generation of the design.|$|R
40|$|The {{most popular}} radio access scheme {{used for the}} third {{generation}} (3 G) system is Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), which provides high data rate services (video conferencing, high bit rate up to 2 Mbps) compared with first (1 G) and second (2 G) generations. To obtain good services, increased number of users and reliable coverage area with minimum implementation cost, the planners must utilize all possible resources to improve capacity and coverage area for the cellular network. The area of study will be a cellular network in urban area with 13 * 13 km containing 19 sites. Network Planning Strategies for WCDMA (NPSW) is a static simulation program used to plan the radio network for WCDMA system programmed with MATLAB. Studying {{the impact of the}} mast <b>head</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and repeaters on the coverage area are investigated. Also, various parameters and their impact on system coverage, like sectorisation (1, 3, 4 and 6 sectors), antenna beamwidth (33 o, 65 o, 90 o, 120 o, and an Omni directional antenna).

40|$|The closed-orbit {{measurement}} {{system for the}} new Antiproton Decelerator (AD) employs 59 electrostatic pick-ups (PU). The intensity range from 2 &# 183; 10 10 down to 10 7 particles poses challenging demands on the dynamic range and noise of the <b>head</b> <b>amplifier.</b> A low noiseamplifier has been developed, having an equivalent input noise of 0. 6 nV/&# 8730;(Hz), allowing beam positions to be measured to &# 177; 0. 5 mm with 5 &# 183; 10 6 particles. Two different gains {{take care of the}} large dynamic range. After amplification and multiplexing, the PU signals are fed to a network analyser, where each measurement point corresponds to one PU. The network analyser is phase locked to the RF of the AD, thus acting as a &# 0147;tracking filter&# 0148; instrument. An orbit measurement takes from 0. 2 to 12 s depending on the IF-bandwidth of the network analyser, selected according to the beam intensity, and the precision required. At the end of the network analyser sweep the data are read via a GPIB interface and treated by a real-time task running in a VME based Power PC...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{introduces}} the radio network planning process and optimisation for WCDMA (FDD mode), {{as defined by}} 3 GPP. This thesis consists of three parts: modelling and tools for radio network planning, process for pre-operational network control and optimisation for the operational network. General challenges to face in 3 G network control {{are based on the}} fact that many issues are interconnected and should be simultaneously considered, such as Planning means not only to meet current status and demands, but the solution should also comply with the future requirements by providing an acceptable development path. Traffic modelling is not only the question about the total amount of traffic growth, but also the question about the future service distribution and performance demands. All CDMA systems have a relation between capacity and coverage. Consequently, the network planning itself is not only based on propagation estimation but also on the interference situation in the network. Ideally, site selection consideration will be done based on the network analysis with planned load and traffic/service portfolio, taking possible co-siting constraints into account. Provision of multiple services and seamless management of at least two multiple access systems require rapid evolution of the management tools and processes. The network performance in terms of capacity, quality, and implementation and operational costs forms a multidimensional space. Operators' task will be to convert the business strategy to an operating point in the performance space in a cost efficient manner. The contribution of this thesis in terms of modelling and tools is as follows: Improvement of the accuracy of radio link budget by introducing power control headroom (also called fast fading margin). Improvement of loading equation by introducing a transmit power increase term. Development of theory and modelling for a planning tool capable of multi-service and multi-carrier interference, capacity and coverage analysis. Development and implementation an interface taking into account the true traffic distribution (not uniform) and terminal speed. In the area of pre-operational planning process the contribution of this thesis is as follows: Development of dimensioning methodology for multi-service network site density estimation, utilising the modelling of power control headroom, transmit power increase, soft handover and Eb/N 0. Development of radio network planning process for multi-service environment including capacity and coverage evaluation for a given traffic mixture, quality and area requirements. Analysis of means to improve radio network performance with Mast <b>Head</b> <b>Amplifier</b> (MHA), diversity reception, sectorisation and proper antenna selection. In the area of optimisation of the operational network the contribution of this thesis is as follows: Definition for optimisation target in the case of 3 G. The optimisation will be capacity-quality trade-off management instead of plain quality improvement process. Introduction of Self Organizing Map (SOM) in the analysis of cellular networks. Analysis of the applicability of SOM in WCDMA cellular network optimisation. Introduction of SOM based applications to support network capacity-quality trade-off management. It is worth noting that process and methods described in this work are not limited to 3 G systems with WCDMA radio access technology, but they are applicable to other CDMA standards as well. reviewe...|$|E

ACT and HOP works by using an extra electrode in the tube to 'flood discharge' the target during the flyback period. Great care was needed in setting up the HOP voltages as damage to the tube’s emission could occur. Once fitted, the ACT circuits were adjusted so that the Comet Tail doesn't appear as a [...] "blob". Even when ACT circuits had been retro-fitted, comet tails would sometimes occur, consisting of either a mix of two separate colours, one colour inside the other (e.g. a comet tail that is red with a smaller comet tail inside that one that may be green), or the comet tail may be a non primary colour, such as pink. The problems occurred when the settings of the ACT circuits were not well matched.|$|R
