50|$|Established in 1919 by Francis H. and Richard B. Weeks, {{the company}} started with two cranes in the Port of New York, {{handling}} bunker coal and <b>dry</b> <b>ballast.</b> By {{the beginning of}} World War II, they had purchased their seventh crane and were loading military equipment bound for Europe to support the Allied Forces. The workload of the war overseas had taken its toll on the Weeks fleet, so after WWII, the wooden hulls of the cranes were replaced with steel hulls, creating the Weeks #6 and #7.|$|E
40|$|During this survey, we {{collected}} and identified 95 {{species that are}} possibly non-indigenous marine species (NIS) in Humboldt Bay. There were representatives from most major groups of organisms, ranging from vascular plants to fish. The largest number of non-indigenous species is found in various invertebrate groups, including polychaetes (24 species), amphipods (20 species), and bryozoa (8 species). Previous studies in Humboldt Bay (Barnhart et al. 1992) were not focused on identification and enumeration of introduced species, {{but many of the}} non-indigenous species found in this study have been reported in that earlier work. A number of introduced species have been in Humboldt Bay for a long time, in some cases going back to the first settlement of the region by Europeans in the mid 1800 ’s. Almost immediately following initial settlement, maritime trade began, with shipping of lumber and lumber products to all parts of the world. It appears that sometime in the 1860 ’s, the most abundant plant of Humboldt Bay salt marshes, Spartina densiflora, was brought into the bay from South America, probably as shingle or <b>dry</b> <b>ballast</b> (Barnhart et al. 1992) ...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{species have}} been {{introduced}} continuously into South Africa for more than 400 years, since {{the arrival of the}} first European explorers. Various waves of introduction can be identified over this period, each associated with a different mix of vectors. Early wooden vessels carried specialized wood-boring species, a rich external fouling community, plus semi-terrestrial species associated with <b>dry</b> <b>ballast.</b> Modern steel vessels continue to import fouling species, despite the use of anti-fouling paints, and may ply new routes, bringing additional introductions from novel locations. More modern waves of introduction are associated with use of ballast water and with marine aquaculture. Research on marine bio-invasions in South Africa has a short history, marked by a rapid rate of discovery of introductions. Some 86 marine species are currently regarded as introduced to the region, with a further 39 considered cryptogenic, but this number is increasing rapidly. Moreover, many taxa and regions still remain inadequately explored, indicating that the current list remains far from complete. The reasons for under-reporting of introduced populations are discussed and include lack of sample coverage, misidentification of aliens as native species and erroneous redescriptions of aliens as new, indigenous species. However, the lack of taxonomic expertise across large sections of the biota remains the greatest impediment to progress...|$|E
50|$|On her ninth patrol, from 29 May to 11 June, {{she carried}} ammunition, oil, and dry stores to Colonel R.V. Bowler on Mindanao. Between 12 June and 27 June, she transported a similar cargo to Negros Island and {{embarked}} evacuees, including one German POW, for Darwin. During her 11th patrol, from 30 June to 27 July, she landed a reconnaissance party and 12 tons of stores on North Pandan Island, and more supplies to Colonel Kangleon on Leyte and Colonel Abcede on Mindanao. On her 12th, 13th and 14th patrols, {{she returned to}} the central Philippines, landed personnel and supplies at various points on Mindanao and Luzon, and carried evacuees to Australia. On 25 September, during the first of these three patrols, she grounded on Iuisan Shoal. Forced to lighten her load, her evacuees, mail, captured documents, and cargo were sent ashore. All secret materials were burned. Her reserve fuel tanks were blown <b>dry,</b> variable <b>ballast</b> was blown overboard and six-inch (152 mm) ammunition jettisoned. With the blowing of her main ballast tanks she was finally able to get off the reef within three and a half hours, despite the receding tide, and clear the area by dawn.|$|R
40|$|Ballast {{consisting}} of large sized aggregate particles with uniform size distribution {{is an essential}} component of the track substructure, to facilitate load distribution and drainage. As freight tonnage accumulates with traffic, ballast will accumulate an increasing percentage of fines due to either aggregate breakdown or outside contamination such as subgrade soil intrusion and coal dust collection. According to the classical text by Selig and Waters [1], ballast degradation from traffic involves up to 76 % of all fouling cases; voids will be occupied by fines from the bottom of ballast layer gradually causing ballast clogging and losing its drainage ability. When moisture is trapped within ballast, especially fouled ballast, ballast layer stability is compromised. In the recent studies at the University of Illinois, the focus has been to evaluate behavior of fouled ballast due to aggregate degradation using large scale triaxial testing. To investigate the effects of moisture on degraded ballast, fouled ballast was generated in the laboratory through controlled Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests intended to mimic aggregate abrasion and breakdown and generate fouled ballast at compositions similar to those observed in the field due to repeated train loadings. Triaxial shear strength tests were performed on the fouled ballast at different moisture contents. Important findings of this preliminary study on characterizing wet fouled ballast are presented in this paper. Moisture was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the fouled ballast strength behavior. Adding a small amount of 3 % moisture (by weight of particles smaller than 3 / 8 in. size or smaller than 9. 5 mm) caused test specimens to indicate approximately 50 % decrease in shear strength of the <b>dry</b> fouled <b>ballast.</b> Wet fouled ballast samples peaked at significantly lower maximum deviator stress values at relatively smaller axial strains and remained at these low levels as the axial strain was increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{coastline}} inhabiting rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) of Atlantic Canada are surveyed. Thirty-three {{species have}} now been recorded in Atlantic Canada including 26 in New Brunswick, 15 in Newfoundland, 31 in Nova Scotia, and 13 on Prince Edward Island. Oligota parva Kraatz, Acrotona avia (Casey), Strigota ambigua (Erichson), and Myrmecopora vaga (LeConte), are all newly recorded in Canada, and Bledius mandibularis Erichson is newly recorded in Atlantic Canada. We retain A. avia as a species distinct from A. subpygmaea Bernhauer and designate a lectotype and paralectotypes for A. avia. Ten new provincial records are reported, one from New Brunswick, six from Nova Scotia, and three from Prince Edward Island. Four functional groups, halobiont (obligate), halophile (facultative), haloxene (tolerant), and incidental coastal species, are distinguished and the fauna is examined {{from the perspective of}} the particular coastline habitats and microhabitats they have been found to inhabit. Fourteen of the 33 staphylinids are introduced, Palearctic species, and eight of these have been associated with historic <b>dry</b> <b>ballast</b> shipping to the region from Great Britain. A trophic analysis indicates that some species are phytophagous algae feeders, while others are either generalist predators, or predators specializing on particular taxonomic or functional groups of invertebrates. Finally, some attention is devoted to discussing the diminished areas of coastline environments such as coastal marshes, and the various kinds of environmental disturbances and degradations they have experienced. These indicate the potential vulnerability of such coastal habitats and consequently of the communities of beetles that inhabit them...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to have consistent ballast testing methods that provide results reflecting the performance of different ballast materials in the railway trackbed. In this research, extensive laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the correlation between simple ballast index tests, and box tests simulating ballast field loading conditions in a simplified and controlled manner. In the box test, a sleeper load of 40 kN was applied to a simulated sleeper {{on the top of a}} sample of ballast in a box of dimensions 700 x 300 x 450 mm. The ballast was tamped using a Kango hammer which caused particles to rearrange as the level of the sleeper was raised. The ballast tests investigated in this project are those ballast tests specified in the Railtrack Line Specification (RT/CE/S/ 006 Issue 3, 2000), in addition to single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, petrographic analysis, and box tests. It was found that there was some correlation between the single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, box tests and petrographic analysis. One of the current ballast tests, namely the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) test, which is analogous to the oedometer test, is not appropriate because the ACV test uses 10 - 14 mm ballast particles, and there is a size effect on the strength of ballast and different ballasts have different size effects. However, if an oedometer test is used on track ballast, the results correlate better with ballast field performance as simulated in the box tests. Six ballasts were tested: A, B, C, D, E and F (mineralogy of these ballasts can be found in the appendix). The aim was to examine the relative performance of these ballasts and to establish which index tests were most indicative of performance in the box test. Simple index tests were performed on each of the ballasts, whilst box tests were only performed on ballasts A, B, C and D. The box tests were generally performed wet by adding a known volume of water at each tamp. For ballast A, controlled tests were also performed on <b>dry</b> <b>ballast,</b> and tests involving traffic loading only and tamping only were also conducted. A box test on 10 - 14 mm ballast A was also conducted to investigate the size effect on ballast behaviour in the box. The Wet Attrition Value (WAV), Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA), and Micro-Deval Attrition (MDA) seem to be suitable parameters to indicate ballast performance in the box test. However, this is considered to be due to the rearrangement of particles in the box test caused by the simulated tamping. In addition to the laboratory tests, the application of discrete element program PFC 3 D (Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., 1999) in simulating ballast behaviour was also investigated. Single particle crushing test was simulated to produce crushable agglomerates with a distribution of strengths of ballast A. These agglomerates were then used to simulate the oedometer test. The resulting normal compression line was compared with that for real oedometer tests: discrepancies can be attributed to the simplified geometry of the agglomerates. Due to the high computational time in simulating a box test with crushable agglomerates, uncrushable spherical balls and uncrushable angular agglomerates were used to represent individual ballast particles in the box. Important aspects of ballast behaviour under repeated loading, namely resilient and permanent deformation, were studied. It was found that the box test on uncrushable angular agglomerates give less permanent deformation compared with the test on spherical balls, because of the additional resistance provided by the irregular shape of the agglomerates.

40|$|Human-mediated marine bioinvasions {{have altered}} the way we view the marine {{environment}} – virtually all regions of the global oceans have experienced the introduction of marine species (e. g., Carlton 1979; Coles et al. 1999; Cranfield et al. 1998; Cohen and Carlton 1998; Hewitt et al. 1999, 2004; Orensanz et al. 2002; Leppäkoski et al. 2002; Lewis et al. 2003; Castilla et al. 2005; Wolff 2005; Gollasch and Nehring 2006; Minchin 2006), placing marine and coastal resources under increased threat. Humans have almost certainly transported marine species since early attempts to voyage by sea. These ancient transport vectors were slow, {{and for the most}} part restricted to small spatial scales. The beginning of significant exploration and subsequent expansion by Europeans (post 1500 AD) has resulted in the transport of many thousands of species across all world oceans (Crosby 1986; diCastri 1989; Carlton 2001). The transport of species by human vectors was recognized by early workers (Ostenfeld 1908; Elton 1958), but it is only in the last few decades that significant progress on identifying patterns and processes has been made (e. g., Carlton 1985, 1996, 2001; Ruiz et al. 2000; Hewitt et al. 2004; Castilla et al. 2005; Minchin 2006). Numerous transport vectors have been identified and described (Carlton 2001; Chap. 5, Minchin et al.); however the majority of species appear to have been associated with vessel movements, either as exploratory, military, commercial or recreational vessels (e. g., Carlton 1985, 2001; Cohen and Carlton 1998; Hewitt et al. 1999; Gollasch et al. 2002, Minchin and Gollasch 2003). The ship as a transport vector is comprised of several sub-vectors. These include (1) the hull and other ‘niche’ areas, such as the propeller, rudder, on exposed surfaces of water piping, seachests, and thruster tunnels, where accumulations of growths of organisms develop (typically known as hull fouling), (2) the boring of organisms into the structure of the vessel (primarily limited to wooden hulled vessels), and (3) the uptake of organisms in association with wet or <b>dry</b> <b>ballast</b> (Carlton 1985, 1996; Ruiz et al. 2000). Several of these ship sub-vectors are no longer active. Hull boring for example, virtually ceased to exist with the use of steel G. Rilov, J. A. Crooks (eds.) Biological Invasions in Marine Ecosystems. 117 Ecological Studies 204, © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009 118 C. L. Hewitt et al. as the primary ship-building material in merchant and naval vessels. However, many pleasure boats and fishing craft are still constructed of wood (Nagabhushanam and Sarojini 1997). Similarly, dry-ballast made up of sand, gravel and rock taken from littoral environments was replaced with water as ballast beginning in the late 1800 s and had become phased out by 1950. None of these sub-vectors is species-specific, and each is likely to transport entire assemblages of species. Each may also facilitate the transport of a differing suite of species with different physiological and ecological characteristics (see Table 6. 1). Biofouling primarily transports species that have attached sedentary or sessile, benthic habits, or species associated with these communities (e. g., living in, between or on other organisms) (Minchin and Gollasch 2003). In contrast, ballast water transports species associated with the plankton either as holo-plankton (species that have their whole life-cycle in the water column), mero-plankton (species with a portion of their life-cycle in the water column), or tycho-plankton (species accidentally swept into the water column), and often include pelagic species. It is difficult to establish a firm link between an already established introduced species and the vector (or sub-vector) by which it arrived in the new location (Minchin 2007). Nevertheless, attempts at assigning linkages to sub-vectors based on life history modes, timing of invasions, and association between location of incursion and subvectors have been deduced by reasoned argument (e. g., Hewitt et al. 1999, 2004, in press; Fofonoff et al. 2003; Ruiz et al. 2000) ...|$|E
