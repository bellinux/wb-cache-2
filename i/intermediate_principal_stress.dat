40|$|By {{incorporating}} the fabric effect and Lode’s angle dependence into the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion, a strength criterion for cross-anisotropic sand under general stress conditions was proposed. The obtained criterion has only three material parameters {{which can be}} specified by conventional triaxial tests. The formula to calculate the friction angle under any loading direction and <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> ratio condition was deduced, {{and the influence of}} the degree of the cross-anisotropy was quantified. The friction angles of sand in triaxial, true triaxial, and hollow cylinder torsional shear tests were obtained, and a parametric analysis was used to detect the varying characteristics. The friction angle becomes smaller when the major principal stress changes from perpendicular to parallel to the bedding plane. The loading direction and <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> ratio are unrelated in true triaxial tests, and their influences on the friction angle can be well captured by the proposed criterion. In hollow cylinder torsional shear tests with the same internal and external pressures, the loading direction and <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> ratio are related. This property results in a lower friction angle in the hollow cylinder torsional shear test than that in the true triaxial test under the same <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> ratio condition.

The samples were prepared based on an established procedure developed to produce weakly consolidated sandstone samples with identical physico-mechanical properties. The properties of the synthetic sandstone samples were determined by conducting a series of standard rock mechanics tests on cylindrical plugs. Using a true-triaxial stress cell (TTSC), cubic samples were subjected to true-triaxial stresses and radial fluid flow from the outer boundaries into the borehole. The maximum and <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stresses</b> were applied laterally in both cases while the effect of changing the lateral stresses {{on the development of the}} failure zone around borehole was monitored.

The experiments were also simulated numerically using ABAQUS in order to validate and interpret the results from the experiments. A good agreement was obtained between the results of both methods, which confirms the importance of lateral stress anisotropy on the evolution of sanding.

40|$|Abstract:The yield {{criteria}} of geomaterials {{play a crucial}} role in studying and designing the strength of materials and structures. The basic characteristics of yield criteria for geomaterials need to be studied under the framework of continuum mechanics. These characteristics include the effects of strength difference (SD) of materials in tension and compression, normal stress, <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress,</b> intermediate principal shear stress, hydrostatic stress, twin-shear stresses, and the convexity of yield surface. Most of the proposed yield criteria possess only one or some of these basic characteristics. For example, the Tresca yield criterion considers only single-shear stress effect, and ignores the effect of SD, normal stress, <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress,</b> intermediate principal shear stress, hydrostatic stress, and twin-shear stresses. The Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion accounts for the effect of SD, normal stress, single-shear stress and hydrostatic stress, but disregards the effect of <b>intermediate</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress,</b> intermediate principal shear stress, and twin-shear stresses. The basic characteristics remain to be fully addressed in the development of yield criterion. In this paper, we propose a new yield criterion with three features, that is, newly developed, better than existing criteria and ready for application. It is shown that the proposed criterion performs better than the existing ones and is ready for application. The development of mechanical models for various yield criteria and the applications of the unified strength theory to engineering are also summarized. According to a new tetragonal mechanical model, a tension-cut condition is added to the unified strength theory. The unified strength theory is extended to the tension-tension region...|$|E

In particular, <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> rotations in unloading cause relatively greater contraction. The mechanisms of <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> rotation effects on sand behavior are illustrated and interpreted. Rotations of <b>principal</b> <b>stresses</b> can mobilize more sand particles in various orientations facilitating particle rearrangement. Therefore, <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> rotations cause greater contraction if sand tends to contract under shear but greater dilation if sand tends to dilate under shear. Loading and unloading with significant <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> rotations are common stress states for underground soils during non-proportional foundation loading, excavation, and tunneling. The effects of <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> rotations on the volumetric behavior of sands are important phenomena when analyzing settlements in the field involving these geotechnical problems...|$|R
