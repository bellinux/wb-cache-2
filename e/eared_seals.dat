Their {{evolutionary}} link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of †Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, †Puijila {{had a long}} tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. The lineages of Otariidae (<b>eared</b> <b>seals)</b> and Odobenidae (walrus) split almost 28 mya.

5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and <b>eared</b> <b>seals</b> (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
25|$|The Steller {{sea lion}} (Eumetopias jubatus) {{also known as}} the {{northern}} sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a near threatened species of sea lions in the northern Pacific. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the <b>eared</b> <b>seals</b> (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals. The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741. The Steller sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska.|$|E

500|$|The California {{sea lion}} was {{described}} by René Primevère Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family Otariidae. Otariids, also known as <b>eared</b> <b>seals,</b> differ from true seals in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus Zalophus, which derives from the Greek words za, meaning [...] "intensive," [...] and lophus, meaning [...] "crest." [...] This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.|$|E
500|$|Otariids {{are also}} known as <b>eared</b> <b>seals</b> due to the {{presence}} of pinnae. These animals rely on their well-developed fore-flippers to propel themselves through the water. They can also turn their hind-flippers forward and [...] "walk" [...] on land. The anterior end of an otariid's frontal bones extends between the nasal bones, and the supraorbital foramen is large and flat horizontally. The supraspinatous fossas are divided by a [...] "secondary spine" [...] and the bronchi are divided anteriorly. Otariids consist of two types: sea lions and fur seals. Sea lions are distinguished by their rounder snouts and shorter, rougher pelage, while fur seals have more pointed snouts, longer fore-flippers and thicker fur coats that include an undercoat and guard hairs. The former also tend to be larger than the latter. Five genera and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist, while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), a 2001 genetic study found that the northern fur seal is more closely related to several sea lion species. This is supported by a 2006 molecular study that also found that the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion are more closely related to Arctocephalus than to other sea lions.|$|E
2500|$|Among others, {{seals and}} whales {{belong to the}} aquatic mammals.

The sleeping half of the brain does not awaken when they surface to breathe. When one half of a seal's brain shows slow-wave sleep, the flippers and whiskers on its opposite side are immobile. While in the water, these seals have almost no REM sleep and may go {{a week or two}} without it. As soon as they move onto land they switch to bilateral REM sleep and NREM sleep comparable to land mammals, surprising researchers with their lack of [...] "recovery sleep" [...] after missing so much REM.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal <b>eared</b> <b>seal</b> native to western North America. It {{is one of}} six species of sea lion. Its natural habitat ranges from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed {{on a number of}} species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and white sharks.|$|R

50|$|An <b>eared</b> <b>seal</b> or otariid or otary is {{any member}} of the marine mammal family Otariidae, one of three groupings of pinnipeds. They {{comprise}} 15 extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as sea lions or fur seals, distinct from true seals (phocids) and the walrus (odobenids). Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans and the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic.|$|R

Both males and females are orange or brown coloured with upturned snouts. Pups are born greyish orange ventrally and black dorsally and moult into a more chocolate colour.|$|E
2500|$|There are non-canine {{species with}} vocalizations that are {{sometimes}} described as barking. Because the alarm {{call of the}} muntjac resembles a dog's bark, they are sometimes known as [...] "barking deer". <b>Eared</b> <b>seals</b> are also known to bark. Prairie dogs employ a complex form of communication that involves barks and rhythmic chirps. A wide variety of bird species produce vocalizations that include the canonical features of barking, especially when avoiding predators. Some primate species, notably gorillas, can and do vocalize in short barks.|$|E
2500|$|The term seal is used {{to refer}} to a diverse group of animals. [...] In science, they are grouped {{together}} in the Pinnipeds, which also includes the walrus, not popularly thought of as a seal, and not considered here. [...] The two main families of seals are the Otariidae (the eared seals; includes sea lions, and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals); animals in the family Phocidae are sometimes referred to as hair seals, and are much more adept in the water than the <b>eared</b> <b>seals,</b> though have a more difficult time getting around on land. The fur seal yields a valuable fur; the hair seal has no fur, but oil can be obtained from its fat and leather from its hide.|$|E

40|$|Published by and {{copyright}} by American Geophysical Union. Marine mammals are {{a conspicuous}} faunal {{element of the}} Southern Ocean ecosystem and have evolved specialized life history patterns to live there. Six species of pinnipeds inhabit the Southern Ocean, including five species of true seals (family Phocidae) and one species of <b>eared</b> <b>seal</b> (family Otariidae. It is a critical feeding ground for many cetaceans: 15 species of cetaceans, including 6 species of baleen whales, Mysticeti, and 8 species of toothed whales, Odontoceti, inhabit the Southern Ocean. Climate, substrate and prey availability are key factors controlling breeding distributions. A unique reproductive pattern has evolved in the true seals, Phocidae, {{that enables them to}} inhabit and breed in the extensive ice regions of the Southern Ocean. While exerting strong direct influences on distribution, changes in the physical properties of the environment, most likely have strong indirect effects on both quality and quantity of breeding substrate, the nature of foraging habitat, or on determining the abundance of potential prey. The occurrence and extent of seasonal ice also play a role in determining the distribution and abundance of marine mammals. This chapter provides an overview of the biology of marine mammals found in the Southern Ocean...|$|R
60|$|It {{appears to}} me that, just as among the {{existing}} Carnivora, the walruses and the <b>eared</b> <b>seals</b> are intercalary forms between the fissipede Carnivora and the ordinary seals, so the Zeuglodonts are intercalary between the Carnivora, as a whole, and the Cetacea. Whether the Zeuglodonts are also linear types in their relation to these two groups cannot be ascertained, until we have more definite knowledge than we possess at present, respecting the relations in time of the Carnivora and Cetacea.|$|E
60|$|All the Carnivora {{fight with}} their canine teeth, and all, {{as far as}} I have observed, draw their ears back when feeling savage. This may be {{continually}} seen with dogs when fighting in earnest, and with puppies fighting in play. The movement {{is different from the}} falling down and slight drawing back of the ears, when a dog feels pleased and is caressed by his master. The retraction of the ears may likewise be seen in kittens fighting together in their play, and in full-grown cats when really savage, as before illustrated in fig. 9 (p. 58). Although their ears are thus to a large extent protected, yet they often get much torn in old male cats during their mutual battles. The same movement is very striking in tigers, leopards, &c., whilst growling over their food in menageries. The lynx has remarkably long ears; and their retraction, when one of these animals is approached in its cage, is very conspicuous, and is eminently expressive of its savage disposition. Even one of the <b>Eared</b> <b>Seals,</b> the Otariapusilla, which has very small ears, draws them backwards, when it makes a savage rush at the legs of its keeper.|$|E

Then changing to another place they do the same again.... As soon as a female reaches the shore, the nearest male goes down to meet her, making meanwhile a noise like the clucking of a hen to her chickens. He bows to her and coaxes her until he gets between her and the water so that she cannot escape him. Then his manner changes, and with a harsh growl he drives her to a place in his harem. This continues until the lower row of harems is nearly full. Then the males higher up select the time when their more fortunate neighbours are off their guard to steal their wives.

40|$|Diving animals offer {{a unique}} {{opportunity}} to study the importance of physiological constraint and the limitation it can impose on animal 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour in nature. This paper examines the interaction between physiology and behaviour {{and its impact on the}} diving capability of five <b>eared</b> <b>seal</b> species (Family Otariidae; three sea lions and two fur seals). An important physiological component of diving marine mammals is the aerobic dive limit (ADL). The ADL of these five seal species was estimated from measurements of their total body oxygen stores, coupled with estimates of their metabolic rate while diving. The tendency of each species to exceed its calculated ADL was compared relative to its diving behaviour. Overall, our analyses reveal that seals which forage benthically (i. e. on the sea floor) have a greater tendency to approach or exceed their ADL compared to seals that forage epipelagically (i. e. near the sea surface). Furthermore, the marked differences in foraging behaviour and physiology appear to be coupled with a species demography. For example, benthic foraging species have smaller populations and lower growth rates compared to seal species that forage epipelagically. These patterns are relevant to the conservation and management of diving vertebrates. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Oceans {{are high}} gene flow environments that are {{traditionally}} believed to hamper the build-up of genetic divergence. Despite this, divergence appears to occur occasionally at surprisingly small scales. The Galápagos archipelago provides an ideal {{opportunity to examine}} the evolutionary processes of local divergence in an isolated marine environment. Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) are top predators in this unique setting and have an essentially unlimited dispersal capacity across the entire species range. In theory, this should oppose any genetic differentiation. Results We find significant ecological, morphological and genetic divergence between the western colonies and colonies from the central region of the archipelago that are exposed to different ecological conditions. Stable isotope analyses indicate that western animals use different food sources than those from the central area. This is likely due to niche partitioning with the second Galápagos <b>eared</b> <b>seal</b> species, the Galápagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) that exclusively dwells in the west. Stable isotope patterns correlate with significant differences in foraging-related skull morphology. Analyses of mitochondrial sequences as well as microsatellites reveal signs of initial genetic differentiation. Conclusion Our results suggest a key role of intra- as well as inter-specific niche segregation {{in the evolution of}} genetic structure among populations of a highly mobile species under conditions of free movement. Given the monophyletic arrival of the sea lions on the archipelago, our study challenges the view that geographical barriers are strictly needed for the build-up of genetic divergence. The study further raises the interesting prospect that in social, colonially breeding mammals additional forces, such as social structure or feeding traditions, might bear on the genetic partitioning of populations. </p...|$|R
