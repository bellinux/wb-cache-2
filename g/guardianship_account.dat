500|$|In 2000, the Schindlers again {{challenged}} Michael Schiavo's guardianship. The Schindlers {{suggested that}} he was wasting the assets within the <b>guardianship</b> <b>account</b> by transferring Terri Schiavo to a Pinellas Park, Florida hospice [...] "after {{it was clear that}} she was not 'terminal' within Medicare guidelines" [...] for hospices. By this time, while still legally married to Terri Schiavo, Michael Schiavo was in a relationship with Jodi Centonze, and had fathered their first child. He said he chose not to divorce his wife and relinquish guardianship because he wanted to ensure her final wishes (not to be kept alive in a PVS) were carried out. The court denied the motion to remove the guardian, allowing that the evidence was not sufficient and in some instances, not relevant. It set April 24, 2001 as the date on which the tube was to be removed.|$|E
40|$|When may states impose coercive {{measures}} such as asset freezes, trade embargos, and investment restrictions to protect {{the human rights of}} foreign nationals abroad? Drawing inspiration from Hugo Grotius’s <b>guardianship</b> <b>account</b> of humanitarian intervention, this Article offers a new theory of states’ standing to enforce human rights abroad: under some circumstances, international law authorizes states to impose countermeasures as fiduciary representatives, asserting the human rights of oppressed foreign peoples for the benefit of those peoples. The fiduciary theory explains why all states may use countermeasures to vindicate the human rights of foreign nationals abroad {{despite the fact that they}} do not suffer any injury to their own independent legal interests when another state violates the human rights of its own people. But the fiduciary theory also constrains foreign intervention by prescribing a robust set of legal duties that respect the self-determination and human rights of foreign peoples...|$|E

(However, <b>guardianship</b> and conservatorship <b>accounts</b> generally remain limited by specific state law.)

40|$|The essay {{investigates the}} impact of the {{premature}} death of the father on brother and sister groups in noble Roman families of the seventeenth century. More specifically, it explores how this loss reflected on the biographical itineraries of individual members of the sibling unit; how adelphic relations between the orphans were reformulated according to order of birth and first born or cadet status, age, and sex; and what forms of solidarity and competition were engendered by the loss of a father. Since demographic historians have shown that orphanage at an early age is an important variable, the author argues that it cannot be overlooked – as historians have done so far – in studies on family relations, and especially when reconstructing childhood and adolescence experiences. The author’s investigation is mainly based on qualitative sources (letters, <b>guardianship</b> memorandums, <b>account</b> books, etc.) from the archives of the families selected for examination. These documents bear witness to the strength of kinship relationships, which provide support to the orphans during their lives, and to the role of proximity vs. distance in the evolution of inter-sibling bonds...|$|R
