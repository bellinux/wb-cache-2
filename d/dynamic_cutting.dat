They sought to accomplish their goal by minimizing story and plot, focusing instead on visual concerns by using close-ups, dolly shots, montage, lens distortions, and other cinematic techniques. Films like Ballet Mécanique, Symphony Diagonale, and The Symphony of a Great City projected rhythm and motion in the title of the films and the works themselves. In addition to close-ups, other filmmaking techniques were used to create rhythm and visual interest.

40|$|According to {{previous}} research of dynamic end milling models, the instantaneous dynamic radii on every cutting position affects the cutting forces directly since the simulated forces are {{proportional to the}} chip thickness, and the chip thickness {{is a function of}} dynamic radii and feedrate. With the concept of flute engagement introduced, it is important to discuss it with respect to radial and axial depths of cut because the length of the engaged flutes is affected by factors in the axial feed and rotational directions. Radial and axial depths of cut affect the “contact area”, which is the area that a cutter contacts with the workpiece. When radial and axial depths of cut increase, the cutting forces also increase since the engaged flute lengths are increased.
