5|$|Deep spectroscopic {{analysis}} of NGC 6543 {{may indicate that}} the nebula contains {{a small amount of}} material which is highly enriched in heavy elements; this is <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationship between}} archaea and eukaryotes remains unclear. Aside from the similarities in cell {{structure and function}} that are <b>discussed</b> <b>below,</b> many genetic trees group the two.|$|E

40|$|Here in this letter, I want to {{harmonize}} the two perspectives {{by arguing that}} coexistence of information explosion and data mining is possible. We should strive for that ever elusive balance and I <b>discuss</b> <b>below</b> how Web 2. 0 will enable it. Web 2. 0, {{still in its infancy}} already shows promising results and I <b>discuss</b> <b>below</b> these usages...|$|R

Current {{companies that}} were formerly based in the city include Checkers, Minolta-QMS, Morrison's, and the Waterman Steamship Corporation. In addition to those <b>discussed</b> <b>below,</b> AlwaysHD, Foosackly's, Integrity Media, and Volkert, Inc. are currently headquartered out of Mobile.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{vertical}} trends down groups, helium {{can be seen}} as a typical noble gas at the head of Group 18, but as <b>discussed</b> <b>below,</b> hydrogen's chemistry is unique and it is not easily assigned to any group.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} the informed and uninformed agents’ strategies when they make decisions in a typical period, which we will <b>discuss</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
30|$|As we will <b>discuss</b> <b>below,</b> {{the final}} step in fluid therapy is to {{consider}} withholding or withdrawing resuscitation fluids when {{they are no longer}} required [1, 14, 15].|$|R
30|$|To {{find the}} optimal {{parameters}} {{for both the}} FEC schemes and the portion of channel bandwidth they share, we <b>discuss</b> <b>below</b> the cross-layer optimization for the four schemes given in Table 2.|$|R
5|$|As is <b>discussed</b> <b>below,</b> {{the reason}} for the delay was {{probably}} simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are <b>discussed</b> <b>below</b> under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species. Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously. An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E

50|$|This is what {{is meant}} by self-{{reflectivity}}. Such reflectivity is encoded in language and developed in conversations about collective selves (as we <b>discuss</b> <b>below,</b> there are also conversations about the selves of individuals, defining, justifying, and stigmatizing them).|$|R
30|$|We <b>discuss</b> <b>below</b> {{the notions}} {{involved}} and the explicit {{values of the}} threshold parameters λ _*, λ _**, and λ _***. Key is the following notion of Hardy interior mass associated to the operator -Δ -γ/|x|^ 2 -λ on a bounded domain Ω containing 0.|$|R
5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{contribute to}} antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and {{preventing them from}} catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and a family history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b> The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{examples}} of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme {{used in the}} process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b> ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (<b>discussed</b> <b>below).</b>|$|E

30|$|In this paper, my {{interest}} is in how design thinking is applied in organizations. In this context, design thinking {{can be seen as}} both a problem-solving process and a way of thinking about problems. 2 While characterizations of each vary, they have common elements, which I <b>discuss</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{paper of}} Brezis and Nirenberg [6] {{generated}} lots of activities. Combined with {{the contribution of}} Druet [19], it contains most of the ingredients relevant to the case when 0 ∈Ω, including the case when the Laplacian is replaced by the Hardy–Schrödinger operator L_γ that we <b>discuss</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (as will be <b>discussed</b> <b>below)</b> and leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E
5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is <b>discussed</b> <b>below,</b> or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought {{about changes in}} the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as <b>discussed</b> <b>below.</b> Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E
