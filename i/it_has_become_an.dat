5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 67 {{people have}} been given the Life Achievement Award. Multiple winners have been awarded 20 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984.

While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners are best known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.|$|E

5|$|Puri is {{the site}} of the Govardhana Matha, one of the four {{cardinal}} institutions established by Adi Shankaracharya, when he visited Puri in 810 AD, and since then <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important dham (divine centre) for the Hindus; the others being those at Sringeri, Dwarka and Jyotirmath. The Matha (monastery of various Hindu sects) is headed by Jagatguru Shankarachrya. It is a local belief about these dhams that Lord Vishnu takes his dinner at Puri, has his bath at Rameshwaram, spends the night at Dwarka and does penance at Badrinath.|$|E
5|$|Some {{freshwater}} bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moir√©-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E
