40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} {{the mode of}} a single-axis solar orientation of the projected spacecraft {{that will be used}} for microgravity experiments. The normal to the plane of spacecraft solar arrays is constantly directed to the Sun in this mode, the absolute angular rate of the spacecraft is practically equal to zero. The mode is realized by means of reaction wheels (RW). We obtain the acceleration estimates by mathematical modeling of the spacecraft attitude motion taking into account the gravitational and the aerodynamic torques acted upon the spacecraft, as well as the control torque produced by the RW system. We consider two models of the spacecraft attitude motion. One of them is rather simple and idealized. The other is more realistic. Using both models, we analyzed two control laws for the RW system. The first law provides only a stabilization of the spacecraft in the prescribed attitude. The second one provides additionally a <b>ecrease</b> <b>of</b> the angular momentum of RW system due to the special choice of the spacecraft turning about the normal to the solar arrays.

40|$|Background: Sport is one {{of popular}} {{activities}} throughout the world. One {{of the biggest problems}} found among athletes in sports is dehydration, which causes many bad health issues for athletes themselves. The bad health issues caused by dehydration, several of them are disturbance and decrease of the memory. Therefore, rehydration is required to overcome the bad effects of dehydration. Aim: To know the effect of rehydration on memory Method: This research uses experimental method. The research subjects are the medical students of Diponegoro University (n= 31) whom being dehydrated and rehydrated with isotonic water. Their memories are measured by using code and memory tests. A changing of memories among groups is analyzed with Kruskal Wallis and continued with Mann-Whitney test. Result: It is found that there is a decrease of memories after dehydrating condition rather than before dehydrating condition. Wilcoxon test shows an increase of memory function after rehydration which is significant in group of isotonic water rehydration (p= 0, 006) and mineral water rehydration (p= 0, 026). Otherwise, there is a significant <b>ecrease</b> <b>of</b> memory function in group of non-rehydration (p= 0, 035). Furthermore, the result of Kruskal Wallis shows the significant difference (p= 0, 022) in memory test among groups. Conclusion: Dehydration decreases memory function, while rehydration with isotonic and mineral water can significantly increase memory function.

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{detailed}} petrographic and microprobe {{study was}} carried out on atoll-shaped garnets from the aureole of the Ardara pluton, in which regionally metamorphosed rocks {{have been affected by}} thermal metamorphism. Textural evidence showed that the atoll garnets are formed by replacement mainly by biotite, some plagioclase, quartz, and opaques, and may proceed from the garnet interior towards the margins, or from the margins into the core. Core replacement occurs mainly in those garnets enclosed by quartz or quartz-rich matrix. Microprobe analyses are presented of garnets in different stages of atoll formation. Compositional profiles at the garnet margins how abnormal (reversed) zoning with increase in MnO and Fe~O 3, z marked <b>ecrease</b> <b>of</b> CaO, and decrease of MgO towards the extreme dge. With decreasing width of the atoll rims, there is generally an increase in MnO {{and to a lesser extent}} Fe 203, a decrease in CaO; MgO is variable. The microprobe data support the textural observations and a model for atoll forma-tion involving prograde resorption (i. e. garnet replacement during temperature increase) ispresented. PREVIOUS work on atoll garnets has been limited, but selective replacement of the atol l core has been generally considered to be the most likely mechanism of formation in metamorphic rocks (Green, I 915; Wil l iamson, t 935; Rast, ~ 963, I 965; Forest ier and Lasnier, I 969). Such crystal shapes are well known in the field of ore mineralog...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the effects of}} L-glutamate (Glu) introduced into the perilymph of scala tympani on the spontaneous and tone-evoked activity of guinea pig single primary auditory afferents. Concentrations below 2 mmol/ 1 were in general ineffective, while a concentration f 5 mmol/ 1 caused amarked <b>ecrease</b> <b>of</b> the neural activity. At 2 mmol/ 1, roughly 60 % of the Glu-perfusions were effective and produced avariety of changes. The most prominent effect was a reduction of the tone-evoked activity without a change in spontaneous rate. Indeed, in some ceils, the tone-evoked activity could be almost otally abolished without affecting the spontaneous activity. More rarely observed was a moderate, generally transient increase of the spontaneous activity which was occasionally followed by a decrease in both tone-evoked and spontaneous firing rate. The increase in firing rate was always mall relative to the maximum discharge rate evoked by tone stimuli. Desensitization f the Glu-evoked response without an obvious change in the spontaneous activity was also found. In a few cells Glu caused areduction of the discharge rate below the spontaneous firing rate during loud tone presentation. Higher Glu doses generally caused a reduction of spontaneous and tone-evoked activity without any sign of a preceding increase. Thus, the effects of Glu in the mammalian cochlea ppear to be complex and on balance seem inconsistent with the effects predicted for an excitatory transmitter. The findings argue against he hypothesis that Glu is the afferent transmitter released by inner hair-cells. However, the results do not exclude an involvement ofGlu as a neuromodulator or co-transmitter...|$|R

Some weeds reduce human efficiency through physical discomfort caused by allergies and poisoning. Weeds such as parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) and rag weed (Limbrosia species) causes etching, hay fever and other debilitating allergies, which contribute markedly to chronic human illness and suffering. Cotton seeds were treated with different concentrations of leaf exudates of parthenium hysterophorus and the biochemical constituents of treated cotton plants were analysed. The protein and phenol were found to increase in treated plants due {{to the release of}} protease inhibitors. In addition to this, increase in the activity of Nitrate reductase and peroxidase were observed followed by dthe <b>ecreased</b> activity <b>of</b> catalase. The plants with higher concentration of phenol showed resistance to pest and they were healthy compound to that of controlled plants. The treated plants also showed some morphological variations. Increase in height was noted in 80 % treated plants and there were no growth and decrease in 100 % treated. This inhibitory effect was due to high concentration of first noted in 80 % treated plants.

40|$|Migration of {{individuals}} allows a fruitful interaction b etween subpopulations {{in the island}} model, a well known distributed approach for evolutionary computing, where separate subpopulations evolve in parallel. This model is well suited for a distributed environment running a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) scheme. Here, the same Genetic Algorithm (GA) is replicated in many processors and attempting better convergence, through an expected improvement on genetic diversity, selected individuals are exchanged p eriodically. For exchanging, an individual is selected from a source subpopulation and then exported towards a target subpopulation. Usually, the imported string is accepted on arrival and then inserted into the target subpopulation. Our earlier experiments on controlled migration showed an improvement on results when contrasted against those obtained b y conventional migration approaches.
