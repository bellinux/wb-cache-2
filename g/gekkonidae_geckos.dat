5000|$|Gekkonidae is {{the largest}} family of geckos, {{containing}} over 950 described species in 51 genera. Many [...] "typical" [...] geckos are members of <b>Gekkonidae,</b> including house <b>geckos</b> (Hemidactylus), tokay geckos (Gekko gecko), and day geckos (Phelsuma).

50|$|The Eublepharinae {{are one of}} five subfamilies of the <b>Gekkonidae,</b> or <b>geckos.</b> The Eublepharinae {{subfamily}} has 27 {{species in}} five genera. Also called eyelid geckos, the eublepharines have more primitive features than other geckos. In particular, their feet lack the modifications that allow most other geckos to climb sheer surfaces. Unlike other geckos, they also have movable eyelids. They are nocturnal lizards, often preying on insects and similar creatures. They lay a pair of leathery eggs, and, {{in at least some}} species, the sex of the young is determined by the temperature of incubation, as in crocodiles.|$|R
50|$|Tarentola mauritanica is {{a species}} of <b>gecko</b> (<b>Gekkonidae)</b> native to the western Mediterranean area of Northwestern Africa and Europe and widely {{introduced}} to America and Asia. It is commonly observed on walls in urban environments, mainly in warm coastal areas. However, {{it can be found}} further inland, especially in Spain. A robust species, up to 150 millimetres long, its tubercules are enlarged and give the species a spiny armoured appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Hemidactylus (the house geckos) is a genus of {{the family}} of common <b>geckos,</b> <b>Gekkonidae.</b> It has about 90 {{described}} species, newfound ones being described every few years. These geckos are found in all the tropical regions of the world, extending into the subtropical parts of Africa and Europe. They excel in colonizing oceanic islands by rafting on flotsam, and are for example found across most of Polynesia. In some archipelagoes, cryptic species complexes are found.

The island also provides habitation for pigeons and doves (Columbidae), common blackbird, tropical mockingbird, sandpipers, bananaquit, blue and crowned herons (Botaurus) and hummingbirds. The skies above are populated by osprey, laughing gull and frigatebird.

Snakes include the Javan spitting cobra (Naja sputatrix), Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii), white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris), blue lipped sea krait (Laticauda laticaudata), and Timor python (Python timoriensis). Lizards include nine skink species (Scinidae), <b>geckos</b> (<b>Gekkonidae),</b> limbless lizards (Dibamidae), and the monitor lizards such as the Komodo dragon (Varanidae). Frogs include the Asian bullfrog (Kaloula baleata), the endemic Komodo cross frog (Oreophryne jeffersoniana) and Oreophryne darewskyi. Frogs are typically found at higher, moister altitudes. The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) was once present within the park in coastal areas including mangrove swamps but is now extinct within the area.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the species richness and distribution patterns of reptiles inhabiting the Central Western Ghats Moun-tains of southwestern India. In {{the past few}} years, field work by us {{as well as our}} colleagues resulted in a steady stream of several new regional records of species of day geckos (Cnemaspis), skinks (Scincidae), shieldtail snakes (Uropeltidae), bronzeback tree snakes (Dendrelaphis) and coral snakes (Calliophis). Based on our past extensive sampling in the region as a whole and intensive, long-term sampling in the central part, i. e., the Agumbe plateau, we continue to add several additional species of <b>geckos</b> (<b>Gekkonidae),</b> agamids (Calotes), skinks and snakes in this paper. We take a more holistic approach here and revise the checklist of reptiles inhabiting the Central Western Ghats not only by adding all our past and present new regional records but also by deleting some dubious “re-cords ” of agamids (Salea) and pitvipers (Trimeresurus) not based on voucher specimens pending the availability of reliable, soundly identified vouchers. As a result, a total of 71 species of reptiles, comprising of 4 chelonians, 24 lizards and 43 snakes are reported here. Our literature review shows that only 11 (out of 71) species were origi-nally described from this region. Our preliminary analysis of area cladogram delineated that despite the many range extensions of “southern ” Western Ghats species, the Central Western Ghats reptile fauna is still more similar to the Northern Western Ghats. Our analysis of distribution patterns revealed that half the species are Western Ghats endemics (47 %), many are also widespread species (30 %) and that the Eastern Ghats and Sri Lankan fauna were only scarcely represented...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comRapid and reliable estimation of population size is needed for the efficient monitoring of animal populations of conservation concern. Unfortunately, technical advances in this area have not been paralleled in uptake in conservation, which may be due to difficulties in implementation or the lack of general guidelines for application. Here we tested five different methods used to estimate population size [capture–mark–recapture (CMR), finite-mixture models, model averaging of finite-mixture models, accumulation curve methods (ACM), and the line transect method (LT) ] using extensive capture–recapture data of the giant day <b>gecko</b> (<b>Gekkonidae,</b> Phelsuma madagascariensis grandis, Gray 1870) at the Masoala rainforest exhibit, Zurich Zoo. When the complete data were analyzed [30 sessions (and 27 sessions for the LT) ], all methods except the LT produced similar estimates of population size. The simple ACM gave a small coefficient of variation (CV), but did not cover the most likely value of population size at moderate sampling effort. Nevertheless, the ACM was the only method that showed a reasonable convergence when subsets of data were used. CMR and Pledger models included the reference value in their confidence intervals (CI) after 25 and 30 sessions, respectively. Although model averaging did slightly improve the estimate, the CV was still high for the full dataset. Our method of using subsets of data to test the robustness of estimates is simple to apply and could be adopted more widely in such analyzes to evaluate sensitivity to method of evaluation. In conclusion, simple accumulation methods showed similar efficiency to more complex statistical models, and are likely to be sufficiently precise for most conservation monitoring purposes. Thomas C.

30|$|The frame-like skulls {{possessed by}} diapsid {{reptiles}} evolved {{in response to}} functional forces (Rieppel, 1993 a, Moazen et al., 2009, Herrel et al., 2007, Curtis et al., 2011) and several studies have suggested heterochrony as a driving force for producing this morphological diversity (Rieppel, 1993 a, Whiteside, 1986, Irish, 1989). The ancestral lineage of diapsid reptiles possessed upper and lower temporal bars that encircle temporal fenestrae (Müller, 2003, Moazen et al., 2009). The lower temporal bar that encloses lower temporal fenestra ventrally was probably lost once in the common ancestor of lepidosaurs and archosaurs, possibly as the outcome of paedomorphosis: incomplete ossification of a quadrato-maxillary ligament between jugal and quadratojugal bones (Rieppel, 1993 a;Müller,, Müller, Müller, 2003). If this is true, the lower temporal bar that possibly results from peramorphosis (hypermorphosis): complete ossification of a quadrato-maxillary ligament was independently re-acquired in the lineages of tuatara and crocodiles, {{as well as in}} several extinct reptilian lineages (Rieppel, 1993 a;Müller,, Müller, Müller, 2003). Furthermore, disappearance of upper temporal bar, which is regarded as an extreme condition of reduction of the dermatocranium in reptiles, may have independently evolved in the skull of <b>geckos</b> (<b>Gekkonidae),</b> miniaturized fossorial lizards (e.g., Typhlosaurus, Dibamus), amphisbaenian, and snakes, as the outcome of paedomorphosis represented by the retardation of ossification (Rieppel, 1993 a, Irish, 1989;Cundall & Irish,, Cundall & Irish, Cundall & Irish, 2008). In the present study, we revealed a possible correlation between distribution pattern of Runx 2 and/or Msx 2 -expressing osteogenic mesenchymal precursor cells and the skull morphology of each reptilian lineage (Figure  9). In early stage crocodile embryos, we observed focal distribution of osteogenic mesenchyme around the domain where future temporal bars are formed. In early stage snake embryos, osteogenic mesenchymal cells were primarily found adjacent to the primordium of the braincase and the spatial pattern presaged the absence of bony temporal bars in the temporal region of adult animal.|$|R
