5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
25|$|The tips of {{the right}} and left maxillary stylets are not the same; the right is hook-like and curved, and the left is straight. The right and left mandibular stylets extend along the outer sides of their {{respective}} maxillary stylets and do not reach anywhere near the tip of the fused maxillary stylets. The stylets are retained in a groove in the labium, and during feeding, they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> of the way; its tip never enters the wound.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} R.E.8 less tiring to fly, the pilot's {{controls}} included a wheel {{to adjust the}} tailplane incidence in flight and a form of primitive rudder trim (applied to the rudder bar) was provided to alleviate the constant pressure necessary to counteract the torque of the propeller. Basic flight controls were installed in the observer's cockpit and <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> of the way when not in use. They were connected to the elevators, rudder and throttle {{but not to the}} ailerons, and were intended to give observers a chance to make a forced landing if the pilot was killed or incapacitated rather than to offer true dual control.|$|E

500|$|The {{interior}} of the vessel was designed by Zimmerman, who visited United States Navy fast-attack submarines for inspiration. He also kept in mind the heritage of the other ships named Enterprise {{in the history of}} Star Trek. The designs attempted to allow a greater freedom of filming angles than seen in previous Star Trek series. The bridge stations were originally designed with both angular and tubular elements, but the tubular elements were dropped as they seemed out of place. John Eaves created the designs for the stations, while Mike and Denise Okuda, Jim Van Over and Anthony Fredrickson created the mechanical and detailed elements. Inspiration was taken from United States Navy ships and the Space Shuttle, such as the inclusion of operations manuals on some of the stations such as communications. Other elements that were added included a switch from the touch screen controls seen in series such as The Next Generation to more hands-on dials and buttons as appeared in The Original Series. The set also included what was described as [...] "busy boxes" [...] by the crew, which were parts of the consoles that <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> and were filled with wires - so that background actors could look busy during a shot when Enterprise was being refitted or when there was battle damage to be seen on screen.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} exterior, the {{interior}} was completely redesigned with a more conservative style, although some features from the previous cars were carried over. The dashboard had a more linear appearance, instead of curving around the driver. The [...] "Integrated Control Panel" [...] was carried over but enlarged, reshaped, {{and placed in the}} center of the dash instead of being tilted toward the driver. The Flip-Fold center console was also carried over but it was revamped as well. When <b>folded</b> <b>out,</b> it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had different cupholders and storage areas. Unlike previous Tauruses, this one offered rear cupholders that either slid or <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were also}} some {{alternate}} {{versions of the}} ascending ligatures. Thus, the basic ascending B–L podatus shape was replaced by one where the second note was both <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> {{to the right and}} marked with an extra stem (...) , as if these two modifications were meant to cancel each other out. The ascending L–L (sine proprietate) was modified accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned {{with a more}} conventional shape, although some features from the previous Taurus generations were carried over. The dashboard was given a squarer design instead of curving around the driver {{as in the previous}} generation. The [...] "integrated control panel" [...] concept was carried over but redesigned, with a bigger, squarer shape, and it was placed {{in the center of the}} dash instead of being angled toward the driver. The flip-fold center console was also carried over from the previous generation, although it was revamped as well. When <b>folded</b> <b>out,</b> it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had reworked cup holders and storage areas. In another change from previous versions, the fourth generation offered rear cup holders that either slid or <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the final note {{was to be}} a breve (sine perfectione), this was {{signaled}} by a change in the noteheads themselves: the descending sequence of square heads was replaced with a single diagonal beam (...) , while the ascending podatus had its second note <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> to the right (...) [...] Both sequences correspond to the initial B–B segments of the ternary porrectus and torculus respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{innovation}} was the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] {{center console}} on cars not {{equipped with a}} standard floor console. [...] It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could {{be transformed into a}} console, reducing the seating count by one. [...] The seat cushion <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> into a console with a lockable storage bin and cupholders, resting against the dashboard. [...] The seatback also folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center console with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold console.|$|E

6000|$|From Prag onwards, {{here has}} been a {{delicate}} set of operations; perfectly executed,--thanks to Friedrich's rapidity of shift, and also to the cautious slowly puzzling mind of Daun. Had Daun used any diligence, had Daun and Prince Karl been broad awake, together or even singly! But Friedrich guessed they seldom or never were; that they would spend some days in puzzling; and that, with despatch, he would have time for everything. Daun, we could observe, stood singing TE-DEUM, greatly at leisure, in his old Camp, 20th June, while Friedrich, from the first gray of morning, and diligently all day long, was withdrawing from the trenches of Prag,--Friedrich's people, self and goods getting <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> in the finest gradation, and with perfect success; no Daun to hinder him,--Daun leisurely doing TE-DEUM, forty miles off, helping on the WRONG side by that exertion! [Cogniazzo, ii. 367.]--"Poor Browne, he is dead of his wounds, in Prag yonder," [...] writes Westphalen, in his Leitmeritz Journal, [...] "news came to us July 1st: men said, 'Ah, that was why they lay asleep.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{provinces of}} Hida and Etchiu are {{cut off from}} the rest of Japan by sets of {{mountain}} ranges, impassable throughout almost their whole length. So bent on barring the way are the chains that, not content with doing so in mid-course, they all but shut it at their ocean end; for they fall in all their entirety plumb into the sea. Following one another for a distance of sixty miles, range after range takes thus its header into the deep. The only level spots are the deltas deposited by the streams between the parallels of peak. But these are far between. Most of the way the road belts the cliffs, now near their base, now cut into the precipice hundreds of feet above the tide. The road is one continuous observation point. Along it our jinrikisha bowled. In spite of the rain, the view had a grandeur that compensated for much discomfort. It was, moreover, amply diversified. Now we rushed out to the tip of some high cape, now we swung round into the curve of the next bay; now we wound slowly upward, now we slipped merrily down. The headlands were endless, and each gave us a seascape differing from the one we <b>folded</b> <b>out</b> of sight behind; and a fringe of foam, curving with the coast, stretched like a ribbon before us to mark the way.|$|E
