40|$|Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law {{was about}} to become history, being allowed to slip slowly but surely into {{obsolescence}} after a lapse of more than 30 years between editions. An unlikely combination of impulses from its former publisher and a legal book-sellers gave it a final chance of revival, and a decision was taken to make one attempt to reverse the terminal decline. An editorial team was assembled, for membership of which the only lexicographical qualification was enthusiasm. In the course of the 3 -year project we all learned a great deal about how not to write dictionaries. This short paper will offer some thoughts from a novice on how to grapple, at speed and against a host of commercial and professional pressures, with fundamental issues that will be familiar to experienced lexicographers. How do you brind yourself to throw out historical material that once gone will be found nowhere else? If you keep it, how do you prevent it from swamping the work of jeopardising the reputation of the dictionary? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between a good dictionary and a bad encyclopaedia? Is the inclusion of examples a counsel of perfection or an admission of failure to define clearly? How far is it worth striving for consistency, when the authority of the work depends on using a wide range of experts with necessarily individual styles and approaches? How far should one consolidate historical doubt, or strip out old entries simply because they are no longer verifiable (and perhaps never were) ? How do you reflect the fact that the inclusion of new substantive fields changes the class of reader and, therefore, the kind of product they are expecting and need?

40|$|Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between {{land and}} sea? Should both {{be part of}} a conceptually larger dimension? This paper {{examines}} a different kind of ‘native space’, the sea - above and below the waves - and how it might have shaped ethnic identities and consciousness in the Andean region. Using evidence from a previously unpublished source dating to the 1580 s, this paper draws on the case of Pedro de Cama, of the ethnic Manteño peoples of the south central (present day) Ecuador. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Manteño were sea farers and marine specialists, with antecedents drawn from maritime cultures and complex exchange systems along the west coast of Central and South America dating back well over two thousand years. In his petition to the Crown of Spain, Pedro de Cama declared himself to be a sailor, diver and ‘man of the sea’ and this is how the Spanish understood him, as an Indian ‘ladino’ - conversant with Spanish ways and language - their ‘friend’, who provisioned the ships of their navy, who sailed in their galleons, and who, on occasion, even saved their ships from sinking. His account is firmly situated within a Eurocentric conceptual framework; his credentials are those of a seaman from within European colonial definitions of that role. However, from an ethnic Andean perspective, we are reminded that space should include more than mere earth-bound notions of territory, that the sea itself constituted its own framework of experience. Drawing on pre-Columbian iconographic and ethnohistorical information this paper offers a view on how native space can be interpreted to include an oceanic dimension and complement purely telluric ‘Tierre Firme’ models of space in a more holistic and multi-dimensional view of the native world...|$|E

Therefore for all intelligible human purposes, for altering things or for keeping things as they are, for founding a system for ever, as in China, or for altering it every month as in the early French Revolution, it is equally necessary that the vision should be a fixed vision. This is our first requirement.|$|R

40|$|The {{past week}} has seen some {{extraordinary}} {{allegations that the}} US National Security Agency (NSA) was intercepting all online communications. It is also alleged that the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) may have circumvented UK law. These allegation are profound not least because they also claim that governments of the US, and by extension the UK, have {{direct access to the}} servers of companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and many others. All the companies accused of granting such access made equally strong claims that they definitely have not given such direct access. The US Director of National Intelligence issued a statement saying that if any document released were genuine then the inference that there was mass surveillance underway would be incorrect. So {{the bottom line is that}} someone is lying, or at best has completely misunderstood the data they have seen. We will have to wait to see how the story plays out. In the meantime the media coverage raises a serious issue that seems to have submerged under the frenzy. The facts known so far are scant and unverified. With national security in play, where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in publishing classified documents? When does whistleblowing become damaging to public safety? There has to be a place for whistleblowers, and investigative journalism, to uncover matters such as illegality and abuses of power. In the UK there are laws that protect such whistleblowers. It is well documented that the UK shares signals intelligence with the US. Since 1946 the UK has agreements for intelligence sharing and these have stood the UK in good stead. So it is not surprising that the UK may have access to interceptions conducted by the US. The real concern is that such arrangements could be used to circumvent UK law, but I will be astonished if we find that the UK intelligence services, or those of the US, have been acting illegally. With oversight from the Intelligence and Security Select Committee and the Interception Commissioner, it would place the intelligence community in a precarious position to be found to not only have broken they law but to have lied about it. Remember, those with oversight have the mandate and clearance to roam where they will. Let’s assume for a moment that the material published is genuine, but what it revealed is not illegal. Let’s assume that any intelligence operations revealed are real, but that those operations are entirely within the law. Is it responsible to publish classified documents just because you can? Intelligence gathering goes on in the background, because if those who you seek to investigate know the methods and techniques you employ, then they can take steps to avoid your scrutiny. To begin to publish documents that reveal operational methods is like playing a game of football and telling the other side your tactics before you begin. I cast my mind back to the Watergate scandal. When Washington Post’s reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein constructed their story, they were careful to corroborate their facts. Their “deep throat” pointed them in the right direction, but they made no allegations until they had interviewed several sources and had constructed a consistent, self-supporting story. We have yet to see such corroboration in the current story. This morning on the BBC World Service Ewen MacAskill, one of the Guardian reporters who broke the current story, said that Edward Snowden, the whistleblower, had been collecting these documents for many years. It cannot have been that Snowden was shocked that the intelligence community was collecting intelligence. That is what they do. Yes, if it turns out that they have mass unfettered access to the systems of the various companies implicated then we should be concerned, but if they are targeting suspected terrorists (or other criminals) then it should not be surprising. I’m left with a niggling feeling that somewhere along the line there is a real danger that certain aspects of intelligence gathering will be revealed that could aid those who would do us harm. There is a fine line between exposing wrong-doing in those in positions of power, and diminishing their ability to protect us. I hope those covering the story are not stepping over that line.

The album stemmed from the idea that [...] " [...] kind of...what we do. I mean, {{in the sense of}} how life goes on when we go away [...]" [...] Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up. Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions, despite stating in interviews that the album was [...] "a full on collaborative effort" [...] and [...] "We just all had a say in what we were writing." [...] It was revealed in 2007, in interviews, and when Mark posted in the band's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri's lyrics in a matter of days. The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums, and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals. CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album [...] "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band [...] "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's The Fiction We Live." [...] The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a [...] "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Abandon Your Friends produced one single, [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Draw</b> <b>The</b> Line?"
