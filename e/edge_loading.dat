5000|$|The sugar {{storage shed}} was {{constructed}} in 1923. An electrical conveyor system was installed in the shed to move sugar bags to and from ships' holds and railway wagons, and was fully operational by 1926. The system consisted of an inclined covered conveyor extending from railway tracks {{on the west side}} of the shed up to the shed's roofline. This conveyor provided the linkage with the wharf railway system. A complicated set of conveyors and chutes was built into the roof of the sugar shed, and this system was used to stack bagged sugar at a rate of up to 80 tons per hour. A second conveyor extended between the roof of the sugar shed eastwards to the roof of number 4 wharf shed. This conveyor joined another in a T-configuration on the eastern side of the wharf shed's roof. The overhead conveyors from White's Shed to number 3 wharf were reconstructed in 1946, while maintenance and repairs to both [...] "shore and floating plant" [...] were made in 1947. The 27-year-old facility was apparently modernised during the overhaul. Two travelling gantry cranes moved up and down the number 4 wharf's <b>edge,</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading the sugar bags into ship's holds via a set of conveyors mounted on the gantry cranes and connected to the T-conveyor.|$|E

The refining conditions affect fibre morphology, pulp suspension characteristics and paper properties. In this study we investigated the effect of refining intensity - given by the specific <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> (SEL) - on the fibre and paper properties. Lower refining intensity led to lower fibre cutting, lower fines generation, and lower ºSR development.

The present study aimed to quantify the {{occurrence of}} edge loading/contact at the articulating surface and to evaluate the effect of cup angles and <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> on the contact mechanics of a modular metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) total hip replacement (THR) during different daily activities.

Hip simulator testing under a wide range of clinically relevant loading conditions is important. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur following impingement under extreme activities and can also occur during normal gait where there is an offset deficiency and/or joint laxity. This study evaluated a hip simulator method that assessed wear and damage in polyethylene acetabular liners that were subjected to <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The liners tested to evaluate the method were a currently manufactured crosslinked polyethylene acetabular liner and an aged conventional polyethylene acetabular liner. The acetabular liners were tested for five million standard walking cycles and following this five million walking cycles with <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions represented a separation of the centres of rotation of the femoral head and the acetabular liner during the swing phase, leading to loading of the liner rim on heel strike.

This study supports previous clinical findings that <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> may cause rim cracking in liners where component positioning is sub-optimal or where material degradation is present.

40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur where there is sub-optimal component positioning and/or joint laxity. Wear resistance can be improved by crosslinking but the manufacturing process of these materials involves post-irradiation thermal treatments to recombine free radicals and to stabilise the materials. Stabilisation can also be achieved by adding antioxidants. Material degradation due to oxidation and manufacturing process can result in rim cracking and/or fracture due to a reduction in mechanical properties and this has been observed in vivo. A requirement for pre-clinical hip simulator testing under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for all of these materials has therefore been identified. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a hip simulator <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol using accelerated aged conventional UHMWPE acetabular liners as positive controls and commercially available crosslinked UHMWPE acetabular liners as negative controls. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol was then used to evaluate antioxidant stabilised liners in hip simulator tests. Explanted UHMWPE acetabular liners were evaluated for wear and damage mechanisms and compared with the damage observed on the hip simulator tested liners and new methodologies were developed to measure and analyse these explanted liners. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol produced cracking and subsurface damage in the aged UHMWPE liners but not in the non-aged crosslinked liners. Rim deformation was observed on all liners and the volume change produced was reduced under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for both types of UHMWPE liner. The antioxidant liners performed as well as the commercially available crosslinked liner in hip simulator tests and the rim deformation that was observed on explanted liners was replicated under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions in the hip simulator tests. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol can be used in the future to test a range of UHMWPE materials, including aged materials, and explant analysis using the methodologies developed in this study can be used to inform the design of future simulator tests...|$|E

Specifically, this study investigated the effect of both the variations in the medial–lateral translational mismatch between the centres of the femoral head and acetabular cup and the variations in the cup inclination angles on the occurrence and magnitude of the dynamic separation, the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> and the wear rate of ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement bearings in a multi-station hip joint simulator during a walking gait cycle. An increased mismatch between the centres of rotation of the femoral head and acetabular cup resulted in an increased level of dynamic separation and an increase in the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> condition which led to increased wear rate in ceramic-on-ceramic bearings. Additionally for a given translational mismatch, an increase in the cup inclination angle gave rise to increased dynamic separation, worst <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, and increased wear. To reduce the occurrence and severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> the relative positions (the mismatch) of the centres of rotation of the head and the cup should be considered alongside the rotational position of the acetabular cup.

Previous work has reported the effect of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> on the wear of hip replacement bearings with a fixed level of dynamic biomechanical hip separation. Variations in both rotational and translational surgical positioning of the hip joint replacement combine to influence both the biomechanics and the tribology including the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> the amount of dynamic separation, the force acting {{on the rim of the}} cup and the resultant wear and torque acting on the cup.

40|$|At {{the limits}} of the range of hip motion, impingement, {{subluxation}} and <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> can cause osteoarthritis in natural hips or early failure hip replacements. The aim of this PhD was to investigate the role of hip joint soft tissues throughout the range of hip motion to better understand their role in preventing (or perhaps even causing) these problematic load cases. A musculoskeletal model was used to investigate the muscular contribution to <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> and found that in the mid-range of hip motion, the lines of action of hip muscles pointed inward from the acetabular rim and thus would stabilise the hip. However, in deep hip flexion with adduction, nearly half the muscles had unfavourable lines of action which could encourage <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> Conversely, in-vitro tests on nine cadaveric hips found that the hip capsular ligaments were slack in the mid-range of hip motion but tightened to restrain excessive hip rotation in positions close to {{the limits of}} hip motion. This passive restraint prevented the hip from moving into positions where the muscle lines of action were found to be unfavourable and thus could help protect the hip from <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The ligaments were also found to protect the hip against impingement and dislocation. Out of the labrum, the ligamentum teres and the three capsular ligaments, {{it was found that the}} iliofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments were primary restraints to hip rotation.

40|$|We {{consider}} the radially symmetric nonlinear von Kármán plate equations for circular or annular plates in {{the limit of}} small thickness. The loads on the plate consist of a radially symmetric pressure load and a uniform <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> The dependence of the steady states on the <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> and thickness is studied using asymptotics as well as numerical calculations. The von Kármán plate equations are a singular perturbation of the Fӧppl membrane equation in the asymptotic limit of small thickness. We study the role of compressive membrane solutions in the small thickness asymptotic behavior of the plate solutions. We give evidence for the existence of a singular compressive solution for the circular membrane and show by a singular perturbation expansion that the nonsingular compressive solution approach this singular solution as the radial stress {{at the center of the}} plate vanishes. In this limit, an infinite number of folds occur with respect to the <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> Similar behavior is observed for the annular membrane with zero <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> at the inner radius in the limit as the circumferential stress vanishes. We develop multiscale expansions, which are asymptotic to members of this family for plates with edges that are elastically supported against rotation. At some thicknesses this approximation breaks down and a boundary layer appears at the center of the plate. In the limit of small normal load, the points of breakdown approach the bifurcation points corresponding to buckling of the nondeflected state. A uniform asymptotic expansion for small thickness combining the boundary layer with a multiscale approximation of the outer solution is developed for this case. These approximations complement the well known boundary layer expansions based on tensile membrane solutions in describing the bending and stretching of thin plates. The approximation becomes inconsistent as the clamped state is approached by increasing the resistance against rotation at the edge. We prove that such an expansion for the clamped circular plate cannot exist unless the pressure load is self-equilibrating. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{chipping}} {{process in}} a brittle material subjected to a uniformly applied <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> has been investigated. The present analysis extends earlier work by recognizing that as the chip is formed it may bend and change the loading at the crack tip. This geometry change introduces a nonlinear effect and has significant influence on the phenomenon. The nonlinear effect was demonstrated by incorporating it into an analytical model for a crack propagating along an interface parallel to the free surface. A finite-element analysis was then conducted to examine the crack trajectory formed in a homogeneous material. This numerical analysis showed that the crack reaches a maximum depth, and then deviates back to the free surface to form a spall. The form of this trajectory results from the additional bending moment acting at the crack tip induced by the bending of the chip and the consequent displacement of the applied load. The length of the spall {{was found to be}} approximately proportional to the square root of Ê d 5 / 2 KIC, where KIC is the fracture toughness of the material, Ê is the appropriate modulus of the material, and d is the depth over which the <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> is applied...|$|R

The wear rates of both the femoral head and acetabular cup during the bedding-in period were between 1 - 3 mm 3 /mc (million cycles) and 80 - 110 mm 3 /mc based on a steady-state wear coefficient. Results showed that modelling and verifying the contact and stress results under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions required more careful computational modelling than for normal loading conditions. The high contact pressures observed during simulations of microseparation models were consistent with the high level of wear and surface damage observed in experimental simulator studies and from patient retrievals. These methods can therefore be used as a technique to simulate wear of hip implant devices. Shakedown assessments showed that under normal, as well as <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> and severe loading conditions the hip device remained below the elastic shakedown region of a rolling and sliding shakedown map, which is ideal for minimal surface contact and subsurface damage...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{computation}} of ﬂexural {{motion of}} a ﬂoating elastic plate is often complicated. The linear approximation {{of the motion}} makes the computation tractable for simple harmonic waves in a plate. I will introduce {{a few examples of}} the linear solution methods from various researchers. This talk will show how the Wiener-Hopf technique gives solutions for a semi-inﬁnite plate with a sinusoidal <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The solution is nearly explicit, which lets us analyze the dynamics of the plate for many frequencies in time and space along the edge. Certain distributions of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> can approximate 7 a localized forcing on the edge. Then, the Wiener-Hopf technique can be used to ﬁnd the response to a localised force {{at the edge of the}} plate. The resulting solutions may be used to ﬁnd the relationship between the deﬂection and velocity near the location of forcing...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature thin-shell leading-edge {{buckling}} test data are analyzed using NASA structural analysis (NASTRAN) as a finite element tool for predicting thermal buckling characteristics. Buckling points are predicted for several combinations of edge boundary conditions. The problem of relating the appropriate plate {{area to the}} edge stress distribution and the stress gradient is addressed in terms of analysis assumptions. Local plasticity was found to occur on the specimen analyzed, and this tended to simplify the basic problem since it effectively equalized the stress gradient from <b>loaded</b> <b>edge</b> to <b>loaded</b> <b>edge.</b> The initial <b>loading</b> {{was found to be}} difficult to select for the buckling analysis because of the transient nature of thermal stress. Multiple initial model loadings are likely required for complicated thermal stress time histories before a pertinent finite element buckling analysis can be achieved. The basic mode shapes determined from experimentation were correctly identified from computation...|$|R

For the equation of stability Trefftez rule is used. The paper consists of buckling behavior of laminate (90 / 0) s, influence of some parameters such as thickness, boundary condition, aspect ratio on buckling loads and modes are investigated. Present results are compared with other papers. In this paper the effect of % weight of carbon nanotube (MWCNT) on the buckling load is also investigated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the stability behavior of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite plates with viscoelastic material behavior subject to in-plane biaxial compressive <b>edge</b> <b>loads.</b> To predict the effective time-dependent material properties, elastic fibers {{embedded in a}} linearly viscoelastic matrix are examined. The micromechanical relations developed for a transversely isotropic medium are discussed along with the correspondence principle of linear viscoelasticity. It is concluded that the stability boundary obtained for a viscoelastic plate is lower (more critical) than its elastic counterpart, and the transverse shear deformation effects are more pronounced in viscoelastic plates than in their elastic counterparts...|$|R
