25|$|Since the UCC {{prescribed}} {{a minimum}} copyright term of 25 years, chapter IV of the Fundamentals was changed accordingly. Copyright henceforth ran generally for {{the lifetime of}} the author plus 25 years, only for photographic works and works of applied art, there were shorter terms {{in some of the}} republics. In the Georgian SSR, these kinds of works were copyrighted for 20 years since their publication or creation, in the Moldavian and Uzbek SSR, for 15 years, and in Azerbaijan for ten years. In Kazakhstan, photographic works were protected for ten years and collections of photos for 15 years. These reduced terms took advantage of a provision in the UCC that set a minimum term of ten years since publication <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> works. The law of the Russian SSR did not contain any such reduced copyright terms <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> works. The new, longer copyright term only applied to works that were still copyrighted in the USSR in 1973.|$|E

25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> application.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phishing}} {{attacks have}} been directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets within businesses, and the term whaling has been coined <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> attacks.

The content of a whaling attack email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint, or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to masquerade as a critical business email, sent from a legitimate business authority. The content {{is meant to be}} tailored for upper management, and usually involves some kind of falsified company-wide concern.

25|$|India has a large, low-income, rural {{population}} with {{limited access to}} formal banking facilities. This leads to teh absenc of two major helplines for poorer people - that of placing their money safely in deposits and secondly {{of being able to}} borrow money fr their needs which may be as simple as buying seeds for the next crop or their children's marriage. The second aim is achieved instead by a web of parallel, informal banking in the form of money lenders (pawn brokers) who have existed in India for a few centuries. At its centre are moneylenders, mostly unregulated, often also wealthy landlords or now politicians, used to charge exorbitant rates of interest. To curb this practice, several Moneylenders Acts were enacted by the State governments of India by the 1950s. However failure to replace the role of moneylenders gave rise to unscrupulous financial operators that operated Ponzi schemes. Some commentators place the blame <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> Ponzi schemes on greed rather than exclusion from formal banking systems.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Eurocode 9 specific design rules for the calculation of aluminium stressed skin panels are available. These design rules {{have been used for}} optimization of two extrusions: one for explosions and wind loading governing and one for explosions and floor loading governing. The optimized extrusions are fulfilling class 3 section properties leading to weight reductions up to 25 % of regularly used shear panel sections. When the design would have been based on class 4 section properties even more weight reduction might have been reached. The failure mode depends on the height of the hat stiffeners. For sections using relatively high hat stiffeners failure is introduced by yielding of the heat affected zone. <b>For</b> <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cross sections the Eurocode 9 design rules and numerical calculations show very good agreement.
