40|$|Detection of {{conventional}} explosives remains {{a challenge to}} air security, as indicated by recent reports detailing lapses in security screening and new requirements that mandate screening 100 % of checked luggage. Neutron Resonance Radiography (NRR) has been under investigation {{as a supplement to}} conventional x-ray systems as a non-invasive, non-destructive means of detecting explosive material in checked luggage. Using fast (1 - 6 MeV) neutrons produced by an accelerator-based D(d,n) 3 He reaction and a scintillator-coupled CCD camera, NRR provides both an imaging capability and the ability to determine the chemical composition of materials in baggage or cargo. Theoretical studies and simulations have shown the potential of NRR. This thesis takes the first step towards experimental implementation using a deuterium target for multiple-element discrimination. A new neutron source has been developed to provide the high-flux neutron beam required for NRR while simultaneously minimizing gamma ray production. The gas target incorporates a 4 atm D 2 gas chamber, separated from the accelerator beamline with thin, 5 [tm tungsten or 7 [im molybdenum foils supported by a honeycomb lattice structure to increase structural integrity and provide a heat removal pathway. An argon gas cooling system is incorporated to cool the target and thus increase the neutron flux. The gas target has been shown to withstand 3. 0 MeV deuteron beam currents in excess of 35 ýLA for extended periods without failure, resulting in a neutron flux of 6. 6 x 107 neutrons/sr/LA/s. A neutron imaging system was designed to detect the fast neutrons and produce a digital image of objects for analysis. (cont.) Two neutron detectors, Eljen plastic scintillator EJ- 200 and a ZnS(Ag) scintillating screen were tested for their suitability to NRR. Although ZnS(Ag) has a lower detection efficiency, its resolution, minimal light dispersion, and insensitivity to gamma rays made it the more favorable material. An Apogee Instruments, Inc., Alta U 9 CCD camera was used to record the light from the scintillator to create radiographs. The gas target and neutron detection system were used to evaluate the results of experimental work to determine the feasibility of NRR. These experiments ultimately indicated that although NRR has promise, significant challenges regarding neutron flux and image processing must be overcome before the technique can be implemented as an <b>explosives</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system.</b> Suggestions are made for improvements. by Whitney Lyke Raas.

This system consists of a transmitter section, an NQR probe, an RFI probe, a receiver section and auxiliary modules. In the transmitter section, a novel Class-D power amplifier (PA) with fast-start fast-stop functions is proposed. The receiver section consists of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), an adaptive filter for RFI mitigation, and an advanced DSP platform for NQR signal processing. The LNA is based on an infinite input impedance power matching scheme, which improves the noise factor and simplifies the circuit structure. A Continuous Time Least Mean Square (CTLMS) adaptive filter is employed to mitigate RFI in the analog domain, and a new weight-updating circuit with DC offset cancellation is included in this adaptive filter. Between the transmitter and the receiver sections, a power multiplexing scheme is designed in order to use a single NQR probe for both transmitting and receiving. A PIN diode based RF switch provides high isolation during transmitting and low signal attenuation during receiving. ^ A customized mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) is fabricated in 0. 18 μm RF CMOS process, which contains the LNAs, adaptive filter and micro controller unit (MCU).
