Good light is essential. Boat builders should not work when they are tired and should keep the work floor clean so they don't trip over tools or wood or electric leads. A fan is handy for extra ventilation if the work space does not have many opening windows or doors. Many boat builders like smaller tools to be bright-coloured tools {{so they can see}} them easily amongst saw dust. With the recent technological advances in materials being used in modern boat building including GRP and FGRP repiratory protection masks have become essential in many workshops.

40|$|Due to {{its high}} strength-to-weight ratio, {{composite}} materials {{have been widely}} applied in aerospace manufacturing. However, some challenges are facing in fabrication and {{assembly of the parts}} with composite materials. One of them is how to collect the dwarf and dust generated from the drilling operation, especially in an open environment when the composite parts are assembled, since a large number of holes need generating to rivet the parts together when the parts with composite materials are assembled in an aircraft structure. The efficiency of <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> is crucial to the healthy operating environment {{and the quality of the}} assembled component. In this paper, three conceptual designs of automatic <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> are proposed and compared, and the best design with the hood fastened on the drilling spindle has been selected and analyzed. Its design parameters have been identified; a systematic procedure has been proposed for the design optimization; the process of the <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> has been modeled and simulated using the COSMOSFloWorks.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the technologies employed {{to develop a}} successful solution to minimise dust emissions using calibrated discrete element modelling (DEM) and new <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> technology. The case study comprised of a large crushing station that screens and crushes oversize product. The coal processed varies from dry dusty coal to wet cohesive coal that can often block sections of the transfer chute. The air generation can often be significant in the stilling chamber on the out-going conveyor due to the large drop height, making it a formidable task to design a reliable <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> system. Material testing for DEM calibration purposes was conducted on representative samples of dry and wet coal {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the solution. A new <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> system was designed and installed to extract the airborne dust, including respirable particles using a combination of misting and high efficiency cyclone technologies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{variability}} in yield oxidative status and appearance of palm oils as affected by fruit type and <b>extraction</b> <b>equipment</b> in the small scale industry. A 23 factorial experimental design with palm fruit types Dura and Tenera and <b>extraction</b> <b>equipment</b> digester screw hand spindle and hydraulic presses were studied. Quality indices of oils i. e. free fatty acid ffa peroxide value moisture content impurities colour and yield were accessed using standard methods. The ffa values obtained for oils produced from both Dura and Tenera fruit types and the <b>extraction</b> <b>equipment</b> ranged 5. 25 - 5. 71 were above the CODEX standard of 5. 0. Furthermore significant differences were also recorded in both moisture contents and impurities from the same oils produced. The oil yield from Tenera fruit types were two folds higher than the Dura fruit types. The redness colour of palm oils for Dura fruit types was a little above the Tenera fruit types. However the yellowness and lightness of colour of palm oils for Tenera were higher than oils from Dura fruit types. Therefore the study concludes that the oil processors in the small scale industry preferred the digester screw press machine because it gave low level of impurities and moisture content than other presses. Tenera fruit type is {{the best choice for}} palm oil processing because of its higher oil yield content. However in terms of oil colour Dura fruit type is preferred...|$|R
