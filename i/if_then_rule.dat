30|$|Fuzzy logic {{provides}} a framework that attempts to define a natural {{way of dealing with}} problems in which the source of imprecision is the absence of sharply defined criteria of class membership rather than the presence of random variables (Zadeh 1965). It is a problem solving technique that was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in (Zadeh 1965) to deal with vague or imprecise problems (De Wilde 2004; DeWilde 2002; Dweiri and Kablan 2006; Kandel and Zhang 1998). It is used to model human reasoning and knowledge that do not have well defined boundary. Although fuzzy logic covers a wide range of theories and techniques, it is mainly based on four concepts: fuzzy sets, linguistic variables (Hajjaji and Rachid 1995), possibility distributions (membership functions), and fuzzy if-then-rules (Dweiri and Kablan 2006). The values of a linguistic variable are both quantitatively described by a fuzzy set. Possibility distributions or membership functions are constraints on the value of a linguistic variable imposed by assigning it a fuzzy set. Fuzzy <b>if</b> <b>then</b> <b>rules</b> are knowledge representation schemes for describing a functional mapping between antecedents and consequents (Oderanti 2010). A fuzzy inference system employs fuzzy if-then rules and can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge and reasoning processes without employing precise quantitative analysis (Oderanti 2010). Fuzzy inference systems are generally understandable because the knowledge in these systems is contained in the form of fuzzy if-then rules containing membership functions (Anderson and Hall 1999).|$|R

Fuzzy models have been receiving particular attention in the area of nonlinear systems identification and analysis due to it is capacity to approximate nonlinear behavior and deal with uncertainty.

IS fuzzy models are nonlinear systems described by a set of <b>if</b> <b>then</b> <b>rules</b> which gives local linear representations of an underlying system.

For the reliable operation of the TS fuzzy inference system, adequate error measurements must be taken. The error noise must be filtered before the application of the IS fuzzy inference system.

50|$|Once {{a system}} has {{gathered}} {{information about a}} user it can evaluate that data by preset analytical algorithm and then start {{to adapt to the}} user's needs. These adaptations may concern every aspect of the system's behavior and depend on the system's purpose. Information and functions can be presented according to the user's interests, knowledge or goals by displaying only relevant features, hiding information the user does not need, making proposals what to do next and so on. One has to distinguish between adaptive and adaptable systems. In an adaptable system the user can manually change the system's appearance, behavior or functionality by actively selecting the corresponding options. Afterwards the system will stick to these choices. In an adaptive system a dynamic adaption to the user is automatically performed by the system itself, based on the built user model. Thus, an adaptive system needs ways to interpret information about the user in order to make these adaptations. One way to accomplish this task is implementing rule-based filtering. In this case a set of <b>IF...</b> <b>THEN...</b> <b>rules</b> is established that covers the knowledge base of the system. The IF-conditions can check for specific user-information and if they match the THEN-branch is performed which is responsible for the adaptive changes. Another approach is based on collaborative filtering. In this case information about a user is compared to that of other users of the same systems. Thus, if characteristics of the current user match those of another, the system can make assumptions about the current user by presuming {{that he or she is}} likely to have similar characteristics in areas where the model of the current user is lacking data. Based on these assumption the system then can perform adaptive changes.|$|R
