40|$|Conventional {{analysis}} of the welfare effects of U. S. oil price regulation in the 1970 's focuses on the deadweight losses in the oil market. This paper argues that such analysis substantially understates the benefits from <b>decontrolling</b> <b>prices,</b> because <b>decontrol</b> will lead to an improvement in the U. S. terms of trade with respect to other oil importing countries. A simple model {{of the relationship between}} oil decontrol and the terms of trade is developed, and the impact is calculated for plausible parameter values. The results suggest that the terms of trade benefits are several times larger than the benefits as conventionally measured. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} three policy reforms {{current in}} Africa: financial liberalisation, consumer <b>price</b> <b>decontrol,</b> and trade liberalisation. It {{is argued that}} financial liberalisation is not only fiscally very costly, but that the gains from improved financial intermediation depend upon a prior fiscal improvement to reduce public indebtedness. It is therefore intrinsically a slow process. By contrast, <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> is straightforward, and in most severe cases, decontrol may remonetise transactions, actually increasing seigniorage. Trade liberalisation is analysed through a political economy model of foreign aid. Donor preferences are characterised by an offer curve, subject to which the government maximises. If the resulting outcome breaches macroeconomic compatibility, private agents respond by speculating. Whereas financial liberalisation is intrinsically difficult and <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> straightforward, trade liberalisation is shown to be highly sensitive to detailed policy design...|$|R

50|$|Government {{efforts to}} take over the credit {{expansion}} also proved ephemeral {{in the early years of}} the transition. Domestic credit increased about nine times between the end of 1991 and 1992. The credit expansion was caused in part by the buildup of interenterprise arrears and the RCB's subsequent financing of those arrears. The Government restricted financing to state enterprises after it lifted controls on prices in January 1992, but enterprises faced cash shortages because the <b>decontrol</b> of <b>prices</b> cut demand for their products. Instead of curtailing production, most firms chose to build up inventories. To support continued production under these circumstances, enterprises relied on loans from other enterprises. By mid-1992, when the amount of unpaid interenterprise loans had reached 3.2 trillion rubles (about US$20 billion), the government froze interenterprise debts. Shortly thereafter, the government provided 181 billion rubles (about US$1.1 billion) in credits to enterprises that were still holding debt.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{is widely considered}} to be the most promising solution to the nation's energy problems. The dominant public policy in this field has been to encourage conservation by <b>decontrolling</b> energy <b>prices</b> and relying on consumers to respond to price increases in ways that best meet their individual needs. This policy so far has led to only small reductions in energy use within the home, and even these reductions are only partly attributable to conservation behavior. Among the many obstacles to residential conservation that have come to light, a major one is the difficulty of predicting what savings will result from any specific investment in home energy efficiency. Ten years of experience after the 1973 oil crisis raises doubts about the feasibility of residential conservation as a short-term energy strategy, and suggests that new policies are needed to improve the operation of the market for conservation investment. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the crude oil price increases, {{associated}} with the Middle East crisis, many countries, particularly Brazil, began producing ethanol for the use as fuel in mixture with gasoline. In the United States, 'gasohol', a blend of approximately 90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol began to be marketed. It was quickly accepted in a market which at that time was being controlled by political and supply problems. Major global and domestic events such as the general glut in the world supply of crude oil, <b>decontrol</b> of <b>prices,</b> lower demand for gasoline and the effect of the current administration on government funding and/or guarantees and the lack thereof, has resulted in a restructing and change in the industry.

40|$|When a {{formerly}} centrally {{planned economy}} frees prices and allows or compels producers to respond to market signals, conventional measures tend to severely overstate short-run output decline and inflation. The overstatement stems partly from neglect of private sector activity or belated recognition of inflation previously disguised as quality improvements. Even when individual prices and outputs are correctly measured, however, shifts in relative prices consequent to <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> create a serious aggregation problem. Moreover, standard indices ignore the deflationary trends in black markets. Theoretically superior indices are devised using a mixture of official and black market prices. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} economic liberalization and monetary growth on inflation during the transition from central plan to market. It concludes that <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> had a substantial, one-time effect on the price level but no lasting effect on inflation; that economic liberalization broadly defined may have helped dampen price increases; and that monetary expansion has been the fundamental determinant of inflation in the region. The paper also finds that the intensity of liberalization has been related to geographic proximity to market economies, {{to the size of}} the underground economy, and to the degree of political freedom. ...|$|R
40|$|Price {{controls}} often {{focus on}} commodities that are storable and {{can thus be}} used in intertemporal speculation. Second, opposition to dismantling of controls is often based on claims of low supply response, and greatly bolstered if a strong supply response fails to materialise. This is especially relevant in Eastern Europe, where experience with markets is limited. We show the difficulties that these two factors create for gradual <b>decontrol</b> of <b>prices.</b> We endogenise {{the probability of a}} collapse of the reform programme and show that such endogeneity in the presence of intertemporal speculation leads to a strong case against gradualism. The smaller the initial price increase, the lower the observed supply elasticity and the greater the probability that the programme of reform will be abandoned. This implies that the policy that makes most sense from a microeconomic point of view (decontrol immediately) is also advisable from a macroeconomic point of view. Credibility problems, which are {{at the core of the}} transitional output losses that characterise most stabilisation programmes, will be much less under a cold turkey approach and so will therefore transitional unemployment...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} tax system in China, where reforms {{designed}} to move the economic system toward a market economy have been occurring {{for more than a}} decade. The authors characterize the comprehensive changes in {{the tax system}} that could be undertaken in the presence of system-wide reform, especially of prices and enterprises, as well as of more moderate reforms that must suffice in the absence of reforms elsewhere in the economic system. In connection with tax reform per se, they emphasize {{that it is possible to}} simplify significantly the rate structure for indirect taxes in the presence of price controls, but a unified rate for value-added tax is undesirable without full <b>decontrol</b> of <b>prices.</b> They also found that the state's role as owner of enterprises must be treated separately from its role as tax collector. All enterprises should pay statutory profits taxes. Negotiation (of the kind that characterizes the contract responsibility system) should be confined to the payments to government from after-tax profits. Those payments could be set to balance incentives to enterprises with the need for the state to earn a return on assets historically provided free to those enterprises. The mode of analysis developed in this paper can be applied to a wider range of economies - whether emerging from a socialist past or not - that are progressing at varying speeds in the interlinked areas of tax reform, price reform, and enterprise reform.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} world markets, trade {{liberalisation}} and <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> have left smallholder farmers {{more vulnerable to}} the vagaries of market forces. Constraints such as poor technology, weak organisational structures and high transaction costs due to long and inefficient supply chain means that smallholders cannot compete with large corporations. Collective action which has been successfully applied within natural resources management if properly institutionalised among smallholder farmers can improve their marketing in a number of ways. It can reduce transaction costs of taking produce to the market; increase the smallholders’ bargaining power and enable them to access services that private sector or government are not readily willing to investigate. This paper uses the Sub Saharan Africa Challenge Programme panel data to investigate enabling factors for collective marketing. Based on these factors the paper discusses how Integrated Agriculture Research for Development (IAR 4 D) can be fashioned to improve upon collective marketing among smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} a {{regulated}} industry undergoing rapid change. For {{the first time in}} its history, following the partial <b>decontrol</b> of field <b>prices</b> in 1978, natural gas is being priced at a level which places it in direct competition with competing fuels, chiefly oil. This change is placing considerable stress on the established institutional relationships in the gas industry and is the source of what has been and will continue to be a protracted public policy debate on the subject. It is the chief purpose of this study to interpret the effect of this change on the gas pipeline segment of the industry and its regulation. A second purpose is to explore the use of information from the capital market's valuation of natural gas pipeline securities, both as a means of characterizing the industry transition in the terms of financial economics and of evaluating the financial performance of the pipelines (and thus indirectly their regulators) during the transition. As such, the continuing <b>decontrol</b> of field <b>prices</b> constitutes a convenient "natural experiment" that allows us to characterize the likely nature of the gas industry of the future and ultimately to evaluate the various proposals for changing it. To accomplish these purposes, the study is divided into five parts. After describing the principal structural characteristics, transactional arrangements and regulatory procedures in the industry, the study investigates the origins and historical evolution of these features. This history is important in establishing the role of natural gas field price and pipeline regulatory policy and market conditions in determining the nature of the transactional arrangements prevalent today in the industry. This section closes with some conventional measures of the extent of the post- 1978 transition and the disequilibrium that now exists between gas market conditions, regulatory policy and industry transactional arrangments. In the next two chapters the tools of modern financial economics are used to characterize the effects of the industry transition on the systematic risk borne by gas pipeline industry investors. A significant secular increase in pipeline industry risk is found to persist during the transition period after 1978, an increase that is found to be directly associated with the partial <b>decontrol</b> of field <b>prices.</b> Other sources of risk are examined including what is termed "contractual leverage" [...] the leverage induced by rigid pipeline contractual relationships. These results are used to evaluate pipeline financial (and thus regulatory) performance during the transition. A significant deterioration in gas pipeline profitability is detected during this period. The study closes with an examination of the industry's transactional arrangements as they serve to allocate these risks under regulatory service obligations. It is observed that the current regulatory regime ratifies the longstanding transactional arrangements which bundle rights to gas reserves with rights to pipeline capacity. A substantial exogenous change in the risk conditions in the industry may require a regulatory regime which allows for more flexibility in gas supply transactions. It is suggested that to achieve this flexibility it may be necessary to unbundle the two types of rights, allowing a separate, unregulated market for gas reserves and production to form. This could lead to the formation of a liquid spot and futures market for gas, with consequential informational advantages for the rest of the market. This unbundling might be achieved with pipeline deregulation or a system of common carriage, the feasibility of which is examined in a preliminary manner. Supported by the U. S. Department of Energy.

40|$|During the {{transition}} from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, many countries seem to have experienced some degree of macroeconomic instability. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon.

On the other hand, the study shows that without hardening enterprise budget constraints, wage and <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> tends to destablize the economy and may lead to persistent budget deficits and inflation.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the effects on real income and the price level of the 1973 - 1974 oil price {{increase}} are quite ambiguous on both theoretical and empirical grounds. The theoretical analysis reviews standard results and extends them to analyze the steady-state equilibrium and endogenous monetary policy reaction functions. It is shown that standard models and parameter values imply trivial reductions in real income and ambiguously signed changes in the price level. It is noted, however, that other special models can rationalize empirical findings of large effects. Direct real- oil-price effects in an extended Barro-Lucas real income equation are estimated for eight countries. Although statistically significant and substantial direct effects are found for about half the countries, {{it is noted that}} these coincided with countries undergoing <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> during 1973 - 1974.

40|$|As {{the supply}} of natural gas {{continues}} to dwindle, and government <b>decontrol</b> of <b>pricing</b> progresses, {{the rising cost of}} this essential natural resource will drive more individuals to consider various forms of pilferage as a way of reducing their financial burden. Today, according to numerous gas utilities, significant revenues are being lost via theft of service, losses which are ultimately passed on to the businesses' honest customers. A method to detect such thievery developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Consolidated Edison of New York, was the design of a secondary flow metering device. Located outside a suspected concern, and placed within the small confines of a modified valve or pipe structure, its function is to act as a cross reference for the existing positive displacement meter. The concept chosen was the phenomena of vortex shedding, a fluid oscillatory instability which is used extensively as a measuruing technique in the process control industry. Feasibility studies were carried out using a flat, non-moving bluff shedding element and a piezo-electric bimorph ceramic cantilevered behind it. Both elements were situated within a curb valve based prototype design having a test section inner diameter of one inch. As predicted, experiments demonstrate a repeatable, linear relationship between frequency of oscillation and volume flow for flow rates between 200 and 1000 CFH. A requirement of less than one inch of water column pressure drop across the test section was also achieved. The output signal of the bimorph varied from millivolts to several volts throughout the same specified flow range. In addition, the oscillations may be simply counted to yield and integration of the total volume delivered. The success of the concept suggests that a Phase II program, in which the laboratory design is incorporated into a device suitable for rigorous field tests by the utility, should be pursued...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This paper {{develops}} extensive new indices of legal independence (central bank independence (CBI)) for new central banks (CBs) in 26 former socialist economies. The indices reveal that CB {{reform in the}} FSE during the 1990 s has been quite ambitious. In spite of large price shocks, reformers in those countries chose to create CBs with levels of legal independence that are substantially higher, on average, than those of developed economies during the 1980 s. The evidence in the paper shows that CBI is unrelated to inflation {{during the early stages}} of liberalization. But for sufficiently high and sustained levels of liberalization, and controlling for other variables, legal CBI and inflation are significantly and negatively related. These findings are consistent with the view that even high CBI cannot contain the initial powerful inflationary impact of <b>price</b> <b>decontrols.</b> But once the process of liberalization has gathered sufficient momentum legal independence becomes effective in reducing inflation. The paper also presents evidence on factors that affect the choice of CBI and examines the relation between inflation and CBI in a broader sample. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
