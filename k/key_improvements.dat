25|$|Meehan {{introduced}} legislation, {{titled the}} 'Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013' (CIRDA), that passed {{the subcommittee on}} Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies in 2013. The bill aims to make <b>key</b> <b>improvements</b> in security for important infrastructure. The measure calls for expansion {{in research and development}} for security technology as well as implementing a new strategy in dealing with cyber threats that the Department of Homeland Security faces. This bill would also streamline sharing of these technologies to many other branches of government, thus making them more secure as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>key</b> <b>improvement</b> was {{the fitting}} of tablet {{exchangers}} to No. 552 and 570 for non-stop running on single-track {{sections of the}} North-eastern line, a portent of improvements on this line that would eventually lead to the non-stop Melbourne-Albury Spirit of Progress service of 1937.|$|R
50|$|The <b>key</b> <b>improvement</b> in ZMODEM was the {{introduction}} of sliding window support for improved performance. Generally, file transfer protocols break down a file {{into a series of}} packets, and then send them one-at-a-time to the receiver. Each packet is sent with a checksum {{that can be used to}} determine if the packet was received correctly. If the packet is received correctly an ACK message is sent and the sender then starts sending the next packet.|$|R
500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed opinions from critics. Rick Sanchez of IGN felt {{disappointed with}} the game's visuals, opining that its graphics had not changed since he had played it at E3 2001. Sanchez stated that the game looked like an [...] "early first generation PS2 game", and asserted that had it been released a year from writing his review, the graphics would not have looked as dated. Louis Bedigan from GameZone praised the game's attention to detail, stating that the game's visuals had improved by [...] "110%" [...] since Wipeout 3 and thought {{a lot of time}} was put into Wipeout Fusions graphics, resulting in [...] "something truly extraordinary". John Kauderer of GameSpy praised the game's <b>key</b> <b>improvements</b> over its predecessor – in particular its cutting edge graphic design, stating that it [...] "sets [...] worlds apart from the tired side scrollers and kiddy characters that populated the 16-bit systems". A reviewer from GamePro enjoyed the game's [...] "slickly renovated" [...] graphics. Ryan Davis of GameSpot criticised the game's visuals, asserting that although the track designs appear more [...] "flamboyant" [...] over Wipeout 2097, the game [...] "keeps its visual flash to a minimum". Additionally, Davis also expressed disappointment in the lack of awe-inspiring tracks, as well as the game's occasional slowdown and graphical pop-up issues. In contrast, Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer considered that Wipeout Fusions only improvement from its predecessors was its improved graphics engine.|$|E

2500|$|The 2013 {{model year}} Leaf {{destined for the}} U.S. market has several <b>key</b> <b>improvements</b> similar to the Japanese version, better range, faster {{charging}} capabilities, a more efficient cabin heater, and a lower starting price. According to Nissan USA, several of the changes seek to address shortcomings of previous versions of the Leaf, and feedback from Leaf owners was taken into consideration. The 2013 model year Leaf delivers a higher range than the 2012 model with the same [...] battery pack. The efficiency gains come {{from a combination of}} improvements to aerodynamics through tweaks to the front fascia that allowed a reduction of the drag coefficient; a more efficient heater; the addition of a driver-selected B-mode that increases regenerative braking; and energy/range management.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Depression of the 1930s struck Birmingham {{particularly}} hard, as {{the sources}} of capital fueling the city's growth rapidly dried {{up at the same}} time farm laborers, driven off the land, made their way to the city in search of work. Hundreds poured into the city, many riding in empty boxcars. [...] "Hobo jungles" [...] were established in Boyles, the Twenty-fourth Street Viaduct, Green Springs Bridge, East Thomas, Pratt City Carbon Hill and Jasper. In 1934, President Roosevelt called Birmingham the [...] "worst-hit town in the country." [...] New Deal programs put many city residents to work in WPA and CCC programs, and they made important contributions to the city's infrastructure and artistic legacy, including such <b>key</b> <b>improvements</b> as Vulcan's tower and the Oak Mountain State Park.|$|E

40|$|An {{open issue}} in {{industry}} is software reuse {{in the context}} of large scale Agile product development. The speed offered by agile practices is needed to hit the market, while reuse is needed for long-term productivity, efficiency, and profit. The paper presents an empirical investigation of factors influencing speed and reuse in three large product developing organizations seeking to implement Agile practices. The paper identifies, through a multiple case study with 3 organizations, 114 business-, process-, organizational-, architecture-, knowledge- and communication factors with positive or negative influences on reuse, speed or both. Contributions are a categorized inventory of influencing factors, a display for organizing factors for the purpose of process improvement work, and a list of <b>key</b> <b>improvement</b> areas to address when implementing reuse in organizations striving to become more Agile. Categories identified include good factors with positive influences on reuse or speed, harmful factors with negative influences, and complex factors involving inverse or ambiguous relationships. <b>Key</b> <b>improvement</b> areas in the studied organizations are intra-organizational communication practices, reuse awareness and practices, architectural integration and variability management. Results are intended to support process improvement work in the direction of Agile product development. Feedback on results from the studied organizations has been that the inventory captures current situations, and is useful for software process improvement work...|$|R
30|$|The main {{drawback}} of how {{the tool}} is applied in this paper is that data on tons was combined with assumed average distances. Hence, a <b>key</b> <b>improvement</b> would be to directly use ton-kilometers data instead of ‘derived’ ton-kilometers data. If for example such data were available on the EU Member State level, comparisons between countries would be possible. 10 However, because the stated aim {{of this paper is}} to illustrate and explain the tool and its usability, the use of derived ton-kilometre data is deemed to be but a minor drawback.|$|R

5000|$|After reading early {{reports of}} Daguerre's invention, Henry Fox Talbot, who {{had succeeded in}} {{creating}} stabilized photographic negatives on paper in 1835, worked on perfecting his own process. In early 1839, he acquired a <b>key</b> <b>improvement,</b> an effective fixer, from his friend John Herschel, a polymath scientist who had previously shown that hyposulfite of soda (commonly called [...] "hypo" [...] and now known formally as sodium thiosulfate) would dissolve silver salts. News of this solvent also benefited Daguerre, who soon adopted it as a more efficient alternative to his original hot salt water method.|$|R
5000|$|However, the <b>key</b> <b>improvement</b> over {{conventional}} suspension is {{that the}} front/rear interconnection allows the vehicle to be stiffer in roll than in pitch. Hence {{it is possible to}} design a compliant suspension - giving a comfortable ride - without suffering a penalty in terms of excessive roll when cornering. In roll, there is no transference of fluid from the displacers, and hence its internal pressure rises. The only [...] "give" [...] in the suspension occurs because of the inherent flexibility of the rubber springs. These are naturally stiff.|$|R

The experimentally-inferred results are then used as inputs for an improved version of one of the most common supercapacitor RC-circuit models. The <b>key</b> <b>improvement</b> concerns the accurate modeling of the redistribution phenomenon of the supercapacitor residual charge during charging/discharging and relaxation phases. The accuracy of the obtained model has been experimentally validated. Preliminary physical investigations concerning the temperature effects on the SC dynamic behavior are also presented and discussed.
