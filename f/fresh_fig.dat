In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment {{for the next generation of}} wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit, and has led to a coevolutionary relationship. Technically, a fig fruit proper would be only one of the many tiny matured, seed-bearing gynoecia found inside one fig - if you cut open a <b>fresh</b> <b>fig,</b> individual fruit will appear as fleshy [...] "threads", each bearing a single seed inside.

50|$|Nonda's {{first major}} show was in 1952 at the Parnassus Gallery in Athens. He {{exhibited}} {{a series of}} explicit nudes, violent, and highly erotic, crammed with images of Paris and its more liberated women, {{as well as the}} series of Femmes Chapeautées which would be shown the same year at the Zaharias gallery. The Parnassus show generated an immediate scandal. Alongside the academic early work and the expressive cardboard models of Montmartre tenements, he hung a series of huge canvases depicting the end of love and youth, the sexual perversion of the misogynist, lesbian orgies, and the frightening satyr-lover figure which he used to portray himself. The largest works were over three meters tall, executed on canvas in bold oil and completely dominated the space. Interspersed were the smaller nudes in plaster frames. The opening was so shocking to certain Athenians that the police, urged by the board of directors at the Parnassus venue, immediately ordered the show closed and padlocked the doors. The charge was “offense of public decency”. Like Modigliani’s first one-man show in Paris, it had reached the classic impasse, the clash of a conservative authority with an independent and free thinking artist. In a sarcastic and historically loaded gesture, he collected an armful of <b>fresh</b> <b>fig</b> leaves from the suburbs and pinned a leaf over the genitalia of each of the figures. Others, considered even more offensive, were veiled with black curtains. With this new, somewhat comic amendment, the show reopened and as one would expect, the scandal generated a huge amount of attention by creating one of the first real censorship issues for a Greek artist in the Post war period. The event was unprecedented in Athens, and the images, as well as the artist’s response, captured the interest of the city. Here was a young artist reported to have made great advances in Paris, and commanded the respect of more traditional artists such as Galanis and Vikatos, but with his first real show had managed to scandalize the city with art that was deemed by many to be dangerous, pornographic and “degenerate.” Thousands of viewers stood in lines that circled the block on Christou Lada Street to see the infamous nudes and the renaissance style “cover up”. Even the controversial King Constantine and Queen Frederika paid a special visit to the show to view the paintings. The Athenian newspapers were polarized on this issue of censorship and crammed with vitriolic letters by academics and other well known poets and writers as a drawn out debate concerning the art in question commenced. In an open letter published in the national paper Nonda writes, “…my soul is filled with bitterness because I have found “Art on the Run” in the proverbial “City of Art and Culture”, I raise protest against the cultural and artistic circles in Athens.” Interestingly, Spiros Vikatos, his former teacher in the Academy, stood by the young painter’s work and supported him against the attacks, as did other more progressive artists and writers such as the novelist Stratis Mirivilis, who wrote a heavily satiric article about the censors in the leading Athens newspaper. These first shows in Athens, although scandalous, had also received rave reviews. There were articles in the all the national Greek newspapers praising the remarkable Greek painter who was to “triumph in Paris” but the fiasco concerning his allegedly pornographic art {{was the beginning of a}} troubled relationship with the city of his birth. Nonda was to prove difficult for the Athenian circles.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways that people continue to consume fig fruits today. The most common forms of consumption are either dried, sliced, and then eaten, or dried and then made into a sticky paste which can then {{be used in a}} variety of different products. This is mostly because it is extremely hard to keep <b>fresh</b> <b>figs,</b> as they spoil within a very short amount of time. So, more often than not, if figs are to be consumed fresh then they must be eaten in the place which they are grown because they are unable to make the journey of exportation. It is for this reason that, for most of their history, around 95% of all the figs produced in the world were destined to be dried. However, despite the difficulties that they pose, the demand for <b>fresh</b> <b>figs</b> has recently greatly increased. From 2002 to 2006, the demand for <b>fresh</b> <b>figs</b> increased four-fold. Besides dried or <b>fresh,</b> <b>figs</b> are also sometimes canned and used in pastries and, although it is not commonly known, they can even be fermented and distilled into alcohol.

Vibration often causes some damages to perishable fruits in transportation and reduces their quality. The fruit injury due to vibration is related to the transportation characteristics of vehicles, packaging boxes and the conditions of the roads. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of packaging box by different materials to decrease the damages of vertical vibration on the quality of three <b>fresh</b> <b>fig</b> varieties (Yediveren, Sarilop and Bursa Black) during transportation.

Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was applied. Results demonstrate that intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of fig are not the key drivers of liking, contrarily the sensory attributes are. Sensory qualities of fruit are the main drivers for purchasing. Consumers’ acceptance after 7 days of storage was good.

Figs were packed under passive MAP, active MAPs including low (10 % O 2 + 20 % CO 2) and high oxygen (70 % O 2 + 20 % CO 2) using polypropylene trays sealed with biaxial oriented polypropylene film. Physical (external and internal color, texture, and weight loss), chemical (brix, pH, acidity) and sensory analysis were conducted during storage at 4 C for 25 days. The fresh figs packaged under passive and low oxygen active atmospheres had brighter inner and outer colors comparison to those packaged in a modified atmosphere with high oxygen level. Although figs under high oxygen appeared to have lower firmness values comparing to other MAPs, there were no significant difference observed between applications. The weight loss was less than 1 % for all MAP applications at the end of storage. In general, chemical parameters did not change much by MAP and storage. Considering the sensory, physical and chemical qualities, fresh figs had a commercial shelf-life of 15 days at air and low oxygen applications at 4 °C.

This study examined and monitored the quality parameters to determine the shelf life of fresh figs under refrigerated Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) conditions. The treatments evaluated were: MAP 1 (80 % CO 2, 20 %N 2, 0. 0 % O 2); MAP 2 tray (20 % CO 2, 80 %N 2, 0. 0 % O 2); MAP 3 tray (20 % CO 2, 70 % N 2, 10 % O 2); control tray treatment (with normal air); and unwrapped cardboard box. The fruit quality attributes such as decay, fruit size, external color, firmness, weight loss, water activity, water content of figs fruits and total soluble solids were measured during storage at 4 °C for more than 42 days. Modified atmosphere packaging with 20 % CO 2 was successful in reducing the rate of ripening process while the control treatment figs showed signs of ripening development such as significant weight loss and change in figs color. However, the decay incidence was reduced and delayed by all the MAP treatments. The weight loss was less than 1 % for all the MAP treatments {{at the end of}} storage.

40|$|Background and Aims: We {{examined}} {{whether a}} sensory difference between fresh and frozen berries could be detected using Berry Sensory Assessment (BSA). If no sensory difference was detected, then fresh berries could be frozen and assessed later, thus reducing {{the problem of}} palate fatigue for assessors. Methods and Results: Twenty-five sensory attributes of fresh and frozen Shiraz berries were evaluated by Descriptive Analysis at three times of harvest, ‘before harvest’, ‘harvest’ and ‘after harvest’. In addition total soluble solids (TSS), pH, titratable acidity (TA) and berry mass were measured for all berry samples. Five sensory attributes were consistently different at the three times of harvest – pulp sweetness, pulp <b>fresh</b> <b>fig</b> flavour, skin colour extraction, skin bitterness and seed astringency. Frozen berries were characterised by having pulp sweetness, pulp fresh ripe fig flavour and seed astringency {{higher than that of}} fresh berries. Whereas fresh berries had skin colour extraction and bitterness higher than that of frozen samples, freezing did not affect TSS, but pH in frozen berries was higher than that in fresh berries at each harvest. Titratable acidity was lower in frozen berries at harvest and at after harvest. Freezing reduced berry mass before harvest and at each harvest compared with that of fresh berries. Conclusions: Shiraz berries that are frozen and thawed have a sensory profile different to that of fresh berries. Time of harvest affects the sensory attributes of Shiraz berries, whether they have been frozen or assessed when fresh. Significance of the Study: Freezing and thawing affect grape berry sensory attributes as assessed by BSA and berry composition and, therefore, comparing results from frozen and fresh berries may not be valid. Further work is required to determine the effect of freezing temperature, storage period and thawing procedureS. M. Olarte Mantilla, C. Collins, P. G. Iland, C. M. Kidman, C. Jordans and S. E. P.

40|$|Berry sensory {{assessment}} (BSA) is {{a technique}} that can help grapegrowers and winemakers make decisions about harvest date and grape product allocation. BSA as a structured technique {{has been used by}} grapegrowers, winemakers and researchers for the last thirteen years. However the number of studies reporting results of the effect of viticultural practices on berry sensory characteristics and wine quality is limited. This thesis examined the BSA technique through four different studies. Study one is a combined review literature review and industry survey paper in which the methodology of Berry Sensory Assessment is presented and the research conducted using BSA is discussed. It also presents the results of a survey channeled to Australian grapegrowers and Australian and New Zealand winemakers about their experience using BSA, their perceptions on its use and their suggestions for improving the methodology. It was evident from the survey that 90 % of grapegrowers and winemakers use BSA and they want to understand the link between BSA and wine quality. These results demonstrated the importance of BSA for wine producers and the need for further improvement. The aim of study number two was to determine if berry sensory attributes and berry compositional variables could predict wine sensory attributes, wine compositional variables and wine quality in Shiraz. The analyses of berry and wine sensory attributes, compositional measures and wine quality using partial least squares regression and Pearson’s correlations from two seasons identified several relationships between berry sensory attributes and wine sensory attributes and quality. A significant negative relationship was identified between seed bitterness and wine savoury spice flavour for the two seasons. The berry sensory attribute pulp detachment from the skin was identified as a predictor of various wine sensory attributes (eg. the harder to detach skin from the pulp the higher intensity for wine body colour, rim colour and dark berry aroma) and wine quality scores in the season 2011. The aim of study number three was to determine if berries stored at - 20 °C for three months could be used instead of fresh berries to conduct BSA. Being able to conduct BSA on frozen berries could help to reduce sensory fatigue in assessors by allowing them to evaluate samples over a longer time period and to schedule BSA away from the busy harvest period. The results of this study determined that sensory profile from Shiraz berries differed in five sensory attributes – pulp sweetness, pulp <b>fresh</b> <b>fig</b> flavour, skin colour extraction, skin bitterness and seed astringency - between fresh and frozen berries at three times of harvest, preventing the evaluation of these five sensory attributes in Shiraz frozen berries. Study number four aimed to determine the effect of three rootstocks on sensory and compositional differences of Shiraz grapes and wines in comparison to a nongrafted control. The trial was conducted over two seasons. Berry and wine sensory and compositional {{differences were found between the}} grafted treatments and the nongrafted control. PCA was able to discriminate the wines from the four treatments in three groups of aroma compounds (acetate esters, ethyl esters and higher alcohols) in both seasons. The results of wine quality scores from two seasons showed that the un-grafted treatment had the lowest quality and 110 Richter and Schwarzmann the highest. The findings from this study identified relationships between the sensory and compositional variables in berries and wines that are affecting wine quality. It also showed that that the use of rootstocks has an impact on berry and wine sensory and compositional characteristics. Thesis (Ph. D.)

This paper reports {{for the first time}} the volatile composition of this typical Italian fig, in comparison to Turkish dried figs of the cultivar Smirne, and Greek dried figs of the cultivars Evia and Kalamata. 73 volatile compounds were identified and semi-quantified by SPME-GC/MS. The most represented chemical classes were alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes and furans. Ethanol, isopentyl alcohol, isopentyl alcohol acetate, ethyl acetate, 3 -mehtylbutanal, hexanal and benzaldehyde were the most abundant compounds. A clear distinction was obtained by applying PCA on volatile dataset among figs from different origins and some marked differences were found in the distribution of volatile compounds by chemical classes. The thermal treatment applied to sun-dried Cilento figs caused significant changes in figs aroma profile. Fig pollination could be a significant factor in determining the aroma composition of fruits. PDO Cilento figs resulted clearly distinguishable from other dried figs. Their aromatic pattern seems to be strongly influenced by the thermal treatment during production. Dried Turkish and Greek figs cultivar Kalamata showed similar volatile profile. <b>Fresh</b> and dried <b>figs</b> are important components of the Mediterranean diet. In this paper we report the characterization of the phenolic compounds in 19 <b>fig</b> samples: 9 <b>fresh</b> <b>figs</b> belonging to the cultivar “Dottato” from Cilento (Italy), 10 dried fig samples from Cilento (2), Turkey (6), and Greece (2).

The Tabernae opened onto the Via delli Augustali and were not connected to the interior of the Macellum. The east wall and western portions of the north wall are of opus incertum to a height of 1.35 m, above which they consist of limestone and tuff. Above the stores there would have been attics in which butcher's assistants and other staff lived. A wooden gallery ran in front of the attics.
