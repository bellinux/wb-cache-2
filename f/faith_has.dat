The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his <b>faith</b> <b>has</b> not been lost, but simply tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Æthelburg's {{marriage}} being dependent on Edwin {{allowing her to}} practice her <b>faith</b> <b>has</b> been questioned, since revising the chronology makes it likely, though not certain, that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald's conversion. In this view, {{it would have been}} the church that objected to the marriage, and Æthelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald's conversion. The story of Paulinus's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which is after the latest possible date for Æthelburg's marriage. However, it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.|$|E

25|$|Among non Christians, the Bahai <b>Faith</b> <b>has</b> {{a strong}} standing. There are also {{approximately}} 4,000 Muslims in the country.

25|$|There {{have also}} been claims that the Bábí {{movement}} was started by the British, and that the Bahá'í <b>Faith</b> <b>has</b> ties to British imperialism; the connection to the British, however, has also been supported by false evidence. Firaydun Adamiyyat, in a biography on Nasser-al-Din Shah's first Prime Minister Amir Kabir, stated that Mulla Husayn, the Báb's first disciple, was really a British agent who was recruited by Arthur Conolly, a British intelligence officer, explorer and writer. Adamiyyat states that the evidence of such an accusation appears in Conolly's book Journey to the North of India Overland from England through Russia, Persia, and Affghaunistaun, but no mention of Mulla Husayn or the Báb appears in the book. In later editions of Adamiyyat's biography on Amir Kabir, the fabrication has been removed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{then other}} {{examples}} of this pattern of growing respect for cultures has taken hold in specific instances. Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country, in the United States, the Bahá‘í <b>Faith</b> <b>has</b> never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed, in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised the great past of the native peoples. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bahá‘í Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. See Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans. In Papua New Guinea whereas Christian missionaries openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances, the Bahá'ís encouraged their production {{as a form of}} worship. Thus while Nalik Bahá'ís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to kastom.

25|$|Iraqi Kurdistan has a religiously diverse population. The {{dominant}} {{religion is}} Islam, which is professed {{by the majority}} of Iraqi Kurdistan's inhabitants. These include Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen, and Arabs, belonging mostly to the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam. There is also a small number of Shia Feyli Kurds, as well as adherents of Sufi Islam. Christianity is professed by Assyrians and Armenians. Yezidis make up a significant minority, with some 650,000 in 2005, or 560,000 as of 2013, though those numbers decreased following the 2014 crisis in northern Iraq. The Shabaki and Yarsan (Ahl-e Haqq or Kakai) religions number around and 250,000 and 200,000 adherents respectively; these, like Yezidism, are sometimes said {{to be related to the}} pre-Islamic indigenous religion of Kurdistan. More recently the Zoroastrian <b>faith</b> <b>has</b> gained strength among the Kurds in the region, claiming up to 100,000 adherents as of 2015. Zoroastrians were seeking official recognition of their religion as of early 2016. A tiny ethno-religious community of Mandeans also exists within the semi-autonomous region. According to recent reports, there are between 400-730 Jewish families living in the Kurdish region. On October 18, the Kurdistan Regional Government named Sherzad Omar Mamsani, a Kurdish Jew, as the Jewish representative of the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs.|$|E
