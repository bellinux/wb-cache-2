[...] But if an emperor and his subordinates were like fish and water, the empire will have peace. [...] Emperor Gaozu of Han {{was but a}} farmer, but he conquered the empire carrying just a short sword. [...] His foundation was strong, and his descendants ruled for generations, because he had good subordinates. [...] <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not an intelligent ruler, it is fortunate that I have you, Dukes, to save me occasion after occasion.

2500|$|During the Spring and Autumn period (771–479 BC), Duke Xiang of Song, when being {{advised to}} attack enemy Chu forces while the enemy army was fording a river, refused {{and waited for}} the Chu army to form formation. After Xiang lost the battle and was being rebuked by his ministers of war, he responded: [...] "The gentleman does not inflict a second wound, nor does he capture those with gray hair. On campaigns the ancients did not obstruct those in a narrow pass. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> but the remnant of a {{destroyed}} state, I will not drum an attack when the other side has not yet drawn up its ranks." [...] His minister retorted, [...] "My lord does not know battle.

2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E
