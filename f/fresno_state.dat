5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the strong rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as the}} overall sound offense of <b>Fresno</b> <b>State.</b> Most analysts predicted a resounding victory by <b>Fresno</b> <b>State.</b> The point spread favored <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> as 12-point favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks to the play of defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E

5|$|One of {{the keys}} to the game, {{according}} to ESPN.com blogger Matt Fortuna, was to stop the run. Both teams had 1,000+ yard rushers (Zach Line for SMU, Robbie Rouse for <b>Fresno</b> <b>State),</b> but SMU's rush defense (24th in FBS) was better than Fresno State's (73rd in FBS). Many analysts predicted that <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> would emerge victorious, some going as far as to predict a blowout, but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E
5|$|SMU's resounding {{victory was}} {{considered}} an upset, and during the game, the Mustangs set a single-season record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown (8), surpassing the 2011 Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team. Margus Hunt was named the game's Most Valuable Player because of his two-forced fumble, three-sack (including one safety) performance. In total, the Mustangs achieved seven sacks, the most <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> had surrendered in a single game all year. Davante Adams' third-quarter touchdown reception lengthened his streak to eight consecutive games with a touchdown reception, tying a <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> record that was set by Henry Ellard in 1982.|$|E

5|$|SMU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the game and marched down the field on an 8-play, 52-yard drive highlighted by a 37-yard run by quarterback Garrett Gilbert {{to set up a}} 41-yard field goal attempt by Chase Hover which he missed. Fresno State's subsequent drive lasted only two series and ended in a punt. The remainder of the first quarter's drives ended in punts. There were a total of three drives that went three-and-out in the quarter, two by SMU and one by <b>Fresno</b> <b>State.</b>|$|E
5|$|SMU struck {{first in}} the second quarter via a 17-yard rush from Gilbert, their quarterback, to put the Bulldogs up 7-0. Fresno State's ensuing drive started with a first down, but ended when quarterback Derek Carr was sacked by SMU defender Margus Hunt; Hunt forced a fumble that was {{recovered}} by the Mustangs at the <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> 16-yard line. SMU gained only three yards on their drive, but due to their excellent field position, kicker Chase Hover was able to convert a 30-yard field goal making it 10-0.|$|E
5|$|Since SMU had {{received}} the ball to start the game, <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> got possession to start the second half. The first play from scrimmage of the half was a 38-yard pass from Carr to Burse which got the Bulldogs up to the Mustangs' 41-yard line. The drive stalled from there, however, after a six-yard loss on a pass play, a false start penalty, a pass completed for no gain, and an incomplete pass. After a 42-yard punt that was returned for 4 yards, SMU was set up at their 14-yard line. The ensuing drive for SMU showed promise after they got into Bulldog territory, but an interception by Sean Alston returned for 50 yards to the SMU 15 ended any chance of scoring for the Mustangs. <b>Fresno</b> <b>State</b> finally put points on the board after setting up in the red zone; Carr threw a 6-yard pass to Adams making the score 22-7 after Quentin Breshears tacked on the point after. On the ensuing drive, SMU ran 7 plays for 75 yards in 3:20 in a drive that culminated with a 21-yard touchdown pass from Gilbert to Darius Johnson; the drive included a 27-yard rush by Zach Line {{as well as a}} 19-yard pass from Gilbert to Der'rikk Thompson.
