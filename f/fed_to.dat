40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is twofold. First, we {{characterize}} the <b>Fed’s</b> systematic response <b>to</b> technology shocks and its implications for U. S. output, hours and inflation. Second, we evaluate the extent to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary policy rule (including the optimal one) {{in the context of a}} standard business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can be described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across periods in the response of the economy (as well as the <b>Fed’s)</b> <b>to</b> a technology shock. Second, the <b>Fed’s</b> response <b>to</b> a technology shock in the Volcker– Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary policy rule. Third, in the Pre-Volcker period the <b>Fed’s</b> policy tended <b>to</b> overstabilize output at the cost of generating excessive inflation volatility. Our evidence reinforces recent results in the literature suggesting an improvement in the Fed’s performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In most {{previous}} studies, distributed sensor net-works {{are typically}} {{assumed to be}} memory less. In this paper, we consider a distributed sensor network with feedback at both the sensor level {{as well as at}} the fusion center. Specically, we analyze (1) a local feedback system (LFS), where the most recent local decision is <b>fed</b> back <b>to</b> its corresponding local sensor; (2) a local and global feedback system 1 (LGFS 1), where the most recent local decision is <b>fed</b> back <b>to</b> its corresponding local sensor and the most recent global decision is <b>fed</b> back <b>to</b> the fusion center, and (3) a local and global feedback system 2 (LGFS 2), where the most recent global decision is <b>fed</b> back <b>to</b> all the local sensors and to the fusion center in addition to the local decision being <b>fed</b> back <b>to</b> its corresponding local sensor. For all the cases, we derive the decision rule and compare the global probability of error using simulations. We show that in an error-free channel, any form of feedback improves GPE performance relative to no feedback system. However, feeding the global decision back to local sensors not only drains resources but also provides the worst performance among feedback schemes. I...|$|R

5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms.

5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> them by their parents.|$|E
5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} <b>fed</b> <b>to</b> chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
