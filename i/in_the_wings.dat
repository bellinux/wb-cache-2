5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} {{turbojet}} engines buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> close to the fuselage. Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E

5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}}, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world's first {{commercial}} jetliner. Developed and manufactured by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows.

5|$|As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> {{of modern}} birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This {{implies that the}} wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
40|$|The gene extramacrochaetae (emc) encodes a {{non-basic}} Helix-loop-helix (HLH) {{protein that}} interacts and antagonises other basic-HLH proteins. The expression pattern of emc, and the phenotype of lethal emc alleles {{indicate that this}} gene is operative in several developmental processes. Here we study the requirements for emc during cell proliferation and vein differentiation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Mosaic analysis of hypomorphic conditions of emc reveals the tendency of mutant cells to proliferate along the veins as long stripes. Large clones abuting two adjacent veins obliterate the corresponding inter-vein, affecting {{the size and shape}} of <b>the</b> whole <b>wing.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> emc gene participates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control of cell proliferation within inter-vein regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> Similar effects were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> haltere and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leg.

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Selendis is the {{executor}} of the Protoss military {{following the}} reunification of the race. The character is introduced in the novel Twilight and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> of Liberty campaign, where she is played by Cree Summer. Selendis is fiercely loyal to her race's ideals and completely dedicated to her responsibilities. A protégée of Artanis, she considers the dark templar {{to be a threat}} to her heritage but is willing to work beside them. Selendis is particularly eager to reclaim Aiur from the Zerg. Shortly after Artanis cleanses Shakuras of Zerg, Selendis takes part in an expedition to rescue three stranded heroes from Aiur; however, the mission was sabotaged by Ulrezaj, who kills two of the trapped warriors. During this time, Selendis became aware of other Protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, but as it was not believed possible to save them, their existence is kept secret. Later, Selendis commands the defenses of the dark templar archives on Ehlna against attack by Zerg and Ulrezaj, resulting in Ulrezaj's defeat.|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila, decapentaplegic, which {{codes for}} a {{secreted}} signaling molecule, is activated by the Hedgehog signaling pathway at the anteroposterior compartment {{border of the}} two dorsal primordia; <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> and <b>the</b> haltere imaginal discs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> disc, Decapentaplegic and Hedgehog signaling targets are implicated in cell proliferation and cell survival. However, most of their known targets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> disc are not expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> haltere disc due to their repression by the Hox gene Ultrabithorax. The T-box gene optomotor-blind escapes this repression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> haltere disc, and therefore is expressed <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> haltere and <b>wing</b> discs. Optomotor-blind is a major player during wing development and its function has been intensely investigated in this tissue, however, its role in haltere development has not been reported so far. Here we show that Optomotor-blind function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> haltere disc differs from that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> disc. Unlike its role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> Optomotor-blind does not prevent apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> haltere but rather limits growth by repressing several Decapentaplegic and Hedgehog targets involved both in wing proliferation and <b>in</b> modulating <b>the</b> spread of morphogens similar to Ultrabithorax function but without disturbing Ultrabithorax expression...|$|R

5|$|The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N-20 was a semi-tailless {{swept wing}} jet {{similar to the}} U.S. Navy's Vought F7U Cutlass with four engines mounted {{internally}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> fold-out canards to improve its aerodynamics at slow speeds, and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200km/h, a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s. The FFA P-16 was a single-engine straight-wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100aircraft was awarded in 1958, but after the second crash of a pre-production model, the order was canceled. The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy loads, and the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself. In addition, {{by the middle of}} 1958, influenced by NATO concepts, the LVK had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter-air operations. Further, the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic (mobile) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons, for neither of which the P–16was suitable.|$|E

The Ekranoplan is destroyed by RAF Vulcan bombers before it reaches its target. Bond and Scarlett escape through Russia but are pursued by Chagrin, whom Bond finally kills on a train. Later Gorner meets him on a boat and tries to shoot him, but Bond pushes him overboard, where he is torn to pieces by a propeller. With the subsequent elimination of both Chagrin and Gorner, Bond considers his mission a success, and on condition that the agent M has waiting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> will not take his place Bond is sent to assess the new agent, designated 004.
