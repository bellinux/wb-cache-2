40|$|AbstractProducers {{operating}} on a competitive market seek possibilities for maximization of expected profit by increasing production, especially by non-decreasing returns to scale. Nevertheless, the low growth rate of demand for agri-food products must determine the change of efficiency-based relations in the sector. Therefore, the Authors believe that {{the main source of}} producers’ competitiveness and growth is not the increase of input factors but the efficiency of their use. The competitiveness is based on productivity. The efficiency-focused modeling presented in the paper bases on the production function, more precisely on the SFA method (the Stochastic Frontier Approach), which is appropriate primarily for samples with high randomness. The efficiency assessment is carried out on the basis of data collected from farms across Poland with the predominant plant production within the framework of <b>FADN</b> (<b>Farm</b> Accountancy Data Network).

One of the most important factor of the farm assets is the fixed assets, and as a part of it, the equipment as well. An important factor of the farm asset value is the machinery, which depends on the amount of internal resources of farms and external financial resources i. e. governmental subsidies, bank loans. But, as it could be observed during the 1980 s and 1990 s on the farms of developed countries, the technical development was also a considerable factor of farming.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of the SAPS (Simplified Area Payment Scheme) on rental land values in seven New EU Member States (NMS). Using the <b>FADN</b> <b>farm</b> level panel data with 20, 930 {{observations}} from 2004 and 2005 we are able to control for unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias, which often distort the incidence measures. According to our results, the SAPS has a positive and statistically significant impact on land rents in the NMS. However, the effect is smaller than theoretically predicted. Land rents capture only 0. 19 of the marginal Euro of the SAPS. Taking into account the level of land renting in the NMS, around 10 percent of the total value of SAPS payments benefit non-farming land owners through higher farmland rental prices. Because the share of rented land is higher for corporate than for individual farms, family farms will likely benefit more from the SAPS than corporate farms.

Due to the lack of empirical data the elasticities were set for all activities to unity. Based on total milk production costs of <b>FADN</b> <b>farms,</b> regional supply functions were estimated. The results are used to adjust the marginal cost functions of organic and non-organic dairy cow activities in the model SILAS to the empirically estimated functions. The results show that the marginal cost functions in the sectoral model are in general a bit steeper than in the FADN estimations, when elasticities by the value one are applied. Major differences between organic and non-organic milk production could not be observed. Adjusting the slope of the marginal cost functions to the empirically estimated ones leads to slightly different forecast results. Mainly the number of organic cows is higher in the FADN adjusted scenario than in the reference scenario without any adjustments.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how rising {{agricultural prices}} affect heterogenous farm production {{and access to}} inputs under credit market imperfections in the CEE transition countries. Using the <b>FADN</b> <b>farm</b> level panel data, which contains 37416 observations for 2004 and 2005, we estimate a farm credit constraint equation and find that small individual farms (IF) are more credit constrained that large corporate farms (CF). Using the estimated parameters we simulate the effect of rising input and output prices on production and input use of IF and CF farms. Our results suggest that {{in the presence of}} credit market imperfections, the relatively less credit constrained CF tend to benefit more from higher output prices than IF. Given that farms in transition and developing countries are more credit constrained than farms in developed market economies, raising food prices may actually reduce their profits and income compared to the latter. Hence, not only consumers but also agricultural producers in the developing world may loose from the increasing food prices. Credit constraint, food prices, firm level heterogeneity...|$|R

According to the theoretical results, if subsidies are paid {{at the beginning of}} the growing season they may reduce bank loans, whereas if they are paid at the end of the season they increase bank loans, but these results are conditional on credit constraint and on the relative cost of internal and external financing. In empirical analysis we use the <b>FADN</b> <b>farm</b> level panel data for period 1995 - 2007. We employ the fixed effects and the GMM models to estimate the impact of subsidies on farm loans.

In spite of this fact due to the lacking supply of insurance in the last 20 years the farmers could not contract insurance policies to cover the most important crop damage risks as drought, inland waters and spring frost.
