"Oh, dear, yes," [...] Felix replied, {{holding his}} hand out as he spoke to catch his companion's arm gently, and steady her against the wave that {{was just going to}} strike the stern: [...] "Excuse me; just so; the sea's rising fast, isn't it?--Oh, dear, yes; of course they are; they're all heathen and cannibals. You couldn't imagine to {{yourself}} the horrible bloodthirsty rites that may this very minute be taking place upon that idyllic-looking island, under the soft waving branches of those whispering palm-trees. Why, I knew a man in the Marquesas myself--a hideous old native, as ugly as you can fancy him--who {{was supposed to be a}} god, an incarnate god, and was worshipped accordingly with profound devotion by all the other islanders. You can't picture to yourself how awful their worship was. I daren't even repeat it to you; it was too, too horrible. He lived in a hut by himself among the deepest forest, and human victims used to be brought--well, there, it's too loathsome! Why, see; there's a great light on the island now; a big bonfire or something; don't you make it out? You can tell it by the red glare in the sky overhead." [...] He paused a moment; then he added more slowly, [...] "I shouldn't be surprised if at this very moment, while we're standing here in such perfect security on the deck of a Christian English vessel, some unspeakable and unthinkable heathen orgy mayn't be <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> beside that sacrificial fire; and if some poor trembling native girl isn't being led just now, with blows and curses and awful savage ceremonies, her hands bound behind her back--Oh, look out, Miss Ellis!" ...|$|E

After dinner, the young people separate from the adults to smoke marijuana. Lucy is now able to laugh about Parrish's betrayal, and the group take turns recounting when they each lost their virginity. When the question comes around to Osvaldo, he demurs, saying, [...] "I don't know which is more ridiculous, this conversation or the silly political one <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> the grown-ups' table."

5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeffrey Bell, on {{the decision}} to introduce the character known previously in the MCU only as [...] "the cellist" [...] here, said, [...] "there’s that one line and suddenly it’s who is this person? And what is this person? And {{when are we going}} to see this person? And we talked about it a number of times over the season, and we had different versions and different ideas how to get there....at a time when Coulson's at his most vulnerable, it seemed to be a good choice for us." [...] Concerning the character of Blackout, Bell stated that [...] "He’s the antagonist, in the same way we’ve used other Marvel characters as antagonists in the episodes. At the same time, we’re dealing with the fall-out of what happened with S.H.I.E.L.D., and the viewers finding out about Ward and what’s <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> so there’s a lot going on. Emotionally, he’s perfect. Here’s a character who absorbs light, and one of the things he says to Audrey - which is the title of the episode - he refers to her as “the only light in the darkness.” And his obsession with the cellist is a beautiful metaphor, I think, for who Coulson is to her, who she is to Coulson, who S.H.I.E.L.D. is to the world…and the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. falling apart, and Hydra coming out and darkness speaking, the idea of having Blackout as an antagonist seemed perfect." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{had already}} got my general {{schedule}} that I {{used to get}} up at about maybe two or three {{early in the morning and}} was taking a bath. After that, at about four, there were some services and performances in the holy temple of Sikhism. I used to go there, and some classical music was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> from that holy scripture, Adi Granth, from four to seven. I used to attend to that, and after seven I used to come back home and was taking my breakfast. Then I was going on my duty as a civil engineer in the government and then was going on all day over there. I was coming back, and in the evening after taking food, then some people were there who were coming to me and we were about five or seven persons to have some music, what you call classical music. I was teaching (it) to them and was also teaching them the Adi Granth, what is the meaning of it, (so) that they may go through the meaning of it really, not only relating. This work was going on two hours, and then I was just going to bed or doing some other work which was there. This was my general routine, just as general...From that day after initiation I had a little change in it. I was getting up at the same time and going to the temple and attending over there for about fifteen minutes or twenty minutes. After that, I was coming back to my home and was meditating about three hours daily. My Master had told me that I should meditate for at least two and a half hours, but it was at least two and a half hours (and) not any limit further. I was feeling like meditating at least three hours. What Master had told is a must, but something more should be there that Master may be happy with me that I have done something more than he asked for. Then I was finding some things inside, and after about four or six months I was really having full confirmation that, [...] "What I have found, it is there, it is my permanent acquisition. There is nothing (that) it is some kind of illusion or delusion at higher levels of mesmerism or hypnotism. It is something much beyond, much beyond that." [...] When I was really confident about it, then I declared it.|$|E
