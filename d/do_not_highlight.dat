These efforts to incorporate culture typically focus on client culture, but provider views of culture can also influence the provision of services.

Although some providers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> cultural issues, others conceptualize cul-ture in terms of (a) generalized Hispanic cultural attributes, (b) male-dominant gender roles, and (c) the culture of poverty.

The use of anatomical information that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> scar tissue (e.g. HRCT or MR reconstructions where the lesion-to-LV contrast is absent) is not worth the effort and the extra radiation burden for the patient, particularly for lesion detection.

40|$|Open Innovation (01) is a 'hot' {{topic in}} the field of innovation. Based on a bibliometric analysis, we found that most of the {{existing}} studies on 01 are conceptual in nature. In the few empirical studies available, the issue of University-Enterprise relations - one of the components of the open innovation model is analyzed in a relatively superficial manner that neglects the mechanisms by which companies could obtain competitive advantage by following a more open model of innovation based on relationships with universities. Moreover, the existing studies on U-E relations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight,</b> at least explicitly, the question of the open innovation model. Such studies are still highly focused on a unidirectional profit perspective, and are excessively centered on the advantages enterprises are able to obtain from relations with universities, failing {{to take into account the}} value that potentially goes to universities from such links...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for representing speaker characteristics {{present in the}} speech signal, by the way of aleemphasizing the linguistic content of the signal. Cepstral coefficients that are widely employed as features for automatic speaker recognition task, contain considerable speech information {{in addition to the}} speaker information, and hence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> the latter. The proposed method is based on using the difference between all-pole spectra due to higher order and lower order of linear prediction analysis. Distribution of the feature vectors in the multi-dimensional feature space is captured by employing autoassociative neural network models. A speaker recognition system is developed using the proposed method of feature extraction, whose performance is evaluated against that of the system based on cepstral coefficients. The complementary nature of evidence due to the proposed feature is also examined, so as to improve the overall system performance...|$|E

40|$|We draw {{attention}} to the fact that a Hermitian matrix is always diagonalizable and has real discrete spectrum whereas the Hermitian Schrödinger Hamiltonian: H=p^ 2 / 2 μ+V(x), may not be so. For instance when V(x) =x, x^ 3, -x^ 2, H does not have even one real discrete eigenvalue. Textbooks <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> this distinction. However, if H has real discrete spectrum, by virtue of the expansion theorem, one can convert the eigenvalue problem Hψ_n=E_n ψ_n into a matrix and get eigenvalues E_n by diagonalizing the matrix. We show, that the thus obtained E_n could be accurate, provided H is devoid of scattering states. We suggest that this could be a simple and apt way to introduce the method of Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) for finding the spectra of molecules. In textbooks, usually the method of matrix-diagonalization appears meagerly as a degenerate perturbation theory for more than one dimensions. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures and 1 Tabl...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Pair {{programming}} {{practice has}} been widely used as a peda-gogical approach in educational setting specifically in the programming course. Most pair programming studies agree that this practice can foster knowledge sharing among students. However, the studies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> knowledge sharing during pair programming practices and towards their performance. Therefore, the main {{aim of this study}} is to test the suitability of knowledge sharing activities by using Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization (SECI) model in pair programming prac-tices (PPP) amongst students in higher learning institution. In achieving the main aim, this study involved experimentation in order to test the effective-ness of the SECI model. 202 participants were actively engaged in pair pro-gramming practices, and involved in the experimentation of the study. The findings reveal that there are significant direct effect of Socialization to-wards Externalization, Externalization towards Combination and Combina-tion towards Internalization. However, the direct effect of Internalization towards Performance are not significant. In addition, the direct effect of SECI model for pair programming practices are not significant towards the performance of the students...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} issue of compensation culture and the evidence {{for it in the}} United Kingdom. Insight into the relationship between Tort Law and Insurance finds that the role of insurance is largely misinterpreted in the field. Insurance companies have many mechanisms to control behaviour, ensure personal responsibility is upheld, reduce moral hazard and promote risk management. This paper proposes that claims increases might be more evident in areas of compensation that are not subject to insurance. The research highlights the key differences between the personal injury litigation system in the United Kingdom and across the Atlantic. The dissertation tests the projections made by Lowe et al (2002) over the cost of compensation and analyses robust statistical sources. Our findings do not reflect the compensation growth predicted by Lowe et al and the additional sources <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> a situation of escalating claims. On the basis of the evidence this dissertation argues {{that there is not a}} compensation culture in the United Kingdom, but equally highlights the implications of perception. Finally the paper concludes with recommendations and suggestions for further work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper aims to {{test the}} {{suitability}} of some biotic indices for their application in Southeast Caspian Sea.

The results from {{the application of the}} biotic indices <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>highlight</b> a clear distinction between the stations. The results show that two of the indices (AMBI and BENTIX) are very close in terms of diagnosis (good and high) and seem to generally perform better than BOPA. In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on abiotic parameters showed clear spatial and temporal differences in environmental variables. However, at this shallow sites with low human pressure and high water residence times, such benthic community composition can be associated with physical stress due to salinity increase and to changes in environmental characteristics, triggered by conventional seasonal variations. Natural variability of transitional waters is a crucial factor for a correct evaluation of the ecological condition of macroinvertebrate communities across the lagoonal system...|$|E
