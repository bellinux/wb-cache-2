25|$|In 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove's children's book Wheedle on the Needle {{postulated}} a furry creature {{called a}} Wheedle {{who lived on}} top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: There's a Wheedle on the Needle/ <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> what you're thinking/ But if you look up late at night/ You'll see his red nose blinking. The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It even became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, who played in nearby KeyArena (originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Symington {{revealed}} he was {{a witness}} to the Phoenix Lights, a mass UFO sighting that took place on March 13, 1997, a decade before his admission. In an interview with The Daily Courier, Symington stated, [...] "I'm a pilot and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it." [...] He continued, [...] "It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape." [...] As Governor during the Phoenix Lights, Symington stated he would investigate the event, but went on to hold a press conference where he had his chief of staff dress up in an alien costume. He later stated that as a public official he felt a responsibility to avert public panic and therefore made an attempt to introduce some levity into the situation.|$|E

No longer ago than {{yesterday}} noon, my Tom took {{and filled the}} cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--" ...|$|E

60|$|When {{he said it}} was a patois, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> what he meant. It was {{equivalent}} to saying that he couldn't understand it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might make}} it," [...] he mused. [...] "But {{if we did}} not there would be a fearful fight and {{possibly}} slaughter. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> how matters were going at Washington." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, come! There's the Heath, and the City--and {{you must}} join a tennis club. Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> the thing--the club to which Vera belongs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm best {{acquainted with}} the brook," [...] said Mr. Arbuton, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> the eddy in it where the {{champagne}} will cool soonest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{know all}} about it, Talcott, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> about how you feel. But all the same you must go back there to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Comparatively so," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{should feel}} better if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> what {{happened}} to me and to the stock. You might tell me, beginning from the time the fence went down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care much}} about eating, Songbird," [...] was the answer. [...] "But I'll go along and take a bite. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> where Tom had gone. I might {{telegraph}} ahead for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't easy getting down, and I'd {{feel better}} if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> {{how we were going}} back," [...] he said. [...] "I guess it's not quite wise either to bang that can about on the rocks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen patiently to me, dear. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how {{you feel}} about it. I feel the same. But we've always known we would have to move some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{be glad to}} {{have her}} here," [...] was the mother's reply. [...] "Poor dear, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how lonely she feels. Of course you {{said it would be}} all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here! you're {{not going}} to leave this house until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> what you are driving at," [...] roared the lawyer. [...] "I won't have you besmirching my fair name!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the very}} thing! I can't {{get into the}} boys, or prevent their {{thinking}} me a Don. I had hoped there was improvement, but the revelations of the half-year have convinced me that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> nothing at all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This was {{the first}} time that Matthias had ever spoken to me about Judith, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> as well as if he had told me that it was Dorcas Stone's clothes that had got him into that way of thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you say, doctor," [...] cried Mrs. Munger, with {{mounting}} cheerfulness. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> {{how much}} you meant, and how little." [...] She {{moved closer to the}} doctor, and bent a look of candid fondness upon him. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're trying to mystify me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I guess she'd {{live through}} it," [...] said the {{mother with a}} laugh. She added, [...] "I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> {{what you mean by}} the Synthesis of Art Studies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could put}} a whole {{regiment}} of Dicks on my back without making me feel any better. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough to go on in spite of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I think. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> what I feel,--nobody else seems to. Eva used to, {{but she is}} gone!" [...] and Marie lay back on her lounge, and began to sob disconsolately.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh; {{just the}} old story, mother, I suppose. What {{she said was}} what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> as well before I went there. But yet it was {{necessary}} that I should hear {{what she had to}} say;--and as necessary I think that she should hear me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “At {{that moment}} <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> surely and clearly, that I was {{witnessing}} perfection.

6000|$|... "Ditto," [...] {{came from}} Harris. [...] "Will you boys {{see what you}} can offer? I don't like to leave the tiller, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how to get the best speed out of the Searchlight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you want to say," [...] she answered. And she was on the point of adding, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how you will say it;" [...] but these words she kept back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, sir," [...] said Jonas, [...] "if {{you have}} no objection, I'd better go and get the rest. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> where they are, and I can get them all down here before night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{always the}} way," [...] said she, {{as the two}} {{followed}} me round {{the back of the}} house, [...] "when people shut up a house and leave it, to put all the door-keys in the back corner of some drawer in the hall, and to take only the front-door key with them. So, you see, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> where to go for these." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, you've {{been having}} a good cry, <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> like {{to go off and}} have a good cry that way. It makes your eyes red, but you can fix that. Just sit still now and let me see what I can do." ...|$|R
60|$|Mitchell {{cleared the}} ravine by {{a hundred and}} twenty yards. He strolled back to me, and watched Alexander go through his ritual with an indulgent smile. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> how he was feeling. Never does the world seem so sweet and fair and the foibles of our fellow human beings so little irritating as when we have just swatted the pill right on the spot.|$|R
6000|$|Lucius was respectful, but firm. [...] "You {{are very}} well in that, Mrs. Haney. But if I were you I'd have a new gown; you'll need it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> the saleslady to fit you out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Happy to meet you, Mrs. March," [...] {{said the}} Iowan. [...] "Introduce you to Mrs. Otterson. I'm the fool in my family, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> {{how you feel}} about a chance like this. I don't mean that you're--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{so silly}} and weak as you think. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> what I should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares. There's no knowing what may happen, and I {{wished to be}} prepared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is," [...] he said, at length, [...] "a {{good deal}} I can't {{get the hang}} of about the whole affair; but if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> how they came to start the plates that let the water in, I'd have {{something}} to figure on. You can't very well knock holes in an iron steamer's bottom on soft, slimy mud, and <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> where they could have found a rock here if they wanted to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there will}} be some more corn for Mrs. Quack. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> it!" [...] cried Peter. [...] "He is going to see if Mrs. Quack is there, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> he has his pockets full of corn." ...|$|R
