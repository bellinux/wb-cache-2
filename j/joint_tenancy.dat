5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} could spend time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris' life.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{situation}} where a {{presumed resulting trust}} is created is if the court can rebut the presumption of an outright gift. The general philosophy here was set out by James LJ in Fowkes v Pascoe, and is that the judge should base his decision on [...] " [...] story as to how I came to have , and judge that story {{with reference to the}} surrounding facts and circumstances". Where the property is money held in a joint bank account, the presumption {{is that it is a}} <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> of that account. As such, when one dies the property is passed absolutely to the other, as in Marshall v Crutwell. This presumption can be rebutted in several situations. It will be rebutted when the account, while in the name of both the husband and wife, is used exclusively for the husband's personal use, as in Young v Sealey, or where the joint account exists solely so the husband can guarantee the wife's account, as in Anson v Anson. Tax avoidance (which is legal, as opposed to tax evasion) frequently involves transferring property to a family member to avoid tax. Where the family member refuses to transfer it back, the taxpayer can come to court and argue it was a resulting trust.|$|E

50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|E
5000|$|A joint {{co-owner}} may break a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> {{and maintain}} {{an interest in}} the property. Most jurisdictions permit a joint owner to break a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> by the execution of a document to that effect. In those jurisdictions which retain the old common law requirements, an actual exchange with a straw man is required. This requires another person to [...] "buy" [...] the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price. In either case, the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> will revert to a tenancy in common as to that owner's interest in the property.|$|E

50|$|However, in jurisdictions {{which use}} the lien theory, the {{mortgage}} merely places a lien on the property, leaving the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> undisturbed. As a lien {{is not enough}} to terminate a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> if the debtor dies before the creditor sues, the creditor is left with no claim against the property, as the debtor's interest in the property evaporates and automatically vests in the other surviving co-owners.|$|E
50|$|The {{unity of}} time rule {{requires}} a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> be granted both parties at the same time. When the current owner of a property wishes to create a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with another party, the grantor conveys the property to a strawperson (often a lawyer or the lawyer's secretary), who in turn creates a second deed conveying property to the original grantor and their desired joint tenant(s).|$|E
50|$|In many states, tenancy by the {{entireties}} {{is recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that the {{tenancy by the entireties}} designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of tenancy by the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy by the entireties and <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.|$|E

5000|$|If any joint {{co-owner}} {{deals in}} any way with a property inconsistent with a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> that co-owner will be treated as having terminated (sometimes called [...] "breaking") the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> The remaining co-owners maintain joint ownership of the remaining interest. The dealing may be a conveyance or sale of the co-owner's share in the property. The position {{in relation to a}} mortgage is more doubtful (see below). For example, if one of three joint co-owners conveys his or her share in the property to a third party, the third party owns a 1/3 share on a tenancy in common basis, while the other two original joint co-owners continue to hold the remaining 2/3s on a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> basis. This result arises because the [...] "unity of time" [...] is broken: that is, because on the transfer the timing of the new interest is different from the original one. If it is desired to continue to maintain a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> then the three original joint co-owners would need to transfer, in the one instrument, the joint interest to the two remaining joint co-owners and the new joint co-owner.|$|E

50|$|If one joint {{co-owner}} {{takes out}} a mortgage on jointly owned property, in some jurisdictions this may terminate the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> Jurisdictions which use a title theory in this situation treat a mortgage as an actual conveyance of title until the mortgage is repaid, if not permanently. In such jurisdictions, the taking of a mortgage by one owner terminates the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as to that co-owner. There are exceptions, and {{the law in the}} State of Georgia is a notable exception.|$|E

There was no sham. It was established that there must be the four unities present, of possession, interest, title and time, and there was no unity of interest because there was only a several obligation for payment of the rent. That requires the existence of ‘joint rights and joint obligations’.|$|E

Consequently, his or her basis would not be stepped up if the property has appreciated, but instead would remain at the original cost basis.|$|E
