500|$|Scott mugs for {{the camera}} and, during the guitar solo/vocal improvization section, <b>he</b> <b>lights</b> a {{cigarette}} as he duels with Angus with a green mallet. Rudd laughs throughout the performance.

500|$|The Fox Network {{executives}} {{had wanted}} the season premiere to be [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] {{because it was}} an Animal House parody. However, the writers felt that [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] would be a better episode because of George Harrison's involvement. During the episode, Homer sings [...] "I am so smart! S-M-R-T... I mean S-M-A-R-T!" [...] while <b>he</b> <b>lights</b> his high school diploma (and the house) on fire. During the recording session, Dan Castellaneta was singing the song and accidentally misspelled [...] "smart". The writers decided that it was much funnier that way, because it seemed like something Homer Simpson would do, so they left the joke in. The song has since become a fan favorite.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} James Bond {{was introduced}} towards, but not at, {{the beginning of}} the film in a [...] "now-famous nightclub sequence featuring Sylvia Trench", to whom he makes his [...] "immortal introduction". The introduction to the character in Le Cercle at Les Ambassadeurs, an upmarket gambling club, is derived from Bond's introduction in the first novel, Casino Royale, which Fleming had used because [...] "skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen... as attributes of a gentleman". After losing a hand of Chemin de Fer to Bond, Trench asks his name. There is the [...] "most important gesture ... the way <b>he</b> <b>lights</b> his cigarette before giving her the satisfaction of an answer. 'Bond, James Bond'." [...] Once Connery says his line, Monty Norman's Bond theme plays [...] "and creates an indelible link between music and character." [...] In the short scene introducing Bond, there are portrayed [...] "qualities of strength, action, reaction, violence – and this elegant, slightly brutal gambler with the quizzical sneer we see before us who answers a woman when he's good and ready." [...] Raymond Benson, author of the continuation Bond novels, has stated that as the music fades up on the scene, [...] "we have ourselves a piece of classic cinema".|$|E
500|$|Solo {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Andrew Liengard of Jazz Houston stated that Rubalcaba played [...] "at once a pyrotechnical and thunderous two-handed assault, he also demonstrates a profound awareness {{of space and}} dynamics," [...] and finally called the album [...] "stunning". Joey Guerra of Amazon said that Solo [...] "finds Rubalcaba soaring {{on the strength of}} his own talent", creating a [...] "unique experience." [...] Website Allmusic stated that the album is a spellbinding collection of improvisations with [...] "remarkable stylistic display." [...] Harvey Siders of JazzTimes commented that the album did not need elaborate arrangements, being a [...] "spontaneous inner dialogue from a brilliant inquisitive mind" [...] and that on Solo [...] "elegance trumps excitement." [...] PopMatters Robert R. Calder stated that the record was [...] "a very remarkable solo piano recital." [...] David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer [...] "is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work." [...] Miller also suggested that [...] "Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings. He still has time to become a great solo artist, and this writer has every confidence that he will." [...] In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba [...] "finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait for this moment, and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately <b>he</b> <b>lights</b> an inspiring fire." [...] Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdés, asseverating that both performers [...] "blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction." [...] Timothy Sprinkle of Jazz Review declared that the performer [...] "carries the disc with a light, breezy ease that's surprising, especially given all of the slow selections." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christmas {{dinner is}} the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. Аbout noon, or even earlier, the family members {{sit down at the}} table. When the head of {{household}} gives a sign, all rise. <b>He</b> <b>lights</b> a candle, censes his family and house, and prays the Lord's Prayer. After that, the family members kiss each other on the cheek saying, [...] "The peace of God among us, Christ is Born." [...] The head and another man of the family hold the česnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of the loaf. The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the česnica, will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The main course of Christmas dinner is roast pork of the pečenica. During the dinner, the head of household proposes a toast to his family with a glass of wine, several times. A traditional toast from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina goes like this: ...|$|E
