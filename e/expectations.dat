5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on <b>expectations</b> about the future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive <b>expectations,</b> which assumed that <b>expectations</b> {{were based on}} an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational <b>expectations</b> to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive <b>expectations</b> modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational <b>expectations</b> modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational <b>expectations,</b> models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the <b>expectations</b> of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for <b>expectations</b> and how <b>expectations</b> relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
