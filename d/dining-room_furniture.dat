25|$|The Foundation’s current {{collection}} of furniture only includes {{a small part}} of the Villa’s original furniture, given that many of these items were sold at auctions and thus dispersed, prior to acquisition of the property by the Portuguese State. The main exceptions are: the <b>dining-room</b> <b>furniture</b> (repurchased by the Foundation) and the interior architecture equipment (doors, embedded cupboards, doorknobs, bathroom furniture, etc.). During the restoration process of the Villa, overseen by the architect Álvaro Siza, the latter items were preserved with great care. Part of the Villa’s furniture was acquired from leading interior decorators of the period. Several items were brought from the Count’s residence in Biarritz. He also added antiques, which he inherited from the family, thus creating an overall eclectic style. Ruhlmann and Leleu design several items of furniture and Silva Bruhns designed the carpets. Edgar Brandt designed a wrought iron gate of the hall and several wall lamps. Jean Perzel designed the lamps. Other refined aspects of the Villa’s interior decoration include the blue limestone and exotic hardwood floors; the marble-lined bathrooms, with stone-carved bathtubs; the geometric patterns of the plasterwork; and the curved form of the library staircase.|$|E
500|$|Bosse and Strindberg {{were married}} on 6 May 1901. Strindberg insisted that Bosse bring {{none of her}} {{possessions}} to the home he had furnished for her, creating a [...] "setting in which to nurture and dominate her". In this setting, his taste in interior decoration was revealed to be Oscarian and old-fashioned, with pedestals, aspidistras, and <b>dining-room</b> <b>furniture</b> in hideous imitation of German renaissance, to Bosse's modern judgment.|$|E
60|$|Rose Villa {{has once}} again resumed its wonted appearance; the <b>dining-room</b> <b>furniture</b> has been replaced; the tables are as nicely {{polished}} as formerly; the horsehair chairs are ranged against the wall, as regularly as ever; Venetian blinds have been fitted to every window {{in the house to}} intercept the prying gaze of Mrs. Joseph Porter. The subject of theatricals is never mentioned in the Gattleton family, unless, indeed, by Uncle Tom, who cannot refrain from sometimes expressing his surprise and regret at finding that his nephews and nieces appear to have lost the relish they once possessed for the beauties of Shakspeare, and quotations from the works of that immortal bard.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle John did not display this {{discouraging}} {{report to}} Patsy or her father. A little thought {{on the matter}} decided him to rectify the deficiencies, {{in so far as}} it lay in his power. He visited a large establishment making a specialty of [...] "furnishing homes complete," [...] and ordered a new kitchen outfit, including a modern range, a mission style outfit for a <b>dining-room,</b> dainty summer <b>furniture</b> for the five chambers to be occupied by his three nieces, the Major and himself, and a variety of lawn benches, chairs, etc.|$|R
50|$|When the Mondales {{occupied}} the house, Joan Mondale introduced more saturated upholstery and wall colors and contemporary art. Like the Rockefellers, the Mondales brought some Asian antiques into the house. The Bush family, working with interior decorator Mark Hampton, used {{a palette of}} celadon, lime, and light blue. The Quayles removed the lime green and used off-white. The Gores oversaw a complete redecoration, {{the addition of a}} new <b>dining-room</b> table, new <b>furniture</b> for the library, and a substantial renovation of the grounds and porches to make them more suitable for outdoor entertaining. Immediately before the Cheneys moved in, some needed work on the air conditioning and heating was performed and the interiors were repainted. The Cheneys brought several pieces of contemporary art into the house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house of}} Francis Wilson was {{purchased}} {{for use in}} the production and would also be the meeting location of the final details surrounding the release by the members of the Thanhouser Company. The historic Francis Wilson house was known as the [...] "house of mystery" [...] in the production. Lonergan insisted that Thanhouser Company president Charles J. Hite acquire the house for the production, but attempts to rent the house for the production failed after the plans to use the grounds for [...] "balloonists, soldiers and the actors for several months". Hite would provide the $200,000 for its purchase and the house was quickly made ready for the production. In a tour of the house, a Motion Picture News writer declared [...] "is furnished in keeping with the imposing exterior of the mansion. Priceless Persian rugs carpet the entrance hall. In the <b>dining-room</b> heavy carved <b>furniture</b> groan {{under the weight of the}} silver service and in every room on the three floors it is apparent that exceptionally good taste has been used in the selection of the works of art which eventually will be seen in the completed film, [...] "The Million-Dollar Mystery." ...|$|R

"The <b>Dining-room</b> <b>furniture</b> is all HOAK, British Hoak; round igspanding table, like a {{trick in}} a Pantimime, iccommadating any number from 8 to 24--to {{which it is}} my wish to {{restrict}} my parties. Curtings crimsing damask, Chairs crimsing myrocky. Portricks of my favorite great men decorats the wall--namely, the Duke of Wellington. There's four of his Grace. For I've remarked that {{if you wish to}} pass for a man of weight and considdration you should holways praise and quote him. I have a valluble one lickwise of my Queend, and 2 of Prince Halbert--has a Field Martial and halso as a privat Gent. I despise the vulgar SNEARS that are daily hullered aginst that Igsolted Pottentat.

40|$|Design {{optimization}} of seat cushions {{is associated}} with the need to investigate their softness using, for this purpose, various kinds of loading pads. The aim of the investigation was: to determine seat cushion stiffness of a chair selected from a set of <b>dining-room</b> <b>furniture,</b> to determine values and distributions of contact strains on the seat surface caused by loading pad of different hardness, numerical calculation of contact strains between the seat cushion and the loading pad and to verify the results of these calculations with the results of laboratory experiments. The performed tests showed that the assessment of the seat cushion stiffness and the evaluation of contact stresses on their surface should be carried out using an equally stiff loading pad. In numerical calculations, polyurethane foams should be modeled as hyperfoam bodies of σ=f(ε) characteristics determined in an axial compression test. Contact stresses between the seat cushion and the user’s body should be reduced as a result of application of a frictionless connection of thin layers of polyurethane foams with foam forming the proper elastic layer of the seat...|$|E
