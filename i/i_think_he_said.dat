It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' as far as I can see determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E
2500|$|Political historians still {{debate whether}} Kennedy {{could have won}} the Democratic {{nomination}} had he lived. Some historians, such as Theodore H. White and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and famed charisma would have convinced the party bosses at the Democratic Convention {{to give him the}} nomination. Jack Newfield, author of RFK: A Memoir, stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, [...] " [...] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me, and Pete Hamill, 'Daley is the ball game, and I think we have Daley. However, other writers such as Tom Wicker, who covered the Kennedy campaign for The New York Times, believe that Humphrey's large lead in delegate votes from non-primary states, combined with Senator McCarthy's refusal to quit the race, would have prevented Kennedy from ever winning a majority at the Democratic Convention, and that Humphrey would have been the Democratic nominee even if Kennedy had lived. The journalist Richard Reeves and historian Michael Beschloss have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman Larry O'Brien wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{called to}} inquire {{yesterday}} morning. I am not sure,' said the exact little boy, 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he met papa in the steamer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was talking}} very loudly, and I thought some of Lord Arthur's friends {{up in the}} {{pavilion}} must have heard. He thought so, too, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>said</b> quickly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. Billy {{agreed with}} him. 'That's just what <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> sir,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> 'It's rough on Bob, but still----' And then {{they walked down}} the steps. I waited a bit to give them a good start, and then sheered off myself. And so home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you would,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> more kindly; 'but your {{indifference}} for so many, {{many years}} {{has made me}} doubt it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a {{young man}} in the {{carriage}} with me," [...] he asked presently. [...] "Mr. Gerald something or other <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his name was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little? Jim {{told me she}} was tall; regal, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> In fact, he's {{enthusiastic}} about her; and that makes me curious, because Jim's taste is not often bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Analysed sounds," [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but I am not sure. He {{glanced at}} the window. [...] "Have {{you ever seen a}} curtain before a window fixed in that way before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a snow-bridge, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> sir," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The creek's running under it. Anyway, I didn't touch {{anything}} solid with my feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was going}} to say that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> fidgets less,' <b>said</b> Laura; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> his chief contortions of the {{scissors}} have been when Philip has been here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{a strange}} girl, {{and she had to}} speak her mind. [...] "I don't think God has done it all," [...] she said. [...] "I don't even <b>think</b> that <b>He</b> told you to do it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> just <b>said</b> to you, 'There is a painted lady's child at your door. You can save her if you like.' ...|$|R
60|$|A {{great number}} of my uncle's sonnets, he said, were written from the 'Cat and Salutation,' or a public-house with some such name, in Smithfield, where my uncle imprisoned himself for some time; and they {{appeared}} in a newspaper, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> the Morning Chronicle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old Bakenkhonsu told me, Prince, that he {{had been}} present at many royal betrothals, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> eleven, and had never seen one {{conducted}} with more grace. He added that the way in which you kissed the brow of her Highness was perfect, as was all your demeanour after the first argument." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, my lord," [...] said Varney, [...] "I may be misled on {{the present}} {{occasion}} by my wish to find the predictions of astrology true. Alasco says that your favourite planet is culminating, and that the adverse influence--he would not use a plainer term--though not overcome, was evidently combust, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> or retrograde." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{know if this}} is {{the right}} thing, but it’s all <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of,” <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> “We want to keep down any {{internal}} bleeding.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Coulson laughed. [...] "Of course, I {{may have}} done, though <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> Harford was a partner of his. Perhaps, however, {{he had a}} purpose in telling us that, for he {{had been trying to}} sell Shafton some land company's shares, though if it hadn't been true he would {{scarcely}} have ventured to mention it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} glanced at Carrie. [...] "If Mrs. Leland will excuse me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and departed, as he evidently considered, tactfully.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Browning {{was very}} kind and warm in his {{expressions}} of pleasure at seeing us; and, on our part, {{we were all}} very glad to meet him. He must be an exceedingly likable man. [...] . They are to leave Florence very soon, {{and are going to}} Normandy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{for the rest of the}} summer.|$|E
60|$|When {{at length}} {{we reached the}} outspan I asked the Hottentot, Klaus, who was {{assisting}} me to drive the team, where his master was, for I could not see him anywhere. He answered that he had gone back down the kloof to look for something that had fallen from the wagon, a bolt <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "None whatever, sir," [...] the man answered. [...] "Our {{junior clerk}} here asked {{him where he}} would wish letters to be forwarded, and he replied that {{there would not be}} any. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he was leaving for abroad almost at once, but would call before he sailed in case there were any letters or {{messages}} for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are a new}} arrival, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> sir?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We have so few white officers, here, {{that one}} spots a fresh face at once." ...|$|R
60|$|The Hatter {{looked at}} the March Hare, who had {{followed}} him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{the sort}} of thing, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Major," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as, after the men were dismissed, he walked back to his tent with Major Harrison.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{heard from}} the Marquis of Wellesley that the rajah had been kept from declaring against us, by a young officer of great ability, whom he had sent to Nagpore for the purpose, and who {{narrowly}} escaped assassination there when {{the news of the}} fall of Seringapatam was received. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that you had a perfect knowledge of Mahratti, and also of Hindustani; and that he had sent you to accompany his brother, General Wellesley.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use," [...] said Mamie. [...] "I know a hero. And when I {{heard of}} you working all day like a common labourer, with your hands {{bleeding}} and your nails broken--and how you told the captain to 'crack on' (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said)</b> in the storm, when he was terrified himself--and the danger of that horrid mutiny"--(Nares had been obligingly dipping his brush in earthquake and eclipse)--"and how it was all done, in part at least, for Jim and me--I felt we could never say how we admired and thanked you." ...|$|E
60|$|Jeeves, when I {{discussed}} {{the matter with}} him later, said {{it was something to}} do with inhibitions, if I caught the word correctly, and the suppression of, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the ego. What he meant, I gathered, was that, owing to the fact that Gussie had just completed a five years' stretch of blameless seclusion among the newts, all the goofiness which ought to have been spread out thin over those five years and had been bottled up during that period came to the surface on this occasion in a lump--or, if you prefer to put it that way, like a tidal wave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is," [...] <b>said</b> Farmer Thornberry, very seriously, [...] "and by this token, {{he says a}} {{knowledge}} of chemistry {{is necessary for the}} cultivation of the soil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{say what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> right," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I shall {{take time to}} {{consider}} what I shall say; I won't be hurried by this ruffian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{must leave}} this place if Raunham {{suspects}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> 'The request of Cytherea and her brother may simply be for a satisfactory proof, {{to make her feel}} legally free--but it may mean more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been almost the very day it happened," [...] she said, with a little shudder. [...] "He came down in the {{afternoon}} and he seemed a bit queer, as though he had something on his mind. He took out the envelope once or twice and looked at it. Once he said to me, 'Agnes,' he said, 'there are men in London who, if they knew that I carried this with me, would kill me for it. I was frightened, and I begged him to leave it somewhere. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he had to have it always with him, because he couldn't think of a safe hiding-place for it. Just as he was going, though, he came back and took it out of his pocket once more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{incubator}} has {{not done}} all {{that it should have}} done," [...] I said. [...] "Ukridge looks after it, and I fancy his methods are not the right methods. I don't know if I have got the figures absolutely correct, but Ukridge reasons on these lines. He says you are supposed to keep the temperature up to a hundred and five degrees. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> a hundred and five. Then the eggs are supposed to hatch out in a week or so. He argues that you may just as well keep the temperature at seventy-two, and wait a fortnight for your chickens. I am certain there's a fallacy in the system somewhere, because we never seem to get as far as the chickens. But Ukridge says his theory is mathematically sound, and he sticks to it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{things like}} this to give courage to us three, but I don't believe we needed it, particularly. Rectus was very quiet, but I think {{that if he could}} have kept himself dry he would have been pretty well {{satisfied}} to float until daylight, for he had full faith in the captain, and was sure we should be picked up. I was pretty much of the same mind, but poor Corny was in a sad way. It was no comfort to her to tell her that we should be picked up, unless she could be assured that the same ship would pick up her father and mother. But we could say nothing positive about this, of course, although we did all that we could, in a general way, to make her feel that everything would turn out all right. She sat wrapped up in her shawl, and seldom said a word. But her eyes were wandering all over the waves, looking for a boat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> hoarsely. Then <b>he</b> {{remembered that}} he had told much to Robert Bolton which she had not heard. 'I did tell her that I would marry her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is?" [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Clyde, when Mr. Archibald had resumed his seat and his pipe. [...] "I believe he is a {{wandering}} actor. Actors always have smoothly shaven faces, and he looks like one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tony smiled wryly. “I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am,” <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> “This fellow got his bayonet into me, and I have {{a notion}} that I’m {{bleeding}} internally. I suppose there is a doctor in Santa Marta.” ...|$|R
