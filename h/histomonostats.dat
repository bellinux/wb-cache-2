40|$|The Autohrs examine shortly the {{development}} of regulation in Europea Union on additives for use in animal nutrition. They consider the Regulation (EC) n. 1831 / 2003 of 22 September 2003 (JO n. L 268, 18 / 10 / 2003) in force into 08 / 11 / 2003, issued to revise the laws on additives, to assure an higher level of protection of human health, animal {{health and the environment}} and {{to take into account the}} fact that technological progress and scientific developments have made available new types of additives, such as those to be used on silage or in water. This Regulation dictates new rules on the authorisation for the marketing and use of additives in feed, repealing Directive 70 / 524 /EEC (art. 23); also covers mixtures of additives sold to the end-user, and the marketing and use of those mixtures should comply with the conditions laid down in the authorisation of each single additive; defines categories of feed additives and inserts in feed additives amino acids, their salts and analogues, and urea and its derivatives, silage agents; prohibits the use of coccidiostats and <b>histomonostats</b> as additives until 31 december 2012 and the use of antibiotics different from coccidiostats and <b>histomonostats</b> until 31 december 2005; dictates a new procedures to grant the authorisations; establishes a Register of authorised feed additives; details labelling and packaging of feed additives and premixtures...|$|E
40|$|The Commission Regulation 574 / 2011 /EC set up {{maximum levels}} of coccidiostats and <b>histomonostats</b> in nonmedicated feed as a {{consequence}} of carry-over during manufacturing. Carry-over takes place from medicated to nonmedicated feed during feed production. Similar contamination could also occur for other pharmaceuticals such as tetracyclines, a group of antibiotics commonly employed in food production animal. The objective of this work is to present a simple and fast method for the simultaneous detection of four tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline) in nontarget feed at a Î¼g/kg level. Validation of the method was performed according to the guideline included in the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC for official method. The validated method was successfully applied to 50 feed samples collected from different milk farms and 25 samples obtained from feed manufacturers. While oxytetracycline was the tetracycline most frequently detected, chlortetracycline was the analyte measured at the highest concentration 15. 14 [*]mg/Kg. From 75 nonmedicated feed analysed 15 % resulted to be positive for the presence of one tetracycline...|$|E
