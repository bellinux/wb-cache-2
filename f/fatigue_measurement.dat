Objectives: to define {{the applicability of the}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> questionnaires and analyze it in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Material and methods: in a first phase, the psychometric properties of 3 <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> questionnaires were determined in 99 patients: Daily Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. In a second phase, fatigue status and its relationship to disease and quality of life was determined in 127 patients and 69 healthy controls. Results: {{the first part of the}} study showed the applicability of the questionnaires listed in inflammatory bowel disease, the Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (DFIS) having the best correlation with the quality of life and clinical activity. In the second phase, significantly higher levels of fatigue were observed in active disease than in disease in remission and healthy controls (p < 0, 05). The severity of fatigue was significantly correlated with quality of life (r = - 0. 66 and - 0. 72 between IBDQ- 9 and DFIS and in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively) and with disease activity (r = 0. 25 and Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively, p < 0. 05). Conclusions: in inflammatory bowel disease, <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> questionnaires have good properties and show that fatigue is an important manifestation of the disease, which has a significant impact on quality of life of patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDriver fatigue in {{endurance}} motor racing, {{has been}} problematic for driver safety and optimal performance. Historically in this sport {{focus has been}} primary on improving mechanical performance; making the racecar light, faster and improving grip (aerodynamics and suspension geometry). Driver safety has come secondary. A series of fatal accidents that were attributed to fatigue have led to rule changes; however, these were made with little understanding of the driver fatigue (type/level). As the literature indicates few publicly available studies into driver fatigue take into account all of the identified stresses for endurance motor racing. Technology has progressed {{where it is now}} easier to quantify self with the use of appropriately selected and placed sensors. This literature review aims to highlight the need for sports engineers to develop a new electronic system for <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> in endurance motor racing and is the first part of a major research project {{in the development of a}} system for race driver <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement...</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{players and}} {{soldiers}} preform strenuous exercises and do difficult and tiring duties, {{they are usually}} the common victims of muscular fatigue. Keeping this in mind, we propose <b>FAtigue</b> <b>MEasurement</b> (FAME) protocol for soccer players and soldiers using in-vivo sensors for Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASNs). In FAME, we introduce a composite parameter for <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> by setting a threshold level for each sensor. Whenever, any sensed data exceeds its threshold level, the players or soldiers are declared {{to be in a}} state of fatigue. Moreover, we use a vibration pad for the relaxation of fatigued muscles, and then utilize the vibrational energy by means of vibration detection circuit to recharge the in-vivo sensors. The induction circuit achieves about 68 % link efficiency. Simulation results show better performance of the proposed FAME protocol, in the chosen scenarios, as compared to an existing Wireless Soccer Team Monitoring (WSTM) protocol in terms of the selected metrics.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigated {{the validity of}} the Royal Australian Navy’s proposed Navy Standard Work Week (NSWW) model and the Navy Management Diary (NMD) with its accompanying <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> tool. A simulated 21 -member Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) crew was constructed in the NMD to assess the NSWW. The NMD <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurement</b> tool and the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) model, and its software instantiation, the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST), were used to estimate risk for the periods of activity across the three weeks, resulting in comparison of the associated risk levels identified by the NMD fatigue tool and corresponding FAST scores. In the proposed RAN NSWW model, the category of maintenance most often exceeded its allocated hours, leading to the recommendation that further research on a larger sample might address whether the proposed NSWW should be customized to be platform and occupation specific. The NMD and FAST software tool comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in predicted risk. The discussion speculates on why these discrepancies exist between the two software tools. The thesis recommends that this methodology be replicated using a larger sample and include empirical observations of performance in actual operations before comparing to FAST-generated predicted effectiveness levels.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the test-retest (two occasions seven days part) reproducibility of isokinetic (Biodex) concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) ankle dorsiflexor strength and <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> in older subjects using several statistical methods. Thirty healthy men (n= 15) and women (n= 15) aged between 70 and 85 years participated in the study. To determine the reproducibility of strength measurements, the 30 individuals performed three maximal CON and ECC contractions at 30 °/s and 90 °/s. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC_{ 2. 1 }) for CON and ECC strength measurements was high and ranged from 0. 94 to 0. 98. Bland & Altman graphs and analyses indicted no systematic bias. The standard error of measurement (SEM), representing the smallest change that indicates a real improvement (or deterioration) for a group of individuals, was small (0. 94) between CON peak torque at 30 °/s and 90 °/s, as well as ECC peak torque at 30 °/s and 90 °/s, suggested that any of these two velocities could be used as a reference. To determine the reproducibility of <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements,</b> 28 of the 30 individuals performed 50 maximal CON contractions at 60 °/s. Reproducibility of the loss in work (work fatigue) and the relative loss in peak torque, comparing the first three to the last three contractions (3 - 3), was determined and the ICC was 0. 71 and 0. 60, respectively. In addition, the SEM was small (< 8. 4 %) and the 'error bands' to define the SRD for a single subject were also small (from − 23. 5 % to 24. 5 %).

40|$|International audienceThe {{reliability}} and the expected lifetime of optical links {{are closely related}} to the chemical action of the water molecules on silica network. However, polymeric coating also contributes largely to the mechanical properties of the fiber. Dynamic <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> were performed on silica optical fibers, either bare or coated, using two-point bending bench. Water concentration in test atmosphere was 50 % relative humidity or very dry atmosphere. When water content is a few ppm, the dynamic fatigue curve, which expresses the breaking strength as a function of stress rate deviates from linearity at high stress rate. The same behaviour is observed in ambient atmosphere for very high testing speeds. The comparison between bare and coated fibers shows that the fatigue behaviour at high stressing rate is influenced by the polymer coating. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Physical {{performance}} measures {{are widely used}} to assess physical function, providing information about physiological and biomechanical aspects of motor performance. However they do not {{provide insight into the}} attentional and visual demands for motor performance. A figure-of-eight sprint test was therefore developed to measure the attentional and visual demands for repeated-sprint performance. The aims of the study were: 1) to assess test-retest reliability of the figure-of-eight sprint test, and 2) to study the attentional and visual demands for sprint performance in a non-fatigued and fatigued condition. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy athletes were included in the study. To determine test-retest reliability, a subgroup of 19 athletes performed the figure-of-eight sprint test twice. The figure-of-eight sprint test consisted of nine 30 -second sprints. The sprint test consisted of three test parts: sprinting without any restriction, with an attention-demanding task, and with restricted vision. Increases in sprint times with the attention-demanding task or restricted vision are reflective of the attentional and visual demands for sprinting. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and mean difference between test and retest with 95 % confidence limits (CL) were used to assess test-retest reliability. Repeated-measures ANOVA were used for comparisons between the sprint times and <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> of the test parts in both a non-fatigued and fatigued condition. Results: The figure-of-eight sprint test showed good test-retest reliability, with ICCs ranging from 0. 75 to 0. 94 (95 % CL: 0. 40 - 0. 98). Zero lay within the 95 % CL of the mean differences, indicating that no bias existed between sprint performance at test and retest. Sprint times during the test parts with attention-demanding task (P = 0. 01) and restricted vision (P < 0. 001) increased significantly compared to the base measurement. Furthermore the sprint times and <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> increased significantly in fatigued condition. There was a significant interaction effect between test part and level of fatigue (P = 0. 03). Conclusions: High ICCs and the absence of systematic variation indicate good test-retest reliability of the figure-of-eight sprint test. The attentional and visual demands for sprint performance, in both a non-fatigued and fatigued condition, can be measured in healthy team-sport athletes with the figure-of-eight sprint test...|$|R

Significant emphasis in relation to the quality of sowing material requires the application of precise me-thods for the assessment of changes in biological quality (usually estimated through the strength and energy of germination) in the course of technological processes. However, such analysis requires a number of germination tests. The presented research results are a continuation of the scholarly search aimed at defining an objective, rapid method for assessing the fatigue resistance of wheat grain. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> conformed to the methods proposed in part one. The statistical analysis was made to define the correlation between resistance indicators and corresponding values of germination capacity and energy. The above revealed that the index, calculated following the 5 th impact, best describes grain behavior - from the viewpoint of fatigue resistance...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the fatigue failure of tree retardant cross-linked polyethylene (TR-XLPE) that is relevant to water tree development in underground cable insulation. Finite element calculations were used to estimate the stresses developed in cable insulation by di-electrophoretic forces; these stresses are in the low megaPascal range around inclusions (or water tree branches) that are long and thin. They are insufficient to bring about instantaneous failure of the insulation. However, these stresses might be sufficient to cause cyclic fatigue failure of the insulation, and, accordingly, <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> were carried out on samples from a commercial cable. The resulting fatigue failures, that occurred at cycle numbers achievable in practical work, suggest that fatigue might be an explanation for slow development of water trees over years of service in the ground. Cycle numbers at failure were found to be lower at higher mechanical stresses, at higher temperatures and in the presence of humic acid or ferric ions; however, the number of cycles to failure was larger in the presence of water.

40|$|The Patient Perspective Workshop at OMERACT 7 {{addressed}} {{the question of}} assessing the outcomes of intervention in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{from the perspective of}} those who experience the disease. A particular emphasis at this workshop was placed on fatigue, but other areas included well-being, real-time assessment, patient priorities, and needs in early and late disease. Through a series of overview presentations, discussion groups, and plenary sessions, workshop participants (who included 19 patients) clarified what is known and what are the outstanding issues for future research. The importance of further work on clarifying the validity of <b>fatigue</b> <b>measurements</b> in RA has been confirmed, and with at least one suitable instrument available there will be strong pressure to include fatigue in a redefined core set of outcome measures in RA. In the other 4 areas covered there are important issues that can be addressed by enquiry and experiment and that together provide a challenging research agenda. At the final plenary session the OMERACT conference endorsed, by a large majority, the proposal that fatigue may warrant consideration for inclusion in the OMERACT core set for RA...|$|R
