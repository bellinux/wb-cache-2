5|$|After the {{election}}, the Conservative {{party were}} charged with <b>improper</b> election spending, {{in a case that}} became known as the In and Out scandal. It dragged on for years, but in 2012 they took a plea deal, admitting both <b>improper</b> spending and falsifying records to hide it.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by malnutrition due to an <b>improper</b> or inadequate diet.|$|E
5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the <b>improper</b> execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of <b>improper</b> loading of the aircraft and <b>improper</b> maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem {{does not seem to have}} been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the <b>improper</b> Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the <b>improper</b> Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Adhomukha (head-inverted): He {{who takes}} bribes, an astrologer and he who worships <b>improper</b> objects is cast here.|$|E
5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by <b>improper</b> purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an <b>improper</b> exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly {{because he did not}} want to leave an <b>improper</b> installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
5|$|DeConcini had {{received}} about $48,000 from Keating {{and his associates}} for his 1988 Senate re-election campaign. In September 1989, after the government sued Keating and American Continental for <b>improper</b> actions regarding contributions, DeConcini returned the money. DeConcini considered Keating a constituent because Keating lived in Arizona; they were also long-time friends.|$|E
5|$|Due to the accident, the FAA put the Teterboro {{controller}} and {{his supervisor}} on leave and made {{comments about the}} phone call, which was deemed <b>improper</b> behavior. However, the NTSB rebuked the FAA for doing so, stating that only the NTSB {{has the authority to}} determine the controller's contribution to the incident.|$|E
5|$|<b>Improper</b> {{adherence}} to these flag dimensions {{have led to}} embarrassing diplomatic incidents. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese flags used during the opening ceremony and two medal ceremonies featured the four small stars incorrectly angled in the same direction, inciting fury in the Olympic organisers.|$|E
5|$|In addition, it {{also appears}} that an applicant's {{subjective}} motivation {{is relevant to}} {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing. If a case is brought out of ill-will or some other <b>improper</b> purpose, the courts will be reluctant to recognize that the applicant has standing, even if there is a public interest in the case being heard.|$|E
5|$|My {{object in}} the present work is to paint the rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; {{to show that the}} Jew who steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he almost {{invariably}} escapes punishment owing to <b>improper</b> occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2011, Lesnar {{was charged}} with hunting infractions {{on a trip to}} Alberta on November 19, 2010. Two charges were dropped, but Lesnar pleaded guilty to the charge of <b>improper</b> tagging of an animal. He was fined $1,725 and given a six-month hunting suspension.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, {{the second}} set of wheels on a {{southbound}} Q train jumped the track near Brighton Beach, constituting the system's second derailment within a month. Nine people suffered injuries due to <b>improper</b> maintenance of the car in question.|$|E
5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an <b>improper</b> electrode.|$|E
5|$|Pramāda (carelessness and laxity of conduct) – This third {{cause of}} bondage {{consists}} of absentmindedness, lack of enthusiasm towards acquiring merit and spiritual growth, and <b>improper</b> actions of mind, body and speech without any regard to oneself or others.|$|E
5|$|The GAO {{found no}} {{evidence}} of <b>improper</b> or unlawful command influence by USAF leaders on the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. The GAO noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied the GAO request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's <b>improper</b> execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E
5|$|The United States Senate Select Committee on <b>Improper</b> Activities in Labor and Management (also {{known as}} the McClellan Committee) was a select {{committee}} created by the United States Senate on January 30, 1957, and dissolved on March 31, 1960. The select committee was directed to study the extent of criminal or other <b>improper</b> practices {{in the field of}} labor-management relations or in groups of employees or employers, and to suggest changes in the laws of the United States that would provide protection against such practices or activities. It conducted 253 active investigations, served 8,000 subpoenas for witnesses and documents, held 270 days of hearings, took testimony from 1,526 witnesses (343 of whom invoked the Fifth Amendment), and compiled almost 150,000 pages of testimony. At the peak of its activity in 1958, 104 persons worked for the committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{attorneys}} {{who represented the}} LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and <b>improper,</b> alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and {{that members of the}} Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|The {{ninth and}} tenth commandments deal with coveting, {{which is an}} {{interior}} disposition not a physical act. The Catechism distinguishes between covetousness of the flesh (<b>improper</b> sexual desire) and covetousness for another's worldly goods. The ninth commandment deals with the former and the tenth the latter.|$|E
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was <b>improper</b> {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|The scandal grew {{to involve}} {{a slew of}} {{additional}} allegations against the President, ranging from the <b>improper</b> use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken <b>improper</b> payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} <b>improper</b> for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by <b>improper</b> leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E
5|$|About 36hours {{prior to}} the {{hurricane}} making landfall, {{when it was still}} south of Cuba, the Miami Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for South Florida. About 18hours before landfall, the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning. The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed <b>improper</b> preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E
5|$|Both parties {{reached a}} {{settlement}} on 20 April 2007, agreeing {{to drop their}} respective lawsuits. Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing to ban the sale or distribution of games by Take-Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged <b>improper</b> conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Brownlee's {{work as an}} MLA {{extended}} beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging <b>improper</b> treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.|$|E
5|$|Cheney was a {{prominent}} member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), {{commonly known as the}} Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of <b>improper</b> political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.|$|E
5|$|Display and {{usage of}} the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code– India, the {{original}} flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of <b>Improper</b> Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate {{the provisions of the}} Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.|$|E
5|$|Even as Metro officially {{designated}} Rosecroft Raceway as the Green Line's southern terminus, {{more than}} half of Prince George's County's representatives in the Maryland state legislature asked Governor Harry Hughes to review the proposed route after allegations of <b>improper</b> political pressure regarding the 1978 route decision surfaced. Metro officials proceeded anyway in March 1984 with Green Line design and planning, and moved the line's completion date up to late 1986.|$|E
5|$|FOXSports.com's Jay Glazer {{reported}} on July 16, 2008, that the Packers filed tampering {{charges against the}} Minnesota Vikings with the league office, alleging <b>improper</b> communication between Vikings offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Favre, although one source suggested that Favre {{may have been in}} contact with Vikings head coach Brad Childress. After an investigation, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ruled there had been no violation of tampering rules.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from <b>improper</b> input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an <b>improper</b> diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Human rights organisations accuse {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents {{at the behest of}} the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for <b>improper</b> conduct.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Euchambersia was {{assigned}} to the newly named family Euchambersiidae by Lieuwe Dirk Boonstra. Boonstra initially misspelt the name as Euchambersidae (which is <b>improper</b> Latin), and was subsequently corrected by Friedrich von Huene in 1940. Euchambersiidae was initially considered to be separate from the families Moschorhinidae and Annatherapsididae; in 1974, Christiane Mendez recognized these groups as closely related subfamilies (renamed Annatherapsidinae, Moschorhininae and Euchambersiinae) within the wider group of her redefined Moschorhinidae (although she also referred to it as Annatherapsididae).|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Travers is {{irritated by}} what she {{perceives}} as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly <b>improper,</b> a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.|$|E
