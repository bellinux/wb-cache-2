5|$|Stories also link Bahuchara {{to gender}} {{variance}} after she becomes divine. One myth concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince {{grew up to}} be <b>impotent.</b> One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince in a dream and ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify <b>impotent</b> men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be <b>impotent.</b> This myth is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{failure in}} the First Bishops' War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise funds from Spain, while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives, led to the public humiliation of the Battle of the Downs, where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet {{off the coast of}} Kent in sight of the <b>impotent</b> English navy.|$|E
5|$|English Poor Law {{legislation}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the <b>impotent</b> poor, although there is much earlier Tudor legislation dealing with the problems caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the Poor Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes, the Old Poor Law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I and the New Poor Law, passed in 1834, which significantly modified the existing system of poor relief. The later statute altered the Poor Law system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by Poor Law Unions.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, {{the second}} phase of the {{operation}} started when several hundred rebels marched into Saigon dressed all in white, armed with only sticks and spears. Before the march, they had ingested potions that purportedly made them invisible. However, the French military were able to capture more than 80 of the supposedly invisible rebels during demonstrations against French rule. The police raided the homes of several people who were known to be involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation <b>impotent.</b> However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was not a}} success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple's only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in Washington for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never substantiated, both that Benjamin was <b>impotent,</b> and that Natalie was unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system <b>impotent</b> and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|During the 9th century, Byzantium had {{gradually}} recovered {{its strength}} and internal stability while the Caliphate had become increasingly <b>impotent</b> and fractured. Under Kourkouas's leadership, the Byzantine armies advanced deep into Muslim territory {{for the first}} time in almost 200 years, expanding the imperial border. The emirates of Melitene and Qaliqala were conquered, extending Byzantine control to the upper Euphrates and over western Armenia. The remaining Iberian and Armenian princes became Byzantine vassals. Kourkouas also played a role in the defeat of a major Rus' raid in 941 and recovered the Mandylion of Edessa, an important and holy relic believed to depict the face of Jesus Christ. He was dismissed in 944 as a result of the machinations of Romanos Lekapenos's sons but restored to favour by Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959), serving as imperial ambassador in 946. His subsequent fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and {{television}} including Frost in May (where he played an <b>impotent</b> man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC. Eleven {{years after his}} film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character. In late 1982 he had his big theatre break {{when he took over}} the lead in Another Country. The following year, he had a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal first mate in The Bounty, after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|Martino Zaccaria was a {{scion of}} the Genoese Zaccaria family. Through his father, Nicolino Zaccaria, {{he was a}} nephew to Benedetto I Zaccaria, lord of Chios and of Phocaea on the Anatolian coast. Benedetto I had {{captured}} Chios from the Byzantine Empire in 1304, citing the island's vulnerability to Turkish raids. His occupation was acknowledged by the <b>impotent</b> Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos, initially {{for a period of}} 10 years, but which was then renewed at five-year intervals. Benedetto died in 1307 and was succeeded in Chios by his son, Paleologo Zaccaria. When he died childless in 1314, the island passed to Martino and his brother, Benedetto II. Chios was a small but wealthy domain, with an annual income of 120,000 gold hyperpyra. Over the next few years, Martino made it the core of a small realm encompassing several islands off the shore of Asia Minor, including Samos and Kos.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June 1978, {{three months}} after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided that the Khalqists had {{exclusive}} rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites <b>impotent.</b> Karmal was exiled, but was able to establish a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for 4 September, on the Festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers would be off duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah both stayed in their assigned countries.|$|E
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render <b>impotent</b> the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E
5|$|With Western Europe neutralised, the OKL and OKW {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Britain, which was now home to the Allied base of operations in Europe. Hitler hoped Britain would negotiate for an armistice, for which he was prepared to offer generous terms. The tentative offers made by Hitler were rejected by the Churchill coalition government. Hitler now ordered the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to prepare for an amphibious assault of Britain, codenamed Operation Sealion. The Luftwaffe was to eliminate enemy air power and the Kriegsmarine was ordered to make all the necessary preparations for transporting the Heer (Army) across the English Channel. The Luftwaffe's task came first. Once the RAF had been rendered <b>impotent,</b> Göring and Hitler hoped that an invasion would be unnecessary. If this proved not to be the case, the Luftwaffe would then support the army and prevent the Royal Navy interdicting German sea traffic. Göring named the offensive against the RAF as Operation Eagle Attack (Adlerangriff).|$|E
5|$|Katharine Hepburn {{joined the}} cast in mid-April 1942 after Stewart {{sent her a}} copy of the {{unfinished}} script. Hepburn was fascinated by the character of Christine, and felt that doing the film would be a way of contributing to the war effort. MGM executives did not want Hepburn attached to the picture, feeling it was an inappropriate follow-up for her (first) previous pairing with Tracy in Woman of the Year (1942), but Hepburn insisted, and MGM relented. Hepburn showed some concerns with Stewart's redrafting of the script, in that he toned down the novel's love story, placing more emphasis on the character of O'Malley role and the action. She asked for more romance in the film. Although Hepburn had spent much of the prior year searching for scripts with equally strong male and female parts for her and Tracy, she now requested that the O'Malley role be restored to the function it served in the novel (where O'Malley is <b>impotent,</b> troubled, and despairing of love) and her own part expanded. Film producer Victor Saville threatened to resign if the changes were made, and Spencer Tracy supported him, which led to the changes being rejected.|$|E
5|$|The new Vandalic Kingdom of Carthage, {{under the}} capable king Geiseric, {{immediately}} launched raids against {{the coasts of}} Italy and Greece, even sacking and plundering Rome in 455. The Vandal raids continued unabated {{over the next two}} decades, despite repeated Roman attempts to defeat them. The Western Empire was <b>impotent,</b> its navy having dwindled to almost nothing, but the eastern emperors could still call upon the resources and naval expertise of the eastern Mediterranean. A first Eastern expedition in 448, however, went no further than Sicily, and in 460, the Vandals attacked and destroyed a Western Roman invasion fleet at Cartagena in Spain. Finally, in 468, a huge Eastern expedition was assembled under Basiliscus, reputedly numbering 1,113 ships and 100,000 men, but it failed disastrously. About 600 ships were lost to fire ships, and the financial cost of 130,000 pounds of gold and 700 000 pounds of silver nearly bankrupted the Empire. This forced the Romans {{to come to terms with}} Geiseric and sign a peace treaty. After Geiseric's death in 477, however, the Vandal threat receded.|$|E
25|$|The divided {{organization}} was minuscule and <b>impotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{irregular}} Arabic {{forces were}} rendered <b>impotent</b> and yielded to panic, calling the situation hopeless and announcing the imminent {{fall of the}} city.|$|E
25|$|The Michaelmas Girls (1975) by John Brooks Barry {{features}} Mary Jane Kelly as {{a lesbian}} prostitute who conspires with an <b>impotent</b> male sadist to murder fellow streetwalkers.|$|E
25|$|Morals excite passions, {{and produce}} or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly <b>impotent</b> in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not {{conclusions}} of our reason.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997 film Deconstructing Harry, Woody Allen's {{character}} {{claims to}} have fallen out of love with his first wife when lighting made her look like Max Schmeling, rendering him <b>impotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{while his}} bowling was <b>impotent</b> on the rock-hard wickets {{prevailing}} in the Home Counties {{for most of}} the season, Tarrant was unplayable on rain-affected pitches at Old Trafford and in Yorkshire, and he scored 1000 runs for the first time.|$|E
25|$|A {{clerical}} {{career was}} not a route chosen by upper-class society. Most parish priests were sons of priests, were very poorly educated, and very poorly paid. The monks in the monasteries had a slightly higher status; they {{were not allowed to}} marry. Politically, the church was <b>impotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{indicated that}} they believed both sides' criticism would prove ultimately <b>impotent</b> and that the negative publicity would prove a boon for the film's box office. Nonetheless, the film trilogy has not been continued, prompting actor Sam Elliott to blame censorship and the Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|In 1581, Fleming {{was elected}} Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull after the {{existing}} members were dismissed as idle and <b>impotent.</b> He was elected MP for Winchester in 1584, and was re-elected in 1593. His progression within {{the legal profession}} was fast (possibly due to several personal connections with the monarch); he became a serjeant-at-law in 1594, and shortly afterwards became Recorder of London.|$|E
25|$|Leonid Andreieveitch Gayev – {{the brother}} of Madame Ranevskaya. One of the more {{obviously}} comic characters, Gayev is a talkative eccentric. His addiction to billiards (often manifesting itself at times of discomfort) is symbolic of the aristocracy's decadent life of leisure, which renders them <b>impotent</b> {{in the face of}} change. Gayev tries hard to save his family and estate, but ultimately, as an aristocrat, lacks the drive.|$|E
25|$|Operation Ajax's formal {{leader was}} senior CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., while career agent Donald Wilber was the {{operational}} leader, planner, and executor of the deposition of Mosaddegh. The coup d'état {{depended on the}} <b>impotent</b> Shah's dismissing the popular and powerful Prime Minister and replacing him with General Fazlollah Zahedi, with help from Colonel Abbas Farzanegan—a man agreed upon by the British and Americans after determining his anti-Soviet politics.|$|E
25|$|In 1663, Louis XIV again {{turned to}} Mademoiselle {{in order to}} arrange a match for his cousin. The {{intended}} bridegroom was Alfonso VI of Portugal, who acceded to the Portuguese throne in 1656. The proud Mademoiselle ignored the idea, saying she would rather stay in France with her vast income and estates and {{that she did not}} want a husband who was rumoured to be alcoholic, <b>impotent</b> and paralytic. Alfonso instead married Marie Françoise of Savoy.|$|E
25|$|In 1679, the 18-year-old Charles II {{was married}} to 17-year-old Marie Louise of Orléans (1662–1689), eldest {{daughter}} of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (the only sibling of Louis XIV) and his first wife Henrietta of England. At that time, Marie Louise {{was known as a}} lovely young woman. It is likely that Charles was <b>impotent,</b> and no children were born. Marie Louise became deeply depressed and died at 27, ten years after their marriage, leaving the 28-year-old Charles heartbroken.|$|E
25|$|Just a year later, however, John II of Castile {{died and}} was succeeded by Henry IV. Barrientos did not fare well {{opposite}} the new king, whom he considered ineffectual {{and lacking in}} character. Henry IV {{was known as the}} <b>impotent</b> for his unconsummated marriage to Blanche II of Navarre. Barrientos scoffed at Henry for his failure to act in the face of rumors impugning his character, such as the infidelity of the queen with one of his confidants, and talk of his homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|The {{play was}} {{attacked}} for its political implications, which later {{resulted in a}} ban on the play and its sequel from being performed. However, Fielding does not favour any political party; instead, he attacks both parties while recognising their importance to the nation as a whole. His attacks are personal, especially in alluding to rumours that the Prince of Wales was <b>impotent.</b> The play did run with The Fall of Mortimer, which made fun of Walpole. The revisions to the play form The Grub-Street Opera.|$|E
25|$|The Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter (later {{made into}} a film by Fellini) is an ancient Roman novel, which has {{partially}} survived, narrating the misadventures of an <b>impotent</b> man named Encolpius, who has been cursed by the god Priapus. The novel is filled with bawdy and obscene episodes, including orgies, ritual sex, and other erotic incidents. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal that a genre of picaresque erotic novel also existed in ancient Greece. Meanwhile, some of the ancient Greek romance novels, such as Daphnis and Chloe, also contain elements of sexual fantasy.|$|E
25|$|Dụ Tông had one wife, Queen Nghi Thánh, who was {{daughter}} of the Prince Huệ Túc Trần Đại Niên. Being <b>impotent,</b> Dụ Tông had no son {{of his own and}} before his death, he issued an edict that the throne would be passed to Dương Nhật Lễ despite the fact that his appointee was not from Trần clan while the royal family still had several capable princes available for the position. This decision of Dụ Tông was heavily criticized by imperial historians because it broke the normal protocol for succession and heralded the start of a chaotic period of the Trần Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|His most salacious {{case was}} {{his defense of}} Jeff and Kathy Willets in 1991. The Willets were accused of {{operating}} a sex business out of their home. Rubin argued in their defense that Kathy Willets was driven to prostitution by nymphomania brought on by side-effects of the antidepressant, Prozac, forcing her to need sex {{with as many as}} eight men daily. Her husband, a deputy sheriff, was <b>impotent</b> and videotaped his wife's sex acts as a form of therapy. Despite this original defense, both were convicted. The lawyer for the prosecution was Joel T. Lazarus, who shortly afterward was appointed a judge.|$|E
25|$|Once the Fourth Age {{began the}} Elves stopped having an active {{influence}} on the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since the Third. The Orcs never became a serious threat again; reduced to small bands of mountain brigands, they were never more than a nuisance. The Nazgûl perished with the unmaking of the One Ring and the subsequent loss of {{the powers of the}} Nine, while their master Sauron was rendered <b>impotent</b> and unable to threaten Middle-earth again. However, the forces of Rhûn and Harad continued to war with the free peoples of Middle-earth until their eventual decline and defeat.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1991, Déby was proclaimed President of Chad and he {{proceeded}} to dissolve the Council of State the day after. In the new government Alingué was given the largely <b>impotent</b> office of Prime Minister, a post he held until May 20, 1992, when he was replaced by Joseph Yodoyman, like him a Chadian Southerner. This dismissal was felt by Alingué {{as an act of}} political ingratitude, transforming him through time into a staunch opponent of the president. During his period in office, in October 1991, the Council of Ministers adopted recommendations leading to the registration of political parties, thus putting an end to the single-party system.|$|E
25|$|Welles {{was in the}} {{meantime}} preparing an expedition for the relief of the garrison at Fort Sumter. As he was unaware that Powhatan would not be available, he included it in his plans. When the other vessels assigned to the effort showed up, the South Carolina troops at Charleston began to bombard Fort Sumter, and the Civil War was on. The relief expedition could only wait outside the harbor. The expedition had little chance {{to be successful in}} any case; without the support of the guns on Powhatan, it was completely <b>impotent.</b> The only contribution made by the expedition was to carry the soldiers who had defended Fort Sumter back to the North following their surrender and parole.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the unique {{political}} system of the Commonwealth, the quasi-democratic Golden Liberty, had turned into anarchy. The Polish nobility's (szlachta) privilege of liberum veto, first introduced as a safeguard against tyranny of the monarch, allowed any deputy to the Sejm to stop and annul the entire session. This was soon seen by the neighbouring powers - especially Prussia and Russia - as the perfect opportunity to disrupt the Commonwealth from inside, and soon many Sejms were dissolved by a deputy bribed by one of the foreign powers. With an <b>impotent</b> Sejm, the Commonwealth stagnated, as it was impossible to reform the government, raise taxes or increase the size of the army.|$|E
