60|$|Colonel Crusty turned pale, and Miss Peppy fell <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> {{on the rug}} in a dead faint, {{crushing}} Rosebud {{almost to}} death in her fall.|$|R
6000|$|I fell <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> {{and gazed}} at him. In a minute more I raised myself on one elbow, and, looking at him earnestly, said, [...] "How long, Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{leave you}} now, then," [...] his friend said, {{buttoning}} his coat around him. [...] "You lie <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on your back, and I think you'll find yourself all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Och! murder, I'm dyin', {{send for}} the praist an' me mother!" [...] cried O'Connor, {{as he fell}} <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> {{on his back and}} pressed both hands tightly over his mouth.|$|R
60|$|Peruvian mules are {{not open}} to flattery. The advance of the fore-legs became more decided, the lean {{backward}} more pronounced, the ears went <b>flat</b> <b>down,</b> and incipient passion gleamed in the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cause,--cause,--cause 't was Miss Eva. O, don't take 'em away, please!" [...] she said; and, sitting <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on the floor, {{and putting}} her apron over her head, {{she began to}} sob vehemently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mild as milk!" [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "I was a-playin' with him last night. He'll {{let you do}} {{anything}} with him! If you box his ears, he'll lay over <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on his side!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, fancy {{keeping a}} big place like this, all {{overgrown}} {{and like a}} wilderness!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If the Professor can't afford a few gardeners, why doesn't he take a comfortable <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> town." ...|$|R
50|$|An annual cheese-rolling {{event has}} taken place in Chester since about 2002 to promote the town's food and drink festival. The rolling takes place on the <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> an {{obstacle}} course. No injuries have been reported since 2006.|$|R
6000|$|I fell <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> again, {{in which}} {{position}} Jack left {{me to go}} and fetch me some dinner. He returned quickly with a plate of soup. Before commencing to eat it I pressed my hand on my forehead, and said-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{corporal}} chanced {{to return}} at that moment. The Turks dropped their burden and lay <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> beside it. Seeing that his friend was gone, {{and hearing the}} clatter of his retreating charger, Corporal Shoveloff put spurs to his steed and followed.|$|R
60|$|I pushed Uncle Richard's small <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> {{the rough}} path and rowed out to Island Rock. Arriving there, I thrust the painter deep {{into a narrow}} cleft. This was the usual way of mooring it, and no doubt of its safety {{occurred}} to me.|$|R
60|$|Impressed {{with the}} force of this reasoning, both ladies made an effort, and got up on their {{respective}} elbows. They smiled incredulously at each other, and then, becoming suddenly grave, fell <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on their backs, and remained so for some time without speaking.|$|R
60|$|The {{guarding}} was of {{the strangest}} and cruellest. The prisoners were made to lie <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on the ground--many of them having been previously stripped nearly naked; and {{if any of them}} ventured to change their positions, or raise their heads to implore a draught of water, they were instantly shot.|$|R
50|$|The facial {{features}} include wide nostrils {{on a black}} nose, the jaw closes in a scissors bite and the eyes are typically dark brown. The skull itself is lean with a well defined stop. The ears have rounded tips, and are set fairly high on the skull, hanging <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> the sides.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} came to the {{immediate}} neighbourhood of the spot where it was rightly conjectured the enemy lay concealed. Here, as Tim had foretold, they went upon their knees, and advanced with the utmost caution. Coming to a grassy eminence they lay <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> and worked their way slowly and painfully to the top.|$|R
50|$|There are inter-house and inter-class tournaments {{throughout}} the year. There are four major {{fields in the}} school, the Top Flat, Middle Flat, Green <b>Flat</b> and <b>Down</b> <b>Flat.</b> There is a synthetic open-air tennis court, and an indoor heated swimming pool.|$|R
50|$|In Boon wurrung thought, their {{territory}} was carved {{out by the}} creator Lohan as he moved from Yarra <b>Flats</b> <b>down</b> to his final resting place at Wa-mung and, as custodians of this marine-bek country, they required outsiders to observe certain ritual prohibitions and to learn their language if the newcomers were to enter their land without harm.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it an't all I want, {{by a long}} jump," [...] said Tom. [...] "Ye don't think I did {{business}} with you, down in Natchez, for nothing, Haley; I've learned to hold an eel, when I catch him. You've got to fork over fifty dollars, <b>flat</b> <b>down,</b> or this child don't start a peg. I know yer." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, the VTF-15H {{was finally}} {{introduced}} to the market. Their first ported 15" [...] subwoofer that provides extension, <b>flat,</b> <b>down</b> to 16 Hz. The VTF-15H {{was also the first}} to feature the new integrated flare triangular port design allowing Hsu to utilize the maximum port size for the subwoofer and to not be limited by the size of conventional rounded ports.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was one in}} an 'underd, poor maid! I putts {{a flower}} 'ere every time I passes. Pretty maid an' gude maid she was, though they wouldn't burry 'er up to th' church, nor where {{she wanted to be}} burried neither." [...] The old {{labourer}} paused, and put his hairy, twisted hand <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on the turf beside the bluebells.|$|R
6000|$|Maraquita {{introduced}} Harold to her aunt, a middle-aged, leather-skinned, excessively dark-eyed {{daughter of}} Portugal. She also {{introduced him to}} a bosom friend, at that time {{on a visit to}} her aunt. The bosom friend was an auburn-haired, fair-skinned, cheerful-spirited English girl. Before her, Harold Seadrift at once, without an instant's warning, fell <b>flat</b> <b>down,</b> figuratively speaking of course, and remained so--stricken through the heart! ...|$|R
60|$|The bare {{thought of}} having been in such extremity, caused Richard to fall into another silence, and to lie <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> again, at his full length. The Marchioness, having {{arranged}} the bed-clothes more comfortably, and felt that his hands and forehead were quite cool--a discovery that filled her with delight--cried a little more, and then applied herself to getting tea ready, and making some thin dry toast.|$|R
60|$|And {{with a nod}} of {{his head}} he pointed up to the rostrum where the dusky {{auctioneer}} had momentarily left off shouting and had thrown himself <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> upon the matting, ostensibly in order to speak {{with one of the}} scribes on the tier below, but who was in reality casting furtive glances in the direction where Hortensius Martius stood talking with the praefectus.|$|R
60|$|Placing the {{umbrella}} {{in such a}} position that it came {{between himself and the}} bull, he laid himself <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> in the drain. The opening was far too narrow to admit his broad shoulders, except when turned sidewise. The same treatment was not applicable to other parts of his person, but, by dint of squeezing and collapsing, he got down, nestled under the bank, and lay still.|$|R
60|$|Whatever {{might have}} been the {{tendency}} of the speech, it was suddenly cut short by the sound of a horse's hoofs clattering in the glen below. After bestowing a united eagle glance on the approaching horseman, the Blackfeet warriors turned a look of intelligence on each other, lay <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> in the long grass, and melted from the scene as completely and silently as snow-wreaths melt before the sun in spring.|$|R
40|$|Octanethiol {{molecules}} adsorbed on Pt {{chains are}} studied with {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} and spectroscopy at 77 K. The head of the octanethiol binds to a Pt atom and the tail is lying <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on the chain. Open-loop current time traces reveal that the molecule wags its tail and attaches to the scanning tunneling microscopy-tip resulting in a dramatic increase of the current. We measured a single molecule resistance of 100 − 150 MΩ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lord love you, sir!' cried Mr Tapley, {{in great}} terror; 'Don't do that! Don't do that, sir! Anything but that! It never helped man, woman, or child, over the lowest fence yet, sir, {{and it never}} will. Besides its being of no use to you, it's worse than of no use to me, for the least sound of it will knock me <b>flat</b> <b>down.</b> I can't stand up agin it, sir. Anything but that!' ...|$|R
60|$|Reddy Fox {{wanted some}} of those little Trouts to take home for his dinner, but he didn't know how to catch them. He lay <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on the Big Rock and reached way down into the Dear Little Pool, but all the little Trouts laughed at Reddy Fox and not one came within reach. Then Mr. Trout swam up so quickly that Reddy Fox didn't see him coming and bit Reddy's little black paw hard.|$|R

50|$|After {{spending}} the night out of the flat, Matthew returns home to find that his father has arranged {{for him to be}} re-committed to the psychiatric hospital. He runs away and hides in Shelley's burnt-out flat. While there, he has a vision showing him that it was Tom and Sophie's abductor who burned the <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> with Shelley and Rebecca inside, and he sees the name Ballan scratched on the floor. He realises that the priest is the killer.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a man}} {{windrowing}} oats {{that are}} <b>flat</b> <b>down</b> on the ground, Stockton, California, before July 25, 1929. A man can be seen wearing a hat seated in a tractor-like piece of machinery at right traveling to the right. A second piece of machinery {{can be seen to}} the left of him with spokes windrowing oats in the field. A few wooden shacks {{can be seen in the}} left background beyond the field amongst trees...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I had him <b>flat</b> <b>down.</b> He couldn't raise a grunt. He {{stood like}} a post while I laid off my trunk; but mother and sis {{came out and}} were both very nice to Nance. Mother asked her to get out, and she did, and I took 'em all for a ride later--all but dad. Couldn't get him inside the machine. Nance stayed for supper, and {{just as we were}} goin' in dad said to me: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{success of}} the scheme was great--much greater, indeed, than had been anticipated. The bake-board fell <b>flat</b> <b>down,</b> {{the door of the}} coal-hole burst open, and our hero, {{springing}} out, planted a blow on the nose of the big-whiskered man that laid him flat on the floor. Another blow overturned the man who restrained Bessy, and a third was about to be delivered when a general rush was made, and Bill Bowls, being overpowered by numbers, was finally secured.|$|R
