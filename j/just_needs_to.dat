25|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous stage, many fewer riders were interested in joining an early breakaway group as the stage featured over 60 kilometers of climbing. 17.5 kilometres into the stage, at the first sprint, there were still no riders who had escaped and so Robbie McEwen saw the possibility of going for it. He succeeded, but mainly because the other sprinters did not even challenge him; this means that they have probably given up for the points classification. It seems now that McEwen <b>just</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> make it to Paris to win that green jersey.|$|E
500|$|Hebel's admirers include Goethe, Gottfried Keller and Tolstoy. Goethe, {{who tried}} to write a poem (the [...] "Schweizerlied", Swiss song) in Alemannic himself, praised the Allemannische Gedichte highly. According to him, Hebel [...] "countrified the {{universe}} in the most naive, graceful fashion". But {{on the question of}} whether he would translate Hebel's works, Goethe said: [...] "Such a great poet should be only read in the original! One <b>just</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> learn this language!" [...] The Brothers Grimm also admired Hebel, and he met Jacob Grimm in Karlsruhe in 1814.|$|E

In a later interview, Carey said, [...] "We don't {{have a lot of time}} to do it. It's not a big-budget thing. But it doesn't need to be. It <b>just</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be about the song, capturing the song and the emotion of it."

500|$|The {{character}} is a 1990s inverse of The Graduate archetype: [...] "a guy {{who does not have}} a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life." [...] He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life [...] "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, [...] " [...] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't {{have anything to do with}} the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it <b>just</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> run now." [...] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be [...] "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it [...] "funny and seditious" [...] by including humor to temper the sinister element.|$|E

Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented after the episode [...] "Preggers": [...] "So far, Terri has been an incredibly unlikable character. More firmly establishing her as this devilish type of schemer at least pushes her far {{enough to make her}} actions entertaining, even as we root against her." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Throwdown": [...] "the pregnancy subplot is dragging down the show, and tonight that subplot nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode. Terri's fake pregnancy and Quinn’s real one started out a few weeks ago as an interesting way to insert some realism and tension into a delightfully surreal musical-comedy universe. By now, however, I watch Glee and feel sorry for Jessalyn Gilsig. I’ll bet the actress didn’t initially sign on to have her character Terri become a shrill, lying nag whose main function is to bring husband Will — and by extension, us — down." ...|$|E
