500|$|Perry's {{undercover}} {{identity as}} a pet leads to characters throughout the series to deem him as a [...] "mindless domestic pet" [...] that [...] "doesn't do much". This definition of the character led to Phineas and Ferb spearheading production of a new toyline based on Perry called [...] "Perry the Inaction Figure," [...] whose tagline revolved around it not doing anything but allowing the customer to make it whatever they desire it to be. In all actuality, Perry is a skilled fighter {{who is able to}} perform several implausible judo fighting moves and escapes. He has access to several different types of technology and inventions provided to him by The O.W.C.A., including a hover craft dubbed the [...] "Platypusmobile," [...] a jet ski, and a whistle set that allows him to summon different types of animals.

500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their <b>favorite</b> <b>color</b> was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dazzling Blue" [...] {{is based}} on his {{relationship}} with wife Edie Brickell, and the title references her <b>favorite</b> <b>color.</b> [...] "The CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing", sang Simon over African cadences and Indian tablas, before marvelling at how his wife and he [...] "were born beneath a star of dazzling blue". He said the song {{reminded him of his}} work as a part of Simon & Garfunkel. [...] "Rewrite" [...] features segments of recordings made on a small digital recorder by Brickell on a 2009 family trip together in Kenya. Simon was frustrated over the guitar tone in his song and attached the sound of a wildebeest to a certain guitar note each time it occurred, in an effort to create an interesting sound. The song contains nighttime ambience recorded during the trip. It was written about a burned out Vietnam veteran imagining that he could rewrite his life, in order to give it a happy ending. [...] "Love and Hard Times" [...] is an affirmation of love for Brickell. The beginning of the song references “God and his only son” visiting Earth. Simon noted that the song’s thesis is being thankful at the highest level. The track contains orchestral arrangement from Gil Goldstein, which was recorded at Avatar Studios, as Ramone wanted a larger room to record in.|$|E

500|$|Daniels {{was unsure}} {{as to what}} to call the Christmas exchange. He had heard the names [...] "Nasty Christmas", [...] "White Elephant", and [...] "Yankee Swap" [...] used to {{describe}} the game, and so he wrote all three into the script in order [...] "to cover all regions of the country". Schur created a list of who receives what gift in order to preserve continuity in the episode. Gifts featured in the episode include Toby giving Angela a baby poster, Kelly getting Oscar a shower radio, Michael buying Ryan an iPod, Kevin buying a foot bath for himself, Creed giving Jim an old shirt, Oscar buying Creed a keychain, and Jim purchasing Pam a teapot. The teapot was chosen because it needed to fit other gifts inside of it, as well as be something that Dwight could have a use for later on in the episode. Fischer was allowed to pick the color of the teapot featured in the episode. She picked teal, due to it being her then-husband James Gunn's <b>favorite</b> <b>color.</b> Jenna Fischer recalled that fans always ask her what Jim wrote in Pam's note. Fischer noted that John Krasinski wrote the note himself and that the contents are [...] "a secret". Jim finally gives Pam the note in the penultimate ninth season episode [...] "A.A.R.M." ...|$|E
500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s <b>favorite</b> <b>color,</b> a false response would be a federal crime." [...] Justice Scalia concluded with the statement: ...|$|E

2500|$|Mary Lincoln {{was thrilled}} with the design. [...] She asked for only minimal changes. The most {{important}} was that the blue band be replaced with [...] "solferino". Solferino was a moderate purplish-red color similar to magenta—a highly popular color at the time.

2500|$|... "Blossom Heath" [...] was Fisher's {{estate in}} Indianapolis. Completed in 1913, {{it was built}} on Cold Spring Road between the estates of his two friends and Indianapolis Motor Speedway partners, James A. Allison and Frank H. Wheeler. The house {{included}} portions of an earlier house on the site and featured a 60-foot-long living room with a 6-foot-wide fireplace where logs burned all day. There were twelve bedrooms and a huge glass-enclosed sun porch. Fisher built a house for his mother on {{the southern part of}} the estate. The estate also included a five-car garage, an indoor swimming pool, a polo course, a stable, an indoor tennis court and gymnasium, a greenhouse, and extensive gardens. A newspaper article dated February 2, 1913, described the simple dignity of the house. Unlike some of his friends and neighbors, Fisher built a large but simple house decorated primarily in yellow, his <b>favorite</b> <b>color.</b> It did not contain exotic woodwork, elaborate carvings, or extensive decoration.|$|E
2500|$|The regions have a color schema: {{blue for}} Munchkins, yellow for Winkies, red for Quadlings, green for the Emerald city, and (in works after the first) purple for the Gillikins, which region {{was also not}} named in the first book. [...] (This {{contrasts}} with Kansas; Baum, describing it, used [...] "gray" [...] nine times in four paragraphs.) In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, this is merely the <b>favorite</b> <b>color,</b> used for clothing and other man-made objects, and having some influence on their choice of crops, but the basic colors {{of the world are}} natural colors. [...] The effect is less consistent in later works. In The Marvelous Land of Oz, the book states that everything {{in the land of the}} Gillikins is purple, including the plants and mud, and a character can see that he is leaving when the grass turns from purple to green, but it also describes pumpkins as orange and corn as green in that land. Baum, indeed, never used the color schema consistently; in many books, he alluded to the colors to orient the characters and readers to their location, and then did not refer to it again. His most common technique was to depict the man-made articles and flowers as the color of the country, leaving leaves, grass, and fruit their natural colors.|$|E
