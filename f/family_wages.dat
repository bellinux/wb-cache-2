50|$|A common {{model used}} to study the added worker effect views the family as a {{decision}} making unit and leisure time as a normal good. With this understanding, a married woman may chose to enter the labor market to offset the loss of income her family faces when her husband loses his job. Since <b>family</b> <b>wages</b> are pooled {{and the price of}} consuming leisure varies among individuals depending on earning power, an increase in one individual's income may result in other family members gaining leisure time by working less (Mincer, 1962, p. 65).

40|$|This paper {{explains}} how {{the idea of}} economic independence has changed. It focuses on the Social Reports by Osaka City from the Showa Period. The 1920 's reports stated that women {{have the right to}} earn enough money to be independent. This conclusion was supported by economist Shiro Kawada. He asserted that the “individual unit social system” is best: everyone has the right to earn the living wage. The “family social system” is not endorsed because it leads to problems for both women and society as a whole. These findings stand in stark contrast to today's economic system. In today's economic system men receive <b>family</b> <b>wages</b> which are capable of supporting a family of 2 to 4 people. On the other hand, women receive wages that are significantly lower than the living wage.

However this recommendation was later contradicted by reports from the 1930 's. Why were the recommendations of the 1920 's reports rejected?

This paper argues that we need to rethink our evaluation of the economic roles played by ever-married women in working-class families. Using a range of government reports as well as IPUMS, I document three ways in which working-class wives and mothers strove to bring cash into their family units: through formal workforce participation; through home work of various sorts; and through selling subsistence, providing in-home services to nonfamily members in exchange for cash. Unlike earlier works which focused on single locations or ethnic or racial groups or female occupations, I tell a national story of ever-married women’s cash-producing work. Working-class wives and mothers filled in the economic gaps existing in the interactions of their families with the capitalist marketplace through a range of different methods. While early 20 th-century unions called for the establishment of a “living wage” for male workers, the world in which those workers lived required both <b>family</b> <b>wages</b> and family strategies to bring in other forms of cash for their survival...|$|E

Nevertheless, full-time hours remain a sticking-point. A gendered full-time/part-time work divide is emerging, in a context where labour markets and their regulation have fragmented. Bargaining models based on “individual choice” allow accommodations, rather than solutions, to the time/income bind. In this context, permanent part-time work, like the earlier <b>family</b> <b>wage,</b> seems to offer the best achievable resolution of the conflicting time demands of work and family life, together with a measure of income security.

40|$|El tema de la tesi és el treball femení a la indústria tèxtil llanera sabadellenca durant el segle XX. S'ha elaborat des de l'antropologia històrica, amb influències de la història local, la geografia humana i la història econòmica. L'objectiu {{principal}} era analitzar el treball de les dones, conèixer quins oficis desenvolupaven, en quines condicions, quin era el seu nivell formatiu, si estaven organitzades sindicalment, i altres qüestions relacionades amb la seva vida laboral. La recerca partia de la hipòtesi de què les dones passen desapercebudes en l'anàlisi quotidiana del món laboral, perquè són considerades principalment mestresses de casa i la seva activitat com a treballadores és socialment secundària. Per tant, es contemplava la interrelació entre el cicle vital de les dones i la seva vida laboral. La tesi posa de relleu que el treball és un element fonamental en l'estudi de les relacions de gènere, però també constata les dificultats per quantificar el treball femení, pel marcat biaix androcèntric de les estadístiques, tan ideològica com metodològicament, que comporta la seva subrepresentació en els resultats. La metodologia basada en la combinació de fonts bibliogràfiques, arxivístiques i orals, ha propiciat una aproximació a l'objecte d'estudi rica i diversa, i la metodologia qualitativa ha estat molt útil per estudiar el treball i la vida de les treballadores. Fins fa pocs anys no s'ha parat atenció a les treballadores en els estudis locals, malgrat les dones eren majoritàries en alguns sectors, com ara la indústria tèxtil llanera sabadellenca. La seva incorporació al món laboral no és recent, ni forma part d'un procés unilinial de progrés, ni és producte de la revolució industrial. Des d'una perspectiva històrica és evident que les dones han treballat en àmbits tant diversos com ara l'agricultura, les manufactures, el comerç o el servei domèstic, la indústria o els serveis. A Sabadell, les dones eren majoria al tèxtil i estaven repartides pràcticament per totes les fases de la producció. De fet, el sector tèxtil és l'únic sector industrial amb presència significativa de dones a la ciutat. Per tant, el fet que els seus sous siguin més baixos no es pot atribuir a què encara no hagin consolidat la presència en el mercat de treball, sinó a un model social basat en el concepte de salari familiar. La discriminació laboral de les dones obeeix a un principi social estructurador, que atribueix models i estereotips diferenciats en funció del sexe. Aquest model atribueix el treball domèstic a les dones, imposant així restriccions en l'ús del temps i de l'espai. A la indústria tèxtil la mà d'obra era molt especialitzada i la formació sovint s'adquiria mitjançant períodes d'aprenentatge a la fàbrica. Globalment, els salaris dels oficis femenins eren més baixos que els masculins i aquest fet té molt més a veure amb el model de salari familiar que no pas amb les pròpies característiques de l'ofici. The {{subject of}} the thesis is the women's work in the textile wool industry inhabitant of Sabadell during the 20 th century. It has been elaborated from historical antropology, with influences of the local history, the human geography and the economic history. Main objective was to analyze {{the work of the}} women, to know which professions they developed, in which conditions, which was their formative level, if they were organized in unions, and other questions related to their work life. The research started from the hypothesis that women go unnoticed in daily analysis of the work world, because they are considered mainly housewives and their activity as workers is taken as socially secondary. Therefore, there was an interrelation between the vital cycle of the women and their work life. The thesis points out that work is a fundamental element fot the study of gender relationships, but it also shows the difficulties in quantifying women's work, from the marked androcentric bias of the statistics, as ideological as methodologically, that their subrepresentation entails in the results. The methodology based on the combination of bibliographical, files and oral sources, has propitiated a rich and diverse approach to matter of study, and the qualitative methodology has been very useful to study the work and the life of the workers. Until few years ago not much attention has been focused on female workers in local studies, in spite of women were the most in some sectors, as now the textile wool industry of Sabadell. Their incorporation in the work world is not recent, not even part of an unilinial process of progress, nor it {{is a product of the}} industrial revolution. From historical perspective it is evident that women have worked in so different areas as agriculture, manufacturing, trade or domestic service, industry or services. In Sabadell, women were a majority in the textile and they were distributed practically by all the phases of the production. As a matter of fact, the textile sector was the only industry sector with significant presence of women in the city. Therefore, the fact that their salaries are smaller can not claim in what they have not consolidated the presence in the job market yet, but on a social model based on the concept of <b>family</b> <b>wages.</b> Work discrimination of women obeys in a social structure principle, which attributes differentiated models and stereotypes depending on the sex. This model attributes the domestic work to the women, imposing to them time and space restrictions. In the textile industry the labour was very specialized and the experience often was adquired by periods of training in the factory. Globally, the wages of the female professions were smaller than the masculine ones and this fact is related much more with the model of <b>family</b> <b>wages</b> than with the characteristics of work itself...|$|E
