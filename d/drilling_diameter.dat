40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study for}} evaluation of anterior C 1 –C 2. To provide essential anatomic data for safer transoral odontoidectomy. The surface dimensions of the atlas vertebra and the transoral approach for odontoidectomy have been described in detail. Anterior arcus of C 1 must be drilled out to reach odontoid process for transoral odontoidectomy. The thickness of anterior ring of C 1 has not been studied before. Sixty, dried adult atlas and 60 axis vertebrae and ten cadaveric craniocervical specimens were measured for the following: (1) bony drilling depth (BDD), {{the distance from the}} anterior wall of anterior ring of C 1 to anterior wall of odontoid; (2) minimum <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> (MDD), distance of minimum C 1 anterior ring removal for odontoid resection on horizontal plane; (3) maximum bony <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> (MBDD), distance of maximum C 1 anterior ring removal for odontoid resection on horizontal plane. Lateral border of this diameter is limited by medial borders of the lateral mass; (4) the widest odontoid diameters (WOD) on coronal sections were measured. On 60 atlas and axis vertebrae, the BDD was 7. 0  ±  1. 2  mm on dry bones, the distance between the medial borders of the lateral mass (MBDD) was 16. 1  ±  1. 5  mm, and the WOD on coronal sections (WOD) was 9. 8  ±  0. 8  mm.

30|$|Generally, the <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> is 100 ~ 300  mm (Zhao and Dai 2007). Among all GSHP {{vertical}} ground heat exchangers, u-tubes, annular {{tubes and}} single tubes are most commonly used. The U-tube is most common {{due to its}} simple construction, good heat exchanger performance, high bearing, less tube joints, and unlikely leakage. The U-type side tube spacing is small due to restraints imposed on the well <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter.</b> Due {{to the existence of}} temperature differences, heat conduction will occur directly between the two side-tubes, interfering with the ability of the soil to function as an effective heat sink. Thermal interference seriously influences the underground heat exchange of U-type tubes, decreasing the quantity of heat rejection for unit well depth by 20 – 40  %. More seriously, it will lead to a malfunction of the heat pump refrigerant-cycle system, which can stop operation. It was found that increasing the pipe spacing, applying high thermal conductivity backfill soil can enhance the performace of GSHP systems (Dehkordi and Schincariol 2014). Shen (2007) uses a finite unit method to perform quantitative analyses on the hystereses caused by thermal interference. Carli (2010) analyzed the thermal interference in the drill holes by calculating the heat resistance, which makes uses an electrical analogy with lumped capacitances. These thermal resistances were used to solve for the heat transfer in an unsteady state. For the vertical double U-type ground tube, although the quantity of heat exchange for a unit well depth is larger than the single U-type tube, for the same drilling area, thermal interference is more likely to happen because the temperature of several side-tubes is different. The rock-soil’s heat equilibrium temperature not only affects the underground rock-soil heat transfer rate, but is also associated with normal operation and economy of heat pump systems. An ideal temperature range ensures efficient running of the system. In addition, appropriate side-tube spacing not can enhance the heat exchanger efficiency but also can reduce the required <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter.</b> Therefore, this paper establishes a three-dimensional heat transfer model for a single-well, double-U buried tube based on the rock-soil thermophysical properties. It also accounts for vertical temperature stratification according to underground heat transfer test experiment conditions, and carried out comparison of simulation results for soil temperature and U-tube water temperature are compared for single U-type buried pipes and a double-U buried pipes for continuous operation over 7  days. After that, the paper compares the outlet water temperature changes during the time of continuous operation and intermittent operation for a double-U heat exchanger. Eventually, the double-U buried pipe model was established of different side-tube center distance. Thermal interference arising from temperature distribution variation for different side-tubes was also analyzed.|$|E

Material and Methods: Forty dental implants (4. 1 mm diameter) with two different macrogeometries were inserted in the tibia of 10 Beagle dogs, and maximum insertion torque was recorded. Drilling techniques were: until 3. 75 mm (regular-group); and until 4. 0 mm diameter (overdrilling-group) for both implant designs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the influence of different implant placement techniques on the early bone healing response in an animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, 24 cylindrical-screw-type implants with a diameter of 4. 2 mm (Dyna(R)) were installed, using three different surgical techniques; (1) 5 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4 mm; (2) 15 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 6 mm; and (3) 25 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. After 3 weeks of implantation period, the peri-implant bone response was histologically evaluated and the percentage of bone-implant contact (%BIC) calculated. RESULTS: New bone formation was more pronounced for implants placed with the 5 % undersized or 15 % undersized technique, as compared with implants installed with the 25 % undersized technique. Histomorphometrical data corroborates these findings as the %BIC was significantly higher for implants inserted with the 5 % undersized (47. 7 +/- 11. 1) or 15 % undersized protocol (47. 5 +/- 9. 5) as compared with implants inserted with the 25 % undersized technique (32. 1 +/- 9. 7). No significant difference in %BIC could be observed between the 5 % undersized and 15 % undersized installed implants. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of the present study, it was concluded that excessive compression of the host bone, when a discrepancy between implant and final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> more than 15 %, can result in an inferior tissue response in the early stage of healing.

The planned difference between the <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> and the reamer diameter is called an allowance. (It allows for the removal of a certain small amount of material.)

30|$|The {{following}} discussion {{is based on}} the apparent resistivity curve RLA 5. As explained in “Resistivity log” section in this work, we did not invert resistivity logs to correct for borehole and mud effects; we used RLA 5, as this measurement corresponds to the greatest depth in the surrounding formation and is surely the most representative of the true resistivity of the formation. The other resistivity measurements, RLA 1 – 4, are also shown in Fig.  2. Although RLA 1 – 4 represent the resistivity closer to the borehole, they have a better vertical resolution than RLA 5; thus, we show them in the figure for reference. Using apparent resistivity implies that geometrical structures, such as a dipping plane of constant resistivity crossing the well, are not interpreted as 2 D/ 3 D structures but as zones where the equivalent homogeneous resistivity varies (i.e., a 1 D approach). This neglect of geometrical effects is valid far from contacts if the bedding thickness is larger than the sensitive zone of the electrodes’ configuration. Furthermore, this technique is qualitatively valid as long as the geometrical effect does not dominate the electrical response or is almost constant in the studied interval. In the latter case, the logarithm of apparent resistivity is only shifted by a constant value from the true formation resistivity. Finally, note that the apparent resistivity curves show a smaller resistivity range than the true resistivity curves. For all these reasons, we limit our interpretations regarding the trends in the average resistivity data. Inversion of the apparent resistivity curve to true formation resistivity is outside the scope of the data presented in this article. This work is supported by a constant <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> in the studied depth interval.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{requirements}} for energy and resource efficiency promote {{the usage of}} lightweight materials. Moreover, hybrid parts made of different materials can provide {{a wider range of}} properties than parts from a single material. One of today’s challenges in production technology is the development of efficient manufacturing methods. Within the scope of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries”, the so called In-Mould-Metal-Spraying (IMMS) is being developed for manufacturing of metal/plastics hybrid parts. It is based upon the transfer of thermally sprayed coatings from the mold insert to the plastic coating carrier during injection molding. A key factor of the IMMS process is the adjustment of the coating bond strength to the mold insert for a residue-free transfer. The surface topography and therefore the surface pretreatment of the mold insert are important for the IMMS process. In the preliminary study, a surface topography fabricated by glass bead blasting has enabled the transfer of wire arc sprayed Zn-coatings. How-ever, further investigations indicated limitations regarding the mold insert material and local coating residuals on the mold insert surface after coating transfer. For the close investigation of this effect, laser structuring is chosen as surface pretreatment method because of its capability of fabricating freely selectable, defined surface topographies.

Internally cooled drill (3. 4 mm i 4. 5 mm) and two-step drill (2. 5 / 3. 4 i 3. 4 / 4. 5 mm) were used in combination with feed (0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 10, 0. 16 i 0. 18 mm/rev) and cutting speed (1. 18, 10. 68, 33. 61, 56. 55, 66. 05 m/min) with and without cooling with water of 24 oC. Bone temperatures are measured with thermocouple with reaction time < 0. 1 s and accuracy of 0. 1 oC. Drilling were conducted on pig bones with 3 -axis mini milling machine Flexmatic FA 530 S. [...] - Results. Bone temperatures of all analysed combinations of parameters with internal cooling were below critical 47 oC (p= 0. 05). Cooling fluid flow was low (0. 1 dcl/min = 0. 16 cm 3 /s) and did not cause damage to bone and surrounding soft tissue. Highest temperatures were detected using 4. 5 mm drill (40. 5 oC). Statistical influence on bone temperature was detected. Statistically significant effect other than cooling was detected with the <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> and feed. <b>Drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 4 mm with internal cooling developed maximum temperature of 38. 5 oC and without cooling 46. 3 oC. For the same conditions <b>drill</b> with <b>diameter</b> of 4. 5 mm obtained temperatures 40. 5 oC and 55. 7 oC respectively. Effect of feed is inversely proportional to the increase in bone temperature.

Internally cooled drill is ideal drill in tramatology/orthopedics because it produces the smallest increase in bone drilling temperature- If internal cooling is used the regulation of other drilling parameters is not neccessary...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} different surgical techniques on the primary and secondary implant stability using trabecular bone of goats as an implantation model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the iliac crest of eight goats, 48 cylindrical-screw-type implants with a diameter of 4. 2 mm (Dyna((R)); Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands) were installed, using three different surgical techniques: (i) 5 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4 mm; (ii) 15 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 6 mm; and (iii) 25 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. Peak insertion torque values were measured by a Digital((R)) (MARK- 10 Corporation, New York, NY, USA) torque gauge instrument during placement. At 3 weeks after implantation, removal torque was measured. Histomorphometrically, the peri-implant bone volume was measured in three zones; the inner zone (0 - 500 mum), the middle zone (500 - 1000 mum) and the outer zone (1000 - 1500 mum). RESULTS: Evaluation of the obtained data demonstrated {{no statistically significant difference}} between different surgical techniques regarding removal torque values. With respect to the percentage peri-implant bone volume (%BV), also no significant difference could be observed between all three applied surgical techniques for both the inner, middle and outer zone. However, irrespective of the surgical technique, it was noticed that the %BV was significantly higher for the inner zone as compared to middle and outer zone (P < 0. 05) around the implant. CONCLUSION: At 3 weeks after implant installation, independent of the used undersized surgical technique, the %BV in the inner zone (0 - 500 mum) peri-implant area was improved due to both condensation of the surrounding bone as also the translocation of host bone particles along the implant surface. Surprisingly, no mechanical beneficial effect of the 25 % undersized surgical technique could be observed as compared to the 5 % or 15 % undersized surgical technique to improve primary or secondary implant stability...|$|R
