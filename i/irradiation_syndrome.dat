40|$|The {{health problem}} due to 2011 Fukushima nuclear {{accident}} crisis {{is a topic}} to be discussed in medicine at present. Several health disorders as consequences of nuclide exposure required proper management. The role of palliative medicine should also be mentioned. Interestingly, {{a considerable number of}} irra-diated cases require palliative management. In the report by Karpenko, one fifth of the patients required palliative not rad-ical management. 1 Based on the evidence in the previous crisis, Chernobyl crisis, it is no doubt that applying the palliative ser-vices significantly improved {{the quality of life in}} the affected families. 2 The management of the cases with pain due to <b>irradiation</b> <b>syndrome</b> is the good example. The good integrative plan connecting between medical, psychological, and social management is the most effective in palliation. 3 Reference...|$|E
40|$|Hemorrhage {{is one of}} the {{important}} abnormalities occurring in animals and man exposed to large doses of ionizing radiation delivered over the entire body. Fernau, Schrank, and Zarsicki (1) as early as 1913, reported hemorrhage in rabbits following the injection of one hundred or more electrostatic units of polonium. Death usually occurred before the 12 th day, at which time the blood was incoagulable. These observations have been confirmed by Falta (2) and others (3, 4). In these reports, hemorrhages were extensive and all organs of the body were affected. It was suggested that the associated thrombocytopenia was the probable cause of the hemorrhagic state. In the dog exposed to x-irradiation of the entire body many pathologic alterations may occur. The most obvious of these are hemorrhage and infection. Hemorrhage is capable in itself of killing the animal, and it may appear as a result of exposure to most forms of ionizing irradiation (1 - 6). The <b>Irradiation</b> <b>Syndrome</b> in Dogs The data comprising this report were obtained from studies on dogs given an x-ray exposur...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the central nervous}} system neuroimmune and inflammatory responses during the prodromal phase of the acute <b>irradiation</b> <b>syndrome</b> in rat brains after partial-body exposure (head-protected) and to investigate the potential neural signalling pathways from the irradiated periphery to the non-irradiated brain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included four groups of rats: one irradiated group and one sham irradiated group, each containing non-vagotomized and vagotomized rats. In vagotomized rat groups, the subdiaphragmatic vagal section surgery was carried out 45 days before the irradiation exposure. The rats were partial-body irradiated with the head shielded with (60) Co gamma-rays to a dose of 15 Gy. They were sacrificed 6 h after the end of exposure. The hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus and cortex were then collected, and the concentrations of IL- 1 beta, TNFalpha and IL- 6 in each were measured by ELISA assays. RESULTS: Six hours after irradiation, IL- 1 beta levels had increased in the hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus, and TNFalpha and IL- 6 levels had increased significantly in the hypothalamus. Vagotomy before irradiation prevented these responses. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus and cortex react rapidly to peripheral irradiation by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators. The results also show that the vagus nerve {{is one of the major}} ascending pathways for rapid signalling to the brain with respect to partial body irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, {{the liver}} was {{classified}} as a radioresistant organ, although {{it is in fact}} highly radiosensitive. The realization that the whole liver could be treated safely only with low doses of radiation led to the conclusion that radiation therapy had an extremely limited role in the treatment of intrahepatic malignancies. A resurgence of interest has been observed with the advent of conformal radiotherapy and the introduction of bone marrow transplantation with total body irradiation. The radiation- induced liver disease, often called radiation hepatitis, is a syndrome characterized by the development of anicteric ascites, approximately 2 weeks to 4 months after hepatic irradiation. Immediate tolerance is generally surprisingly good, and the subacute radiation injury is followed by a complete asymptomatic healing, although the late lesions may be associated with signs of chronic radiation hepatitis. Radiation hepatitis must be distinguished from chemoradiation-induced-hepatitis occuring in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation and total body <b>irradiation.</b> Both <b>syndromes</b> demonstrate the same pathological lesion: veno-occlusive disease. The main treatment for radiation hepatitis is diuretics, although soma advocate steroids for severe cases. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{effects of}} irradiating the lungs {{are related to}} the histologic and clinical sequelae. The occurrence and severity of damage are semiquantitatively related to the volume of lung irradiated, and the dose rate of <b>irradiation.</b> The clinical <b>syndrome</b> occurs in up to about 10 % of patients and consists of an acute transient phase, radiation pneumonitis, usually occurring 6 to 12 weeks after radiation therapy. This is followed by clinical remission except in the most severe cases and gradual radiologic progression to the stage of radiation fibrosis over the next 6 to 12 months. Concommittant chemotherapy, repeat courses of radiation, and steroid withdrawal are exacerbating factors. Characteristic changes in pulmonary function and radiographic appearance are described, and management is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|When {{the entire}} body of dogs was exposed to 450 units of Roentgen <b>irradiation</b> a hemorrhagic <b>syndrome</b> {{developed}} which was characterized by thrombo-cytopenia, prolonged clotting and bleeding times, and neutropenia. The prothrombin time remained normal until about 24 hours before death. The calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels were not altered. Fibrinogen was present but syneresis was poor. Toluidine blue and protamine sulfate, substances which can inhibit the biologic action of heparin, restored the clotting time to normal. The hemorrhagic state was not materially altered by transfusions, vitamin K, or vitamin C. Toluidine blue and protamine sulfate were ineffective in the control of hemorrhage produced by dicumarol. The defect responsible for bleeding after irradiation {{appeared to be the}} presence in the circulation of an anticoagulant whose properties, so far as tested, were indistinguishable from those of heparin...|$|R
40|$|Ionizing {{radiations}} {{were directed}} at the heads of anesthetized mice in doses that evoked the acute central nervous system (CNS) radiation <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Irradiations</b> were done using either a predominantly thermal neutron field at a nuclear reactor after intraperitoneal injection of 10 B-enriched boric acid or 250 -kilovolt-peak x-rays with and without previous intraperitoneal injection of equivalent unenriched boric acid. Since 10 B concentrations were approximately equal to 3 -fold higher in blood than in cerebral parenchyma during the reactor irradiations, more radiation from alpha and 7 Li particles was absorbed by brain endothelial cells than by brain parenchymal cells. Comparison of the LD 50 dose for CNS radiation lethality from the reactor experiments with the LD 50 dose from the x-ray experiments gives results compatible with morphologic evidence that endothelial cell damage is {{a major determinant of}} acute lethality from the CNS radiation syndrome. It was also observed that boric acid is a low linear energy transfer radiation-enhancement agent in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Salivary gland atrophy is {{a common}} {{consequence}} of pathology, including Sjögren's <b>syndrome,</b> <b>irradiation</b> therapy and obstructive sialadenitis. During severe atrophy of the rat submandibular gland caused by excretory duct ligation, the majority of acinar cells disappear through apoptosis, whereas ductal cells proliferate and dedifferentiate; yet, the gland can survive in the atrophic state almost indefinitely, with an ability to fully recover if deligated. The control mechanisms governing these observations are not well understood. We report that ∼ 10 % of acinar cells survive in ligation-induced atrophy. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of ligated glands indicated sustained transcription of acinar cell-specific genes, whereas ductal-specific genes were reduced to background levels. After 3 days of ligation, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and autophagy occurred as shown by phosphorylation of 4 E-BP 1 and expression of autophagy-related proteins. These results suggest that activation of mTOR and the autophagosomal pathway are important mechanisms that may help to preserve acinar cells during atrophy of salivary glands after injury...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} causes an alteration in DNA by modifying neighboring thymine bases {{resulting in}} the formation of a dimer. These dimers block the processes of transcription and translation and ultimately no protein is synthesized and the cell dies. However, DNA repair mechanisms correct this damage by excising the dimer from the DNA strand and inserting replacement bases which are joined to the original strand by DNA ligase. This allows transcription to resume and ultimately protein synthesis to take place. This research focused on determining the DNA damage and subsequent repair levels in a connective tissue disorder, namely Marfan syndrome. This information is important in understanding the clinical expression and management of life threatening conditions in Marfan syndrome individuals. Preliminary results indicate that at 20 - 25 J/m 2 UV dose (254 nm) Marfan syndrome skin cells show a mean reduced survival value of 12 % compared to normal human skin cells. Gel electrophoresis indicates a reduced DNA repair level 24 h post UV <b>irradiation</b> for Marfan <b>syndrome</b> skin cells compared to normal human skin cells. These results suggest Marfan syndrome skin cells have reduced survival and DNA repair levels compared to normal human skin cells. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
