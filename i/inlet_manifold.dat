500|$|Brothers Franz and Carl Hailer and {{the other}} two men in their party were from a German {{reconnaissance}} unit, Flieger-Abteilung A292. Franz Hailer noted, [...] "It was leaving a cloud of black smoke... caused by oil leaking into the cylinders." [...] The engine had to be inverted for this to happen. The Hispano engine was known to flood its <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> with fuel when upside down and then stop running. Franz Hailer and his three companions hurried to the crash site. [...] Ball was already dead when they arrived. [...] The four German airmen agreed that the crashed craft had suffered no battle damage. [...] No bullet wounds were found on Ball's body, even though Hailer went through Ball's clothing to find identification. Hailer also took Ball to a field hospital. A German doctor subsequently described a broken back and a crushed chest, along with fractured limbs, as the cause of death.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to [...] "XT5" [...] specification. Now painted blue and thus known as the Blue straight-sixes and Holden V8s, these replaced the Red units fitted to the VB and earlier cars. Changes included a new twelve-port cylinder head, re-designed combustion chambers, inlet and exhaust manifolds, a new two-barrel carburettor and a Bosch electronic ignition system for the inline sixes. Tweaks and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of electronic ignition, revised cylinder head and <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> design and the fitment of a four-barrel carburettor on the 4.2-litre variant. These changes brought improved efficiency, increased outputs and aided driveability. In response to increasing oil prices, a four-cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980. Displacing 1.9-litres, this powerplant known as Starfire was effectively Holden's existing straight-six with two cylinders removed. The four's peak power output of [...] and torque rated at [...] meant its performance was compromised. Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real-world fuel consumption similar to the straight-sixes.|$|E

2500|$|Excess {{engine oil}} from the {{flywheel}} overflowed the reservoir and trickled over the large surface area of the round flywheel cover. [...] Two passages cast into the cover took air-fuel mixture from the carburettor mounted at the bottom to a copper U-shaped <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> mounted between the banks of cylinders, and the flywheel cover acted as a heat exchanger, preheating the fuel-air.|$|E
2500|$|A single jet Zenith {{carburettor}} with {{a remote}} float chamber fed a double branched <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> on the right; the plugs, also {{set in the}} cylinder walls, {{were on the same}} side, below and angled to the inlets. The exhaust ports were on the left side, angled forwards. A crankshaft driven Bosch magneto at the rear provided the plugs' high voltage supply. The overhead camshaft was also driven from the crankshaft via worm gears and a vertical shaft {{at the rear of the}} engine. [...] The camshaft operated the valves by rockers with rollers on their camshaft ends and adjusting screws at the other.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive valve clearance eventually allowing collision of the valve {{head with the}} rising piston fracturing the valve stem, which then allowed the inlet valve to drop open, resulting in the ignition by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was at higher pressure than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E

[...] Further engine details are provided in the panel to the right.|$|R
50|$|Other engine {{features}} were desmodromic valves, timing belts, two valves per cylinder (Taglioni {{did not love}} multi-valve), two-segment pistons (to reduce friction), a bearing type single-piece crankshaft with coupled connecting rods and four 40mm Dell'Orto carburettors installed on long <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> between the cylinder banks.|$|R
50|$|Even so, at 50 °C the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{was still}} hotter than ideal, and the engine's volumetric efficiency remained somewhat impaired The eccentric shaft's main bearings and the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> were fed by oil-injection lubrication, and the fuel-air mix also carried residual mist {{of oil from}} {{the interior of the}} rotors, which helped to lubricate the rotor tips.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the throttle twist grip! The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|E
2500|$|The biggest {{difference}} between the so-called [...] "XR series" [...] performance versions and standard models were the engines; the XR6 and XR8 boasted a [...] six-cylinder and a [...] V8 respectively. The V8 was later upgraded to output 185kilowatts (248hp) in October 1997. The upgraded transmission and exhaust system were unique to the XR range, as was the exterior styling with an XR exclusive quad headlamp assembly giving the vehicle {{a higher degree of}} aggression when compared to the look possessed by the other variants. Both models came standard with limited slip differential and specially tuned suspension. Body kits were also installed to improve the aesthetics and the aerodynamics. The first series of 824 XR8 models had the [...] engine and 3.23:1 diff ratio with 15 inch alloy wheels. The second and last of the series numbered 784 examples and was equipped with a [...] engine, shorter 3.45:1 diff ratio, 16 inch alloy wheels, big bore exhaust headers and the late model Explorer <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> as standard.|$|E

[...] This new blower features twin four-lobe rotors which are twisted 160-degrees. [...] It is mounted {{on top of the}} engine within the 'Vee', pumping air directly into the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> [...] This new design of supercharger is said to reduce the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) of the engine. [...] In 'standard' tune, this engine produces [...] at 4,850-6,500rpm, and [...] at 2,500-4,800rpm. [...] However, a higher performance variant is fitted to the latest B8 Audi S4, and in this car, produces [...] at 5,500-7,000rpm, and [...] at 2,500-5,000rpm - which makes this new S4 more potent than its immediate predecessor, with its 4.2-litre V8. [...] This engine is also scheduled to be fitted to a new hybrid version of the Volkswagen Touareg.|$|E
50|$|V engines {{remained}} {{with a separate}} block casting for each bank. The complex ducting required for <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> between the banks were too complicated to cast otherwise. For economy, a few engines, such as the V12 Pierce-Arrow, were designed to use identical castings for each bank, left and right. Some rare engines, such as the Lancia 22½° narrow-angle V12 of 1919, did use a single block casting for both banks.|$|R
50|$|The clutch {{and four}} speed gearbox {{were the same}} as those fitted to the MK3 LE but the final drive was through a cast {{aluminium}} pivoted fork, with a universal joint to the drive shaft. Front suspension was the same as the LE but rear suspension used Woodhead-Monroe springs with hydraulic damping. Two Amal 363 monobloc carburettors fitted to stub <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> were linked by a balancing tube. The recommended top speed was 60 mph.|$|R
50|$|Various {{carburettor}} configurations {{were used}} {{depending on the}} event, including four horizontal Claudel Hobson (1921 Indianapolis 500), four Zenith carburettors (1921 Grand Prix de l’A.C.F.); however, in the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy two racing CZC vertical Claudel Hobson carburettors 42 choke were used. Claudel Hobson were an S.T.D. Subsidiary. Fabricated <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> incorporating water jacket to stop icing.

2500|$|By December 1909 Anzani had a [...] 3-cylinder {{air-cooled}} true {{radial engine}} running, {{developed from the}} earlier 3-cylinder fan configuration engines (semi-radials) that had powered Bleriot across the Channel. [...] By about March 1910 he had completed the first two-row radial engine, a 6-cylinder unit made by merging two 3-cylinder units together, one slightly behind the other and at an angle of 60°. [...] The engine therefore had {{a lot in common}} with the early 3-cylinder motors: cylinders were a single iron casting with built-in valve cells and ribs, and pistons were steel with cast-iron rings. [...] The early versions were side-valve engines with automatic (atmospheric pressure opened) inlet valves and exhaust valves mechanically operated via cams in the crankcase. [...] By the end of 1912, as with the smaller engines the exhaust valves were moved to the cylinder heads and operated by push-rods and rockers. [...] The exhaust valves were {{at the front of the}} engine, with the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> at the rear. [...] A prominent pair of 150° exhaust tubes were fitted. Plugs were mounted in the cylinder sides, in the plane of the engine and on the upper side to minimise plug fouling by lubricant.|$|E
50|$|The Zetec-SE has {{no common}} parts or design {{with the larger}} Zetec-E engines apart from the name.

Induction was by a twin throat down-draft carburettor, the compression ratio was 8.0:1 and the total weight was 155 kg. An LPG version, the R-LPG, was produced for the last two years.|$|R
50|$|The four {{banks of}} four {{cylinders}} were {{arranged in a}} flattened 'X' when viewed from the front. The angle between the upper cylinders was 52.5 degrees, the lower cylinders 127.5 degrees, which gave an angle of 90 degrees between the outer cylinder banks. The cylinders consisted of separate individual steel forgings with welded steel water cooling jackets. The carburettor was situated below the propeller reduction gear {{at the front of}} the engine and fed the inlet valves through four <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds.</b> The valve drive gear, magnetos and pumps were fitted to the rear of the crankcase.|$|R

Early examples were fitted with a 3.6 L AJ6 engine in standard tune but later models had a TWR tuned version of the 4.0 AJ6, with new <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds,</b> uprated cams and a tweaked ECU.

50|$|Most {{automobiles}} use four-stroke Otto cycle engines {{with multiple}} cylinders {{attached to a}} single <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold.</b> During the induction stroke, the piston descends in the cylinder and the intake valve is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and carburetor or fuel injection system, where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold</b> from carburetor to engine.|$|E
50|$|Also, an {{explosion}} in the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifold,</b> carburetor/throttle body, or air cleaner of an internal combustion engine can occur when the intake valves are not shut prior to fuel combustion.|$|E
50|$|The dual {{crankshafts}} {{are geared}} {{directly to the}} clutch, while the front crankshaft also drives a counter balancer shaft mounted between the two crankshafts. The counterbalance shaft, unusual on a two-stroke, assists with damping engine vibrations. The engine is cooled by thermostatically controlled liquid cooling, an auxiliary electric fan mounted behind the radiator cuts in at quite high but acceptable working temperatures (e.g. when stationary in traffic).Lubrication is by direct injection into the <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> using Yamaha's 'Autolube' pump system.

50|$|In {{practice}} TVO {{had most}} of the properties of paraffin, including the need for heating to encourage vapourisation. As a result, the exhaust and <b>inlet</b> <b>manifolds</b> were adapted so that more heat from the former warmed the latter. Such a setup was called a vaporiser. To get the tractor to start from cold, a small second fuel tank was added that contained petrol. The tractor was started on the expensive petrol, then - once the engine was warm - the fuel supply switched over to TVO or paraffin. So long as the engine was working hard, as when ploughing or pulling a load, the TVO would burn well. Under light conditions, such as travelling unloaded on the highway, the engine was better on petrol.|$|R
