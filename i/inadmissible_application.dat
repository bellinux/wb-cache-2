50|$|Protocol 14 {{entered into}} force on 1 June 2010, {{three months after}} it was {{ratified}} by all 47 contracting states to the Convention. Between 2006 and 2010, Russia was the only contracting state to refuse to ratify Protocol 14. In 2010, Russia ended its opposition to the protocol, {{in exchange for a}} guarantee that Russian judges would be involved in reviewing complaints against Russia. Protocol 14 led to reforms in three areas: The Court's filtering capacity was reinforced to deal with clearly <b>inadmissible</b> <b>applications,</b> new admissibility criteria were introduced so that cases where the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage would be declared inadmissible, and measures were introduced to deal more effectively with repetitive cases.|$|R
25|$|A {{provisional}} Protocol 14bis {{had been}} opened for signature in 2009. Pending the ratification of Protocol 14 itself, 14bis was devised {{to allow the}} Court to implement revised procedures in respect of the states which have ratified it. It allowed single judges to reject manifestly <b>inadmissible</b> <b>applications</b> made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the Court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its raison d'être and according to its own terms ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010.|$|R
50|$|Bernadotte {{went to the}} European Court of Human Rights in {{an effort}} to have the Government of Sweden {{acknowledge}} his princely title there, but in 2004, after his death, the ECHR declared the <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible.</b>|$|R
50|$|Haseldine {{submitted}} {{an application}} to the European Court of Human Rights in 1991, claiming that his dismissal for writing the letter to The Guardian contravened his right to freedom of expression, but the ECHR declared his <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible</b> the following year.|$|R
50|$|Protocol 14 {{amended the}} Convention so that judges would be elected for a non-renewable term of nine years, whereas {{previously}} judges served a six-year term with {{the option of}} renewal. Amendments were also made so that a single judge could reject plainly <b>inadmissible</b> <b>applications,</b> while prior to this protocol only a three judge committee could make this final decision. In cases of doubt, the single judge refers the applications to the Committee of the Court. A single judge may not examine applications against the state which nominated him. The three judge committee has jurisdiction to declare applications admissible and decide {{on the merits of}} the case if it was clearly well founded and based on well established case law. Previously the three judge committee could only declare the case inadmissible, but could not decide on the merits of the case, which could only be done by a chambers of seven judges or the Grand Chamber. Protocol 14 also provides that when a three judge committee decides on the merits of a case, the judge elected to represent that state is no longer a compulsory member of this committee. The judge can be invited by the committee, to replace one of its members, but only for specific reasons, such as when the application relates to the exhaustion of national legal remedies.|$|R
2500|$|Statements about Muslims in France : [...] In 2005 and 2008, Le Pen was fined, in both case 10,000 euros for “incitement to discrimination, {{hatred and}} {{violence}} towards {{a group of}} people”, on account of statements made about Muslims in France. In 2010. the European Court of Human Rights declared Le Pen's <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible.</b>|$|R
40|$|The usual {{interpretations of}} {{solutions}} for the gravitational field in a spherically symmetric Type I Einstein space contain mathematical anomalies. It is shown herein that the usual solutions must be modified {{to account for the}} intrinsic geometry associated with the rele-vant line elements, by which the geometrical relations between the components of the metric tensor are consequently invariant. A geometry is entirely determined by the form of the line element describing it. The usual solutions violate the intrinsic geometry of the associated line elements and are therefore <b>inadmissible.</b> Correct <b>application</b> of the intrinsic geometry has significant consequences for the standard models of Einstein’s gravitational field...|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently to Ždanoka, {{a number}} of other {{judgments}} and decisions were adopted by Chambers (smaller formations) of the Court in cases regarding issues ranging from the restriction of political rights of former Soviet politicians to criminal conviction for crimes against humanity, whereby the Court noted that illegal occupation of Baltic States by the USSR had taken place in 1940 (see Kolk vs Estonia, Penart vs Estonia). In Penart vs Estonia, the Court declared <b>inadmissible</b> an <b>application</b> by a former USSR internal security service operative Vladimir Penart, convicted of crimes against humanity by an Estonian court for organizing the killing of [...] "a person hiding in the woods" [...] most probably a member of the Forest Brothers, a militant anti-Soviet movement in 1953. The court stated following: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} {{declared the}} <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible.</b> Concerning Article 9 of the Convention (freedom of religion), it {{noted that the}} Commission does not exclude the possibility of criticism or 'agitation' against a church or religious group reaching such a level that it might endanger freedom of religion and where a tolerance of such behaviour by the authorities could engage State responsibility. However, the Commission does not consider that such an issue arises on {{the facts of the}} present case (Para. 5).|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} {{declared the}} <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible.</b> Concerning Article 9 of the Convention (freedom of religion), it {{mentioned that the}} Market Court did not prevent the Church from selling the E-meter or even advertising it for sale as such and stated that the concept, contained in the first paragraph of Article 9, concerning the manifestation of a belief in practice does not confer protection on statement of purported religious belief which appear as selling 'arguments' in advertisements of a purely commercial nature by a religious group, therefore founding no interference with Church's rights.|$|R
5000|$|Drumm {{subsequently}} {{moved with}} his family to Massachusetts, US, where in 2010 he filed for bankruptcy under US law. The hearing at the Boston-based court heard from the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which fought Drumm's claims for bankruptcy, as he owed it €9 million. It was alleged during the case that Drumm had transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during the bankruptcy proceedings. In early 2015, the court ruled the <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible,</b> ruling that he could be held liable for debts of €10.5m in Ireland. In a 122-page ruling, the judge found Drumm was [...] "not remotely credible", his conduct [...] "both knowing and fraudulent", and accused Drumm of telling [...] "outright lies".|$|R
40|$|In its 11 June 2013 {{decision}} in Stichting Mothers of Srebrenica and Others v. the Netherlands, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) unanimously declared the <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible,</b> {{ruling that the}} Dutch court’s grant of immunity to the United Nations (UN) did not constitute a violation by The Netherlands of the applicants’ right of access to a court. The author provides a critical overview of the case, situating it within the jurisprudence of the ECtHR and the International Court of Justice concerning immunities. The author concludes that the ECtHR should have applied the presumption of consistency with human rights obligations to {{the interpretation of the}} immunity rules of the UN. This could have led the Court to require the availability of alternative dispute-settlement mechanisms as a prerequisite for immunity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} certain {{admissibility}} criteria {{of an individual}} application before the European Court of Human Rights. This {{is one of the}} most important issues in the Court's practice and it represents a necessary condition for deciding on the merits of submitted applications. The period of six months for submitting the application is introduced in order to preserve legal certainty but also it serves for the interests of states because it prevents that final domestic decisions are questioned indefinitely. The Court can declare each <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible</b> if it considers that the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage, unless respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols requires an examination of the application. Also, the application cannot be rejected on this ground if the case has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal. Protocol No. 15 to the Convention, which has not yet entered into force, envisages the deletion of this last possibility and also reducing the period for submitting the application from six to four months...|$|R
50|$|Protocol 14 {{empowered}} the Court {{to declare}} <b>applications</b> <b>inadmissible</b> where the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage and {{which do not}} raise serious questions affecting the application or {{the interpretation of the}} Convention, or important questions concerning national law. The European Commissioner for Human Rights is now allowed to intervene in cases as a third party, providing written comments and taking part in hearings. In order to reduce the workload of the Court, Protocol 14 states that the Court should encourage the parties to reach a settlement at an early stage of the proceedings, especially in repetitive cases. The Committee of Ministers supervises the settlement's execution. Protocol 14 also allows the Committee of Ministers to ask the Court to interpret a final judgment if there are difficulties in the execution of a final judgment. In order to prevent repetitive applications concerning structural problems in contracting states on which the Court has previously made a final decision, the Committee of Ministers can in exceptional circumstances and with a two-thirds majority, initiate proceedings for non-compliance with a final decision in the Grand Chamber of the Court. Article 17 of protocol 14 allows the European Union to become party to the Convention. In turn the Lisbon Treaty, which entered force in December 2009, provides that the European Union should accede and become a party to the Convention. The Committee of Ministers is to evaluate in 2012 to 2015 {{the extent to which the}} implementation of Protocol 14 has improved the effectiveness of the Court. The Committee of Ministers is to decide before 2019 whether more reforms of the Court are necessary.|$|R
2500|$|One case {{is headed}} {{by a team of}} 14 {{attorneys}} of Dutch law firm , which is representing 11 plaintiffs including the foundation [...] "Mothers of the Enclaves of Srebrenica and Žepa" [...] (which represents 6,000 relatives of the victims), who asked the court, inter alia, to grant a judicial declaration that the UN and the State of the Netherlands breached their obligation to prevent genocide, as laid down in Genocide Convention and to hold them jointly liable to pay compensation for the loss and injury suffered by plaintiffs as well as damages yet to be determined by the court, and to settle these according to law. On 10 July 2008, the court ruled that it had no jurisdiction against the UN, however the proceedings against the State of the Netherlands continued. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment (in relation to UN immunity), and first public hearings relating to this issue were held on 28 January 2010. The decision by the Court was made on 30 March 2010, by which the UN's absolute immunity was upheld. Plaintiffs have appealed this judgment as well, but the Supreme court of the Netherlands held in April 2012 that the UN enjoyed the immunity. On 11 June 2013 the European Court of Human Rights unanimously declared the <b>application</b> <b>inadmissible,</b> in relation to the alleged violation of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights because of the granting of absolute immunity to the UN by the Dutch Supreme Court. On 16 July 2014 the District Court in The Hague ruled that the Netherlands is liable for the deaths of some 300 victims who were under Dutchbat's effective control, and which were forced out of the Dutchbat compound in Potočari, but not for the deaths of other victims. On 27 June 2017 the Hague Court of Appeals upheld the first-instance judgment against the Netherlands, but limited the Dutch government’s liability to 30 percent of the damages.|$|R
