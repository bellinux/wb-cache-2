A distinctive characteristic is that the two resonators are here organized as a translational system and a superimposed rotational system. Both resonator systems use one and the same mass element. The resonators are separately driven by the aerodynamics, the translational by the space average pressure in the glottal passage, and the rotational by the pressure gradient in the flow direction.

Using semiparametric techniques to control for the endogeneity of prior behaviors, our estimates provide strong evidence of this response. We also find evidence of persistence in unemployment.

After numerical integration some solutions, including the well-known Maxwellian and the hard spheres cases, are found for various meaningful interaction laws.

While traditional trajectory planning strategies are entirely based on kinematic considerations, manipulator dynamics are usually neglected altogether. The strategy presented in this work has two distinguishing features. Firstly, the trajectory planning problem is reformulated as an optimal control problem, which is in turn solved using Pontryagin's maximum/minimum principle. This approach merges the traditional division of trajectory planning followed by trajectory tracking into one process. Secondly, the feedback form compensates for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>approximation</b> errors derived from linearization and the fundamental parameter uncertainty of the dynamic equations of motion.
