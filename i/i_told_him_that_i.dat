5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

Pianist Ethan Iverson, a contemporary of Mehldau's, stated that Mehldau was the principal influence on his peers, {{beginning in the late}} 1990s. Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: [...] "He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be arrested for all the stuff I've stolen from him." [...] Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians: [...] "Brad has had a lot of influential records, [...] if you talk to musicians, especially younger musicians, so many of them will name that as a defining record." [...] Marco Benevento and Aaron Parks are among the improvisers who have been affected by the 2002 album.|$|E

In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had better things to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would lift my voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." [...] Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was [...] "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" [...] Feinstein threw him and his crew out of her office.|$|E

2500|$|On November 30, 1998, a {{few days}} after the band {{accumulated}} [...] " [...] total [...] more than $25,000" [...] in backstage and hotel room damages during the Poughkeepsie, New York stop of their Mechanical Animals Tour, SPIN editor Craig Marks filed a $24million lawsuit against Manson and his bodyguards for allegedly assaulting his person and threatening to kill his family. According to Marks' interview with the New York Post, the issue stemmed from Manson's displeasure with the magazine's decision to renege on a promised cover story of the band for their January 1999 cover. According to Marks, the last-minute change was made because Manson's record wasn't [...] "performing." [...] The Post described the editor as [...] "bruised and battered." [...] Manson for his part issued a statement saying, [...] "I had a conversation with Craig Marks expressing I was tired of Spins immature business behavior and the series of deals they had broken with me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't care what he prints or whether or not I'm on the cover. I simply no longer wanted to work with him or his magazine that obviously has a lack of respect for musicians and their fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited Comăneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} Béla Károlyi. Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent me to meet with the director of the Olympic stadium, who told me that I could do some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] When I woke up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E

2500|$|According to Robert Craft, Stravinsky {{remained}} a confirmed monarchist {{throughout his life}} and loathed the Bolsheviks from the very beginning. In 1930, he remarked, [...] "I don't believe that anyone venerates Mussolini more than I ... I know many exalted personages, and my artist's mind does not shrink from political and social issues. Well, after having seen so many events and so many more or less representative men, I have an overpowering urge to render homage to your Duce. He is the saviour of Italy and – let us hope – Europe". Later, after a private audience with Mussolini, he added, [...] "Unless my ears deceive me, the voice of Rome {{is the voice of}} Il Duce. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt like a fascist myself... In spite of being extremely busy, Mussolini did me the great honour of conversing with me for three-quarters of an hour. We talked about music, art and politics". When the Nazis placed Stravinsky's works on the list of [...] "Entartete Musik", he lodged a formal appeal to establish his Russian genealogy and declared, [...] "I loathe all communism, Marxism, the execrable Soviet monster, and also all liberalism, democratism, atheism, etc." [...] Towards the end of his life, at Craft's behest, Stravinsky made a return visit to his native country and composed a cantata in Hebrew, travelling to Israel for its performance.|$|E

Do not speak to me as though everything must be stern and hard and cruel." [...] Then she handed up the letter, and Mrs. Fenwick read it as they walked.|$|E
