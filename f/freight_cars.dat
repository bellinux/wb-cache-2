5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three <b>freight</b> <b>cars.</b> In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad {{had at least one}} parlor car and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola cars for coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a standard gauge gondola fleet {{in the last years of}} its existence.|$|E
5|$|The line {{opened on}} 12 July 1904 {{and at the}} opening there were {{delivered}} two six-axle steam locomotives from Hartmann, which were named Lier and Hole. The railway also took delivery of two passenger cars, a combined freight and conductor car, {{and a number of}} <b>freight</b> <b>cars.</b> Periodically the railway needed extra haulage power, and therefore sometimes leased locomotives from the Norwegian State Railways. The initial fares were NOK1.30 from Lier to Svangstrand, while the ferry across the lake cost an additional NOK1.50. The greatest ridership was during the summer, when tourists took the line to reach the steam ships. During winter, the ridership fell, and the railway terminated at Sylling instead of Svangerstrand.|$|E
5|$|When Luna {{saw that}} the American advance had halted, mainly to {{stabilize}} their lines, he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on February 10.

Caloocan was left with American forces {{in control of the}} southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway, along with five engines, fifty passenger coaches, and a hundred <b>freight</b> <b>cars.</b> After consolidating control of Caloocan, the obvious next objective for American forces would be the Republic capital at Malolos. However, General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino forces would be deployed in its defense.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once {{daily in}} each {{direction}} at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station. Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area. Saint Paul {{is the site of}} the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed <b>freight</b> <b>cars,</b> 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E

5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six <b>freight</b> <b>cars</b> consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E
