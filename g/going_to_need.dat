I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody.

5|$|In July 1933, Parsons became {{liaison officer}} between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. At the NRL he was briefed {{by the head}} of its Radio Division, A. Hoyt Taylor, who told him about {{experiments}} that had been carried out into what the Navy would later name radar. Parsons immediately recognized the potential of the new invention to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. For this, he realized that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> high frequency microwaves. He discovered that no one had attempted this. The scientists had not considered all the applications of the technology, and the Navy bureaus had not grasped their potential. He was able to persuade the scientists to establish a group to investigate microwave radar, but without official sanction it had low priority. Parsons submitted a memorandum on the subject to the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) requesting $5,000 per annum for research. To his dismay, the BuOrd and Bureau of Engineering, which was responsible for the NRL, turned his proposal down.|$|E

Although the battery line continued to do well, the profits it generated were not enough to run the company as a whole. Ballard started looking for new capital, and found Mike Brown, a founder of the Vancouver-based Ventures West venture capital company. Ventures West provided several rounds of funding, and Brown suggested that if the company wanted to be successful it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> new leadership who was familiar with dealing with large companies. Although the founders found it difficult to accept a stranger into their midst, they were eventually won over and Firoz Rasul became the new CEO. Rasul immediately instituted a development plan with a timeline of goals that had to be met and go/no-go milestones.|$|E

Tate said that though he found the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode fairly predictable, the [...] "writing and performances were so engaging that it hardly mattered".

Similarly, though Billen considered the setting fairly unoriginal and the characters stereotypical, he said that the writers [...] "scored a laugh every few seconds and then a home run with a savage resolution". Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, described [...] "La Couchette" [...] as [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "sharply observed". He commended the cast, saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith [...] "give a mini-masterclass" [...] in their performances. Jones called the episode [...] "toilet humour with a twist", saying that [...] "It was Jorg's grunting and squatting that produced the episode's impressively grotesque climax, but it was Whitehall as Hugo who followed up with the instantly quotable line: 'We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> a bigger box!'"
