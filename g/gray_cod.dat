50|$|The Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus, is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the family Gadidae. It is a bottom-dwelling fish found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, mainly on the {{continental}} shelf and upper slopes, to depths of about 900 m. It can grow to a length of a meter or so and is found in large schools. It is an important commercial food species and {{is also known as}} <b>gray</b> <b>cod</b> or grey cod, and grayfish or greyfish. Fishing for this species is regulated with quotas being allotted for hook and line fishing, pots, and bottom trawls.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{signed binary}} {{representation}} (SBR) of an integer N is a string ab ···a 2 a 1 a 0 over the alphabet {− 1, 0, 1 } such that N = �b i= 0 ai 2 i. An SBR of an integer N {{is said to}} be minimal if the number of nonzero digits is minimum. In this paper, we describe a simple 3 -close Gray code for listing all minimal SBRs of an integer N. The algorithm is implemented to run in constant amortized time. In addition, we identify the values for N that have the maximum number of minimal SBRs given the length of the binary representation of N. Key words.

40|$|ABSTRACT-Pharyngeal tumors at {{the locus}} of the pseudo-branch (parabranchial body) were found at a mean {{frequency}} of 4. 2 % in 2, 096 Pacific <b>gray</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus macrocephalus) taken from the Bering Sea. The tumors, invariably bilateral and symmetrical, generally surrounded remnants of normal pseudobranch but did not invade nearby or distant organs. Cells comprising {{the bulk of the}} tumor tissue were identical to the "X-cells " previously observed in skin papillomas of pleuronectids from North American Pacific coastal waters and in skin papillomas of pleuronectids and gobies from Japanese waters. However, no papillomas were present in cod with pseudobranch tumors. In these pseudobranch tumors of cod as in skin papillomas of pleuronectids, X-cells were mostly held within meshworks of fine, electron-dense cytoplasmic processes belonging to another cell type, "envelope " (or satellite) cells...|$|E
