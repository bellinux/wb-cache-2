Therefore, privacy protection in data publishing becomes important and has received much recent attention. To improve privacy protection, many researchers have investigated how secure the published data is by designing <b>de-anonymisation</b> methods to attack anonymised data. Most of the <b>de-anonymisation</b> methods consider anonymised data in a syntactic manner. That is, items in a dataset {{are considered to be}} contextless or even meaningless literals, and they have not considered the semantics of these data items. In this thesis, we investigate how secure the anonymised data is under attacks that use semantic information. More specifically, we propose a <b>de-anonymisation</b> method to attack transaction data anonymised by set-based generalisation. Set-based generalisation protects data by replacing one item by a set of items, so that the identity of an individual can be hidden. Our goal is to identify those items that are added to a transaction during generalisation. Our attacking method has two components: scoring and elimination. Scoring measures semantic relationship between items in a transaction, and elimination removes items that are deemed not to be in the original transaction. Our experiments on both real and synthetic data show that set-based generalisation may not provide adequate protection for transaction data, and about 70...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} handheld devices (e. g.,smartphones, tablets) makes mobility traces of users broadlyavailable to third party services. These traces are collected bymeans of various sensors {{embedded in the}} users’ devices, includ-ing GPS, WiFi and GSM. We study in this paper the mobility of 300 users over a period up to 31 months from the perspective ofthe above three types of data and {{with a focus on}} two cities, i. e.,Lausanne (Switzerland) and Lyon (France). We found that users’mobility traces, no matter if they are collected using GPS, WiFi orGSM antennas, are highly unique. We show that on average onlyfour spatio-temporal points from the WiFi, GSM and GPS tracesare enough to uniquely identify 94 % of the individuals, on bothdatasets. In addition, we show that using the temporal dimension(i. e., whether users move or are in a meaningful location such asthe home or the working place) drastically improves the capacityto uniquely identify users compared to when only exploiting thespatial dimension (by 14 % on average). In some cases, usingthe temporal dimension alone can represent a better mobilityfootprint than the spatial dimension to discriminate users. Wefurther conduct a <b>de-anonymisation</b> attack to assess how mobilitytraces can be re-identified, and show that almost all userscan be de-anonymised with a high success rate. Finally, weapply different location privacy protection mechanisms (LPPMs),applying spatial filtering, temporal cloaking, adding spatial noiseto mobility data, or using generalisation, and analyse the impactof these mechanisms on both the uniqueness of users’ mobilitytraces and the outcome of the <b>de-anonymisation</b> attack. We showthat spatially obfuscating mobility data is not enough to protectusers, and that classical LPPMs are not able to protect usersagainst a <b>de-anonymisation</b> attack. We finally conclude this paperby drawing some insights towards future spatio-temporal LPPMs...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} {{personal}} {{information is available}} digitally, both collected by organisations and published by individuals. People may attempt to protect their privacy by avoiding to provide uniquely identifying information and by providing different information in different places; however, in many cases, such profiles can still be de-anonymised. Techniques from the record linkage literature {{can be used for}} pairwise linking of databases, and for cross-correlation based on these pairwise results. However, the privacy implications of these techniques in the on-line setting are not clear: existing experiments depend on quasi-identifiers and do not focus on cross-correlation. This paper studies the problem of <b>de-anonymisation</b> and, in particular, cross-correlation of multiple databases using only non-identifying information in an on-line setting...|$|E
40|$|Online {{anonymity}} {{has been}} an important element in scholarly debates {{on the role of the}} internet in modern day democracy. Proponents of the right to anonymity argue that it helps secure users' privacy, autonomy and freedom of speech. Critics, on the other hand, see the act of withdrawing identity information as a way to limit or avoid responsibility for one's actions. Despite large amount of evidence that the role of anonymity on the internet is diverse and context sensitive, researchers have observed a unidirectional trend towards its limitation or even complete elimination. The process, which might be called <b>de-anonymisation</b> of online spaces, is influenced by what Lessig (2006) described as four main forces shaping internet’s architecture: law, technology, market and social norms. But it also features at the level of discourse, which so far has received very little academic attention. The meanings, values and power struggles underlying the debate on online anonymity have also been largely ignored in Central and Eastern European contexts. In order to close this gap, this study examines a case from Poland, in which an identity of an anonymous blogger was revealed by a mainstream newspaper. It also investigates the broader characteristics of the coverage of online anonymity in the Polish press. By employing content and discourse analyses, and drawing on the work of critical internet scholars, it offers first empirical evidence that newspapers in Poland can be agents of <b>de-anonymisation.</b> Specifically, the findings reveal the debate on online anonymity is characterised by four key conflicts: 1) a conflict over the status of journalists and internet users in online deliberation; 2) a conflict over the vision of the digital public sphere; 3) a conflict over Poland's democratisation process; and 4) a conflict of values underlying perceptions of online anonymity...|$|E
40|$|The use of anonymity-based {{infrastructures}} and anonymisers is {{a plausible}} solution to mitigate privacy {{problems on the}} Internet. Tor (short for The onion router) is a popular low-latency anonymity system that can be installed as an end-user application {{on a wide range}} of operating systems to redirect the traffic through a series of anonymising proxy circuits. The construction of these circuits determines both the latency and the anonymity degree of the Tor anonymity system. While some circuit construction strategies lead to delays which are tolerated for activities like Web browsing, they can make the system vulnerable to linking attacks. We evaluate in this paper three classical strategies for the construction of Tor circuits, with respect to their <b>de-anonymisation</b> risk and latency performance. We then develop a new circuit selection algorithm that considerably reduces the success probability of linking attacks while keeping a good degree of performance. We finally conduct experiments on a real-world Tor deployment over PlanetLab. Our experimental results confirm the validity of our strategy and its performance increase for Web browsing.
