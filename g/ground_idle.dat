2500|$|The {{first officer}} {{called for the}} arming of the {{spoilers}} one second after touchdown, and the commander armed them half a second later. Two seconds later the first officer called [...] "no spoilers" [...] as the spoiler indicator light had not switched on. He then verified the hydraulic pressure and that the switch was set correctly. Meanwhile, the commander had switched the thrust levers from flight idle to <b>ground</b> <b>idle,</b> and six seconds after touchdown activated the wheel brakes. From 12.8 seconds after touchdown various screeching sounds can be heard from the tires. The braking took place nominally until halfway down the runway. From this point the pilots reported that nominal retardation did not occur. The commander attempted to use the brake pedals to apply full braking, without effect. He then moved the brake lever from green to yellow and subsequently emergency brake, disconnecting the anti-lock. Witnesses observed smoke and spray emitted from the landing gear.|$|E

[...] They said that the riot [...] "forever made the match memorable {{in the annals of}} New South Wales cricket", and lamented the fact that [...] "rowdyism became rampant {{for the rest of the}} afternoon". The paper asked the {{question}} [...] "What will they say in England?" [...] Wisden condemned the unrest as a [...] "deplorably disgraceful affair" [...] and described the spectators as a [...] "rough and excited mob". Richard Driver of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) issued a statement of regret for what had happened to the tourists.|$|R
50|$|His very {{sensible}} {{discourse on}} ‘Foolish Talking and Jesting described and condemned', is of moment {{in view of}} his own practice and repute. Briefly, he contends that ‘no jesting is lawful but what is medicinal, and restorative of spirits for nobler thoughts’. In theology, he was Calvinistical. Burgess’s last years were damped by the defection from his flock and by sickness. ‘If I must be idle,’ he said, ‘I had rather be <b>idle</b> under <b>ground</b> than <b>idle</b> above ground.' He died on 26 January 1713, and was buried on 31 January, in the church of St. Clement Danes. Matthew Henry preached his funeral sermon.|$|R

[...] "Come, let's get on; you'll want your dinner, and it's getting dark." [...] So they cantered on, and got off their horses at the gate, without another word. And not another word was spoken on the subject that night. Harry was very silent, {{walking up and down}} the veranda with his pipe in his mouth--not lying on the <b>ground</b> in <b>idle</b> enjoyment--and there was no reading. The two sisters looked at him from time to time with wistful, anxious-eyes, half afraid to disturb him by speech.|$|R
50|$|Noticed by the {{abnormal}} {{situation on}} the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> during flight by the function of Electric Magnetic Lock Systems and Mechanical Power Lever Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} electric magnetic lock system (Power Lever lock) was on open position. With power lever lock on open position, the solenoid of the electric magnetic lock system disengage and allow the power lever moves to <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|E

50|$|After the {{creation}} of the Irish Free State, and therefore the removal of the British Army, the <b>ground</b> lay <b>idle</b> for 3 years before League of Ireland club Brideville began using the ground in 1925. In 1930 Brideville were forced to move to Harolds Cross Greyhound Stadium to accommodate St Patrick's Athletic moving in. St. Pats continues to use and develop the ground until 1951 when they entered the League of Ireland. The league deemed the ground unsuitable and St. Pats were forced to use a variety of grounds in Dublin as they fought to upgrade Richmond Park. In 1960, after serious development, the ground played host to St Pats first home league game in Inchicore. The ground closed for redevelopment in May 1989, however due to St Pats hitting financially difficulties they did not return until 5 December 1993.|$|R

50|$|As {{long as the}} LP turbine remains choked, {{there is}} no {{significant}} change in HP turbine pressure ratio (or deltaH/T) and flow. Once, however, the LP turbine unchokes, the HP turbine deltaH/T starts to decrease. Eventually the HP turbine unchokes, causing its flow capacity to start to fall. <b>Ground</b> <b>Idle</b> is often reached shortly after HPT unchoke.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{then turned}} on the pilot who flew the plane, First Officer Vunpin. First Officer Vunpin have some {{experiences}} of delay on moving the power lever to <b>Ground</b> <b>Idle</b> during landing. On the accident flight, he aware to previous experienced and lifted the mechanical power lever stop slots during approach. He realized that he retarded the Power Lever backward at about 70 ft of aircraft altitude and unintentionally entered the Beta Range. Interviews with First Officer Vunpin revealed that he have some experiences of delay on moving the power lever to <b>Ground</b> <b>Idle</b> during landing. This experience became his belief (cognitive). First Officer Vunpin has been planned to do the flight check to be qualified First Officer, {{and he wanted to}} prove that he was qualified as a First Officer. Knowing that he had repeated the errors in the past flights, he tried to prove that he had overcome his errors. However, he unintentionally moved the power lever beyond flight idle (behavioral). The aircraft lost lift and subsequently crashed.|$|E
5000|$|... 10 July 2014: An ATR 72-500, tail number 5H-PWA, {{was halfway}} {{en route to}} Dar es Salaam from Mwanza during normal cruise when the number 2 engine seized. This necessitated a {{diversion}} to Kilimanjaro International Airport. The aircraft touched down normally; however, after selecting <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> (as per the captain's explanation), the aircraft veered {{to the left side}} and exited the runway hitting one of the runway edge lights and proceeded to roll on the grass field parallel to runway 09 for approximately 180 meters before subsequently regaining the runway. No injuries were reported.|$|E
50|$|Various state-run {{development}} projects were abandoned, including some which were nearly complete. These included manufacturing and refining operations under state control {{which would have}} competed with foreign business interests. A plan to stockpile cocoa (the top export at the time) {{in order to take}} improve Ghana's position in the world market, was canceled; the nearly-built silos, intended to accomplish this goal, allowed to fall into disrepar. Agricultural projects were privatized or canceled and newly purchased equipment left in fields to rust. Overall spending on agriculture decreased by 35%. A fleet of fishing boats were <b>grounded</b> to lie <b>idle</b> and deteriorating—leading the country to begin importing foreign fish.

5|$|Liverpool Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Liverpool, Merseyside, which competes {{in the top}} tier of English football, for the 2015–16 season. The club was formed in 1892 following a disagreement between the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. The dispute over rent resulted in Everton leaving Anfield for Goodison Park, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Not content for his <b>ground</b> to lay <b>idle,</b> he created his own club: Liverpool. Liverpool joined the Lancashire League on their foundation before the 1892–93 season. They ended their inaugural season as league champions, and were elected to The Football League soon afterwards. The club remained in The Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League.|$|R
50|$|The 19th-century {{academic}} {{debate on}} cousin marriage developed differently in Europe and America. The writings of Scottish deputy commissioner for lunacy Arthur Mitchell claiming that cousin marriage had injurious {{effects on offspring}} were largely contradicted by researchers such as Alan Huth and George Darwin. In fact, Mitchell's own data did not support his hypotheses and he later speculated that the dangers of consanguinity might be partly overcome by proper living. Later studies by George Darwin found results that resemble those estimated today. His father, Charles Darwin, who did marry his first cousin, had initially speculated that cousin marriage might pose serious risks, but perhaps {{in response to his}} son's work, these thoughts were omitted from a later version of the book they published. When a question about cousin marriage was eventually considered in 1871 for the census, according to George Darwin, it was rejected on the <b>grounds</b> that the <b>idle</b> curiosity of philosophers was not to be satisfied.|$|R
5000|$|The captain, faced {{now with}} a sudden time {{pressure}} and all mechanical locks being removed, and {{with his hand on}} the power levers, may have unintentionally moved the power levers further backwards, passing through the <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> position, towards full reverse. This shift to reverse power triggered a propeller overspeed that was heard and noticed by the crew. Feeling a tremendous increase in drag and a sudden deceleration, one of the crew members retracted the flaps. The power levers were then moved forward, but it was too late. A few seconds later, the aircraft crashed into the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} point for the transient is some steady state point (e.g. <b>Ground</b> <b>Idle,</b> Sea Level Static, ISA). A ramp of fuel flow versus time is, for instance, fed into the model to simulate, say, a slam acceleration (or deceleration). The transient calculation is first undertaken for time zero, with the steady state fuel flow as the engine match, which should result in zero excess turbine power. By definition, the first transient calculation should reproduce the datum steady state point. The fuel flow for '''''' is calculated from the fuel flow ramp and is used as the revised engine match in the next transient iterative calculation. This process is repeated until the transient simulation is completed.|$|E
50|$|The Captain {{decided to}} perform a go-around. However, the copilot did not react and instead {{continued}} with the approach checklist, placing the <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> stop in the OFF position, this being the last action on the checklist. This misunderstanding probably resulted {{from the lack of}} preparation for the approach. While the captain ordered a go-around, the crew did begin the process, and so the decision did not result in significant action. Instead, the crew realized that they had deviated from the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). This seems to have caused confusion in the cockpit. Although the Captain continued the approach, he didn't call for flaps and gear. In addition, he waited for several seconds before putting the aircraft into descent.|$|E
50|$|The South Philadelphia {{site was}} {{selected}} to gain a benefit from a larger development concept for the area near JFK Stadium. The area was the former site of the United States 1926 celebration, the Sesqui-Centennial an exposition of 20th-century technology and American life demolished in 1927. In the years following, ideas were percolating about {{a portion of the}} exposition <b>grounds.</b> It remained <b>idle</b> until a 1960s development plan for a modern sports and entertainment complex at the apex of Broad Street and Packer Avenue was realized with the eventual demolition of the historically remembered Municipal Stadium (a last remaining structure of the Sesqui-Centennial Expo and the event site of the annual Army/Navy Game) then renamed in 1964, JFK Stadium, in honor of the then recently assassinated president John F.

60|$|As he had {{sometimes}} felt, {{gazing up}} from the deck at midnight into the boundless starlit depths overhead, in a rapture of devout wonder at that endless brightness and beauty--in some such a way now, the depth of this pure devotion (which was, for the first time, revealed to him) quite smote upon him, and filled his heart with thanksgiving. Gracious God, who was he, weak and friendless creature, that such a love should be poured out upon him? Not in vain--not in vain has he lived--hard and thankless should he be to think so--that has such a treasure given him. What is ambition compared to that, but selfish vanity? To be rich, to be famous? What do these profit a year hence, when other names sound louder than yours, when you lie hidden away under the <b>ground,</b> along with <b>idle</b> titles engraven on your coffin? But only true love lives after you--follows your memory with secret blessing--or precedes you, and intercedes for you.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that when the Census Act, 1871, was passing through the House of Commons, an attempt was made by Sir J. Lubbock, Dr Playfair, and others, to have a {{question}} inserted with respect to the prevalence of cousin marriages, under the idea that when we were in possession of such statistics {{we should be able to}} arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to whether these marriages are, as has been suspected, deleterious to the bodily and mental constitution of the offspring. It is unfortunately equally well known that the proposal was rejected, amidst the scornful laughter of the House, on the <b>ground</b> that the <b>idle</b> curiosity of philosophers was not to be satisfied. It was urged, that when we had these statistics it would be possible to discover, by inquiry in asylums, whether the percentage of the offspring of consanguineous marriages amongst the diseased was greater than that in the healthy population, and thus to settle the question as to the injuriousness of such marriages. The difficulty of this subsequent part of the inquiry was, I fear, much underrated by those who advocated the introduction of these questions into the census. It may possibly have been right to reject the proposal on the ground that every additional question diminishes the trustworthiness of the answers to the rest, but in any case the tone taken by many members of the House shows how little they are permeated with the idea of the importance of inheritance to the human race. In the summer of 1873 the idea occurred to me that it might be in some measure possible to fill up this hiatus in our national statistics.

5000|$|In the DHC-6, {{there is}} a mode called as [...] "beta", where the crews could control the {{propeller}} pitch directly. There are two ranges of beta; {{the first one is}} a range from + 17° to + 11°, called “approach beta” and permitted in flight. In this range, the propellers are tractive. The second one is a range from + 11° to - 15°, called “reverse beta” which is prohibited in flight. In this range, the propellers act as brakes, two different sub-ranges being identifiable: <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> and traction reversal. If the reverse beta was retracted in mid-air, based on the manufacturer, this could produce a high amount of drag which would result in a significant loss of speed. Subsequently, the plane could lose its lift.|$|E

40|$|Techniques were {{evaluated}} {{to determine if}} simple combustor modifications {{could be used to}} reduce the engine <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> emissions of a double annular combustor designed for Mach 3. 0 cruise operation. These techniques were radial fuel staging, the use of radial-inflow rather than axial-flow air swirlers, and the optimization of fuel-nozzle spray angle and differential pressure. Radial fuel staging and the use of radial-inflow air swirlers significantly improved performance at two <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> test conditions simulating both low- and high-compression ratio engines...|$|E
40|$|IT is a known {{fact that}} {{aircraft}} noise and fuel emissions {{are the most}} constraining factors {{for the growth of}} aviation. Continuous Descent Arrivals (CDAs) provide significant reductions in fuel consumption and noise footprint on the <b>ground,</b> by following <b>idle</b> thrust descent and eliminating low altitude leveling off. However, limitations such as unpredictability of the trajectory and separation management for CDAs prevent wide-spread implementation. The thesis focuses on overcoming some of these limitations. Optimal control theory is used to optimize the descent trajectory of the aircraft by using fuel and time as the performance index. The problem is formulated as amulti-phase optimal control and is solved by using a pseudospectral method. The theory is also the backbone of General Pseudospectral OPtimal Control Software (GPOPS). The main focus of the thesis is to enable multi-aircraft trajectory optimization for CDAs and ensure sufficient separation between all aircraft along the entire trajectory by implementing the separation algorithm. The possibility of using both distance based and the time based separation is explored in detail. It is demonstrated using Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) airport’s real-time inbound flight data that it is feasible to apply the separation algorithm to separate aircraft along the entire lateral path while still being able to performCDAs during the peak and non-peak periods. All the limitations pertaining to the separation algorithmare analyzed and discussed in detail. By addressing some of these shortcomings, the simulation environment can be improved to bring itmore close to a real-time scenario. Although a lot of other factors have to be considered for a practical wide-spread implementation, success of this method will result in the aircraft trajectory being more predictable to the ground controller, effectively addressing one of the major shortcomings of CDAs. On a more important note, the success of this method will also result in reduced noise footprint and fuel consumption by aircraft, benefiting both the environment and airlines.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of air-flow {{shifting}} between the pilot and main stages of a staged lean jet engine burner were investigated. A fluidic element attached {{in front of the}} swirlers was used to alter the air-flow split ratio between them, and the swirler and nozzle exit-section pressure loss behind the fluidic element was measured using an atmospheric isothermal test. The fluidic element did not fully recover the pressure loss in the burner inlet. However, it can also affect the losses, and cause an air shift between the pilot and main stage. Therefore, further combustion tests were conducted under two operating conditions: <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> at 7 % maximum take-off thrust and scaled cruise condition. Under <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> conditions, increased pilot air flow improved the combustion efficiency for high fuel flow, and reduced pilot air flow improved it for low fuel flow.
