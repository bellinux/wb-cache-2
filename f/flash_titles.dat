50|$|The Flash: Fastest Man Alive {{was started}} with the first seven issues written by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo (producers of the 1990s Flash TV series) with art by Ken Lashley.

A major shakeup occurred when The Flash would inadvertently kill his wife's murderer, the Reverse-Flash, in The Flash #324 (Aug. 1983). [...] This led to an extended storyline titled [...] "The Trial of the Flash" [...] in which the hero must face the repercussions of his actions.

[...] Describing the first reconstruction attempt in 1975, Everson made it clear that reassembling the available material into a viewable form was a far from trivial task: [...] "A few years ago all that existed of this film were rolls and rolls of negative sections, in which every take--not every sequence, but every take--were sic jumbled out of order, with only a few <b>flash</b> <b>titles</b> for guidance ... and a script that in many ways differed from the play, adding to the herculean task of putting it all together." ...|$|E

5000|$|The series {{presented}} metafictional stories featuring comics creators appearing {{within the}} Flash's adventures {{such as the}} [...] "Flash [...] - [...] Fact Or Fiction" [...] in issue #179 in which the Flash finds himself on [...] "Earth Prime". He contacts the [...] "one man on Earth who might believe his fantastic story and give him the money he needs. The editor of that Flash comic mag !" [...] Julius Schwartz helps the Flash build a cosmic treadmill {{so that he can}} return home. [...] Several years later, the series' longtime writer Cary Bates wrote himself into the story in issue #228. Four months after the cancellation of his own title, Green Lantern began a backup feature in The Flash #217 (Aug.-Sept. 1972) and appeared in most issues through The Flash #246 (Jan. 1977) until his own solo series was revived. Schwartz, who had edited the title since 1959, left the series as of issue #269 (January 1979). Bates wrote The Flash #275 (July 1979) wherein the title character's wife, Iris West Allen was killed. Don Heck became the artist of the series with issue #280 (Dec. 1979) and drew it until #295 (March 1981). The Flash #300 (Aug. 1981) was in the Dollar Comics format and featured a story by Bates and Infantino. Doctor Fate was featured in a series of back-up stories in The Flash from #306 (Feb. 1982) to #313 (Sept. 1982) written by Martin Pasko and Steve Gerber and drawn by Keith Giffen. A major shakeup occurred in the title in the mid-1980s. The Flash inadvertently kills his wife's murderer, the Reverse-Flash, in The Flash #324 (Aug. 1983). [...] This led to an extended storyline titled [...] "The Trial of the Flash" [...] in which the hero must face the repercussions of his actions. Bates became the editor as well as the writer of The <b>Flash</b> <b>title</b> during this time and oversaw it until its cancellation in 1985. [...] "The Trial of the Flash" [...] was collected in a volume of the Showcase Presents series in 2011.|$|R
