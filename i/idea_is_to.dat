5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the {{development}} of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group {{in which the individual}} {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E
25|$|Levitsky's <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} black bishop move again.|$|E
50|$|The main <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> unite all {{organizations}} {{through the}} years into one Ultras Organization.|$|R
50|$|Pico {{should be}} {{interpreted}} as 'small', the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a small language for educational purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{have four}} teams playing, including England and Scotland, but this <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> quickly {{replaced with a}} match between France and the United States.|$|R
25|$|Combi Coupé: A 2-door, 4-seat {{car with}} {{hatchback}} door at rear and, collapsible rear seats, resembling a fastback. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maximize the carrying capacity without bargaining on the performance.|$|E
25|$|Counterbalance rappelling — Used {{typically}} by {{a leader}} {{to reach an}} injured second. <b>Idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> rappel off on one strand of rope, using the incapacitated second's weight on the other strand of the rope to counterbalance.|$|E
25|$|Variations in the Solvay process {{have been}} {{proposed}} for carbon sequestration. One <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> react carbon dioxide, produced perhaps by the combustion of coal, to form solid carbonates (such as sodium bicarbonate) that could be permanently stored, thus avoiding carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The director's <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> shoot {{one minute}} {{each day and}} edit the footage down to ninety minutes.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Straith {{gained the}} {{attention}} of Walter P. Chrysler, and the knobs and handles of the 1937 Dodge were designed for safety. Some of Straiths <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incorporated into the 1948 Tucker Sedan.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} {{resilient}} wheel. This function is now {{provided by the}} pneumatic tyre.|$|R
25|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} out lattice spins iteratively, {{generating a}} flow in couplings. But now the couplings are lattice energy coefficients. The {{fact that a}} continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.|$|E
25|$|Direct modelling, after Woodard. Here the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{estimate}} subsurface {{flows from}} direct inversion of the frequency-wavenumber correlations {{seen in the}} wavefield in the Fourier domain. Woodard gave a practical demonstration of {{the ability of the}} technique to recover near-surface flows from the f-mode part of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Mirror mazes, {{often found}} in {{amusement}} parks as well, contain large numbers of mirrors and sheets of glass. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> navigate the disorientating array without bumping into the walls. Mirrors in attractions like this are often made of Plexiglas as to assure {{that they do not}} break.|$|E
50|$|Originally, the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} Country Buggy an amphibious vehicle, however {{directives}} from VW Germany curtailed this vision.|$|R
60|$|Snap sprang forward. His one <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{save his}} chum, {{and he did}} not think of his own peril.|$|R
5000|$|She {{said the}} basic <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> look like [...] "a not very {{interesting}} man from a not very interesting country".|$|R
25|$|More technically, the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{start with}} a well-understood {{manifold}} M and perform surgery on it to produce a manifold M ′ having some desired property, {{in such a way}} that the effects on the homology, homotopy groups, or other interesting invariants of the manifold are known.|$|E
25|$|Counter attacking Football {{involves}} a team withdrawing players {{into their own}} half but ensuring that one or two players {{are committed to the}} attack. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> try to get strikers isolated from the defenders by lurking on the halfway line, and to create space for a quick break.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the season}} proper starts (usually from early November in the {{northern}} hemisphere, or May in the southern hemisphere), the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> drive the fox from the covert and pursue the scent that it leaves for long distances over open countryside. The northern hemisphere season continues through to March or April.|$|E
50|$|One of Wolley's <b>ideas</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} census {{of all the}} birds of Britain, an idea that foreshadowed bird atlases.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} finite differences is in numerical analysis, especially in numerical differential equations, which {{aim at the}} numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations respectively. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> replace the derivatives appearing in the differential equation by finite differences that approximate them. The resulting methods are called finite difference methods.|$|E
25|$|The ATLAS {{detector}} is {{complemented by}} a set of detectors in the very forward region. These detectors are located in the LHC tunnel far away from the interaction point. The basic <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measure elastic scattering at very small angles in order to produce better measurements of the absolute luminosity at the ATLAS interaction point.|$|E
25|$|Wu {{transformed}} the optical energy from low powered {{light emitting diodes}} (LED) into electrical energy via a photoconductive surface. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> allow the LED to {{switch on and off}} the photoconductive material via its fine projection. As the optical pattern can be easily transformable through optical projection, this method allows a high flexibility of switching different optical landscapes.|$|E
50|$|Another project <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use C-130 {{aircraft}} and altering them to drop biodegradable cones filled with fertilizer and saplings over hard-to-access areas.|$|R

25|$|A European patent (EP1369126A1) in 2003 by Bork records {{a method}} used for {{prevention}} of cancers {{and for the}} curative treatment of cancers and precancers such as DNA-mismatch repair deficient (MMR) sporadic tumours and HNPCC associated tumours. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use immunotherapy with combinatorial mixtures of tumour-specific frameshift mutation-derived peptides to elicit a cytotoxic T-cell response specifically directed against tumour cells.|$|E
25|$|A better {{solution}} was proposed {{as long ago}} as 1980 by Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA Maryland, USA) who called their device a 'dynapod'. Their <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> re-engineer common Home appliance with small (fractional – less than 1-horsepower) electric motors (c. 500W – 1000W) which are used for short periods, for example food mixers, grinding machines, hand-held power-drills and light wood-working equipment.|$|E
25|$|After {{this bit}} of fun to warm up the crowd the Sway Hood is then thrown up in the air. The rugby type scrum (or Sway to give it its {{official}} title) then converges on the Hood and the game starts in earnest. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get the Sway Hood {{into one of the}} four pubs in either Haxey or Westwoodside.|$|E
