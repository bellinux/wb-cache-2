500|$|Heigl {{declined}} {{to put her}} name forward for consideration at the 2008 Emmy Awards, claiming {{that she had been}} given insufficient material on the series to warrant a nomination. Following Heigl's statement, speculation arose that her character would suffer a brain tumor and be killed off Grey's Anatomy, substantiated by the announcement Jeffrey Dean Morgan would return to the series as Denny, who died at the end of season two. ABC's entertainment president Steve McPherson denied the rumor, stating: [...] "There is an unbelievable storyline for her this year, which is really central to everything that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> this season".|$|E
500|$|Legislation for {{a silver}} fifty-cent piece {{and a gold}} one-dollar piece in {{commemoration}} of the 150th anniversaries of the Battle of Bennington and of the independence of Vermont {{was introduced in the}} Senate by that state's Frank Greene on January 9, 1925. Greene had not always been a friend to commemorative coins: when the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar was debated in 1922, he commented, [...] "the question is whether the United States Government is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] His bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. Greene, a member of that committee, reported the bill back to the Senate on January 20, with an amendment and a recommendation that it pass. The amendment deleted the proposed one-dollar piece and increased the mintage of the half dollar from 20,000 to 40,000. On January 24, New Hampshire's George H. Moses, acting on Greene's behalf, moved that the Senate consider the bill, and it passed that body without opposition.|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [...] {{to be able to}} go be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|Realizing that Congress {{might not}} pass {{legislation}} for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event {{with a major}} anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. [...] The obvious candidate was the Boston Tea Party of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode [...] "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles". On December18, 1922, California Congressman Walter Franklin Lineberger introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. [...] Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, {{out of the hands}} of European powers. [...] The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, and in the Senate by Vermont's Frank Greene, who stated, [...] "it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The question is whether the United States government is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000pieces was authorized.|$|E

500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E
500|$|On the April 13, 2017 {{edition of}} The Juggalo Show with Jumpsteady, Violent J, and Kevin Gill, {{it was said}} by Violent J that {{recently}} he has pushed his solo album Karma Forest back because he has [...] "been consumed with the entity that is the next Joker Card" [...] also saying [...] "I am finding out more about it everyday {{and it may be}} the best entity in the Dark Carnival yet". He stated [...] "The only thing that I can say about it is Red Fred, Red Fred".

While Shaggy 2 Dope is on tour Violent J is going to form the skeleton of the next Joker Card, and when Shaggy 2 Dope gets back from tour, then they will start putting the [...] "nerves, muscle, tissue, skin etc. together and then bring the entity to life".

In late April/early May Necro announced that he will not take part in the Juggalo March On Washington nor would he take part in The Parental Advisory Tour stating in part [...] "It's all good between us, just business. They were wanting me to tour for a month basically for free". On May 26, 2017 when F.T.F.O.M.F. was released, the song [...] "Foggin' Up The Window" [...] caught a lot of [...] "Juggalo Theorists" [...] attention because of Violent J's verse saying [...] "Now my number 4 is all red, Red Fred, Red Fred", believing that to be the name of the next Joker Card, or possibly it's what is said to [...] "summon" [...] the entity, going back to the April 13, 2017 edition of The Juggalo Show. [...] "Fearless Fred Fury" [...] was revealed as the name of the next Joker Card at their Hallowicked show.|$|E
