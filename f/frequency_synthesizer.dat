Many types of <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizer</b> are available as integrated circuits, reducing cost and size.

25|$|In digital {{wireless}} communication systems (GSM, CDMA etc.), PLLs {{are used to}} provide the local oscillator up-conversion during transmission and down-conversion during reception. In most cellular handsets this function has been largely integrated into a single integrated circuit {{to reduce the cost}} and size of the handset. However, due to the high performance required of base station terminals, the transmission and reception circuits are built with discrete components to achieve the levels of performance required. GSM local oscillator modules are typically built with a <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizer</b> integrated circuit and discrete resonator VCOs.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} {{this type of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizer</b> cannot operate over a very wide range of frequencies, because the comparator will have a limited bandwidth and may suffer from aliasing problems. This would lead to false locking situations, or an inability to lock at all. In addition, {{it is hard to}} make a high frequency VCO that operates over a very wide range. This is due to several factors, but the primary restriction is the limited capacitance range of varactor diodes. However, in most systems where a synthesizer is used, we are not after a huge range, but rather a finite number over some defined range, such as a number of radio channels in a specific band.|$|E

40|$|Two {{documents}} {{discuss a}} breadboard version of advanced transponders that, when fully developed, would be installed on future spacecraft {{to fly in}} deep space. These transponders {{will be required to}} be capable of operation on any deepspace- communications uplink frequency channel between 7, 145 and 7, 235 MHz, and any downlink frequency channel between 8, 400 and 8, 500 MHz. The document focuses on the design and operation of <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> for the receiver and transmitter. Heretofore, <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> in deep-space transponders have been based on dielectric resonator oscillators (DROs), which do not have the wide tuning bandwidth necessary to tune over all channels in the uplink or downlink frequency bands. To satisfy the requirement for tuning bandwidth, the present <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> are based on voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) phase-locked loops (PLLs) implemented by use of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) implemented using inGaP heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technology. MMIC VCO PLL <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> similar to the present ones have been used in commercial and military applications but, until now, have exhibited too much phase noise for use in deep-space transponders. The present <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> contain advanced MMIC VCOs, which use HBT technology and have lower levels of flicker (1 /f) phase noise. When these MMIC VCOs are used with high-speed MMIC frequency dividers, it becomes possible to obtain the required combination of frequency agility and low phase noise...|$|R
40|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> are an {{essential}} building block of RF communication products. They {{can be found}} in traditional consumer products, in personal communication systems, and in optical communication equipment. Since <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers</b> are used in many different applications, different performance aspects may need to be considered in each case. The main body of the text describes a conceptual framework for analyzing the performance of PLL <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizers,</b> and presents optimization procedures for the different performance aspects. The analysis of the PLL properties is performed {{with the use of the}} open-loop bandwidth and phase margin concepts, to enable the influence of higher-order poles to be taken into account from the beginning of the design process. The theoretical system analysis is complemented by descriptions of innovative system and building block architectures, by circuit implementations in bipolar and CMOS technologies, and by measurement results.

25|$|The key to {{the ability}} of a <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizer</b> to {{generate}} multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually {{in the form of a}} digital counter, with the output signal acting as a clock signal. The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a digital system.|$|E
25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based <b>frequency</b> <b>synthesizer.</b>|$|E
