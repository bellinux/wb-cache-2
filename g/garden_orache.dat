500|$|Green borscht (...) , a light soup {{made from}} leaf vegetables, {{is an example}} common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. The {{naturally}} tart-tasting sorrel is most commonly used, but spinach, chard, nettle, <b>garden</b> <b>orache</b> and occasionally dandelion, goutweed or ramsons, may be added as well, especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed. Like beetroot borscht, {{it is based on}} meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled with dill. There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots.|$|E
5000|$|Atriplex hortensis L. [...] - [...] <b>Garden</b> <b>Orache,</b> Red Orach, Mountain Spinach, French Spinach: in Asia, {{cultivated}} or naturalized in Europe ...|$|E
5000|$|The favored {{species for}} human {{consumption}} is now usually <b>Garden</b> <b>Orache</b> (A. hortensis), but many species are edible {{and the use of}} Atriplex as food is known since at least the late Epipaleolithic (Mesolithic).|$|E
50|$|Atriplex hortensis, {{also known}} as <b>garden</b> <b>orache,</b> red orach, {{mountain}} spinach, French spinach, or simply orache or arrach, is a Eurasian species of plant in the amaranth family (for many years classified in the goosefoot family, now absorbed in the amaranth family). It is native to Asia and Europe, and widely naturalized in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>orache</b> has a salty, spinach-like taste. The {{leaves are}} used cooked or in salads. It was {{commonly}} grown in Mediterranean regions from early times until spinach became the more favored leaf vegetable. The leaves appear in red, white and green varieties. It is commonly grown as a warm-weather alternative to spinach {{because it is}} more tolerant of heat and slower to bolt in warm weather. The green leaves were once used to color pasta in Italy. Another common use of orach is to balance out the acidic flavor of sorrel.|$|E

50|$|Sorrel soup is a soup {{made from}} water or broth, sorrel leaves, and salt. Varieties {{of the same}} soup include spinach, <b>garden</b> <b>orache,</b> chard, nettle, and {{occasionally}} dandelion, goutweed or ramsons, together with or instead of sorrel. It is known in Ashkenazi Jewish, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian cuisines. Its other English names, spelled variously schav, shchav, shav, or shtshav, are borrowed from the Yiddish language, which in turn derives from Polish szczaw. The latter together with its Eastern Slavic cognates (Belarusian шчаўе, Russian and Ukrainian щавель, shchavel) comes ultimately from the Proto-Slavic ščаvь for sorrel. Due to its commonness as a soup in Eastern European cuisines, it is often called green borscht, as a cousin of the standard, reddish-purple beetroot borscht. In Russia, where shchi (along with or rather than borscht) has been the staple soup, sorrel soup is also called green shchi. In old Russian cookbooks it was called simply green soup.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{measuring}} {{the content of}} chosen phenolic substances in some specimen of the genera Chenopodium L. and Atriplex L. Two independent analytical methods {{were used to determine}} the content of phenolic substances, namely the Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary Chromatography (MECC) method and the High - Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. Two cultured species of the genera Spinacia and Atriplex, three freely growing specimen of the genus Chenopodium and three freely growing species of the genus Atriplex were analysed. The analysis concerned the leaves and the inflorescence of these species. The total content of quercetin and rutin was determined by the MECC method. The highest total content of quercetin was found in the leaves of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Orache</b> (4240 mg/kg of dry matter), the lowest total content of quercetin was found in the inflorescence of the Atriplex prostrata DC. (19. 6 mg/kg of dry matter). Rutin was only found in four samples, the rest of the samples contained rutin in quantities below the limit of quantification. The highest content of rutin was found in the leaves of the Lamb´s Quarters (868 mg/kg of dry matter) ...|$|E
