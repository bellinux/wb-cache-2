40|$|This paper investigates actual Venture Capital (VC) {{decision}} making as it occurs {{over time in}} its natural decision environment. Our qualitative analysis {{is based on a}} comprehensive, longitudinal data set comprising 11  years of archival data from a European-based VC firm. During this time, the VC managed two funds, reviewed a total of 3631 deals, and made 35 investments. By adopting this research methodology, we can overcome several limitations of post-hoc methods and experiments commonly used in this research stream, and also have the opportunity to tackle some fundamental, yet hitherto elusive research topics. For example, our findings reveal how the importance of <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> varies between different stages of the evaluation process. They also show how VC portfolio composition and VC management time serve as important, yet to-date largely neglected <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria.</b> Implications for research and practice are outlined.

(Financial Management) This study aims to {{determine}} whether South African do-it-yourself listed share investors consider selected strategic investment <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> in their investment processes. It also aims {{to determine}} whether South African do-it-yourself listed share investors’ decision-making is affected by selected behavioural bias. A quantitative research approach was adopted, and an electronic questionnaire was emailed to a convenience sample consisting of individuals who are employed at three financial institutions within the Gauteng region. The demographic profile of the convenience sample {{was found to be}} similar to those of previous studies and therefore provided a sound base for comparison and analysis. These results indicated that do-it-yourself listed share investors are in fact considering the selected strategic <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> across the investment process. On assessment of the investor’s behaviour against the selected biases which are commonly associated with listed share investors, it was determined that the respondents, in general, believe that their decision-making is mostly not affected. This study informs the potential do-it-yourself listed share investor of the <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> considered by current investors, as well as potential behavioural biases that could adversely affect their investment decision-making process.

40|$|We use an {{integrated}} assessment model {{of climate change}} to analyze how alternative <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> affect preferred investments into greenhouse gas mitigation, the distribution of outcomes, the robustness of the strategies, and the economic value of information. We define robustness as trading a small decrease in a strategy’s expected performance for {{a significant increase in}} a strategy’s performance in the worst cases. Specifically, we modify the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE- 07) to include a simple representation of a climate threshold response, parametric uncertainty, structural uncertainty, learning, and different <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria.</b> Economic analyses of climate change strategies typically adopt the expected utility maximization (EUM) framework. We compare EUM with two decision criteria adopted from the finance literature, namely Limited Degree of Confidence (LDC) and Safety First (SF). Both criteria increase the relative weight of the performance under the worst-case scenarios compared to EUM. We show that the LDC and SF criteria provide a computationally feasible foundation for identifying greenhouse gas mitigation strategies that may prove more robust than those identified by the EUM criterion. More robust strategies show higher near-term investments in emissions abatement. Reducing uncertainty has a higher economic value of information for the LDC and SF decision criteria than for EUM.

In order to know the practice, methodology, and <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> of Spanish forensic psychologists experienced in family cases, 66 Spanish forensic psychologists (error margin ±. 06) responded to a Spanish adaptation of the questionnaire {{for the assessment of}} child custody evaluation practices by Keilin and Bloom (1986) and Ackerman and Ackerman (1997).

As regards the custody type, most of them chose sole custody. As for <b>decision-making</b> <b>criteria</b> for sole custody, the results showed that Spanish forensic psychologists follow a hierarchical decision-making model that begins, firstly, with the application of criteria concerning the child’s protection (e. g. cruelty, abuse, negligence), then moving on to parental abilities.
