25|$|Allegations arose {{again in}} January 2007 when videos {{circulated}} on the Internet of Abdul appearing to sway <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> slur her speech during {{a set of}} interviews. Abdul's publicist attributed this to fatigue and technical difficulties during the recording of the interviews. It was revealed on the Bravo show Hey Paula, which had followed Abdul with a video camera prior to the interviews, that Abdul had not been sleeping, perhaps suffering from some mild form of insomnia.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E
60|$|Susie settled herself more comfortably <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> lit a cigarette.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> smiling, <b>and</b> {{wrinkling}} <b>her</b> fine, thin nose.|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{disturbed}} {{them and}} the shady room was cool. The smell of heliotrope floated in; one heard the fountain splash and the languid rumble of the surf. Betty leaned back <b>in</b> <b>her</b> revolving <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> Kit lighted a cigarette.|$|R
60|$|They were gone. Ursula {{stood looking}} at the door for some moments. Then she put out the lights. And having done so, she sat down again <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> absorbed <b>and</b> lost. And then she began to cry, bitterly, bitterly weeping: but whether for misery or joy, she never knew.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> glanced appreciatively at the moor.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen started <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{took the}} girl's hand once more.|$|E
60|$|Miss Jethro {{suddenly}} turned <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> looked at Doctor Allday.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a darling you are!" [...] she languidly exclaimed, {{leaning back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "Come <b>and</b> be hugged, or I must come and hug you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Give me back those papers! give me back those papers!' She tore {{them out}} of my hands, and tossed them on her table. Then seating herself defiantly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> great <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> folding <b>her</b> arms, she stabbed me to the heart with the unlooked-for reproach, 'You worldly wretch!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Morel got {{gradually}} worse. At {{first they}} used to carry her downstairs, sometimes even into the garden. She sat propped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> smiling, <b>and</b> so pretty. The gold wedding-ring shone on her white hand; her hair was carefully brushed. And she watched the tangled sunflowers dying, the chrysanthemums coming out, and the dahlias.|$|R
60|$|Honora thrust {{back her}} writing pad, turned <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> faced him.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} his pinched and determined visage.|$|E
60|$|Miss Grandison turned <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> hid {{her face}} with her handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh, pooh!" [...] said Mohi, [...] "who {{does not}} see stars at such times? I see the Great Bear now, and the little one, its cub; and Andromeda, and Perseus' chain-armor, <b>and</b> Cassiopea <b>in</b> <b>her</b> golden <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> the bright, scaly Dragon, and the {{glittering}} Lyre, and all the jewels in Orion's sword-hilt." ...|$|R
50|$|Monkey Island II: LeChuck's Revenge, a PC {{game from}} 1991, {{features}} a notably large library, {{complete with a}} female librarian who wheels around <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> between shelves <b>and</b> shushes the protagonist.|$|R
60|$|The Princess yawned as {{she leaned}} back <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> Both Forrest <b>and</b> De la Borne, who had left his place to turn {{up one of the}} lamps, glanced stealthily round at the speaker.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Dowson, past speech, {{sank back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> stared at him.|$|E
60|$|Wilhelmina turned round <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{laid her}} hand upon the woman's arm.|$|E
60|$|Jeanne leaned {{a little}} forward <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> looked steadfastly at her stepmother.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have given}} me a dreadful fright, Mary," [...] says I, sitting down by <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{beginning}} by this time to feel rather faint after being startled so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{nothing at}} all, my dear," [...] replied the countess, a slight flush {{momentarily}} coloring her already pink cheek. [...] "I was but recalling with admiration those stupendous skyscrapers, {{as they call}} them, of New York," [...] and the fair countess settled herself more comfortably <b>in</b> <b>her</b> steamer <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> resumed the magazine which [...] "nothing at all" [...] had caused her to let fall upon her lap.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile below stairs, Mrs. Bridges {{is sitting}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> crying brokenheartedly, <b>and</b> feeling very guilty, the devastated Bellamy staff stay behind from the servants' outing, and Hudson, using his various contacts, has the undertakers, Mr. Waterman and Mr. Lowe, take her body {{out of the}} house.|$|R
60|$|Annabel {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> laughed till the tears stood in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Van Brandt {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> covered {{her eyes with}} her hands.|$|E
60|$|Grace turned <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> looked wonderingly {{into the}} dim {{corner of the}} room.|$|E
6000|$|The fond {{delusion}} grew quite absorbing, and {{her mind}} was full of it as she sat watching the sun set from her western window and admiring with dreamy eyes the fine effect of the distant hills clear and dark against a daffodil sky when the bang of a door made her sit suddenly erect <b>in</b> <b>her</b> low <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> say with a catch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breath: [...] "He's coming! I must remember what I promised Uncle and be very firm." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} gasp she uttered before I {{caught sight of}} her. She was seated at the table's head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> great wooden <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> Fra Gervasio was pacing the rush-strewn floor <b>in</b> talk with <b>her,</b> {{his hands behind his}} back, his head thrust forward.|$|R
60|$|She {{was sitting}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> on the window-sill {{they saw a}} young man lolling, who rose and stood stock-still, with an almost insolent {{expression}} on his broad, good-looking face. Lennan scrutinized him with interest--about twenty-four he might be, rather dandified, clean-shaved, with crisp dark hair and wide-set hazel eyes, and, as in his photograph, a curious look of daring. His voice, when he vouchsafed a greeting, was rather high and not unpleasant, {{with a touch of}} lazy drawl.|$|R
60|$|Miss Panney {{turned toward}} Mrs. Tolbridge, sat up very {{straight}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> glared.|$|E
60|$|Hunca Munca {{stood up}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> chopped at the ham with another lead knife.|$|E
60|$|Again she was silent. But after {{a moment}} dropped back <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> laughed uneasily.|$|E
6000|$|As {{she entered}} her aunt's room George Voss was sitting before the stove, while Madame Voss was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{accustomed}} <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> Peter was preparing {{the table for}} his young master's dinner. George arose from his seat at once, and then came a look of pain across his face. Marie saw it at once, and almost loved him the more because he suffered. 'I am {{so glad to see}} you, George,' she said. 'I am so glad that you have come.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Marguerite that {{through all the}} noise, all the din of music, dancing, and laughter, she could hear his cat-like tread, gliding through the vast reception-rooms; that she could hear him go down the massive staircase, reach the dining-room and open the door. Fate HAD decided, had made her speak, had made her do a vile and abominable thing, {{for the sake of}} the brother she loved. She lay back <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> passive <b>and</b> still, seeing the figure of her {{relentless}} enemy ever present before her aching eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Trevennack {{sank back}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> very pale <b>and</b> wan. [...] "Oh, {{what shall we}} do if they meet?" [...] she cried, {{wringing}} <b>her</b> hands <b>in</b> despair. [...] "What shall we do if they meet? This is more than I can endure. Eustace, Eustace, I shall break down. My burden's too heavy for me!" ...|$|R
