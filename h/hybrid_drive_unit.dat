40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>drive</b> line concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic drive lines in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel drive hydrid drive line with wheel hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel drive line topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel drive line is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC <b>drive</b> <b>units,</b> which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid drive lines are given...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} of a novel robotic <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> intended as the driving kernel for multi-degree of freedom (dof) parallel manipulators. The transmission system of this unit features a planetary gear train and a ball-screw mechanism. Due to this special transmission design, two driving motors can {{be placed on the}} fixed base, thereby enhancing the load-carrying capacity of the robotic <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> Parallel robots constructed and actuated with the proposed units should exhibit higher load-carrying capacity and faster motion capability, as compared to existing drives. The conceptual design of the unit is first proposed, and a design alternative is then discussed. The application of this novel <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is illustrated by the example of integrating three such <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> into a six-dof parallel manipulator with three Universal-Prismatic-Spherical (UPS) legs. With six actuators installed on the fixed base, such a manipulator can be endowed with high stiffness, high speed, high accuracy and high load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, a testbed is designed in order to verify the kinematic and dynamic performance of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> The kinematic analysis of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> the testbed and the six-dof parallel manipulator is conducted. The CAD modelling and animation results are included to validate the design and the kinematics of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
