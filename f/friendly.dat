5|$|After {{the move}} to Stoney Lane, Albion held four {{exhibition}} games to help {{cover the cost of}} the ground. The first of these was a 4–1 win against Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers on 5 September 1885, in front of 2,122 spectators. Tommy Green scored a hat-trick, including the first goal to be scored at Stoney Lane. As league football had yet to be established, the club also played {{in a number of other}} <b>friendly</b> matches throughout the season. Their 31 <b>friendly</b> matches included 21 wins and 9 defeats, while one match against Bolton Wanderers was abandoned with the game still scoreless. Albion's joint biggest <b>friendly</b> victories of the season were their 7–0 wins against Small Heath Alliance, Aston Unity and Halliwell. The season's heaviest <b>friendly</b> defeat was the 0–7 reverse at home to Preston North End. Albion also took part in the Walsall Senior Cup and Birmingham Charity Cup, but entered a reserve team for both competitions.|$|E

50|$|In February 2012, <b>Friendly's</b> CEO Harsha V. Agadi {{announced}} his resignation. This came {{four months after}} <b>Friendly's</b> filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. On April 12, 2012, <b>Friendly's</b> announced that John Maguire had been named President and CEO.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} side are a group of <b>Friendlies</b> who had been misled into {{supporting}} an abortive local revolution. The <b>Friendlies</b> are led by Jamethon Black, whose engagement Tam had broken years earlier. The <b>Friendlies</b> are hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered. Tam has manipulated the situation so that not only will the <b>Friendlies</b> lose, but their ability to hire out their soldiers will be crippled, possibly leading {{to the end of}} their viability as a culture.|$|R

5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. <b>Friendly,</b> {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. <b>Friendly</b> felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. <b>Friendly</b> resented this move.|$|E
5|$|Babangida {{received}} his first call-up {{to the senior}} Nigeria national team for a pre-World Cup <b>friendly</b> against Romania in 1994. He then played in a <b>friendly</b> against Georgia, but {{did not make the}} final squad for 1994 World Cup.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{the hosts}} Russia, while having already {{qualified}} automatically, {{were to be}} partnered with a five-team Group H, which would have enabled them to play <b>friendlies</b> against these countries on their spare dates (these <b>friendlies</b> would not have counted in the qualifying group standings). However, with the admission of Kosovo and Gibraltar, all groups were filled to contain six teams and the Russia <b>friendlies</b> against Group H teams were cancelled. UEFA vice-president Hryhoriy Surkis said that the UEFA management will be dealing {{with the issue of}} finding opponents for Russia to play <b>friendlies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Olbison {{featured}} {{in one of}} the four pre-season <b>friendlies.</b> He played against Castleford Tigers. He didn't feature in anymore <b>friendlies</b> due to an injury he picked up in the Castleford game.|$|R

50|$|In 2015, BBC Northern Ireland {{acquired}} the live rights to show Northern Ireland's <b>friendlies</b> {{in the run-up}} to UEFA Euro 2016, but the next two subsequent home <b>friendlies</b> against Croatia and New Zealand were on Premier Sports/eirSport.|$|R

5|$|Every year it is {{becoming}} more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their <b>friendly</b> engagements and even arrange <b>friendly</b> matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.|$|E

50|$|Houston did not field a {{professional}} team from 2000 to 2005 but the city's ability to draw big crowds for <b>friendlies</b> {{placed it in}} the conversation to land a Major League Soccer club. Houston had become a hotspot for Mexican First Division club <b>friendlies</b> at Robertson Stadium (the future home of the Dynamo) {{and the opening of}} Reliant Stadium, thanks to the return of an NFL team to Houston in 2002, made it a hot destination to host international <b>friendlies.</b>|$|R
