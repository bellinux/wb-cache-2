500|$|Jonathan Wright, {{writing in}} The Guardian, commended the script of [...] "La Couchette", calling it [...] "a delight, with one line {{delivered}} by Jack Whitehall quite {{possibly the most}} gloriously tasteless you'll hear on television all year". Ferguson offered a similar view, saying that Whitehall delivered [...] "seriously undeliverable lines with entirely believable gusto". Tate said that though he found the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode fairly predictable, the [...] "writing and performances were so engaging that it hardly mattered". The episode was, for him, [...] "inventive" [...] and [...] "deliciously wicked". Similarly, though Billen considered the setting fairly unoriginal and the characters stereotypical, he said that the writers [...] "scored a laugh every few seconds and then a home run with a savage resolution". Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, described [...] "La Couchette" [...] as [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "sharply observed". He commended the cast, saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith [...] "give a mini-masterclass" [...] in their performances. Jones called the episode [...] "toilet humour with a twist", saying that [...] "It was Jorg's grunting and squatting that produced the episode's impressively grotesque climax, but it was Whitehall as Hugo who followed up with the instantly quotable line: 'We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> bigger box!'" [...] Billen commended the cast, and Christine Brandel, writing for entertainment website PopMatters, described Gunning as one of the stand-out guest stars of the second series.|$|E

50|$|That {{was until}} about their 15th anniversary. At that time, Tom began {{questioning}} his life. No longer D.A., he grew {{disgusted with the}} law when {{he was unable to}} keep the innocent Lily Snyder from <b>going</b> <b>to</b> prison. <b>Needing</b> <b>a</b> change of direction, he became a journalist and became close to Emily Stewart. Soon, Tom and Margo's marriage started to fall apart and, when he incorrectly believed that she had an abortion, he ran into the open arms of Emily, who became pregnant and later, gave birth to his son, Daniel. The night that Daniel was conceived, Margo miscarried her and Tom's child. Margo and Tom separated, but he vowed to win back Margo's love. Tom never wavered in his pursuit of Margo, despite all her attempts to push him away. When Tom learned that Margo had been arrested for Alec Wallace's murder, he left the hospital (where he had just come out of a week-long coma) to see her in jail. Tom realized instantly that Margo was innocent and, giving her all his love and support, offered to defend her. In the end, all charges against Margo were dropped and Tom and Margo renewed their wedding vows. Soon after, Tom returned to the law and opened his own practice.|$|R

[...] Poniewozik also noted: [...] "As we get farther into what we usually think of in pop-culture terms as 'the ’60s,' it gets harder even for a show as brilliant as Mad Men to avoid overfamiliar takes", singling out the scene where Don watches Vietnam War news reports.

This is notable because, other than a snippet from a home movie, there is no other footage of Chandler known anywhere.|$|R

He filed and obtained a patent that covered tennis racquets with size 95-135 square inches.
