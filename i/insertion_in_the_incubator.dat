Sound level measurements were obtained in several incubators in use at Portuguese hospitals and in their surrounding nurseries. <b>In</b> each <b>incubator</b> <b>the</b> microphone was placed on a crib mattress {{side by side with}} a present infant. All measurements were made with <b>the</b> <b>incubator</b> operating <b>in</b> a normally functioning mode with the typical surrounding daytime nursery noise. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubators</b> <b>the</b> noise spectra fell within NC- 52 (NCB- 41 /NR- 52 /RC- 45) and NC- 67 (NCB- 59 /NR- 65 /RC- 61) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nurseries between NC- 49 (NCB- 45 /NR- 50 /RC- 47) and NC- 68 (NCB- 68 /NR- 71 /RC- 68). <b>The</b> Leq <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubators</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 68 - 78 dB (56 - 68 dBA) when <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nurseries they fell between 68 - 77 dB (53 - 73 dBA). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubators</b> <b>the</b> spectral energy was found to be concentrated mainly below 250 Hz. <b>The</b> values measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubators</b> revealed a decrease from those available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature for similar situations 30 years ago but not very far from the values found 20 years ago. The presence of high SPL's <b>in</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>incubators</b> and nurseries is attributed to the frequent use of loud sound alarms and to inadequate acoustical treatment of both <b>the</b> <b>incubators</b> and <b>the</b> rooms...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Egg {{size and}} {{functional}} qualities differ among strains of com-mercial turkeys. Thus, energy budgets of egg contents and eggshell conduc-tance constants may represent different strategies for hatching and more energy may be expended by some strains than others. The {{objective of the}} present study was to determine the effects on poult quality of holding hatchling poults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubator</b> for 12 or 24 h posthatching. Eggs from three strains of commercial turkey breeder hens were obtained from a commercial turkey breeding company, numbered, randomly distributed, and set <b>in</b> <b>incubators.</b> <b>The</b> time of hatching of each egg was observed at 4 -h intervals and a random sample of hatchlings emerging from the shell at 648 and 660 h of incubation was compared with poults kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubator</b> until 672 h of incubation. Holding poults in incubators 12 or 24 h posthatching reduced (P <. 05) total body weight of all strains examined but increased (P <. 05) relative heart and liver weights. Holding time interacted (P <,. 05) with strain of turkey to increase blood plasma glucose and decrease heart glycogen. Holding decreased (P <. 001) liver glycogen precipitously in all three strains. It was concluded that holding poults in incubators 12 or 24 h posthatching has detrimental effects on carbohydrate metabolism and some strains of turkeys respond to the holding time better than others. Therefore, poult quality of commercial turkey strains may be affected differently by keeping them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incubator</b> posthatching.
