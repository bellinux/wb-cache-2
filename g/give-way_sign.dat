30|$|Some {{things may}} be noted from these results. Firstly, {{in this case}} the speed is mainly governed by the speed limits. Next, there are six {{instances}} where the curvature affects the speed greatly: four in first part (0.32, 0.43, 2.2 and 2.7 km) and two in final part (14.9 and 15.6 km). In all cases, the measured speed is lower than the simulated one, perhaps because the acceleration limit needs better tailoring (ay 0 = 0.2 g was used) or because the curvature estimate is inaccurate. Another reflection is that the measured speed is at its lowest right before the curve, not in it. This likely reflects a property of the <b>give-way</b> <b>sign</b> in intersections: to avoid stopping completely, the driver controls his or her speed appropriately. This mechanism has not been modelled, but could be since the OC-format provides information about <b>give-way</b> <b>sign</b> locations.|$|E
30|$|The {{traffic light}} and <b>give-way</b> <b>sign</b> {{are defined by}} their {{position}} and given as discrete entries together with a stop time. The {{result is that the}} entries are identical to that of a stop sign. This is not a bad thing: it is a valid model for red and green light (entry with zero stop time), but it does not reflect the stochastic nature of a real stop light.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a risk model for estimating {{the likelihood of}} collisions at low-exposure railway level crossings, demonstrating the effect that differences in safety integrity can have on {{the likelihood of a}} collision. The model facilitates the comparison of safety benefits between level crossings with passive controls (stop or <b>give-way</b> <b>signs)</b> and level crossings that have been hypothetically upgraded with conventional or low-cost warning devices. The scenario presented illustrates how treatment of a cross-section of level crossings with low cost devices can provide a greater safety benefit compared to treatment with conventional warning devices for the same budget...|$|R
25|$|In most of Continental Europe, {{the default}} rule {{is to give}} {{priority}} to the right, but this may be overridden by signs or road markings. There, priority was initially given according to the social rank of each traveler, but early {{in the life of}} the automobile this rule was deemed impractical and replaced with the priorité à droite (priority to the right) rule, which still applies. At a traffic circle where priorité à droite is not overridden, traffic on what would otherwise be a roundabout gives way to traffic entering the circle. Most French roundabouts now have <b>give-way</b> <b>signs</b> for traffic entering the circle, but there remain some notable exceptions that operate on the old rule, such as the Place de l'Étoile around the Arc de Triomphe. Priority to the right where used in continental Europe may be overridden by an ascending hierarchy of markings, signs, signals, and authorized persons.|$|R
50|$|Sidra Intersection (previously called Sidra and aaSidra) is a {{software}} package used for intersection (junction) and network capacity, {{level of service}} and performance analysis by traffic design, operations and planning professionals. First released in 1984, it has been under continuous development in response to user feedback. A new major version with network modelling capability and new vehicle movement classes was released in April 2013. The latest Version 7 includes new timing analysis methods for Common Control Groups (multiple intersections operating under one signal controller) and Network Cycle Time and Signal Offset calculations for signal coordination. Sidra Intersection is a micro-analytical traffic evaluation tool that employs lane-by-lane and vehicle drive cycle models. It {{can be used to}} compare alternative treatments of individual intersections and networks of intersections involving signalised intersections (fixed-time/pretimed and actuated), roundabouts (unsignalised), roundabouts with metering signals, fully signalised roundabouts, two-way stop and <b>give-way</b> (yield) <b>sign</b> control, all-way (4-way and 3-way) stop sign control, merging, single-point urban interchanges, traditional diamond and diverging diamond interchanges, basic freeway segments, signalised and unsignalised midblock crossings for pedestrians, merging analysis and network modelling of these intersection and interchange types.|$|R
30|$|The {{parameters}} in {{the road}} category describe the time-constant infrastructure and the physical properties of the road, including the geometry. Road signs that always require a driver to behave {{in the same way}} are included, but signs that require different action depending on the presence of other vehicles belong in the traffic category. For example, a stop sign always requires vehicles to stop at the given position and belongs {{in the road}} category. A <b>give-way</b> <b>sign</b> prescribes action to either stop or continue depending on the traffic situation and belongs in the traffic category.|$|E
