50|$|Spotted tilapia feed {{mainly on}} plant matter and {{males and females}} never feed at the same time. Instead, one will feed while the other stays close by {{and then they will}} switch.

Their predators include the electric catfish Malapterurus electricus which preys on the eggs of spotted tilapia, and African pike and obscure snakehead which prey on the adults. Spotted tilapia are also prone to heavy intestinal infection caused by nematode parasites which causes death. Also, they sometimes get swept away from their streams by flooding caused by rain into small residual pools over the banks of the stream where they become stranded.
