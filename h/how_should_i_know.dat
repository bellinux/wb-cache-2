'That there being no precept, precedent or example, {{for you to}} shut your holy brethren out of church communion; therefore you should not do it.' That you have no command to do it, is clear, and you must of necessity grant it. Now {{where there is no}} precept for a foundation; it is not what you by all your reasonings can suggest; can deliver you from the guilt of adding to his word. Are you commanded to reject them; If yea, where is it? If nay, for shame be silent.|$|R

Leave me at least that {{magnificent}} liar--the one perfectly intelligible witness you have. For {{from the time that}} he first appeared here with a grievance and a claim for a commission, he has been an unspeakable joy to me and a convincing testimony to you. Other witnesses have been partisans and prejudiced; Mr. Hooker was frankly true to himself. <b>How</b> else <b>should</b> <b>I</b> have <b>known</b> of the care you took to disguise yourself, save the honor of your uniform, and run the risk of being shot as an unknown spy at your wife's side, except from his magnificent version of HIS part in it? <b>How</b> else <b>should</b> <b>I</b> have <b>known</b> the story of your discovery of the Californian conspiracy, except from his supreme portrayal of it, with himself as the hero?

You don't suppose I keep a genealogical {{table and}} full {{pedigree}} {{of all the}} second cousins of all my clients hung up conspicuously in some spare corner of my brain, do you, eh? Upon my soul I really haven't the slightest notion. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about them is that the late Mrs. Amelia Maria Susannah Aikin, deceased, had one sister, who married somebody or other somewhere, against Mr. Anthony Aikin's wishes, and that he never had anything further {{to say to her}} at any time. 'But where she's gone and how she fares, nobody knows and nobody cares,' sir, as the poet justly remarks." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{see nothing}} in the story to {{establish}} the alleged vanity of Goldsmith, but we think it tells rather to the disadvantage of Burke; being unwarrantable under their relations of friendship, and a species of waggery quite beneath his genius. Croker, in his notes to Boswell, gives another of these practical jokes perpetrated by Burke {{at the expense of}} Goldsmith's credulity. It was related to Croker by Colonel O'Moore, of Cloghan Castle, in Ireland, who was a party concerned. The colonel and Burke, walking one day through Leicester Square on their way to Sir Joshua Reynolds', with whom they were to dine, observed Goldsmith, who was likewise to be a guest, standing and regarding a crowd which was staring and shouting at some foreign ladies in the window of a hotel. [...] "Observe Goldsmith," [...] said Burke to O'Moore, [...] "and mark what passes between us at Sir Joshua's." [...] They passed on and reached there before him. Burke received Goldsmith with affected reserve and coldness; being pressed to explain the reason. [...] "Really," [...] said he, [...] "I am ashamed to keep company with a person who could act as you have just done in the Square." [...] Goldsmith protested he was ignorant of what was meant. [...] "Why," [...] said Burke, [...] "did you not exclaim as you were looking up at those women, what stupid beasts the crowd must be for staring with such admiration at those painted Jezebels, while a man of your talents passed by unnoticed?" [...] "Surely, surely, my dear friend," [...] cried Goldsmith, with alarm, [...] "surely I did not say so?" [...] "Nay," [...] replied Burke, [...] "if you had not said so, <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> have <b>known</b> it?" [...] "That's true," [...] answered Goldsmith, [...] "I am very sorry--it was very foolish: I do recollect that something thing of the kind passed through my mind, but I did not think I had uttered it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You owe her to me. You {{should never}} forget that. If I had done [...] better {{no one can}} say what might have been the result. This [...] {{proposition}} can not be gainsaid, for as no one ever saw me do [...] better, <b>how</b> <b>should</b> anybody <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was leaving her to you. [...] She might not have <b>known</b> it, but <b>I</b> did. I did not suppose it would [...] come so soon, but I was sure it would ultimately come to pass. It [...] has come to pass, and I feel triumphant. In the great race in which [...] I had the honor to run, you made a most admirable second. The best [...] second is he who comes in first. In order for a second to take [...] first place it is necessary that the leader in the race, be that [...] leader horse, man, or boat, should experience a change in [...] conditions. I experienced such a change, voluntary or involuntary [...] it is unnecessary to say. You came in first, and I congratulate you [...] as no living being can congratulate you who has not felt for a [...] moment or two that it was barely possible that he might, in some [...] period of existence, occupy the position which you now hold.|$|R
