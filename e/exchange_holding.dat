500|$|While the artilleries kept {{up their}} noisy <b>exchange,</b> <b>holding</b> the Duke's attention, Frederick sent scouts {{to find a}} decent {{crossing}} of the Saale, since the one at Weissenfels was not usable. [...] There was little he could do at the burned bridge; to cross the river under Saxe-Hildburghausen's nose, {{in the face of}} fire, would have been foolish. Across the river, the Allies had a physical barrier to protect them; they could also use their position to watch Frederick's movement. Inexplicably, though, Saxe-Hildburghausen gave up this advantage and retired toward Burgweben and Tagewerben, counting on the intervening hills to protect him. Soubise had advanced from Reichardswerben through Kaynau, and they met up at Gross Körbetha. Their advanced guard patrolled Merseburg, and sought some information from the local inhabitants. Although the local Saxon peasants might have disliked the Prussians, they disliked the French and Austrians more, and they gave up little information. Neither Saxe-Hildburghausen nor Soubise had an idea what Frederick intended, or indeed, what he was doing. [...] Marshal Keith reached Merseburg and found the bridge there destroyed, with the Austrians and French prepared to hold {{the other side of the}} river. [...] By the night of 3 November, Frederick's engineers finished their new bridges and the entire Prussian line advanced across the Saale. As soon as Frederick had crossed the river, he sent 1,500 cavalry under the command of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz to raid the Allied camp. He planned to attack it the next day, but the surprise raid frightened Soubise into moving during the night to a more secure position. On 4 November, Frederick moved to his camp at Rossbach.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We {{introduce}} a simple two-country exchange model with money introduced via a cash-in-advance constraint with a variable money velocity. Currency substitution is endogenous to this model. While all purchases {{must be made}} in local currency, foreign exchange can be traded for local currency within a transactions period while other nonmonetary assets, bonds and equalities, cannot. We find that consumers only hold foreign exchange when the local inflation rate is high enough to induce a sufficient desire to reduce the holding of real domestic money balances below the level required to facilitate purchases during the exogenously determined pay period. Foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>holding</b> allows the consumer to reduce the initial level of real balances below the level required to facilitate purchases until the next pay period. In general equilibrium allowing consumers to hold foreign exchange reduces the amount of resources dedicated to transacting, the shoe leather cost. As a result, currency substitution reduces the velocity of money, increasing the level of real domestic money balances. Therefore currency substitution increases seigniorage revenue in the home country {{as well as in}} the country providing foreign exchange. Given these results, foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>holding</b> is complementary to, rather than a substitute of, domestic real balances. Currency substitution can enhance efficiency. We find that currency substitution can increase utility by reducing shoe-leather expense. The country supplying foreign exchange can appropriate this gain by increasing its own inflation rate.

40|$|International audienceAn {{extended}} literature {{analyzes the}} accumulation foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>holding</b> observed {{in many developing}} and emerging countries since the 2000 s. Empirical studies on the self-insurance motive suggest that high-reserves economies are more resilient to financial crises and to international capital inflows volatility. They show also that pre-crisis foreign reserve accumulation explains post-crisis growth. However, some papers suggest {{that the relationship between}} international reserves holding and reduced vulnerability is nonlinear, meaning that reserve holding is subject to diminishing returns. This paper devotes more attention to the potential nonlinear relationship between the foreign reserves holding and macroeconomic resilience to shocks. For a sample of 9 emerging economies, we assess to what extent the accumulation of international reserves allows to mitigate negative impacts of external shocks on the output gap. While {{a major part of the}} literature focuses on the global financial crisis, we investigate this question by considering two sub-periods: 1995 - 2003 and 2004 - 2013. We implement threshold VAR (TVAR) model in which the structure is allow to change if the threshold variable crosses a certain estimated threshold. We find that the effectiveness of reserve holding to improve the resilience of domestic economies to shocks has increased over time. Hence, the diminishing returns of foreign reserve holding stressed in the previous literature must be qualified...|$|E

Tobacco litigation frequently {{has been used as a}} method for promoting tobacco control in the United States. Litigation is less common outside the United States, but increasingly advocates have brought innovative lawsuits abroad. This commentary explores global tobacco litigation strategies, with 4 key elements: compensation/recovery, advertising restrictions, criminal liability, and public interest writ litigation. The commentary argues that perhaps the most important effect of tobacco litigation has been to transform public and political perceptions about risk and responsibility in smoking, making clear what manufacturers knew, how they concealed this knowledge, and how they manipulated consumers. Tort law has reframed the debate from personal to corporate responsibility. However, the industry still manages, at least in the political realm, to alter the discourse to one involving freedom of choice for the smoker, the evils of big government, unfair taxation, and the influence of trial lawyers. Furthermore, now that the tobacco industry is aggressively seeking new markets in the poorest, least-regulated countries, litigation will take on new importance. The most promising strategies will use a human rights framework, arguing that tobacco is so detrimental that it violates the rights to health, life, and a sanitary environment...|$|E
25|$|Using US definitions, {{a person}} who owns street name {{securities}} and {{who is not a}} member of an <b>exchange,</b> <b>holds</b> the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.|$|R
