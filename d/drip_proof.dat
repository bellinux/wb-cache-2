50|$|Compare to the ODP (Open <b>Drip</b> <b>Proof)</b> motor design, {{which has}} {{ventilation}} openings which are guarded to prevent falling water {{from entering the}} motor windings.|$|E
50|$|Standardized NEMA & IEC {{motor frame}} sizes {{throughout}} the industry result in interchangeable dimensions for shaft, foot mounting, general aspects {{as well as}} certain motor flange aspect. Since an open, <b>drip</b> <b>proof</b> (ODP) motor design allows a free air exchange from outside to the inner stator windings, this style of motor tends to be slightly more efficient because the windings are cooler. A lower speed requires a larger frame.|$|E
