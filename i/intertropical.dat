5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone, and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone. The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Five-E formed {{out of a}} weak {{tropical}} wave, {{associated with}} scattered convection, which formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 23. The wave was moving towards the west at the rate of 23mph (37km/h), due to an area of high pressure located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean leading to a prevailing easterly flow. Some cyclonic turning was noted and convection was {{on either side of the}} axis the center of the stormbut was mainly in association with the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The wave remained very close to the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone for the next several days without any further development.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the <b>Intertropical</b> Front (ITF), the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the same}} {{tropical}} wave that formed Tropical Storm Danny in the Atlantic crossed over the Isthmus of Panama and became a disturbance in the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone during mid to late September. On September 20 the cloud pattern had increased in organization and the system was designated a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|The monsoon trough is {{a portion}} of the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone, as {{depicted}} by a line on a weather map showing the locations of minimum sea level pressure, and as such, is a convergence zone between the wind patterns of the southern and northern hemispheres.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone. Despite being {{located in a}} hostile environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that from occurring. Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E
5|$|Tropical glaciers {{are located}} between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, {{in the region}} that lies 23° 26′ 22″ north or south of the equator. Strictly, a {{tropical}} glacier is located within the astronomical tropics; the area where the annual temperature variation is less than the daily variation, and is within the oscillation area of the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|In early August, a {{disturbance}} {{was observed in}} satellite images moving {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 4. Moving westward along the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone at a forward speed of roughly , the disturbance showed no signs of development until a cloud mass broke away from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E
5|$|On Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel, Haruna {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} 144km/h (90mph) during {{the passage of}} the eyewall. Before the cyclone struck Madagascar, the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone had caused flooding in the country that killed four people and caused widespread road disruption. Officials prepared by collecting supplies in the capital Antananarivo beginning on February20, and sending an emergency crew to the expected landfall location. Residents were evacuated using boats and canoes to shelters.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on July 9.|$|E
5|$|On June13, 1974, a {{tropical}} disturbance was identified several hundred {{miles south of}} Mexico. Tracking westward, rapid development ensued the following day and the system was classified {{a tropical}} depression around 12UTC. Shortly thereafter, satellite intensity estimates indicated further strengthening and the storm was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolores. Development temporarily slowed on June 15 as the structure gradually organized. Enhanced by the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone, a band of deep convection wrapped into the storm. A banding eye-feature developed later that day, indicating Dolores to be near hurricane strength.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the latest}} Cape Verde-type hurricanes to form in any season, Joan formed from an area of {{convection}} in the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa early in October. It developed banding and was upgraded to Tropical Depression Seventeen on October 10 and later designated as Tropical Storm Joan while located at low latitude in the central Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca depended on {{a reduction in}} air temperature over the Altiplano {{and an increase in}} precipitation, which may have been caused by shifts in the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and increased easterly winds. It was originally supposed that glacial melting might have filled Lake Tauca, but the quantity of water would not have been sufficient to fill the whole lake. The lake was accompanied by glacial advance, noticeable at Cerro Azanaques and Tunupa. Elsewhere in South America, water levels and glaciers also expanded during the Lake Tauca phase.|$|E
5|$|The global {{moisture}} {{budget is}} primarily being influenced by tropical sea surface temperatures {{from the position}} of the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The Southern Hemisphere has a unique meteorological feature positioned in the southwestern Pacific Basin called the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), which contains a perennial position within the Southern Hemisphere. During ENSO warm periods, the SPCZ reverses orientation extending from the equator down south through Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and towards the French Polynesian Islands; and due east towards South America affecting geochemistry of corals in tropical regions.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} shift {{is the high}} summer {{temperature}} difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This {{is accompanied by a}} seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength {{as a result of the}} Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated from a tropical wave off {{the southern coast}} of Mexico in late May2006. An area of convection {{was associated with the}} wave, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual development. The system, which was enhanced by the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west. On June1, the convection became more concentrated, and by early the next day it developed a low pressure area; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone became evident {{southeast of the}} Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone became evident {{south of the}} Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} disturbance, associated with the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ), that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September13. Tracking westward at a low latitude, the system fluctuated in organization, with the development and weakening of deep convection and weak outflow for several days. By September18, the disturbance entered a region where there was sinking air, an inhibiting factor of tropical cyclone development. Two days later, the system separated from the ITCZ and quickly developed into a tropical depression, the twelfth of the season, while located about 605miles (975kilometers) southeast of Barbados.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{originated}} in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted {{for several days}} in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also {{led to the formation}} of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions. By September 5, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Greta {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} disturbance in the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone near Jamaica on October30, 1956. A Navy reconnaissance plane recorded sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and found an area of low pressure. Around this time, the system was classified as a tropical depression. Although a ship near the system discovered a cold-core circulation—a feature of non-tropical cyclones—it was classified as tropical. By October31, the depression passed near {{the western edge of}} Haiti and later crossed the eastern tip of Cuba before entering the Atlantic Ocean. By the afternoon of November1, the depression had moved through the central Bahamas and turned towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August18. Shortly after, the system became embedded within the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By August23, the system began to intensify while convective activity become consolidated around the center of circulation. By 0600UTC on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Eight roughly 965miles (1,555km) east of Barbados. A weak ridge of high pressure {{to the north of}} the depression led to a general westward movement of the system. Gradually strengthening, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm early on August25, at which time it was given the name Gustav.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There is a possibility that the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{convective}} systems, {{which can}} evolve into tropical cyclones, form along {{areas such as}} tropical waves or easterly waves which progress westward along monsoon troughs and the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone in regions of ample low level moisture, convergent surface winds, and divergent winds aloft. This typically occurs north of the equator from Africa across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans, as well as across the northwest and southwest Pacific oceans, from Australia eastward into Oceania, the Indian ocean, Indonesia, and from southeast Brazil into the southern Atlantic ocean. It is also noted on occasion in the southeast Pacific ocean mild to cool ENSO years, outside of El Niño. More intense systems form over land than water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone {{produced}} {{an area of}} convection in the southeastern Arabian Sea {{toward the end of}} October 2011. The overall system moved west-northwestward, developing a distinct low pressure area on October27. By that time, the thunderstorm activity was still disorganized and associated with a weak circulation. Environmental conditions were unfavorable initially, consisting of strong wind shear and dry air. An anticyclone over the system caused the shear to decrease by October28, amid warm water temperatures of , both more favorable conditions. By that time the circulation became well-defined, although still elongated, and the convection was still scattered. On October29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 02 about 885km (550mi) east of the Yemeni island of Socotra.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} circulation {{is controlled by}} the two semi–permanent South Atlantic and South Pacific highs, and the Chaco Low. During summer, the interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low brings northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region during summer results in very high precipitation. Most of the precipitation comes from the east since the Andes block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Southern parts of the region are influenced by cold fronts travelling northward. These cold fronts are responsible for producing precipitation during summer. For example, in Tucumán Province, cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. Furthermore, the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone (or doldrums) reaches the region during the summer months, leading to enhanced precipitation. During the winter months, the <b>intertropical</b> convergence zone, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic highs move northward while the Chaco Low weakens, all of which results in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean, along with {{atmospheric circulation}} patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. The Chaco Low attracts air masses from the South Pacific High, creating a dry and cold wind, particularly during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intertropical</b> {{convergence}} zone spawned a tropical disturbance on January19, developing a circulation {{just west of}} St. Brandon. That day, the Météo-France on Réunion (MFR) classified {{the system as a}} tropical disturbance, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system as a low-pressure area a day prior. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle late on January20, by which time the JTWC gave it the designation Tropical Cyclone 20S. Due to a large ridge centered near Île Amsterdam, the storm tracked generally southwestward toward the Mascarene Islands. Early on January22, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and later that day, the MFR upgraded Gretelle to tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} formed on October20 in the Caribbean Sea off the northwest coast of Colombia, {{believed to have been}} from the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone. It moved northwestward, intensifying into a tropical storm on October21 and a hurricane the following day. Fox subsequently turned to the north, intensifying to a major hurricane as it passed west of the Cayman Islands. Late on October 24, the cyclone struck the small island of Cayo Guano del Estes in the Archipelago de los Canarreos, south of Cienfuegos, Cuba. It struck the island with peak winds of , and the island reported a minimum pressure of 934mbar (27.59inHg). Shortly thereafter, Fox crossed the mainland coast of Cuba west of Cienfuegos, and it weakened while crossing the island.|$|E
5|$|Whether it be a {{depression}} in the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} the Southern Hemisphere spring, the <b>intertropical</b> {{convergence}} zone (ITCZ) was active across the southern Indian Ocean {{in the middle of}} October. On October18, a low pressure area formed, based on reports from nearby ships. It moved southeastward and slowly intensified, given the name Alex. Located southwest of Sumatra, the storm curved to the south. Late on October21, Alex attained peak winds of 150km/h (90mph), or above tropical cyclone status. For several days, it maintained much of its intensity while curving to the southwest. The storm eventually weakened due to strong wind shear deteriorating the convection. On October27, Alex dissipated.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in Dakar, Senegal. A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August10 within an area of thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h). This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of , the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} developed {{within the}} <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone on June17 and remained distinct on its track west. An {{area of low pressure}} developed {{in association with}} the system over the northwestern Caribbean on June24 and further organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC the following day, supported by data from a reconnaissance aircraft. Steered west and eventually west-northwest by an expansive ridge across the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alex by 06:00UTC on June26 and attained an initial peak with winds of 65mph (100km/h) before moving ashore near Belize City, Belize several hours later. Alex maintained tropical storm intensity as it crossed the Yucatan Peninsula, and upon executing a northward turn and a second westward bend, began to steadily intensify. The cyclone intensified into the season's first hurricane at 00:00UTC on June30 and attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) as it made landfall near Soto la Marina, Mexico, at 02:00UTC on July1. Once inland, Alex turned west-southwest and rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico. It dissipated by 06:00UTC on July2.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development out to 48hours. The tropical wave split on September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability for development, the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the <b>Intertropical</b> Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
