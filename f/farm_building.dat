5|$|After Crowhurst Bridge, {{which carries}} the Burwash to Stonegate road over the river, the railway {{crosses to the}} south bank. By Etchingham railway station, the River Limden joins from the north, the A265 road crosses, and the River Dudwell joins from the southwest. Both the railway and the river turn to the south to reach Robertsbridge. Another tributary, which flows to the {{northwest}} from near a gypsum mine at Brightling, turns {{to the south and}} runs parallel to the Rother before joining it in Robertsbridge. There is a network of channels, as the River Darwell joins the river, and there was formerly a mill nearby. The mill was called Hodson's Mill, and was part of Mill Farm. It burnt down in 1902, and the Georgian farmhouse was subsequently demolished. The only original <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> still standing is part of an oasthouse, dating from the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|At about 18:00, {{the prisoners}} were divided into groups. Each group of 10 to 20 was loaded onto a truck and transported several hundred metres (yards) from the {{building}} towards a wooded ravine. When the prisoners reached the previously prepared execution site, they were shot and buried in a mass grave using a bulldozer. After 15–20 minutes, the truck would return empty {{to pick up the}} next group. The final group of prisoners was executed just outside the <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> itself. By 22:00 that evening, all of the prisoners had been killed. Most sources place the number of victims at around 260. This figure has been used by ICTY prosecutors. Some estimates of the death toll go as high as 264. The Croatian authorities believe that the total figure stands at 261. The massacre was the most severe individual war crime committed in Europe since World War II until that point.|$|E
5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small <b>farm</b> <b>building,</b> perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
50|$|The plastered, Neoclassical house {{consists}} of a two-storey main wing with a black-glazed tile roof flanked by two one-storey lateral wings with red tile roofs. The house fronts a large courtyard which is flanked by <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> (Avlsgården) on its three other sides. The <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> mostly date from 1866 but integrate remains of the Bjelke's original half-timbered <b>farm</b> <b>buildings.</b> The main building is listed. The <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> are not listed.|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{transmitted}} from wildlife to livestock or {{people may be}} managed more effectively if it is known where transmission occurs. In Britain, <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> have been proposed as important sites of Mycobacterium bovis transmission between wild badgers (Meles meles) and cattle, contributing {{to the maintenance of}} bovine tuberculosis (TB). Farmers are therefore advised to exclude badgers from buildings. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and remote cameras to characterise badgers’ use of <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> at four TB-affected sites in southwestern Britain. Across 54 GPS-collared badgers, 99. 8 % of locations fell ≥ 3 m from <b>farm</b> <b>buildings.</b> Remote cameras deployed in feed stores recorded just 12 nights with badger visits among 3134 store nights of monitoring. GPS-collared badgers used space near <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> less than expected based on availability, significantly preferring land ≥ 100 m from buildings. There was no positive association between badgers’ use of <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> and the infection status of either badgers or cattle. Six GPS-collared badgers which regularly visited <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> all tested negative for M. bovis. Overall, test-positive badgers spent less time close to <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> than did test-negative animals. Badger visits to <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> were more frequent where badger population densities were high. Our findings suggest that, while buildings may offer important opportunities for M. bovis transmission between badgers and cattle, building use by badgers is not a prerequisite for such transmission. Identifying ways to minimise infectious contact between badgers and cattle away from buildings is therefore a management priority...|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting for the owners. The buildings {{on either side of}} the tower were then pulled down to allow for the construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only the tower survived to become an ancillary <b>farm</b> <b>building.</b> In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed the tower into the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, who decided to open it to the public. An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it one of only a handful of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} day an attack by German 88mm guns {{destroyed}} some of 10 Para's transport. The battalion counterattacked, capturing the guns and a nearby <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> they were using. The brigade advance restarted at 07:00, but by now the 9th SS Panzer Division had established a blocking position between Oosterbeek and the Ede–Arnhem road across the brigade's expected route. Repeated assaults by both battalions {{could not find a}} way through. Advancing through heavy woodland, 156 Para were confronted by infantry supported by mortars, self propelled guns (SP gun) as well as fighter aircraft, and the battalion suffered heavy losses. At one stage 'A' Company penetrated the German line, but before they could dig in, all their officers were killed or wounded. Short of ammunition, the remaining men were counter-attacked by the Germans and driven back.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} two churches {{dedicated}} to Saint Werburgh, there are 15 other GradeII listed buildings. The parish rooms and caretaker's house were built in 1889, and designed by John Douglas. Also built in the village by Douglas was the post office in 1893, and Warburton School in 1871–72; this has been converted to a residence but still features crucks supporting the roof. Some farm buildings in Warburton are also listed, including the farmhouse on Moss Lane. The barn is 18th-century but features crucks which may be 17th-century or earlier. The timber framed <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> on Park Road is 17th-century in origin; the late-18th-century farmhouse on Warburton Lane was made with Flemish bond brick and has a slate roof. The barn on Paddock Lane dates from the 17th century. Also on Paddock Lane are two farmhouses: one was built in 1717 by Thomas Egerton and features an inglenook fireplace; the other is Wigsey Farmhouse which was originally built in the 17th century with later additions, including a 19th-century porch. The building on Warburton Lane near Villa Farmhouse was originally a timber framed building from the 16th or early 17th century. The house features late-16th- or early-17th-century frescos of a woman, possibly St Werburgh, with two geese and a rose.|$|E

5|$|For {{one year}} it {{met in the}} {{basement}} of Pleasantville's public school (until the Briarcliff Farms building was completed), and did not provide housing. The <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> was completed in spring 1901 and dedicated on May 15. The large Colonial Revival building, with a plain exterior and wide halls, had lecture halls, a library, a laboratory, an office, a dining hall and dormitory space for 40 staff members and students. Its grounds had an orchard, a working garden, experimental greenhouses, poultry houses, a farmhouse and barns. The school's faculty included a director, a horticulturalist, an agriculturalist and instructors in nature study and cold storage. It was coeducational, with identical courses for men and women. Students were required to be proficient in English, provide good references, be at least 16 years of age, and be in good health. On January 1, 1902 Henry Francis du Pont, then in his third year at Harvard University, wrote to Powell requesting admission to the school; Powell replied that DuPont was listed first in the school's 1903 class. However, DuPont was unable to attend and left Harvard (perhaps due to his mother's sudden death in autumn 1902).|$|E

25|$|An annual fair {{was instituted}} in 1206 during the seventh year of King John's reign to the priory of Rochester, {{to be held}} on 26 August, which {{continued}} well into the 18th Century, according to Hasted, the Kent historian. It was traditionally held over three days, and associated with Christian celebration of the Assumption (15 August). The Strood Fair was held regularly into the 1970s. The land used for the Strood Fair was sandwiched between Grange Road and Station Road, adjacent to Strood railway station. It was for many years part of a dairy farm, though by the 1970s the <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> {{had been turned into}} a motor repair business. The fair ground was passed on to the people who ran the Strood Fair. It was then used by them to stay through the winter months. Gradually the number or fairs held on the land dwindled.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{intensity}} {{varied from}} EF1 to EF2 in intensity as the tornado entered Wilcox County and passed {{near the town}} of Rochelle. Off Double Run Road and CR 41, a small <b>farm</b> <b>building</b> was completely destroyed. Two residences had their windows broken, and a metal building structure was severely damaged, with several anchored metal trusses ripped from the concrete foundation; this resulted in total collapse of the building. Additional metal barns and outbuildings nearby were severely damaged. Along Crawford Dairy Road, several large wooden electrical transmission towers were snapped. Farther northeast, a semi-truck trailer was flipped, flattened, and pushed across the road. Another metal building structure had its southeast corner completely destroyed, and it had a few 2ft (0.61m) deep concrete support beams ripped out of the ground. A small home sustained minor roof and siding damage, and several single to double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris thrown up to 100yd (91m) downstream. Damage to some of the manufactured homes was consistent with a high-end EF2 tornado. The storm crossed Highway 280, destroying several small wooden sheds and fences, and downing numerous trees before finally lifting along Kingfisher Road west of Abbeville at 4:27p.m. EST (21:27UTC).|$|E

A heritage-listed cottage close by on Meander Valley road was formerly called [...] "Ivy Cottage" [...] due to prolific growth of the plant and was used as a private school. The former police watch-house was built opposite the Carrick Inn in 1837 using convict labour. The Prince of Wales Hotel was built in 1840 and was licensed for many years, but is now a private home. By 1869 it was a two-storey brick building with sixteen rooms, a cellar and a separate stone stable. [...] "Sillwood" [...] is the remains of an original <b>farm</b> <b>building,</b> built on a grant that was [...] in 1835. The original home was partly demolished to make way for an extension to an adjacent building in the late 20th century. The main farmhouse, said to be an [...] "Outstanding Indian-influence house", has been demolished. Carrick House, on East Street was built around 1840 by Roderic O'Conner and was extended in the 19th century. Until the 1980s the house was associated with horse racing; its stables were used as a training base. It is a two-storey brick house with an iron roof and twelve-pane windows. Behind the stone mill is a single-storey brick cottage that was built around 1840 as a four-roomed, single-story brick building. After he purchased the mill, Monds expanded the cottage with a pantry, three more rooms and a dairy.|$|E
