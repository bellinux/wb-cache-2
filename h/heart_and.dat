5000|$|Some in {{the diamond}} {{industry}} disagree on which diamonds should receive the [...] "Hearts and Arrows" [...] label. Because {{there used to}} be no industry standard, one person or company may say a diamond is a <b>Hearts</b> <b>and</b> Arrows diamond while another may say it is not. In the industry, the term [...] "super ideal" [...] is a common term that is coined and used to describe diamonds displaying perfect optical symmetry. Most diamonds with an overall cut graded by GIA as [...] "Excellent" [...] (with Excellent symmetry as well) or American Gem Society as [...] "0" [...] (or [...] "Ideal") will have some sort of <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> arrows pattern when seen through a viewer, although the pattern may not be perfect. Many within the diamond industry believe the <b>Hearts</b> <b>and</b> Arrows pattern should be graded, and only those with the top grade should be called <b>Hearts</b> <b>and</b> Arrows. Those people believe that the mere presence of a <b>Hearts</b> <b>and</b> Arrows pattern is not sufficient to be considered a <b>Hearts</b> <b>and</b> Arrows diamond; the pattern must be perfect to fit within certain guidelines.|$|R

40|$|Failure of {{the human}} heart to {{maintain}} sufficient output of blood for the demands of the body, heart failure, is a common condition with high mortality even with modern therapeutic alternatives. To identify molecular determinants of mortality in patients with new-onset heart failure, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and follow-up genotyping in independent populations. We identified and replicated an association for a genetic variant on chromosome 5 q 22 with 36 % increased risk of death in subjects with heart failure (rs 9885413, P = 2. 7 x 10 ⁻⁹. We provide evidence from reporter gene assays, computational predictions and epigenomic marks that this polymorphism increases activity of an enhancer region active in multiple human tissues. The polymorphism was further reproducibly associated with a DNA methylation signature in whole blood (P = 4. 5 x 10 ⁻⁴⁰) that also associated with allergic sensitization and expression in blood of the cytokine TSLP (P = 1. 1 x 10 ⁻⁴). Knockdown of the transcription factor predicted to bind the enhancer region (NHLH 1) in a human cell line (HEK 293) expressing NHLH 1 resulted in lower TSLP expression. In addition, we observed evidence of recent positive selection acting on the risk allele in populations of African descent. Our findings provide novel genetic leads to factors that influence mortality in patients with heart failure.
