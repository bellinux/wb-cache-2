40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{barriers}} to participation <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> education. Survey, which investigates the strategies used for overcoming the barriers to participation <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> education by parents on parental leave, has been prepared {{on the basis of the}} contemporary theoretical knowledge on barriers to participation <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> education and inequalities <b>in</b> participation <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> education. Parents on parental leave are one of the groups with uneven access to adult education and they are deterred from participation in education because of situational barriers. Research participants (n = 6, M = 34. 5) participated in semi-structured interview, which consists of seven topics related to the respondent's personal history, his academic and professional career and the circumstances of his life. Based on the data, the conditions and mechanisms that help to overcome group-specific barriers to participation <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> education were identified. On the basis of the common elements of respondents' answers the economically oriented strategy for overcoming barriers and the alternative strategy for overcoming barriers were defined.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the differential long-term after-effects on the apomorphine-susceptibility in the apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) and apomorphine-unsusceptible (APO-UNSUS) rats of either a saline injection (a mild stressor) or a clonidine-injection (a moderate stressor) applied around the onset of the stress-hypo-responsive-period (SHRP) on postnatal day (PND) 2, 4, 6 or 9. The present study shows that an injection of saline on PND 2 decreases the apomorphine-induced gnawing score <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-SUS rats, but increases this score <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-UNSUS rats; clonidine given on this day has no effect. An injection of saline on PND 4 decreases the apomorphine score <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-SUS rats, but has no effect <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-UNSUS rats. An injection of clonidine on PND 4 counteracts the long-term after-effects of a saline injection on this PND <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-SUS rats, but has no effect <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-UNSUS rats. Finally, an injection of clonidine on PND 9 has no effect on the apomorphine score <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-SUS rats, but increases this score <b>in</b> <b>adult</b> APO-UNSUS rats; saline given on this day has no effect. It is concluded that the long-term after-effects of early postnatal stressors depend on the interrelationship between, rather than the separate impact of, the genetic background of the rat, the nature of the event, and time of exposure to the event, thereby implying that these factors direct the phenotypic expression of a particular genotype at adult age...|$|R
