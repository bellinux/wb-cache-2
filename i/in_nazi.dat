5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life.

He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, Nazi Germany made {{increasingly}} aggressive territorial demands, threatening war {{if they were not}} met. It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in what was left of Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, murdered <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> concentration camps and extermination camps, or shot.|$|E

5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|He was {{critically}} {{wounded in}} an ambush in Prague on 27 May 1942 by a British Special Operations Executive-trained team of Czech and Slovak {{soldiers who had}} been sent by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to kill him in Operation Anthropoid. He died from his injuries a week later. Nazi intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the villages of Lidice and Ležáky. Both villages were razed; all men and boys {{over the age of}} 16 were shot, and all but a handful of the village's women and children were deported and killed <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl {{was born}} in Germany on 22 August 1902. Her father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, owned a {{successful}} heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter to follow him into the business world. Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her {{to carry on the}} family name and secure the family fortune. However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business. Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 39 on the Eastern Front <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany's war against the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> propaganda, where its size and strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} eastern Europe, the state played {{a greater role in}} organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. <b>In</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Initially a {{force of}} a dozen men {{under the auspices of}} the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) grew to become one of the largest and most {{powerful}} groups <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany. Led by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938 and continued to grow. Himmler envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence. The Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS, became a de facto fourth branch of the Wehrmacht.|$|E

50|$|The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality <b>in</b> the <b>Nazi</b> Party {{is a book}} first {{published}} in 1995 by Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, and currently in its 5th edition.

50|$|From his {{appointment}} {{as director of}} the vocational school in Deroystraße, Himmler devoted himself to numerous honorary offices <b>in</b> the <b>Nazi</b> regime and was largely exempted from teaching. He trained as an officer and continued to work with the NSLB. From early 1936, he worked in the head office for technology <b>in</b> the <b>Nazi</b> Party, the Hauptamt für Technik in der NSDAP, and <b>in</b> the <b>Nazi</b> Federation for German Technology (NS-Bund Deutscher Technik), led by Fritz Todt and to which, until 1938, almost all technical-scientific associations, such as the Association of German Engineers (VDI), were connected.|$|R
5|$|MacLachlan flew {{missions}} against rail targets <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> Germany on 23 May, attacking Bingen am Rhein. On 25 May he flew against targets near Sedan and his Battle {{was damaged}} by flak. The unit relocated to Moissy and he flew missions {{in support of}} French Army forces around Abbeville. On 10 June near Fleury, his cockpit hood was shot away by accurate ground fire but MacLachlan was unhurt. On 13 June he flew a daylight mission against German spearheads and while returning to base flew under a formation of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. The escorting Bf 109s gave chase and shot one Battle down. MacLachlan claimed to have managed to fire on two Bf 109s and damaged them—these claims cannot be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Propaganda did {{not develop}} a {{negative}} connotation {{until it was}} used <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> propaganda for World War II. Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was {{the main reason for}} losing the war. Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power. The Nazi party took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions. The Nazi party used posters, films, books and public speakers among other tactics.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{one of the largest in}} Medieval Europe and is {{regarded}} as the most important victory in the histories of Poland and Lithuania, also it's widely celebrated in Belarus.

During the 20th century the battle was used <b>in</b> <b>Nazi</b> and Soviet propaganda campaigns. Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the battle, reconciling the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.|$|E
