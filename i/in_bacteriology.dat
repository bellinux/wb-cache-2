5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising <b>in</b> <b>bacteriology</b> The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E

25|$|Flewett studied {{medicine}} at Queens University Belfast, where he graduated with honours in 1945. He {{worked at the}} Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and, from 1946 to 1948, was a demonstrator <b>in</b> <b>bacteriology</b> and pathology at Queen’s University. His scientific interest in viruses began with his membership of the scientific staff of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, where he spent three years between 1948 and 1951 researching common cold viruses and exploring the effect of influenza viruses on cells in culture. This led to his first use of electron microscopy, in which he became a leading authority. In 1951 he moved as lecturer <b>in</b> <b>bacteriology</b> to Leeds University, where {{he was involved in}} the 1953 smallpox outbreak. This experience proved invaluable twenty-five years later when a laboratory-associated case of smallpox at the Medical School of the University of Birmingham, UK, led to the death of Janet Parker. In 1951 he married June Evelyn Hall who bore him two daughters.|$|E

25|$|Bains {{came from}} Mahilpur in Hoshiarpur {{district}} of Punjab state, India. His family were members or {{supporters of the}} Communist Party of India (CPI) and he joined its youth wing. The CPI that Bains knew as a teenager was a mass and militant party. Operating underground {{for part of the}} 1950s, the CPI won back its legality in time for the general elections of 1957, where it emerged as the largest opposition party in the country and held state government in Kerala. By this time, however, a young Bains had apparently quit the CPI in protest of its acceptance of Nikita Khrushchev’s criticisms of Joseph Stalin. Bains, according to the CPC (ML)'s official biography, immigrated to Canada from India two years later in 1959 at age nineteen. In Vancouver, he pursued post-graduate studies at the University of British Columbia from 1960 to 1965, <b>in</b> <b>Bacteriology.</b>|$|E

500|$|The strictest {{definition}} of [...] "plant" [...] includes only the [...] "land plants" [...] or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, {{known as the}} gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for {{at least part of}} its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied <b>in</b> <b>bacteriology),</b> fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.|$|E
