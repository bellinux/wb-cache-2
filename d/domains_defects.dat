It is about boronitrid (BN), sacharin, hydroxapatit, plasticizer Tegmer a tree types of talc. Crystal structure was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffraction, supramolecular structure was observed by optical microscopy (polarized and confocal laser scanning). Nucleating activity was evaluated by isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization made on calorimeter and heated table of optical microscope. There is not influence of additives on crystallographic structure, but additives affects number and size of spherulites including crystal <b>domains</b> <b>defects,</b> which can have impact on final mechanical properties. BN and talcs react as nucleating agents, other additives during low and high cooling speeds (vc) inhibit nucleation and in middle cooling speeds are without effect. Nucleating activity is not evaluated by numerically, because decrease of crystallization temperature together with vc is not linear.

Gears are in good condition, a half broken tooth, one broken tooth, and cracked. The gear rotational speeds were taken in 300 rpm, 750 rpm, and 2250 rpm. Vibration data acquisition was done using vibrationmeter and PC. Vibrationmeter record the signal on time domain and convert it to frequency <b>domain.</b> <b>Defect</b> analysis {{was done in the}} time domain and frequency domain. Experiment result showed that time <b>domain,</b> <b>defect</b> of gear could detected by spike appearing every one period of shaft revolution.

Whereas on a half broken tooth condition failure was difficult to detect at time domain. At frequency domain, indication of a half broken tooth was seen by increasing amplitude of gearmesh frequency four time to 39, 57 volt and sideband appearing. Then on one broken tooth indication could be seen by increasing amplitude of gearmesh frequency ten times to 123, 5 volt and sideband appearing. On cracked gear, indication could be seen by increasing amplitude of gearmesh frequency four times to 123, 5 volt and appearing many sidebands.

40|$|Abstract. A {{frequency}} modulated {{continuous wave}} (FMCW) radar sensor whose {{heart is a}} Monolithic Millimetre wave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) working at approx. 94 GHz {{has been used for}} both process control and imaging for different purposes. The radar sensor has been tested in the area of gas-assisted injection moulding processes for production of plastics parts and components. By means of waveguides and a window which is transparent for millimetre waves the waves are guided into the cavity to be filled with liquid plastics. The appearance of a gas bubble changes the wave pattern inside the cavity. Thus, the process sequence can be controlled in a quick and direct way. With the help of a twodimensional raster scanning device imaging can be performed in diverse <b>domains</b> like <b>defect</b> detection, process control or homeland security. Flat and thin objects can be imaged with small aperture antennas working in the nearfield <b>domain.</b> <b>Defects</b> in plastics parts like voids or pores or moisture spots can be detected without the need of higher developed imaging methods.

However, growths of monolayer and bilayer WSe 2, an important member of the transition-metal dichalcogenides family, by the molecular-beam epitaxy method remain uncharted probably {{because of the difficulty}} in generating tungsten fluxes from the elemental source. In this work, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study of molecular-beam epitaxy-grown WSe 2 monolayer and bilayer, showing atomically flat epifilm with no <b>domain</b> boundary <b>defect.</b> This contrasts epitaxial MoSe 2 films grown by the same method, where a dense network of the <b>domain</b> boudaries <b>defects</b> is present.

But, it is {{the severity of the}} faults that is more important than number of faults existing in the developed system as the major faults matters most for a developer and those major faults needs immediate attention. In this paper, we tried to predict the level of impact of the existing faults in software systems. Neuro-Fuzzy based predictor models is applied NASAâ€™s public <b>domain</b> <b>defect</b> dataset coded in C programming language. As Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) evaluates the worth of a subset of attributes by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. So, CFS is used for the selecting the best metrics that have highly correlated with level of severity of faults. The results are compared with the prediction results of Logistic Models (LMT) that was earlier quoted as the best technique in [17]. The results are recorded in terms of Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

40|$|Abstract: The {{software}} {{industry has been}} experiencing a software crisis, a difficulty of delivering software within budget, on time, and of good quality. This may happen due to number of defects present in the different modules of the project that may require maintenance. This necessitates the need of predicting maintenance urgency of the particular module in the software. In this paper, we have applied the different predictor models to NASA five public <b>domain</b> <b>defect</b> datasets coded in C, C++, Java and Perl programming languages. Twenty one software metrics of different datasets and Java Classes of thirty five algorithms belonging to the different learner categories of the WEKA project have been evaluated for the prediction of maintenance severity.

40|$|Abstractâ€”As the {{majority}} of faults are found in a few of its modules {{so there is a}} need to investigate the modules that are affected severely as compared to other modules and proper maintenance need to be done in time especially for the critical applications. As, Neural networks, which have been already applied in software engineering applications to build reliability growth models predict the gross change or reusability metrics. Neural networks are non-linear sophisticated modeling techniques that are able to model complex functions. Neural network techniques are used when exact nature of input and outputs is not known. A key feature is that they learn the relationship between input and output through training. In this present work, various Neural Network Based techniques are explored and comparative analysis is performed for the prediction of level of need of maintenance by predicting level severity of faults present in NASAâ€™s public <b>domain</b> <b>defect</b> dataset. The comparison of different algorithms is made on the basis of Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error and Accuracy Values. It is concluded that Generalized Regression Networks is the best algorithm for classification of the software components into different level of severity of impact of the faults. The algorithm can be used to develop model that can be used for identifying modules that are heavily affected by the faults. Keywordsâ€”Neural Network, Software faults, Software Metric. I...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of fault prone modules in software development process enables effective discovery and {{identification of the}} defects. Such prediction models are especially valuable for the large-scale systems, where verification experts need to focus their attention and resources to problem areas in the system under development. This paper presents a methodology for predicting fault prone modules using a modified random forests algorithm. Random forests improve classification accuracy by growing an ensemble of classification trees and letting them vote on the classification decision. We applied the methodology to five NASA public <b>domain</b> <b>defect</b> data sets. These data sets vary in size, but all typically contain {{a small number of}} defect samples in the learning set. For instance, in project PC 1, only around 7 % of the instances are defects. If overall accuracy maximization is the goal, then learning from such data usually results in a biased classifier, i. e. the majority of samples would be classified into non-defect class. To obtain better {{prediction of}} fault-proneness, two strategies are investigated: proper sampling technique in constructing the tree classifiers, and threshold adjustment in determining the winning class. Both are found to be effective in accurate prediction of fault prone modules. In addition, the paper presents a thorough and statistically sound comparison of these methods against ten other classifiers frequently used in the literature...|$|R

40|$|BRCA 1 {{has been}} implicated in {{numerous}} DNA repair pathways that maintain genome integrity, however the function responsible for its tumor suppressor activity in breast cancer remains obscure. To identify the most highly conserved of the many BRCA 1 functions, we screened the evolutionarily distant eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae for mutants that suppressed the G 1 checkpoint arrest and lethality induced following heterologous BRCA 1 expression. A genome-wide screen in the diploid deletion collection combined with a screen of ionizing radiation sensitive gene deletions identified mutants that permit growth {{in the presence of}} BRCA 1. These genes delineate a metabolic mRNA pathway that temporally links transcription elongation (SPT 4, SPT 5, CTK 1, DEF 1) to nucleopore-mediated mRNA export (ASM 4, MLP 1, MLP 2, NUP 2, NUP 53, NUP 120, NUP 133, NUP 170, NUP 188, POM 34) and cytoplasmic mRNA decay at P-bodies (CCR 4, DHH 1). Strikingly, BRCA 1 interacted with the phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) carboxy terminal domain (P-CTD), phosphorylated in the pattern specified by the CTDK-I kinase, to induce DEF 1 -dependent cleavage and accumulation of a RNAPII fragment containing the P-CTD. Significantly, breast cancer associated BRCT <b>domain</b> <b>defects</b> in BRCA 1 that suppressed P-CTD cleavage and lethality in yeast also suppressed the physical interaction of BRCA 1 with human SPT 5 in breast epithelial cells, thus confirming SPT 5 as a relevant target of BRCA 1 interaction.
