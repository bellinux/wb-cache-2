5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E

The gases in lunar regolith were a complex mixture of gases of different origins: Solar, cosmogenic, radiogenic, and so on. Solar wind gases predominated, distributed in the thin surficial layer of the regolith grains. The concentrations of these gases in the surficial layer is several cubic centimeters per gram.

5|$|Once on {{the surface}} the diver will {{continue}} to eliminate <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> until the concentrations have returned to normal surface saturation, which can take several hours, and is considered in some models to be effectively complete after 12 hours, and by others to take up to, or even more than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

During the ascent from adive, <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> must be cleared from the tissues and too rapid decompression will lead to phase separation, and possibly to symptoms of decompression sickness. An analogue is described based on the similarity between gaseous diffusion and thermal conduction; this is used to predict optimal decompression. 1...|$|R
