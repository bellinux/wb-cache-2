6000|$|... "It's {{brought into}} my head, master," [...] returns the woman, her eyes filling with tears, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the child lying so. If {{it was never}} to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I know that very well. I was with Jenny when she lost hers--warn't I, Jenny?--and I know how she grieved. But look around you at this place. Look at them," [...] glancing at the {{sleepers}} on the ground. [...] "Look at the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn. Think of the children that your business lays with often and often, and that YOU see grow up!" ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} factor, I {{could see that}} his face was flushed and that he bore every {{appearance}} of having had an extra glass.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him compassionately, {{for he was}} old {{and broken}} in spirit, and would plainly starve if turned adrift on the prairie, while as I did so the {{surveyor}} broke in: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver {{went up and down}} my backbone. But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|R
60|$|I got up {{then and}} {{approached}} her, {{with a strange}} sort of anxiety. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her round, strong neck, then stooped low enough to peep at her face. And I began to tremble a little myself.|$|R
60|$|Steel's jaw dropped, and his dismay {{would have}} been ludicrous had it not betrayed his whole-hearted friendship, while Thorn's burst of {{sulphurous}} language was an even more convincing testimony. Again I felt a curious humility, and something enlarged in my throat as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
60|$|Quickly I fitted {{an arrow}} now that I might be ready {{at the next}} attack, and as I did so <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the girl, so that I {{surprised}} her in a surreptitious glance which she was stealing at me; but immediately, she again covered {{her face with her}} hands.|$|R
60|$|Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the chain}} on my {{waistcoat}} {{it reminded me}} of Sam. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> on to the river and thought of 'im going down on the ebb. Then I got a sort o' lonesome feeling standing {{on the end of the}} jetty all alone, and I went back to the Bear's Head and 'ad another pint.|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} she was in my arms, weeping convulsively on my {{shoulder}} while I clasped her close. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the brown glory of her hair, glinting gems in the sunshine far more precious to me {{than those in the}} treasure-chests of kings. And I bent my head and kissed her hair softly, so softly that she did not know.|$|R
60|$|Thus I dreamed as {{we moved}} on toward Thuria. My dreaming was rudely {{shattered}} by a savage growl from Raja. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him. He had stopped in his tracks as one turned to stone. A thin ridge of stiff hair bristled along {{the entire length of}} his spine. His yellow green eyes were fastened upon the scrubby jungle at our right.|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} slip {{them out of}} sight, but I was too quick and, seizing one, held it fast, feeling ashamed and sorry as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it. The hard ropes had torn the soft white skin, and {{the rim of the}} bucket or the coaming had left dark bruises. Admiration, mingled with pity, forced me to add: [...] "It was very cruel. I called you child. You are the bravest woman I ever met!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{nevertheless}} fancied she {{was pleased}} at my eagerness, and, for Haldane had passed on, I felt suddenly oppressed by the recognition of what I owed her. Yet had it been possible I should not have lightened the debt. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her gravely, noticing how young and fresh and slender she seemed--bright as the blaze of sunshine in which she stood--and then I pointed towards the long ranks of sheaves and the sea of stately ears.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{stopped and}} <b>looked</b> up at her. She started back from {{me with a}} scream of terror. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> the title-page, and read the next lines-- ...|$|R
60|$|And then {{it struck}} me {{suddenly}} that I was very anxious that she should believe me. It was not that I feared the results which would follow a general belief that I had returned from the Barsoomian heaven or hell, or whatever it was. Why was it, then! Why should I care what she thought? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her; her beautiful face upturned, and her wonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her soul; and as my eyes met hers I knew why, and--I shuddered.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at me without replying, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him without {{pressing}} him too soon with a repetition of my idle question. Just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had force to draw me down. When such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away over the landscape, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> again, and saw him refurling the flag he had shown while the train went by.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his marsh-stained shoes. One {{foot was}} wet to the ankle, {{and a thin}} strip of green seaweed had wound itself around his trousers. To any other man I should have had more to say. Yet even in those first few hours of our {{acquaintance}} I had become, like all the others, to some extent the servant of his will, spoken or unspoken. So I held my peace and looked away into the fire. I felt {{he had something to}} say to me, and I waited.|$|R
5000|$|... "Whatever {{happened}} - and I didn't see it - I {{think part}} of what did happen is he hit the ground and his head hit the cricket pitch... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Johnny and {{it gave me a}} dreadful fright. It was a horrific sight... he was severely hurt." [...] Thompson and fellow Magpies were distraught, some thought Greening would die. [...] "St Kilda's Jim O'Dea received a 10-match suspension for the incident, but Peter McKenna recalls that the initial fear as Greening's teammates ran towards their prostrate young wingman was that they would find him dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|Blacky {{pretended not}} to hear this. [...] "I've often thought," [...] said he, [...] "of you and Mrs. Reddy as <b>I</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> those fat hens. It is too bad that they are so far away." ...|$|R
5000|$|He and {{his manager}} {{were in the}} city {{as part of the}} Alabama {{farewell}} tour. Alphin had $200 to his name and $140,000 in credit card debt, and in hopes of increasing his cash on hand, he went to the blackjack tables. At one point, he had won nearly $1,000, but instead of stopping, he continued to play. Eventually, he lost all but $21. He gave the dealer a $20 tip, leaving Alphin with literally his last dollar. [...] "That night as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the sole breaking off of my shoe it hit me like a ton of bricks," [...] Alphin said. [...] "But with that realization came the freedom of knowing that I also had nothing to lose." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the grave}} with {{a pang of}} {{compassion}} for the unfortunate Wolf Tone Fitzgerald, with whom the blessed would not rest. I was even astonished, though I had worked expressly to this end. But the birds were astir, and the cocks crowing. My landlord was an early riser. I put the spade on the truck again, and hastened back to the farm, where I replaced them in the cow-house. Then I stole into the house, and took a clean pair of boots, an overcoat, and a silk hat. These with a change of linen, were sufficient to make my appearance respectable. I went out again, bathed in Four Mile Water, took {{a last look at}} the cemetery, and walked to Wicklow, whence I traveled by the first train to Dublin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor little girl," [...] <b>I</b> exclaimed, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the slim, graceful figure by my side. [...] "This is no {{atmosphere}} {{for you to}} live in. Why will you not let me rescue you from it? Why won't you allow me to go straight and ask the general for your hand? At the worst he could only refuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her sweet {{spirit was}} about to leave its frail body, that was evident to me as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, but she knew me and whispered, [...] "I'm glad to have you at home." [...] She showed no fear of death, in fact she {{appeared}} unconscious of her grave condition. She was a beautiful character and to see her lying there beneath her old-fashioned quilt, so small and helpless, so patient, lonely and sad, made speech difficult for me. She had meant much in my life. The serene dignity with which she and her mother had carried the best New England traditions into the rough front rank of the Border, was still written in the lines of her face. I had never seen her angry or bitter, and I had never heard her utter an unkind word.|$|R
5000|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} {{the show}} someone out in the crowd ... knew I wasn't feeling too well," [...] {{recalled}} Dylan in a 1979 interview. [...] "I think they could see that. And they threw a silver cross on the stage. Now usually I don't pick things up in front of the stage. Once in a while I do. Sometimes I don't. But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> that cross. <b>I</b> said, 'I gotta pick that up.' So I picked up the cross and I put it in my pocket ... And I brought it backstage and I brought it with me to the next town, which was out in Arizona ... I was feeling even worse than I'd felt when I was in San Diego. I said, 'Well, I need something tonight.' I didn't know what it was. I was used to all kinds of things. I said, 'I need something tonight that I didn't have before.' And <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in my pocket and I had this cross." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lynn, [...] "a self-made {{business}} magnate, {{was suffering}} from nervousness and dissatisfaction when he met Paramahansa Yogananda in Kansas City in 1932. Lynn later said of that meeting: 'I became aware that (for {{the first time in}} years) I was sitting very still...I had found entrance into a spiritual realm previously unknown to me.'" [...] In spite of his material success Lynn was unhappy, and acknowledged that he had a short temper and nervous problems. In January, 1932, his life changed when he attended a series of classes given by Paramahansa Yogananda. Lynn felt instantly transformed in Yogananda’s presence:On the second night of the class, I became aware that I was sitting upright, my spine straight and I was absolutely motionless. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my hands, which were so restlessly moving before and which were now perfectly still… I knew I had found the path that gave me inner peace and satisfaction and that I had found that something tangible I was seeking, a guru.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Little Nassau" [...] {{was already}} filled and {{straining}} at the guys. The parachute lay flat {{along the ground}} and beyond it the trapeze. I tossed aside my overcoat, took my position, and gave the signal to let go. As you know, the first rush upward from the earth is very sudden, {{and this time the}} balloon, when it first caught the wind, heeled violently over and was longer than usual in righting. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the old familiar sight of the world rushing away from me. And there were the thousands of people, every face silently upturned. And the silence startled me, for, as crowds went, this was the time for them to catch their first breath and send up a roar of applause. But there was no hand-clapping, whistling, cheering--only silence. And instead, clear as a bell and distinct, without the slightest shake or quaver, came George's voice through the megaphone: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Seville from above. A Spanish town wears always {{its most}} picturesque {{appearance}} thus seen, {{but it is}} never different; the patios glaring with whitewash, the roofs of brown and yellow tiles, and the narrow streets, winding in unexpected directions, narrower than ever from such a height and dark with shade, so that they seem black rivulets gliding stealthily through the whiteness. Looking at a northern city from a tall church tower all things are confused with one another, the slate roofs join together till {{it is like a}} huge uneven sea of grey; but in Seville the atmosphere is so limpid, the colour so brilliant, that every house is clearly separated from its neighbour, and sometimes there appears to be between them a preternatural distinctness. Each stands independently of any other; you might suppose yourself in a strange city of the Arabian Nights where a great population lived in houses crowded together, but invisibly, so that each person fancied himself in isolation.|$|R
60|$|At last, in {{the distant}} topmost floor, I had my bedroom, with two beds and bare floor and scant furniture. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the river far below, at the covered bridge, at the far lights on the hill above, opposite. Strange {{to be here in}} this lost, {{forgotten}} place, sleeping under the roof with tramps and beggars. I debated whether they would steal my boots if I put them out. But I risked it. The door-latch made a loud noise on the deserted landing, everywhere felt abandoned, forgotten. I wondered where the eight tramps and beggars were asleep. There was no way of securing the door. But somehow I felt that, if I were destined to be robbed or murdered, it would not be by tramps and beggars. So I blew out the candle and lay under the big feather bed, listening to the running and whispering of the medieval Rhine.|$|R
6000|$|... "It gets {{me going}} when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the aisle <b>at</b> {{the altar and}} see the arches and so on. And the priests in their robes--they look so--so way up--oh, I dunno just how to say it--so kind of uplifted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A citizen anarchist from Barcelona?" [...] <b>I</b> repeated, stupidly, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the man. He {{had turned}} to {{his work in the}} engine-well of the launch and {{presented}} his bowed back to us. In that attitude I heard him protest, very audibly: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was pleased}} to find that William's {{troubles}} were near an end without my having to interfere in his behalf, and I then remembered {{that he would not}} be able to see the girl Irene from the library windows, which are at the back of the club. <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, but she refrained from signalling because she could not see William, and irritated by her stupidity I went out and asked her how her mother was.|$|R
60|$|As we {{went through}} the court I felt as though I had been tied to a string, {{suspended}} in the air, and spun. This was undoubtedly due to the heat. And after the astonishing conversation from which we had come, my admiration for the lady beside me was magnified to a veritable awe. We reached the archway. Madame la Vicomtesse held me lightly by the edge of my coat, and <b>I</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|It {{was curious}} and interesting, nevertheless, {{to be sitting}} up there behind four horses: well educated, well dressed, and with plenty of money in my pocket; and {{to look out for}} the places where I had slept on my weary journey. I had {{abundant}} occupation for my thoughts, in every conspicuous landmark on the road. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the trampers whom we passed, and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up, I felt as if the tinker's blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again. When we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham, and I caught a glimpse, in passing, of the lane where the old monster lived who had bought my jacket, I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my money. When we came, at last, within a stage of London, and passed the veritable Salem House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand, I would have given all I had, for lawful permission to get down and thrash him, and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows.|$|R
60|$|Now Larry {{was a large}} man, {{much larger}} {{altogether}} than myself, and as he said this <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> involuntarily <b>at</b> his feet; or rather at his foot, for as he stood I could only see one. And then a sudden hope filled my heart. On that foot there glittered a shoe--not indeed such as were my own which were now resting ingloriously at Ballyglass while they were so sorely needed at Castle Conor; but one which I could wear before ladies, without shame--and in my present frame of mind with infinite contentment.|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} why. I did {{not know}} enough of her brother for the remotest guess at what he might be like. I had never set eyes on the man. I didn't know him so completely that by contrast I seemed to have known Miss de Barral--whom I had seen twice (altogether about sixty minutes) and with whom I had exchanged about sixty words--from the cradle so to speak. And perhaps, <b>I</b> thought, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mrs Fyne (<b>I</b> had remained standing) perhaps she thinks that this ought to be enough for a sagacious assent.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{thick of}} the crowd had already passed. 'Looky there, Ted,' quoth the younger of the detectives, with the {{sharpness}} of surprise in his voice, and pointed straight to my feet. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> and saw <b>at</b> once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud. For a moment I was paralysed.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1978, Dylan {{initiated}} a ten-month World Tour {{that consisted of}} 114 concerts in ten countries. On June 15, Dylan released the album Street-Legal, which received poor reviews from most American critics. Performances on his world tour also received negative reviews. The physical demands of touring were also taking a toll on the artist. During a concert on November 17 in San Diego, someone from the audience threw a small silver cross on stage. Dylan later recalled in a 1979 interview: [...] Towards {{the end of the}} show someone out in the crowd ... knew I wasn't feeling too well. I think they could see that. And they threw a silver cross on the stage. Now usually I don't pick things up in front of the stage ... But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> that cross. <b>I</b> said, 'I gotta pick that up.' So I picked up the cross and I put it in my pocket ... And I brought it backstage and I brought it with me to the next town, which was out in Arizona ... I was feeling even worse than I'd felt when I was in San Diego. I said, 'Well, I need something tonight.' I didn't know what it was. I was used to all kinds of things. I said, 'I need something tonight that I didn't have before.' And <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in my pocket and I had this cross.|$|R
