In 2010, while lecturing on nuclear weapons politics, Majid endorsed Qadeer Khan's services and stressed to the fact that: [...] "Pakistan had {{to be mindful of}} a blatant pursuit of military preponderance in its eastern neighborhood". Lecturing at the National Defence University, General Majid argued that [...] "a proposed fissile material cutoff treaty would target Pakistan specifically. Islamabad has refused to allow talks on such a pact to proceed at the International Conference on Disarmament. As chairman joint chiefs, Majid had asserted his role as principle military adviser to the [...] government of Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and President Asif Ali Zardari on the matters involving the nuclear policy, military affairs, and geostrategic positions of Pakistan. [...] He presented the government a tri-services combat framework to tackle the joint combat operations against the extreme elements; a plan which was duly approved by Prime minister Gillani as part of his war strategy. While presenting this plan Majid noted to Prime minister Gillani {{that there is a need}} to harmonize individual capacities of the services so that efforts are synergized within a framework of jointness and <b>inter-operability</b> to meet present and future challenges. He played a vital role in devising the government to change its foreign policy to neutral matters in Afghanistan, and to lessen the American influence in the country which had dismayed the civil society of the country.|$|E
