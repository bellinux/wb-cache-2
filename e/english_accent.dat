It became the actress' first regular role since playing Samantha Carter on Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for eleven years. She initially had difficulty playing Magnus as her personality greatly differed from Carter. She also dyed her hair darker and spoke with an <b>English</b> <b>accent</b> throughout the run, as she herself was born in England. In addition, Tapping serves as the series executive producer and on some occasions, director.|$|E

5|$|Johansson {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} an alien who preys on men in Scotland in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction movie Under the Skin (2013).

5|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{recorded}} {{that his}} mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912. For two years Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles Robotham in Swindon. Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his <b>English</b> <b>accent,</b> and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E

Balthier received many privileges as Cid's son, including being made an Imperial Judge, but eventually cut ties with his father when Cid became consumed by his experimentation with nethicite. He left {{the service of the}} empire, stole an Archadian airship, and took a new name. Balthier is now a renowned career criminal with a sizable bounty on his head, and must be careful to avoid the attention of both the law and the bounty hunters seeking the reward for his capture. He originally joins the resistance in the hope of reacquiring the Dusk Shard, but when he learns it is actually a piece of nethicite, he sees too much of his father's obsession in his own quest and decides to abandon the search. After the party defeats Dr. Cid at the Pharos, Balthier makes peace with his father and helps the group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for Cid's deeds.|$|E

25|$|Note: Gilbert {{supplied}} a topsy-turvy twist {{by writing}} Julia's dialogue in a German accent, since {{she is the}} only English character in Ernest's company; all of the Germans speak with an <b>English</b> <b>accent.</b> The first Julia, Ilka Pálmay, was Hungarian but performed mostly in German.

For instance, in the 1976 D'Oyly Carte recording (which did not include the dialogue), the singer playing Julia did not affect a German accent.|$|E

500|$|Northern <b>English</b> <b>accents</b> {{have not}} {{undergone}} the TRAP–BATH split, {{and a common}} shibboleth to distinguish them from Southern ones is the Northern use of the short a (the near-open front unrounded vowel) in words such as bath and castle. On the opposite border, most Northern <b>English</b> <b>accents</b> can be distinguished from Scottish accents because they are non-rhotic, although a few rhotic Lancashire accents remain. Other features common to many Northern <b>English</b> <b>accents</b> are {{the absence of the}} FOOT–STRUT split (so put and putt are homophones), the reduction of the definite article the to a glottal stop (usually represented in writing as t), and the T-to-R rule that leads to the pronunciation of t as a rhotic consonant in words and phrases like matter (...) and get up (...)

25|$|The {{speaking}} dialect or accent of {{a person}} may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that {{is used in the}} style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent {{of a person}} than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an <b>English</b> <b>accent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Earlier lineups of {{the band}} were sextets and octets {{employing}} extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employ a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith's lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong punk-styled Estuary <b>English</b> <b>accent)</b> and choral sections (varying from yelled to falsetto) involving most or all {{of the band}}. Smith's singing style has been described by music critics as 'skittish'; it has also been commented that his singing voice sounds very similar to his speaking one. The band's music is written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions have been made by other group members.|$|E

25|$|Hiroyuki Sanada as Kaneda, the ship's captain. The script {{originally}} had an American captain, but Boyle changed the nationality to Japanese {{after studying the}} opinions of scientists and space experts. Boyle saw Sanada in The Twilight Samurai (2002), and director Wong Kar-wai recommended the actor to Boyle when the latter sought someone to cast as the Asian captain of the ship. Sanada's character was originally called Kanada, but he asked Boyle to change the name to Kaneda, a more natural Japanese name. The character was Sanada's second English-language role in cinema, and Sanada learned different forms of English, depending on the circumstances. Sanada's base English language had a British dialect, and when the actor recited official statements as Kaneda, the dialect was official English. In communicating with other characters as Kaneda, Sanada spoke with an American <b>English</b> <b>accent</b> to reflect the fictional situation of the character training with the rest at NASA.|$|E

To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an <b>English</b> <b>accent</b> and the duke {{pretends to be}} a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men {{who seem to be}} the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E
