5|$|After Morta's {{death in}} 1262, Mindaugas took her sister (name unknown) {{as his wife}} despite her being married to Daumantas. This cruel act {{motivated}} Daumantas to become an ally of Treniota and assassinate Mindaugas {{with two of his}} sons. Treniota was Mindaugas' nephew. It is believed that he was son of Duke of Samogitia, either Vykintas or Erdvilas. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was Vykintas, then there was a double marriage: Vykintas' sister married Dausprungas and Dausprungas' (and Mindaugas') sister married Vykintas. Erdvilas is mentioned only once in the 1219 treaty. The other nephew, Lengvenis, played a role in Lithuanian state in 1242–1260.|$|E

500|$|An article {{published}} in People's Daily, China's top state newspaper, accused the United States and NATO of flouting international law and fanning terrorism. Simultaneously, many Chinese scholars, analysts and members of leading think tanks also expressed strong criticism of NATO's attack. A former spokesperson for the US state department said China, which is a close ally of Pakistan, [...] "sees this as a target of opportunity, both to tweak the US and to subtly suggest to Pakistan that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> sours of {{its relationship with the}} US, it has an alternative".|$|E
500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 October 1961, a {{group of}} campaigners {{including}} J. M.

2500|$|Mixed {{reviews of}} the album have focused on its change in style from {{previous}} Opeth albums. Uncut magazine wrote, [...] "On Heritage, [...] jettisoning practically all trace of heavy whatsoever". Similarly, Kerrang! magazine wrote, [...] "It's an album that succeeds {{on its own terms}} but <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> does mark the effective end of Opeth as a metal band, that will remain our loss". In a negative review for Drowned in Sound, Patrick Smith wrote, [...] "Åkerfeldt should be praised for breaking free of an often repetitive genre – there's nothing wrong with radical reinvention. But this departure didn't need to be quite so lacklustre".|$|E
2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is {{a single}} animal and not a chimera, Protoavis would raise {{interesting}} questions about when birds began to diverge from the dinosaurs, but until better evidence is produced, the animal's status currently remains uncertain. Furthermore, paleobiogeography suggests that true birds did not colonize the Americas until the Cretaceous; the most primitive lineages of unequivocal birds found to date are all Eurasian. Certainly, the fossils are most parsimoniously attributed to primitive dinosaurian and other reptiles as outlined above. However, coelurosaurs and ceratosaurs are in any case not too distantly related to the ancestors of birds and in {{some aspects of the}} skeleton not unlike them, explaining how their fossils could be mistaken as avian. Palaeontologist Zhonghe Zhou stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Utilitarian {{theories}}, on {{the other}} hand, must answer the charge that ends do not justify the means. The problem arises in these theories {{because they tend to}} separate the achieved ends from the action by which these ends were produced. One implication of utilitarianism is that one's intention in performing an act may include all of its foreseen consequences. The goodness of the intention then reflects the balance of the good and evil of these consequences, with no limits imposed upon it {{by the nature of the}} act itself—even if it be, say, the breaking of a promise or the execution of an innocent man. Utilitarianism, in answering this charge, must show either that what is apparently immoral is not really so or that, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is so, then closer examination of the consequences will bring this fact to light. Ideal utilitarianism (G.E. Moore and Hastings Rashdall) tries to meet the difficulty by advocating a plurality of ends and including among them the attainment of virtue itself, which, as John Stuart Mill affirmed, [...] "may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good".|$|E

2500|$|Of Hai's poetical {{writings}} {{few have}} been preserved, {{and even of}} these the genuineness is doubted. The didactic poem [...] "Musar Haskel" [...] is generally regarded as authentic, though Dukes expressed some doubts as to its genuineness, as old Jewish authors like al-Harizi and ibn Tibbon do not mention it; and Steinschneider also regarded it as of doubtful authenticity. The first edition appeared about 1505 (see Fano); others were published in Constantinople (1531), in Paris (1559), and elsewhere. The modern editions are as follows: Dukes, Ehrensäulen, p.96; Grätz, Blumenlese, p.27; Steinschneider, Musar Haskel, Berlin, 1860; Weiss, Liqquṭe Qadmonim, Warsaw, 1893; Philipp, Sämmtliche Gedichte des R. Hai Gaon, Lemberg, 1881; a Latin translation by Jean Mercier, Cantica Eruditionis Intellectus Auctore per Celebri R. Hai, Paris, 1561; another by Caspar Seidel, Carmen Morale ΣτροφορυΘμον Elegantissimum R. Chai, etc., Leiptzig, 1638. The [...] "Musar Haskel" [...] consists of 189 double verses in the Arabic meter [...] "rajaz," [...] and {{it is said to}} have therefore received the title of [...] "Arjuzah." [...] <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> belongs to Hai, he was, as far as is known, the first Eastern writer to use an Arabic meter in Hebrew poetry. Every strophe is complete in itself, and independent of the preceding strophe.|$|E
