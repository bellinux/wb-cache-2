25|$|Being {{the weakest}} {{of the weak}} {{chemical}} forces, with a strength between 0.4 and 4kJ/mol they may still support an integral structural load when multitudes of such interactions are present. Such a force results from a transient shift in electron density. Specifically, as the electrons are in orbit of the protons and neutrons within an atom the electron density may tend to shift more greatly on a side. Thus, this generates a transient charge to which a nearby atom can be either attracted or repelled. When the <b>interatomic</b> <b>distance</b> of two atoms is greater than 0.6 nm the force is {{not strong enough to}} be observed. In the same vein, when the <b>interatomic</b> <b>distance</b> is below 0.4 nm the force becomes repulsive.|$|E
25|$|Thallium is a soft, {{reactive}} metal (MH 1.0), {{so much so}} that it has no structural uses. It has a close-packed crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) but an abnormally large <b>interatomic</b> <b>distance</b> that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the thallium atoms. Although compounds in the +1 (mostly ionic) oxidation state are the more numerous, thallium has an appreciable chemistry in the +3 (largely covalent) oxidation state, as seen in its chalcogenides and trihalides. It {{is the only one of}} the Group 13 elements to react with air at room temperature, slowly forming the amphoteric oxide Tl2O3. It forms anionic thallates such as Tl3TlO3, Na3Tl(OH)6, NaTlO2, and KTlO2, and is present as the Tl− thallide anion in the compound CsTl.

30|$|X-ray {{scattering}} is {{a powerful}} technique for investigating both atomic ordering and electronic density contrast evolution linked with pore filling. Usually, the range of distances to be analysed is so different that, for technical reasons, two different experimental set up must be used: small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). SAXS brings information about phenomena impacting large distance range such as pore filling, while WAXS is used to study short (<b>interatomic)</b> <b>distances.</b> However, the high capacitance observed in porous carbons being associated {{with the presence of}} micropores with size close to <b>interatomic</b> <b>distances</b> (between 0.6 and 1  nm), these sizes are small enough to generate “typical SAXS” patterns in the lowest part of the angular range normally used to investigate <b>interatomic</b> <b>distances.</b> That makes the use of the WAXS technique sufficient to investigate both pore filling and pore wall modifications. Moreover, the access to low and high angles parts in a single experiment allows an easy evaluation of the ratio between the different components (carbon, electrolyte, sample holder) useful to separate their contributions.|$|R

50|$|Channeling is {{observed}} when the incident beam is aligned {{with a major}} symmetry axis of the crystal. Incident nuclei which avoid collisions with surface atoms are excluded from collisions with all atoms deeper in the sample, due to blocking by the first layer of atoms. When the <b>interatomic</b> <b>distance</b> is large compared to the radius of the blocked cone, the incident ions can penetrate many times the <b>interatomic</b> <b>distance</b> without being backscattered.
