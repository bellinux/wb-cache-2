5|$|By 1932, {{there was}} an {{increasing}} movement for government control. By mid-1934 when Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia called for a Catholic boycott of all films, and Raymond Cannon was privately preparing a congressional bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans which would introduce Government oversight, the studios decided they had had enough. They re-organized the <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedures</b> giving Hays and the recently appointed Joseph I. Breen, a devout Roman Catholic, {{head of the new}} Production Code Administration (PCA), greater control over censorship. The studios agreed to disband their appeals committee and to impose a $25,000 fine for producing, distributing, or exhibiting any film without PCA approval. Hays had originally hired Breen, who had worked in public relations, in 1930 to handle Production Code publicity, and the latter was popular among Catholics.* Jeff & Simmmons, pg. 55.* Ross, pg. 270. Joy began working solely for Fox Studios, and Wingate had been bypassed in favor of Breen in December 1933. Hays became a functionary, while Breen handled the business of censoring films.|$|E

Rwanda has especially focused on community rebuilding placing justice in the hands of trusted citizens. However, the system has come under criticism from a number of sources, including the Survivors Fund, which represents survivors of the genocide, due to the danger that it poses to survivors and there have been a number of reports on survivors being targeted for giving evidence at the courts. However, the Rwandan government maintains the success of Gacaca Courts citing their present success as a country.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to discuss and analyse the {{novelties}} introduced in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure</b> on immovable property by the latest Amendments to the Enforcement Law, particularly {{in the context of}} the protection of the debtor and the immovable property in which he/ she resides, and the property necessary for satisfying his/her basic needs and those of the persons that he/she is legally obliged to support. In this context, the paper contains a summary of the historical genesis on regulation of the <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure</b> on immovable property, particularly in relation to the protection of the debtor in the period from the adoption of the first Enforcement Law of 1996 until the Law of 2012.

2500|$|After the Cork Report in 1982, a {{major new}} {{objective}} for UK insolvency law became creating a [...] "rescue culture" [...] for business, as well as ensuring transparency, accountability and collectivity. The hallmark of the rescue culture is the administration procedure in the Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1 as updated by the Enterprise Act 2002. Under Schedule B1, paragraph 3 sets the primary objective of the administrator as [...] "rescuing the company as a going concern", or if not usually selling the business, {{and if this is}} not possible realising the property to distribute to creditors. Once an administrator is appointed, she will replace the directors. Under paragraph 40 all creditors are precluded by a statutory moratorium from bringing <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedures</b> to recover their debts. This even includes a bar on secured creditors taking and or selling assets subject to security, unless they get the court's permission. The moratorium is fundamental to keeping the business' assets intact and giving the company a [...] "breathing space" [...] for the purpose of a restructure. It also extends to a moratorium on the enforcement of criminal proceedings. So in Environmental Agency v Clark the Court of Appeal held that the Environment Agency needed court approval to bring a prosecution against a polluting company, though in the circumstances leave was granted. Guidance for when leave should be given by the court was elaborated in Re Atlantic Computer Systems plc (No 1). In this case, the company in administration had sublet computers that were owned by a set of banks who wanted to repossess them. Nicholls LJ held leave to collect assets should be given if it would not impede the administration's purpose, but strong weight should be given to the interests of the holder of property rights. Here, the banks were given permission because the costs to the banks were disproportionate to the benefit to the company. The moratorium lasts for one year, but can be extended with the administration.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the distrubution of {{responsibilities}} in the environmental law <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{between the state and}} the individual environmental actor. The state and its public authorities have a fundamental environmental responsibility. This responsibility is nevertheless shared with the actors. Actor responsibilities include taking sufficient precautionary measures, and controling the own activities. This also covers responsibilities for knowledge and investigation, which are in focus in the thesis analysis. Such responsibilities are enforced by administrative authorities. Enforcement, however, also entails exercise of public power against the individual, and thus warrants proper procedure and safeguards of legal certainty.  Such procedural responsibilities include ensuring decision making materials to support their exercise of authority. It also means that the authority has formulate clearly to the actor what their legal duties are, and what they need to do to avoid further enforcement. These administrative duties may entail the authority taking over the actor's information responsibilities under environmental law. Enforcement of actor responsibilities thus becomes inconsistent, or even contraproductive. This thesis comprises analysis of the meeting of environmental and administrative law in the enforcement situation. The analysis is focused on balancing effective implementation and enforcement of policy aims, and the safeguards of the individual's rights and freedoms. The aims is to find ways to coordingate instead of prioritising these objectives.  The research is based on a comparative study and analysis of the enforcement systems of Sweden, the United Kingdom (England and Wales), and the Netherlands. The importance of distinguising between the different purposes and aims of the responsibilities is argued. Actor responsibilities for precaution and information should be recognised also in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure.</b> A communicative <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure,</b> and more purposive assessment of the proper distribution of responsibilities in the individual case may provide both effective enforcement and legal certainty.

New Serbian Enforcement and Security Act has established enforcement agents as new legal profession. New Law distinguishes between (private) enforcement agents and court bailiffs. Only graduate and experienced lawyer who has passed special exam and meets other conditions can be appointed as enforcement agent. His primary duty is to carry the enforcement out, but in some situations he is solely responsible for the whole <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure.</b> When it comes to collection of utilites (state companies are <b>enforcement</b> creditors) <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure</b> is almost completely in hands of enforcement agent. The system of enforcement agents is not organized in a way that fosters competition. It is closed system that leads to monopoly and possible corruption. Enforcement agents are primarily responsible to the Ministry of Justice, and not so much under the court's supervision. Chamber of enforcement agents is not completely autonomous but under control of the Ministry of Justice. Besides enforcement agents court bailiffs still continue to exist. Mixture of enforcement agents and court bailiffs exists in other countries as well. Mixed status is transitional before moving to a fully private status of enforcement agents...|$|R
