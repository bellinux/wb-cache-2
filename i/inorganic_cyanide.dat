Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Consultant: Prof. RNDr. Karel Bezouška, DrSc. Faculty of Science, Department of Biochemistry,, Charles University in Prague Prague 2010 INTRODUCTION Nitriles are widespread in the environment - not only as the natural products of plants but also as the secondary metabolites of microorganisms or higher organisms. Synthetic nitriles and <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanides</b> occur as pollutants from human activities (industrial wastes, herbicides, etc.). Both natural and man-made nitriles are poisonous to many organisms, the natural ones serving as a protection against enemies (e. g. herbivores). Their toxic activity is used in some herbicides.

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{comparing}} the toxic effects of cassava-borne organic cyanide and equivalent level of <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> (KCN) in New Zealand White rabbits. Three groups of 3 -month old, male weanling rabbits (4 per group) were used. One group received pure growers mash (control), while another was fed isonitrogenous cassava peel flour, CPF containing 702 ppm organic cyanide. A third group was given mash with 702 ppm KCN (<b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide).</b> Feed intake, body weight gain, and serum SCN-were recorded. The animals were fed for 10 weeks prior to sacrifice and isolation of tissues for assays of rhodanese, LDH, ALT, AST and serum urea and creatinine. Feed intake and weight gain were significantly lower in CPF group than in KCN group, but LDH activities in serum, liver, and lung were significantly higher in the CPF group (p < 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences}} in the tissue and serum levels of AST and ALT between both groups. In addition, serum urea and creatinine did not differ significantly between the CPF and KCN groups. However liver and kidney rhodanese activities and urinary thiocyanate were significantly higher in the KCN group (p < 0. 05). More pronounced pathological lesions (tubular and glomerular necrosis) were evident in the kidney from the CPF group, while liver lesions (congestion, necrosis and inflammatory reactions) were more severe in the KCN group. These results suggest that although the metabolic effects of cassava-borne organic cyanide and <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> resemble, the severity of their tissue toxicities may differ...|$|E
40|$|Cyanide {{formation}} by microorganisms {{is typically}} observed during early stationary growth phase and is {{facilitated by the}} presence of iron(III) and inorganic phosphate. Extracellular free cyanide in aqueous solutions might readily react with methemoglobin added and can be determined by UV/VIS spectroscopy. As alternative to existing methods, this provided the basis for an analytical method which has not been used previously for the determination of cyanide in bacterial cultivations. We successfully applied the technique to study the combined effect of both iron(III) and phosphate on the cyanide formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens, which we used as model organism known for its ability to form HCN. Information on the combined effect of iron and phosphate was obtained by using commercially available 24 -well microtiter plates as two-dimensional gradient systems. After its reaction with methemoglobin, cyanide was measured reproducibly at the wavelength of 427 nm. We found a combined effect of both iron and phosphate. In the absence of <b>inorganic</b> phosphate, <b>cyanide</b> formation was stimulated considerably by increasing concentrations of iron(III), although the effect on the bacterial growth of P. fluorescens was almost insignificant. This suggests that iron is more important than inorganic phosphate for the cyanogenesis by P. fluorescens...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{tests with}} model {{systems and the}} testing in pilot systems under application-oriented {{conditions}} have demonstrated the extreme stability and the highest known overpotential for water electrolysis for conductive diamond / 1, 2 /. Conductive diamond is based on activated low-pressure chemical vapour deposition of boron doped polycrystalline diamond coatings on electrode substrates. The substrate materials are predominantly niobium, titanium or silicon, respectively. The diamond coating technology is able to produce three dimensional electrodes as well as elecrodes with dimensions up to 50 cm x 100 cm / 3 /. Fundamental investigations have demonstrated an effective anodic oxidation of organic and <b>inorganic</b> (e. g. <b>cyanides)</b> substances in water. This high effectivity {{is caused by the}} generation of OH radicals with high current efficiency / 4 /. The current efficiency for generation of OH radicals on the other hand is based on the high overpotential which suppresses or even avoids the competing generation of oxygen. In this contribution we demonstrate the performance of conductive diamond resulting from these specific properties by application examples in the field of wastewater treatment. Current research and development with the aim of establishing the new electrode material is focusing on quality control for the production of diamond electrodes, development and integration of reactors with diamond electrodes into industrial processes and the investigation of new appliations.

40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} are in use {{to improve}} the quality of contaminated groundwaters at many sites in the USA. Target contaminants include both organic and inorganic constituents. Volatile and nonvolatile hydrocarbons are found in ground water at closed petroleum refinery sites, and in leachates from landfills. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are pollutants at many sites. Chlorinated organics occur in waters as the result of the disposal of solvents. <b>Inorganics,</b> such as <b>cyanide,</b> ammonia and a number of metals are also of concern at many sites. Natural treatment systems are comprised of combinations of ponds, wetlands, cascades, and infiltration basins. These may be designed to operate in a passive mode, with only minimal and infrequent maintenance activities necessary. These features are exceptionally attractive for treatment in perpetuity, because of low present worth compared to other technologies. A major disadvantage of natural systems is their land- intensive character; however, the remediation flows are often quite small. As a consequence, relatively small natural systems such as wetlands may provide long detention and treatment. This paper describes the design, operation and performance of four operating facilities that involve constructed wetlands. The Casper, Wyoming project uses subsurface flow wetlands to treat gasoline range organics at a closed refinery. The Hillsdale, Michigan project uses a passive surface flow wetland to reduce chlorinated organics. The Saginaw, Michigan project uses both vertical flow and surface flow wetlands to treat leachate from a closed landfill. The Knoxville, Tennessee project uses surface flow wetlands to reduce both cyanide and petroleum hydrocarbons in a groundwater discharge.

40|$|<b>Inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> and nitrile {{compounds}} {{are distributed}} widely in the environment, chiefly {{as a result}} of anthropogenic activity but also through cyanide synthesis by a range of organisms including higher plants, fungi and bacteria. The major source of cyanide in soil and water is through the discharge of effluents containing a variety of <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> and nitriles. Here the fate of cyanide compounds in soil and water is reviewed, identifying those factors that affect their persistence and which determine whether they are amenable to biological degradation. The exploitation of cyanides by a variety of taxa, as a mechanism to avoid predation or to inhibit competitors has led to the evolution in many organisms of enzymes that catalyse degradation of a range of cyanide compounds. Microorganisms expressing pathways involved in cyanide degradation are briefly reviewed and the current applications of bacteria and fungi in the biodegradation of cyanide contamination in the field are discussed. Finally, recent advances that offer an insight into the potential of microbial systems for the bioremediation of cyanide compounds under a range of environmental conditions are identified, and the future potential of these technologies for the treatment of cyanide pollution is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Background: Besides acute lethal cyanide poisoning, its chronic {{intoxication}} may also produce some pathologic effects on different tissues that precedes alterations in biochemical parameters. The {{present study was}} aimed to evaluate the effects of sublethal cyanide exposure on some tissue enzyme activities in liver and kidney of rats. Methods: Twelve male rats {{were divided into two}} groups as follows: Group 1 rats served as control. Rats in group 2 received water containing 200 ppm <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide.</b> At the end of the experiment (42 days), hepatic and renal activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and rhodanese were measured. Results: Potassium cyanide administration caused elevation of all measured liver enzymes in group 2, although the increase was only significant for AST and ALT activities as compared to control values (P< 0. 05). Moreover, renal AST activity in rats from group 2 was significantly higher than those from controls. Conclusion: The altered tissue activities of some enzymes in the present study might reflect the metabolic disturbances due to cyanide intoxication in studied organs. However, further research should be focused on this issue for better understanding of the fine mechanism of cyanide effects upon metabolic enzyme activities. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Biochemistry) An Acinetobacter sp. was {{isolated}} {{which had the}} ability to metabolise both organic nitriles and <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> salts. The enzyme responsible for the degradation of the nitrile groups, was found to be an extra-cellular complex. This complex was partially purified and was shown to consist of not only a number of protein fractions, but also a definite lipid fraction which was identified as being fatty acids. The entire complex had a molecular weight of about 80 000 Da. The enzyme complex exhibited a high degree of stability in the crude form, but rapidly lost its activity on further purification. The complex had a Km of 0. 154 ug/ml and a Vmax of 0. 534 ug/ml/min for KCN as substrate. This Km value indicates that the complex has a high affinity for KCN and may be of use in the removal of cyanide at low levels. The temperature optimum was shown to be 20 ·C and the pH-optimum 6. 5. Fatty acids were produced both in the presence and absence of a nitrile substrate, and it is unclear whether carbon from CN degradation can be channeled into fatty acid synthesis by this particular bacterium. This bacterium was found to be very effective in the degradation of nitrile compounds. The removal of cyanide from mine effluents is of particular interest in South Africa today and no effective biological method is currently in use...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. An Acinetobacter sp. strain RFB 1 {{isolated}} in our laboratory {{has been shown}} {{to have the ability to}} metabolise <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> salts, CO 2, and bicarbonate. The enzyme aggregate responsible for the conversion of these substrates, is located extra-cellularly. Resolution of the extra-cellular complex, a crude enzyme filtrate, was attempted in order to characterise the protein responsible for the reduction of CO 2. The crude enzyme filtrate was separated by means of molecular exclusion chromatography and afforded three fractions with molecular masses ranging from 76 000 to 191 000. Analysis by SDS-electrophoresis, showed that the first protein fraction contained more than ten proteins. Certain of these proteins were identified in the second fraction and other proteins in the third protein fraction. This implies that some denaturation already occurred during molecular exclusion separation. The functionali 7 ation of CO 2 by protein fractions 1 and 3 supports this argument, and, in addition, cyanide ions were only reduced by fractions 1 and 2. Fatty acids, ranging with chainlengths between C 5 and C 25, were shown to be present and certain fatty acids were unequivocally identified by GC-mass spectroscopy as the products resulting from CO 2 functionali 7 ation and carbon-carbon bond formation. Ferrous ions, in an optimal concentration of 250 gg cm', were necessary and served as an essential ingredient of the reaction mixture. A rather unusual result was, however, that apart from an initial, relatively small uptake of Fe(II), significant amounts of Fe(III) were not formed and the Fe(II) concentration remained approximately constant during the reaction. This implies that the formed Fe(M) is rapidly reduced to Fe(II) again. Spectroscopic measurements, furthermore, strongly suggested the involvement of an iron-sulphur cluster in a cyclic redox process wherein both Fe(II) and Fe(III) are involved. Carefully conducted experiments pointed to light as the outside source of energy. Qualitative similarities with an artificial photosynthetic process, formulated earlier by J-M. Lehlliii, can be drawn and used partly to explain the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs: 2014 / 2015 Nitriles {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important classes of organic compounds used as intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds and pharmaceutical substances. Furthermore, they are also used in agrochemicals, herbicides, polymers, dyes and natural products, which are derived from amino acids in plants, arthropods, bacteria and fungi. Nitriles are also versatile intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry due to their easy conversion into amines, amides, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, esters, etc. The most common and well-known procedure for the preparation of nitriles is the nucleophilic displacement of substrates with suitable leaving groups such as halogen compounds, aryl sulphonates, alcohols, ester, ethers, nitro or amino compounds and diazonium salts with <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> ions. The conventional methods and several other reported procedures such as dehydration of amides and aldoximes, condensation of carboxylic acids with NH 3 and conversion of aldehydes, alcohols and esters, often require hazardous reagents, severe reaction conditions and/or produce stoichiometric waste. For example, the Rosenmund-von Braun and the Sandmeyer reaction require the use of stoichiometric amounts of CuCN and produce high amounts of CuCl as waste. To overcome some of these environmental related problems, catalytic methods such as direct conversion of primary amines to nitriles via dehydrogenation could be a viable alternative and clean route if a simple olefin is used as hydrogen acceptor. This procedure offers a mechanistically distinct and relatively benign pathway for nitrile synthesis. n catalysis, ruthenium complexes have been proved to be very efficient for transfer hydrogenation reactions. So considering this previous background, my work has been focused in the study of the catalytic mechanism of dehydrogenation of amines into the corresponding nitriles using different ruthenium complexes as catalysts. For that, I have synthesized 3 ruthenium complexes containing NHC ligands (imidazolylidenes in this case) with different electronic properties. The modulation of the electronic properties is introduced by changing the functional groups at 4 and 5 positions in the imidazol ring. The main purpose of this work was to study how the electronic density over the metal affects the effectiveness of the dehydrogenation of amines over a series of arenes with different functional groups...|$|E
40|$|Acanthella cavernosa is {{a brightly}} {{coloured}} orange tropical marine sponge commonly found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region, including the eastern coastline of Australia. Chemical studies on A. cavernosa {{have revealed that}} the major sesquiterpenoid components of Australian species of this sponge are (+) -axisonitrile- 3 and (+) axisothiocyanate- 3, which contain a spiro[4. 5]decane skeleton. The biosynthetic origin of the isocyano and isothiocyanato functionalities in marine secondary metabolism remains a source of intrigue. Previous investigations have shown <b>inorganic</b> <b>cyanide</b> and thiocyanate to be precursors to isocyanide and isothiocyanate functional groups in marine sponge systems. In addition, a clear link has been established between the isocyano and isothiocyanato functional groups, with suggestions that the interconversion between these two groups is occurring enzymatically. In preparation for synthetic and biosynthetic studies on (+) -axisonitrile- 3, a stereoselective synthesis {{of a series of}} menthyl-based model compounds containing nitrogenous functionalities was completed. This series of compounds contain a core structure similar to the spiro[4. 5]decane skeleton, which allowed information to be gained on possible synthetic approaches to the marine natural products, (+) -axisonitrile- 3 and (+) axisothiocyanate- 3. With the preferred approach established from the model investigations, an efficient, protecting group free, stereoselective route to the marine natural products, (+) axisonitrile 3 and (+) -axisothiocyanate- 3, was completed in 7 chemical steps in 3 % overall yield from (+) -menthone via a key intermediate, axamine- 3. By simply switching the starting material from (+) -menthone to (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) -menthone, it was also possible to access the (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) series, or Ã¢â‚¬ËœunnaturalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ product configuration, namely (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) -axisonitrile- 3 and (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) axisothiocyanate- 3. Hence, the total syntheses of the natural (+) (5 R, 6 S, 7 R, 10 S) and unnatural (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) series (5 S, 6 R, 7 S, 10 R) of compounds was completed. The relatively straightforward access to both antipodes of axisonitrile- 3 and axisothiocyanate- 3 allowed the biosynthesis and catalytic turnover of the natural (+) and unnatural (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) substrates to be examined in A. cavernosa. The enantiomeric excess of the synthetically prepared substrates was confirmed by chiral GC analysis to be > 96 %. The absolute configuration of (+) axisonitrile 3 was secured by crystal structure analysis. To further our understanding of possible enzymatic thionation/dethionation in marine sponge systems, [14 C]-labelled (+) -axisonitrile- 3 and (+) -axisothiocyanate 3 were prepared and incorporated into A. cavernosa. The data clearly indicated that the incorporation of [14 C]-(+) axisonitrile- 3 into A. cavernosa resulted in the isolation of labelled (+) axisothiocyanate- 3. Likewise, the incorporation of [14 C]-(+) -axisothiocyanate- 3 resulted in the isolation of labelled (+) axisonitrile- 3. The observed isocyano-isothiocyanato biotransformation in A. cavernosa complemented the findings of previous biosynthetic investigations in other sponge systems and provided an additional piece of biosynthetic information adding weight to the proposed isocyanide-isothiocyanate interchange occurring at the secondary metabolite level. In addition, the unnatural metabolites, [14 C] (Ã¯â‚¬Â­) axisonitrile- 3 and [14 C]-(Ã¯â‚¬Â­) -axisothiocyanate 3, were also successfully incorporated and interconverted by the sponge, although at a slower rate. This interesting, albeit quite unexpected biotransformation, provided the first experimental evidence of enantiomeric sulfur transferring enzymatic conversions in marine sponge systems. The recognition of the unnatural nitrogenous sesquiterpene substrates and apparent lack of enantiomeric discrimination perhaps indicates the presence of a universal enzyme, which is able to primarily recognise nitrogenous functionality. Alternatively, terpene cyclases in marine sponges may have the ability to catalyse the anomalous enantiomeric cyclisation, if only in minute quantities. On the basis of this unexpected biosynthetic result, experiments incorporating the unnatural substrates were repeated rigorously in order to verify these findings. Functionalised pyrroles are abundant in nature, forming the characteristic subunit of haeme, chlorophyll, bile pigments and vitamin B 12. Consequently, a wide variety of methods have been developed to enable the synthesis of these important heterocycles. The synthesis of a diverse array of pyrroles from the cyclocondensation of 1, 4 -dicarbonyl compounds with magnesium nitride (Mg 3 N 2) as a convenient source of ammonia has been demonstrated...|$|E
