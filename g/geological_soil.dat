The measurements of TGDR were conducted {{in the state of}} Johor with a total of 3873 measured points which covered all <b>geological</b> formations, <b>soil</b> types and districts. The measurements were taken 1 m above the soil surface using NaI [Ti] detector. The measured gamma dose rates ranged from 9 nGyh- 1 to 1237 nGyh- 1 with a mean value of 151 nGyh- 1. The data have been normalized to fit a normal distribution. Tests of significance were conducted among all <b>geological</b> formations and <b>soil</b> types, using the unbalanced one way ANOVA. The results indicated strong significant differences due to the different <b>geological</b> formations and <b>soil</b> types present in Johor State. Pearson Correlation was used to measure the relations between gamma dose rate based on <b>geological</b> formation and <b>soil</b> type (DG,S) with the gamma dose rate based on geological formation (DG) or soil type (Ds). A very good correlation was found between DG,S and DG or DG,S and Ds. A total of 118 pairs of <b>geological</b> formations and <b>soil</b> types were used to derive the statistical contribution of <b>geological</b> formations and <b>soil</b> types to gamma dose rates.

40|$|Abstract—Collapsible soils {{go through}} radical {{rearrangement}} of their particles when triggered by water, stress or/and vibration, causing loss of volume. This loss of volume in soil {{as seen in}} foundation failures has caused millions of dollars ’ worth of damages to public facilities and infrastructure and so has an adverse effect on the society and people. Despite these consequences and the several studies that are available, more research is still required {{in the study of}} soil collapsibility. Discerning the pedogenesis (formation) of soils and investigating the combined effects of the different <b>geological</b> <b>soil</b> properties is key to elucidating and quantifying soils collapsibility. This study presents a novel laboratory testing regime that would be undertaken on soil samples where the effects of soil type, compactive variables (moisture content, density, void ratio, degree of saturation) and loading are analyzed.

40|$|Aggregate piers are {{a method}} of ground {{improvement}} used to increase the strength and bearing capacity of the native <b>geological</b> <b>soils</b> {{for the support of}} new civil infrastructure. The understanding of the bearing failure mechanism of aggregate piers remains largely unstudied. The effects of design variables in the failure mechanisms are not fully understood. This study determined the geotechnical characterization and drained shear strength of a limestone aggregate of specific gradation commonly used for the construction of aggregate piers. The index properties and drained shear strength parameters were found using consolidated drained, axisymmetric triaxial testing. Five confining stresses were chosen to model the stresses an aggregate pier would be subjected to in situ and at a given depth. Dilation occurred at most of the confining stresses but decreased in magnitude with increased confining stresses until no dilative behavior occurred at the highest confining stress. The specimens all demonstrated strain softening behavior without a distinctive peak and a gradual decrease in principal stress difference after failure. The friction angle did not vary significantly within a large range of relative densities. Small differences were observed between the peak and residual friction angles, with the difference decreasing at higher confining pressures...|$|R

The study {{was based on a}} stratified random sampling design composed of the following soil group substrates: (i) granophyres, (ii) malvernia, and (iii) rhyolite. Belt transects of 0. 3 × 0. 1 [*]km were randomly laid across soil group. Baobab abundance and population structure were determined from the density and size class distribution, respectively. There were significant differences in plant height and plant density across Gonarezhou soil groups. Study sites on granophyres derived soil group indicated viable abundance and recruitment of baobab population. Whereas the study highlighted a concern over the unbalanced size structure distribution of baobab population on malvernia derived soil group, our results indicated that baobabs are in danger of extirpation on malvernia derived soil group.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the long-term foundation settlement in soft soil is very complex, which is attributed {{to a number of}} uncertainties associated with various factors, such as: (i) The compressibility parameters obtained in the laboratory from samples of relatively small size that are more homogeneous compared to heterogeneous field sediments in which various soil types may be interlayered at random and may occur without exhibiting any real stratification; (ii) limitations and unrealistic assumptions prevailing in the conventional consolidation analysis. These have often resulted in the large discrepancy between actual in-situ settlements and the predictions from the conventional consolidation models (e. g., Terzaghi 2 ̆ 7 s model). In this study, a field data based method inspired from an observational approach is proposed and validated against a number of high quality long-term field settlement data. Moreover, the corresponding <b>geological</b> <b>soil</b> properties obtained from field and laboratory tests have been presented, with the aim of providing useful practical references for other projects with similar geological profile.

40|$|Belgium's {{soil survey}} data {{collected}} between 1950 and 1970 (pre-Kyoto Protocol) contain more than 13000 geo-referenced soil profile descriptions, which allow the computation of a spatially distributed baseline carbon content for incremental soil depths, based on soil/land-use combinations (landscape units) and multiple matching soil profile observations. The {{results show that}} the soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIOC) contents of many landscape units do not differ significantly. However, landscape units under forest and grassland tend to contain more carbon. The same is true for landscape units on poorly drained and/or clayey soils, podzols or anthropogenic soils. The change of the SOC in the upper 100 cm of mineral soil follows a logarithmic decline with increasing depth, useful for the extrapolation of SOC of surface layers to deeper layers. SIOC values are strongly related to the <b>geological</b> <b>soil</b> characteristics and increase linearly with depth. Integrating the mean SOC and SIOC content of landscape units over the Belgian territory results in a total soil carbon stock of 303 MtC in the upper 100 cm layer.
