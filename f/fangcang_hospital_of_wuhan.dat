However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the pathophysiological link are not yet fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that high glucose levels promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells by stimulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and the Rho family GTPase Rac 1 and Cdc 42 mediate the corresponding signaling induced by high glucose levels. We further show that Cdc 42 promotes EGFR phosphorylation by blocking EGFR degradation, which may be mediated by the Cbl proteins, whereas the Rac 1 -mediated EGFR phosphorylation is independent of EGFR degradation. Our findings elucidate a part of the underlying molecular mechanism of the link between high glucose levels and tumorigenesis in breast cancer and may provide new insights on the therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia.

Although ATG 7 -deficient mouse models have demonstrated that ATG 7 -dependent autophagy is required for lung cancer tumorigenesis, the relationship between ATG 7 expression levels and human lung cancer is unclear.

Our previous studies confirmed the advantages of quantum dots-based nanotechnology for quantitative analysis of biomarkers compared with conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC). This {{study was designed to}} assess Ki 67 by quantum dot-immunohistochemistry (QD-IHC) and investigate the prognostic value of the Ki 67 score in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) -positive (non-luminal) breast cancer. Methods: Ki 67 expression in 108 HER 2 -positive (non-luminal) breast cancer specimens was detected by IHC and QD-IHC. Two observers assessed the Ki 67 score independently and comparisons between the two methods were made. The prognostic value of the Ki 67 score for five-year disease-free survival was estimated. Results: The same antigen localization, high correlation of staining rates (r= 0. 993), and high agreement of measurements (Κ= 0. 874) of Ki 67 expression (cutoff: 30 %) in breast cancer were found by QD-IHC and conventional IHC. The QD-IHC had a better interobserver agreement for the Ki 67 score than conventional IHC (t=- 7. 280, P< 0. 01). High Ki 67 expression (cutoff: 30 %) was associated with shorter disease-free survival (log-rank test; IHC, P= 0. 026; QD-IHC, P= 0. 001), especially in the lymph node-negative subgroups (log-rank test; IHC, P= 0. 017; QD-IHC, P= 0. 002).

In the present study, we sought to explore whether sex {{differences have}} an impact on inflammation, oxidative stress, and pain sensitivity in CRPS-I. Methods: Chronic post-ischemia pain (CPIP) was established in both male and female mice as an animal model of CRPS-I. Edema and mechanical allodynia of bilateral hind paws were assessed after reperfusion. Blood samples were analyzed for serum levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines. Results: Both male and female mice developed edema. Male mice developed CPIP at day 3 after reperfusion; female mice developed CPIP at day 2 after reperfusion. Female mice displayed significantly earlier and higher mechanical allodynia in the ischemic hind paw, which was associated with higher serum levels of IL- 2, TNF-α, isoprostanes, 8 OhdG, and malondialdehyde at day 2 after reperfusion. Moreover, female mice showed significantly lower SOD and IL- 4 compared to male mice at day 2 after reperfusion.

The use of {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to treat brain metastases remains controversial. Thus, we performed a pooled analysis of published data to evaluate the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients with brain metastases, particularly for tumors with activating EGFR mutations. Methods: Several data sources were searched, including PubMed, Web of Science, and ASCO Annual Meetings databases. The end points were intracranial overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. The pooled ORR, DCR, PFS, and OS with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated employing fixed- or random-effect models, depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies. Results: Sixteen published studies were included in this analysis, with a total of 464 enrolled patients. The EGFR mutational status was unknown for 362 (unselected group), and 102 had activating EGFR mutations. The pooled intracranial ORR and DCR were 51. 8 % (95 % CI: 45. 8 %– 57. 8 %) and 75. 7 % (95 % CI: 70. 3 %– 80. 5 %), respectively. A higher ORR was observed in the EGFR mutation group than in the unselected group (85. 0 % vs 45. 1 %); a similar trend was observed for the DCR (94. 6 % vs 71. 3 %). The pooled median PFS and OS were 7. 4 months (95 % CI, 4. 9 – 9. 9) and 11. 9 months (95 % CI, 7. 7 – 16. 2), respectively, with longer PFS (12. 3 months vs 5. 9 months) and OS (16. 2 months vs 10. 3 months) in the EGFR mutation group than in the unselected group. Conclusion: This pooled analysis strongly suggests that EGFR-TKIs are an effective treatment for NSCLC patients with brain metastases, particularly in those patients harboring EGFR mutations. Larger prospective randomized clinical trials are warranted to confirm our conclusion and identify the most appropriate treatment model.

In terms of treatment-related Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, our pooled analysis with a fixed-effects model showed significantly enhanced toxicity in the DDP-CCRT group compared with that in the RT group (odds ratio = 3. 13, 95 % CI: 2. 37 – 4. 13). Conclusion: Solid and stable beneficial effects are associated with DDP-CCRT, and its superiority over comparative RT in patients with high-risk CC is confirmed. DDP-CCRT should be considered one of the frontline treatment options for high-risk CC patients without contraindications. However, enhanced toxicity associated with DDP-CCRT should never be ignored.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} a specific biological marker for the diagnosis of colorectal adenomas through the analysis of variations in serum protein profiling in colorectal adenoma patients. The study was conducted at the Renmin <b>Hospital</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wuhan</b> University (Wuhan, China) between September 2011 and May 2012. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time‑of‑flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) was performed to compare the serum protein profiles of 50 patients with colorectal adenoma and 50 healthy individuals. The obtained protein profiles were analyzed using Biomarker Wizard software. Twenty protein peaks were identified to exhibit differences in average intensity between colorectal adenomas compared with normal controls, including peaks 8, 565. 84, 8, 694. 51 and 5, 910. 50 Da, in which the intensity between the patients and control individuals was significantly different. Two peaks, 8, 565. 84 and 8, 694. 51 Da, were observed to be highly expressed in the colorectal adenomas, however, expres-sion was low in the control samples. By contrast, 5, 910. 50 Da expression was low in the colorectal adenomas and high in the controls. The results of the current study indicate that the three protein peaks may represent specific biomarkers for colorectal adenomas...|$|R

Previous {{studies have shown that}} triptolide interferes with a number of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether triptolide has protective effects during acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Male Sprague Dawley rats received triptolide or vehicle at the onset of reperfusion following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, we evaluated neurological injuries, the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, and NF-κB activation. I/R rats treated with triptolide showed significantly better neurological deficit scores, decreased neural apoptosis, and reduced cerebral infarct volume and brain edema, and triptolide treatment suppressed the activation of NF-κB following I/R injury. Furthermore, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at both the mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in rats receiving triptolide. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effects of triptolide during acute cerebral I/R injury are possibly related to the inhibition of both the NF-κB signaling pathway and inflammation.

The main concomitant factor is the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Existing treatments are focused generally on lowering IOP. However, both RGC loss and optic nerve atrophy can independently occur with IOP at normal levels. In recent years, there has been substantial progress {{in the development of}} neuroprotective therapies for glaucoma in order to restore vital visual function. The present review intends to offer a brief insight into conventional glaucoma treatments and discuss exciting current developments of mostly preclinical data in novel neuroprotective strategies for glaucoma that include recent advances in noninvasive diagnostics going beyond IOP maintenance for an enhanced global view. Such strategies now target RGC loss and optic nerve damage, opening a critical therapeutic window for preventative monitoring and treatment.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the {{expression of}} these molecules in osteosarcoma and their relationship with each other, to provide a theoretical basis to understand the prognosis of osteosarcoma. Material/Methods: We selected surgically resected osteosarcoma specimens from 116 patients <b>of</b> Zhongnan <b>Hospital</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wuhan</b> University and Hubei Cancer Hospital, Hubei, China, between January 2000 and January 2010 with detailed follow-up data. Twenty osteochondroma specimens from the corresponding period were used as controls. Expression of Src and p-Src was detected in osteosarcoma and osteochondroma by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed the relationship of the 2 proteins and osteosarcoma patient prognosis. Results: The expression of Src and p-Src in osteosarcoma was significantly higher than the expression level in osteo-chondroma (P< 0. 05). The expression levels of the 2 proteins, clinical stage, and tumor metastasis were signif-icantly associated with survival time (P< 0. 05), but there was no correlation between age or sex and survival time.

In this study, we aim to investigate the anticancer effects of a selective CDK 7 inhibitor, BS- 181, in gastric cancer (GC) cell line. Human GC cells (BGC 823) were cultured with or without BS- 181 at different concentrations for 24 – 72  hours. BS- 181 significantly reduced the activity of CDK 7 with downregulation of cyclin D 1 and XIAP in GC cells. Treatment with BS- 181 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The expression of Bax and caspase- 3 was significantly increased, while Bcl- 2 expression was decreased in cells treated with BS- 181. In addition, the inhibition of CDK 7 with BS- 181 resulted in reduced rates of proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cells. Those results demonstrated the anticancer activities of selective CDK 7 inhibitor BS- 181 in BGC 823 cells, suggesting that CDK 7 {{may serve as a}} novel therapeutic target or the treatment of GC.

Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search in electronic databases was conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible studies were selected according to the predefined selection criteria, before they were evaluated for methodological quality. Basic characteristics and data for network meta-analysis (NMA) were extracted from included trials and pooled in our meta-analysis. The end points were the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 14 RCTs that included 4, 763 patients were analyzed. The post-induction ORR was higher with bortezomib plus thalidomide plus dexamethasone (VTD) regimens, and VTD was better than the majority of other regimens. For OS, VTD plus cyclophosphamide (VTDC) regimens showed potential superiority over other regimens, but the difference was not statistically significant. The PFS was longer with thalidomide plus doxorubicin plus dexamethasone (TAD) regimens for transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM).

We recruited 146 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were treated in Renmin <b>Hospital</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wuhan</b> University <b>of</b> China between 1 May 2014 and 30 March 2016. There were 57 males and 89 females included and average age of included patients was 57. 03 years old. Serum samples were taken immediately on admission (within 48 hours after initial hemorrhage) and the levels of serum biomarkers were detected. Baseline information, complications, and outcomes at 6 months were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained to investigate {{the possibility of the}} biomarkers predicting prognosis. Of the 146 patients, 102 patients achieved good outcomes and 44 patients had poor outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade, high serum D-dimer levels, and high neurological complications were significantly associated with poor outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curves verified that D-dimer levels were associated with poor outcomes. D-dimer levels strongly correlated with neurological complications.

In the present study, we aim to investigate the possible antitumor effects of anti-RhoC small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in inflammatory breast cancer cells. In this study, a specific anti-RhoC siRNA was used to inhibit RhoC synthesis. Transfection of anti-RhoC siRNA into two IBC cells SUM 149 and SUM 190 induced extensive degradation of target mRNA and led to significant decrease in the synthesis of protein. Anti-RhoC siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, increased cell apoptosis, and induced cell cycle arrest in vitro. Moreover, the transfection of siRNA increased the expression of KAI 1 and decreased the expression of MMP 9 and CXCR 4 in both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, transplantation tumor experiments in BALB/c-nu mice showed that intratumoral injection of anti-RhoC siRNA inhibited tumor growth and increased survival rate. Our results suggested that RhoC gene silencing with specific anti-RhoC siRNA would be a potential therapeutic method for metastatic breast cancer.

Methods: Between August 2008 and July 2011, 78 patients with carotid atherosclerosis that were admitted at the Department of Ultrasonography in ZhongNan <b>Hospital</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wuhan</b> University, Wuhan, China underwent standard and BFI examination. Fifty-one patients received both BFI and CEU. We evaluated {{the relationship between}} BFI findings, and clinical symptoms in ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack patients. The correlation of cerebrovascular symptoms, stenosis, and plaque type on the detection of neovessels by BFI were statistically evaluated using χ 2 test (McNemar test). The agreement of the 2 sonographic methods was assessed by κ coefficient. The diagnostic efficacy of BFI for carotid atherosclerotic micro-vessel detection was also calculated. Results: The BFI findings of micro-vessel were correlated to patient’s symptom. The agreement between BFI and CEU for diagnosis of microvascularization was good (κ = 0. 406). The following was calculated: sensitivity (0. 483); specificity (0. 955); positive predictive value (0. 933); negative predictive value (0. 583); and accuracy of BFI (0. 686).

An animal model for SAH {{was established by}} directly injecting a hemolysate into the subarachnoid space of rats or mice. However, the in vitro applications of the hemolysate SAH model have not been reported, and the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established an in vitro SAH model by treating cortical pyramidal neurons with hemolysate. Using this model, we assessed the effects of recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (rhBDNF) on hemolysate-induced cell death and related mechanisms. Cortical neurons were treated with 10  ng/mL or 100  ng/mL rhBDNF prior to application of hemolysate. Hemolysate treatment markedly increased cell loss, triggered apoptosis, and promoted the expression of caspase- 8, caspase- 9, and cleaved caspase- 3. rhBDNF significantly inhibited hemolysate-induced cell loss, neuronal apoptosis, and expression of caspase- 8, caspase- 9, and cleaved caspase- 3. Our data revealed a previously unrecognized protective activity of rhBDNF against hemolysate-induced cell death, potentially via regulation of caspase- 9 -, caspase- 8 -, and cleaved caspase- 3 -related apoptosis.
