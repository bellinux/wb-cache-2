25|$|A charged object brought {{close to}} an <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>object</b> causes a {{separation}} of charge within the neutral object. Charges of the same polarity are repelled and charges of the opposite polarity are attracted. As the force due to the interaction of electric charges falls off rapidly with increasing distance, {{the effect of the}} closer (opposite polarity) charges is greater and the two objects feel a force of attraction. The effect is most pronounced when the neutral object is an electrical conductor as the charges are more free to move around. Careful grounding of part of an object with a charge-induced charge separation can permanently add or remove electrons, leaving the object with a global, permanent charge. This process is integral to the workings of the Van de Graaff generator, a device commonly used to demonstrate the effects of static electricity.|$|E
40|$|The {{multipole}} {{expansion of}} the polarization interaction between a charged particle and an <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>object</b> {{has long been known}} to be asymptotic in nature, i. e., the multiple expansion diverges at any finite distance from the atom. However, the multipole {{expansion of the}} polarization potential of a confined hydrogen atom is shown to be absolutely convergent at a distance outside the confinement radius, R 0, of the atom. The multipole expansion of the dispersion potential between two confined hydrogen atoms is also shown to be absolutely convergent provided the two atoms satisfy R > 2 R 0, where R is the inter-nuclear separation. These results were established analytically using oscillator strength sum rules and verified numerically using a B-spline description of the hydrogen ground state and its excitation spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Stripe phases were {{predicted}} to arise in doped antiferromagnets through competition between magnetism and the kinetic energy of mobile carriers (typically holes). In copper-oxides the main experimental evidence for stripes is neutron scattering from La 1. 48 Nd 0. 4 Sr 0. 12 CuO 4 (LNSCO) and La 1. 875 Ba 0. 125 CuO 4 (LBCO) which reveals coexisting static spin and charge order whose wavelengths differ {{by a factor}} of two, reminiscent of charged rivers separating regions of oppositely-phased antiferromagnetism. A neutron is an <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>object,</b> however, so does not detect charge but rather its associated lattice distortion; it is not known if the "stripe" phase in LNSCO and LBCO actually involves ordering of the doped holes. Here we present a study of the charge order in LBCO with resonant soft x-ray scattering (RSXS). We observe giant resonances at both the mobile carrier and upper-Hubbard band features in the OK edge. These demonstrate a substantial modulation in the doped hole density as well as the amount of spectral weight near the correlated gap, i. e. the degree of "Mottness". The peak-to-trough amplitude of the valence modulation is estimated to be 0. 063 holes, which if interpreted with a model of the stripe form factor suggests an integrated area of 0. 59 holes under a single stripe. While only an estimate, this number agrees with what is expected for half-filled stripes. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Nature Physic...|$|E

40|$|Long-range forces between {{macroscopic}} {{objects are}} mediated by light particles that {{interact with the}} electrons or nucleons, and include spin-dependent static components as well as spin- and velocity-dependent components. We parametrize the long-range potential between two fermions assuming rotational invariance, and find 16 different components. Applying this result to <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>objects,</b> we show that the macroscopic potential depends on 72 measurable parameters. We then derive the potential induced by the exchange of a new gauge boson or spinless particle, and compare the limits set by measurements of macroscopic forces to the astrophysical limits on the couplings of these particles.

40|$|Optical {{tweezers}} allows contactless three-dimensional manipulation with <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>objects</b> {{of sizes}} from tens of nanometers {{to tens of}} micrometers. Mouse or joystick are the traditional devices to control the positions of trapping beams in holographic optical tweezers that provide optical manipulation with microobjects. Our approach {{is based on a}} modern 3 D depth sensors combined with gestures and speech recognition software. The human operator controls the position of one trapping beam by a traditional pointing device like mouse or joystick. However, manipulation with more objects needs control of corresponding number of independent trapping beams generated by a spatial light modulator. We upgraded own NUI software which processes signals from sensors and sends the control commands to holographic Raman tweezers which subsequently controls the positions of trapping microparticles and the acquisition system of Raman spectra...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{fluctuations}} {{give rise}} to van der Waals and Casimir forces that dominate the interaction between <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>objects</b> at sub-micron separations. Under the trend of miniaturization, such quantum electrodynamical effects are expected {{to play an important}} role in micro- and nano-mechanical devices. Nevertheless, utilization of Casimir forces on the chip level remains a major challenge because all experiments so far require an external object to be manually positioned close to the mechanical element. Here by integrating a force-sensing micromechanical beam and an electrostatic actuator on a single chip, we demonstrate the Casimir effect between two micromachined silicon components on the same substrate. A high degree of parallelism between the two near-planar interacting surfaces can be achieved because they are defined in a single lithographic step. Apart from providing a compact platform for Casimir force measurements, this scheme also opens the possibility of tailoring the Casimir force using lithographically defined components of non-conventional shapes.
