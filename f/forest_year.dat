40|$|Presence {{of exotic}} species in forest {{remnants}} {{is a major}} concern for the conservation of wild species, not only on islands, where potential impact is higher. Although the problem is widespread and increasing, there are few studies on Neotropical forests. Here we quantify the occurrence of domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in an Atlantic forest reserve in south-eastern Brazil (Santa Lúcia Biological Station - SLBS). Throughout two years of monitoring with camera traps (2, 142 camera-days), 25 records of 16 individual dogs were obtained in the interior of SLBS, making dogs the fourth most frequently recorded species of mammals in general and the first-ranking among Carnivora, ahead of the ocelot and puma, the top two terrestrial predators present in SLBS. Dogs entered the <b>forest</b> <b>year</b> round, in almost half of the sampled months (48 %), and predominantly during daytime (89 %). They were detected in various trails inside the reserve, but mostly in areas nearest to the reserve's border (0. 05 in all cases), suggesting an erratic, non-seasonal pattern of entrance in the reserve. Data indicate that domestic dogs can be abundant and frequent visitors to little disturbed Atlantic forest reserves even when these are located in regions of low density of human population. The potential impact to native fauna is discussed...|$|E
30|$|For this study, {{most of the}} FORMIND model {{parameter}} {{values were}} determined based on local forest inventories (e.g., the allometric relationship between dbh and tree height), {{and some of the}} parameter values were taken from the literature (see Additional file 2 : Appendix B. 4). Due to the lack of repeated forest surveys, parameters concerning mortality are unknown. These parameters were estimated using a calibration process that compared the simulated mature forest to the forest inventories. We analysed in detail the total aboveground biomass and the fraction of biomass for each PFT for all trees with a dbh[*]>[*] 10  cm. The aboveground biomass of the field data was calculated by summing the biomass of the individual trees using the same allometric relationships as used in the FORMIND model (Additional file 2 : Appendix B. 1). The simulated value for mature biomass was derived by averaging the biomass values of simulated mature <b>forest</b> (<b>year</b> 500 – 1, 000). For the calibration process, we varied the mortality parameter values and compared the stem size distribution and biomass values to the field values. The model itself does not include topography. However, indirectly, topography was incorporated via some parameter values that are affected by topographic conditions (e.g. mortality, productivity). All parameter values are in Additional file 2 : Appendix B. 4.|$|E

500|$|The grey jay is a [...] "scatterhoarder", caching {{thousands}} of food items {{during the summer}} for use the following winter, and enabling the species to remain in boreal and subalpine <b>forests</b> <b>year</b> round. Any food intended for storage is manipulated in the mouth and formed into a bolus that is coated with sticky saliva, adhering to anything it touches. The bolus is stored in bark crevices, under tufts of lichen, or among conifer needles. Cached items can be anything from carrion to bread crumbs. A single grey jay may hide {{thousands of}} pieces of food per year, to later recover them by memory, sometimes months after hiding them. Cached food is sometimes used to feed nestlings and fledglings.|$|R
