25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to <b>hug</b> <b>her,</b> while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E
2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I can think of is Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He lit a cigarette and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
2500|$|Theatre {{writer and}} {{historian}} John Kenrick wrote, [...] "the {{bad news is}} that this Follies is a dramatic and conceptual failure. The good news is that it also features some of the most exciting musical moments Broadway has seen in several seasons. Since you don't get those moments from the production, the book or the leads, that leaves the featured ensemble, and in Follies that amounts to a small army. ... Marge Champion and Donald Saddler are endearing as the old hoofers. ... I dare you not {{to fall in love with}} Betty Garrett's understated [...] "Broadway Baby" [...] – you just want to pick her up and <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b> Polly Bergen stops everything cold with [...] "I’m Still Here," [...] bringing a rare degree of introspection to a song that is too often a mere belt-fest.... he emotional highpoint comes when Joan Roberts sings 'One More Kiss'." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} to help it--a ghost must have <b>hugged</b> <b>her.</b> The Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea being, in that respect, all one, Martin <b>hugged</b> <b>her</b> instantly. Mr Tapley (as if the idea were quite novel, and {{had never occurred to}} him before), followed, with much gravity, on the same side.|$|R

2500|$|She was {{required}} to begin her jail term on June 5, and entered the Century Regional Detention Facility (a women's prison in Lynwood, California) after attending the 2007 MTV Movie Awards on June 3. On June 7, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca signed an order resentencing Hilton to 40 days of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device due to an unspecified medical condition. Baca said, [...] "My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities {{more than the average}} American is not justice." [...] He added, [...] "The special treatment, in a sense, appears to be because of her celebrity status... She got more time in jail". Judge Michael Sauer summoned her to reappear in court the following morning (June 8), since her original sentence specified imprisonment: [...] "No work furlough. No work release. No electronic monitoring." [...] At the hearing, Sauer declined a briefing in chambers by Hilton's attorney on her medical condition and sent her back to jail to serve the original 45-day sentence. When she heard the decision, Hilton shouted [...] "It's not right!" [...] Screaming, she asked to <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> mother. Hilton was moved to the medical wing of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles, and returned to the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on June 13.|$|E

60|$|Patsy {{had been}} {{examining}} {{the child with}} curious intentness. The little one was so lovely and graceful, and her voice sounded so soft and womanly, that Patsy longed to take her {{in her arms and}} <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Colonel Keith leant {{over the}} back of her chair and silently watched, but the scene was not quite what they expected. Violetta was sitting in her [...] "slantingdicular" [...] {{position}} on her chair placed on a bench, and her little mistress knelt down before her, took her in her arms, and began to <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{were simple}} words, {{but they were}} spoken {{in such a way}} that they meant a good deal. Pomona knew what they meant. Her eyes sparkled, and as she went out, I saw her <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> child to her breast, and cover it with kisses, and then, through the window, I could see her running to the barn and Jonas.|$|E

6000|$|I 'most {{jumped out}} of my skin for joy. I {{reckoned}} Tom would fly at his aunt and <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> head off; but if you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might lose it if he didn't speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn't know what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and I could a shot him for it: ...|$|E

60|$|The senator's son and Phil had {{accompanied}} Dave to Crumville, and all {{had received a}} warm reception {{at the hands of}} those who were waiting for them. Mr. Wadsworth was delighted to get back the jewels, and thanked Dave over and over again for what he had done. Dave's father and his uncle were also happy, and as for Laura, she had to <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> brother over and over again. Jessie wanted to hug him, too, but her maidenly modesty prevented this, but she gave Dave a look and a hand squeeze that meant a good deal, for our hero was her hero, too, and always had been.|$|E
6000|$|Parting {{with her}} {{after four years}} under her was a real grief. Even Griff was fond of her; when once emancipated, he used to <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> and bring her {{remarkable}} presents, and she heartily loved her tormentor. [...] Everybody did. It remained {{a great pleasure to}} get her to spend an evening with us while the elders were gone out to dinner; nor do I think she ever did us anything but good, though I am afraid we laughed at 'Old Newton' as we grew older and more conceited. We never had another governess. My mother read and enforced diligence on Emily and me, and we had masters for different studies; the two boys went to school; and when Martyn began to emerge from babyhood, Emily was his teacher.|$|E
60|$|Jo {{looked up}} then, quite {{unconscious}} of anything but her own {{pleasure in the}} prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer's face suddenly recalled {{the fact that she}} might find Laurie more than a 'best friend', and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina on her knee. She didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately the child was moved to <b>hug</b> <b>her,</b> so she managed to hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he said cordially...|$|E

60|$|Whether {{he meant}} Hilary's escape or Thyme's was doubtful, but there came on him a longing to rush {{up to his}} little daughter's room, and <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b> He {{suppressed}} it, {{and sat down at}} the bureau; he was suddenly experiencing a sensation such as he had sometimes felt on a perfect day, or after physical danger, of too much benefit, of something {{that he would like to}} return thanks for, yet knew not how. His hand stole to the inner pocket of his black coat. It stole out again; there was a cheque-book in it. Before his mind's eye, starting up one after the other, he saw the names of the societies he supported, or meant sometime, if he could afford it, to support. He reached his hand out for a pen. The still, small noise of the nib travelling across the cheques mingled with the buzzing of a single fly.|$|E
60|$|And {{he longed}} to have the freedom of that garden. Jims loved gardens. There had been a garden at the little house but there was none here--nothing but an old lawn that had been fine once but was now badly run to seed. Jims had heard Uncle Walter {{say that he was}} going to have it {{attended}} to but nothing had been done yet. And meanwhile here was a beautiful garden over the wall which looked as if it should be full of children. But no children were ever in it--or anybody else apparently. And so, in spite of its beauty, it had a lonely look that hurt Jims. He wanted his Garden of Spices to be full of laughter. He pictured himself running in it with imaginary playmates--and there was a mother in it--or a big sister--or, at the least, a whole aunt who would let you <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> and would never dream of shutting you up in chilly, shadowy, horrible blue rooms.|$|E
6000|$|The tramp of horses, {{distinctly}} {{heard in}} the silence, was at length discerned. It was a troop sent by Karazza, the Admiral; they bore dispatches to the Lord General. The contents of these papers were important. The night before, the watch, on board {{one of the smaller}} vessels anchored near the seraglio wall, was roused by a slight splashing as of muffled oars; the alarm was given: twelve small boats, each containing three Janizaries, were descried endeavouring to make their way through the fleet to the opposite shore of Scutari. When they found themselves discovered they discharged their muskets, and some came to the front to cover the others, whose crews, exerting all their strength, endeavoured to escape with their light barks from among the dark hulls that environed them. They were in the end all sunk, and, with the exception of two or three prisoners, the crews drowned. Little could be got from the survivors; but their cautious answers caused it to be surmised that several expeditions had preceded this last, and that several Turks of rank and importance had been conveyed to Asia. The men disdainfully repelled the idea of having deserted the defence of their city; and one, the youngest among them, in answer to the taunt of a sailor, exclaimed, [...] "Take it, Christian dogs! take the palaces, the gardens, the mosques, the abode of our fathers--take plague with them; pestilence is the enemy we fly; if she be your friend, <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> to your bosoms. The curse of Allah is on Stamboul, share ye her fate." ...|$|E
