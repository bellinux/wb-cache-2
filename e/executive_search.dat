Another former employer, Inderjit Singh, a PAP Member of Parliament and founder of United Test & Assembly Centre, said Kuan's performance as a consultant had been unsatisfactory.

40|$|Firms are {{too often}} {{unsuccessful}} due to poor strategy implementation, even when they have developed a sound strategy. <b>Executives</b> <b>searching</b> for guidance on implementing strategy {{are faced with a}} dilemma: some researchers argue that explicitly articulating strat-egy to organization members leads to organizational inertia; others say that strategy must be explicitly articulated for a coordinated implementation effort. We introduce structural centralization as a third variable that may be helpful in resolving this dilemma. We argue that, for more decentralized firms, explicit articulation of strategy may improve perfor-mance by increasing the likelihood of coordinated and motivated strategy implementa-tion. Strategy articulation is not necessary, however, for coordinated implementation in centralized firms. The empirical results of our field study of 95 US manufacturing firms generally support this contingency view. Our results also indicate, however, a curvilinear explicitness–performance relationship. Very high and very low explicitness are associated with higher performance, while moderate explicitness is linked to lower performance. These results have important implications for both researchers and practitioners, in part because they help to integrate the previously contradictory viewpoints...|$|R
