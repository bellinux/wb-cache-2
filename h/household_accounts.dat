5|$|Braose {{was the son}} of William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose and {{his first}} wife, Aline, {{daughter}} of Thomas de Multon. He was likely born around 1260, as his age was given as about 46 in 1307. Other events prove that he was born prior to 1264, as he was captured in that year. This came about during the Second Barons' War (1264–1267) during the reign of King Henry III of England, as the elder Braose had sided with the king during Simon de Montfort's rebellion. The younger Braose was a hostage in the custody of Montfort's wife, Eleanor. Her <b>household</b> <b>accounts</b> include expenses related to the younger William's care.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of <b>household</b> <b>accounts</b> referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E
5|$|The Lancastrians {{were both}} pious and well read. Henry IV {{was the first}} English king known to have possessed a vernacular Bible, {{supported}} the canonization of John Twenge, gave a pension to the anchoress Margaret Pensax and maintained close relations with several Westminster recluses. His <b>household</b> <b>accounts</b> as king record conventional payments to large numbers of paupers (12,000 on Easter day 1406) and the intercession for him of twenty-four oratores domini regis at 2d each per day. However, his reliance on the church was both personal and political. Archbishop Arundel gave the Lancastrians vital support and carried other bishops with him. In return the church required support for religious orthodoxy against heresy. Lollards were suppressed and heresy was made a capital offence in England under the statute of De haeretico comburendo even though Henry {{could not afford to}} overly antagonize his supporters with Lollard sympathies, including those among his Lancastrian retainers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Beyond {{the public}} world of work, the home {{provides}} an arena for examining accounting and gender in everyday life. This study {{aims to examine}} <b>household</b> <b>accounting</b> in Australia from the early nineteenth to around the mid-twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach – The study comprises two parts. The first part, as reported in this paper, presents evidence on <b>household</b> <b>accounting</b> as prescribed in the didactic literature in Australia, and evidence of actual accounting practices based on the examination of 76 sets of surviving Australian household records available in public repositories. The second part adopts a microhistorical approach involving the detailed scrutiny of 18 sets of accounting records and relevant biographical and family data on the household accountants involved. Findings – The study indicates that <b>household</b> <b>accounting</b> was an instrument for restraining female consumption, particularly during times of crises, and that accounting in Australian homes focussed on maintaining records of routine transactions {{as opposed to the}} preparation of budgets and financial statements. <b>Household</b> <b>accounting</b> in Australia was performed by women and men. The surviving records examined suggest that while areas of financial responsibility were defined by gender there was little evidence of formalised hierarchical accountability between spouses as {{has been found to be}} the case in Britain. Originality/value – The study extends knowledge of <b>household</b> <b>accounting</b> and gender. Most historical investigations on this subject draw on instructional literature. The current investigation also examines accounting practice in the home. Accounting, Accounting history, Accounts, Australia...|$|R

500|$|The Grandmother's Sitting Room is {{situated}} {{at the front of}} the eastern wing. It is noted for its deep blue hand-painted frescoes and formal furniture, and was the favourite room of Charles and Diana's grandmother, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer. Nearby was the Muniment Room in which the Spencer family records were kept, described as a [...] "musty apartment" [...] which contained over 500 years of history, from medieval <b>household</b> <b>accounts</b> to letters from Jacobeans and accounts of Victorian house parties. The room was a favourite haunt of Spencer's grandfather, Albert Spencer, who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history. So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722), Albert immediately doused out his cigar in fear of creating a fire. The records were sold to the British Library in the 1980s, leaving the room empty, before it was converted to what is known as the [...] "Steward's Room Flat".

This gap remains after controlling for the lower incomes of female heads. What, then, produces the gender discrepancy in net worth?
