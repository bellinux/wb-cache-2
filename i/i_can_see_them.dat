They're not 'feels' anymore." [...] Mike Love remembered: [...] "Brian is so spontaneous that if there's a piano and two or three people around to sing parts, he’ll sit down and write a song in five minutes. But if you don’t get it right then, he goes off and drops it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Wilson {{explained}} his writing process as {{going to the}} piano and finding [...] "feels," [...] which he describes as [...] "brief note sequences, fragments of ideas," [...] and that [...] "once they're {{out of my head}} and into the open air, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> and touch them firmly. They're not 'feels' anymore." [...] Some of his stylistic markers include slash chords, key modulations, [...] "stepwise falloffs", the use of minor seventh chords drawn from Burt Bacharach, piano triads [...] "hammered" [...] in eighths, and a tendency for his harmonic progressions to wander far from the tonal center. Musicologist Daniel Harrison notes that [...] "even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyrics were usually written by an outside collaborator after the melody and chord patterns were established.|$|E

"The houses {{was about}} right here, {{and there was}} more trees, lots of trees, and lots of grass, and lots of goats. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> now, an' two boys drivin' 'em. An' right here is a lot of men walkin' behind one man. An' over there"--I pointed to where I had placed my village--"is a lot of tramps. They ain't got nothin' on exceptin' rags. An' they're sick. Their faces, an' hands, an' legs is all sores." ...|$|R

"Of course you're the {{one that}} knows {{what we ought to}} do, an' I ain't sayin' a word if we run way down to South America; but it's kinder tough on the boys. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em,</b> when they think I ain't lookin', wipin' their eyes an' actin' like as if it wouldn't take much to make both yell right out.

[...] "They have two rows of armed men across the road already; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> from here. The town is in arms, as I said it was.

6000|$|... "You are right," [...] said Sir William, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> also <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> There is much Spanish blazonry also, if I could but read it. Don Diego, {{you know}} the arms of your own land. Who are they who have done us this honor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{should have}} heard the people groan,' said Chitling; 'the {{officers}} fought like devils, or they'd have torn him away. He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to {{them as if they}} were his dearest friends. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst 'em; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they'd tear his heart out!' ...|$|R

60|$|GERALD. I hope I am. It's quite {{a relief}} to me to feel that I may be wicked. I fear I'm not. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> all anticipating victory, in their low-down fashion wanting to crow their low-down crowings. I'm afraid I feel it's a righteous cause, to cut {{a lot of little}} combs before I die.|$|E
60|$|They said nothing, {{but they}} still scanned me with curious eyes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now, {{standing}} in a line before me, tall men and short men, stout men and thin men: Olivier, with his warlike moustache; the thin, eager face of Pelletan; young Oudin, flushed by his first duel; Mortier, with the sword-cut across his wrinkled brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{said the}} captain, who {{was using a}} {{powerful}} telescope, [...] "they are blacks. There must be fifty of them beside the crew, {{and as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> most of <b>them</b> are armed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] he answered; [...] "of {{an evening}} as I {{come back from}} fishing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> numbers of <b>them</b> walking there. When the vesper bell rings they all go in. That is the chapel {{adjoining}} the convent on this side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't see," [...] was the reply, [...] "therefore it isn't {{meant for}} me to see. It's for you to choose. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now as plain as I can see you. You are all three {{standing}} where two roads meet. The fair young man is beckoning to you and pointing to a big house and a motor-car and a yacht." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just as it}} was," [...] he said. [...] "Even the furniture. I'm {{glad you}} haven't moved it. They used to sit {{over there in the}} corner, and have tea on the ebony table. And it was always dark-just as it is now. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> They wore dresses with wide skirts and flounces, and queer low collars and bonnets. And they talked in subdued voices--unlike so many women in these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} he has done a great deal; and, as far as I am concerned, I am {{grateful}} to him. Nothing that you can say can prevent my being so.

[...] "If you have nothing further to say, I shall be obliged by being permitted to say good night--I am very tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh," [...] was Billy's comment, as he {{went over}} the mite's {{wardrobe}} {{and came back to}} center on the little knit shirts, [...] "they look more like a real kid than the whole kit an' caboodle. Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> him in <b>them</b> regular manshirts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm dreaming,' thought Richard, 'that's clear. When I went to bed, {{my hands}} were not made of egg-shells; and now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>see</b> through <b>'em.</b> If {{this is not a}} dream, I have woke up, by mistake, in an Arabian Night, instead of a London one. But I have no doubt I'm asleep. Not the least.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Out of our heads, {{but never}} {{out of our}} hearts," [...] said I, laughing. [...] "However, you are right, little one, for our {{attention}} has certainly been distracted from them. I shall walk {{up in the morning}} and <b>see</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> anything of <b>them.</b> By the way, to-morrow is the fateful 5th of October--one more day, and all will be well with us." ...|$|R
60|$|Our parting was so hurried at the last, as {{is often}} the way after long fellowship, that beyond mutual thanks and good wishes we said little to one another. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now {{standing}} with their arms about each other watching me disappear. Concerning their future {{there is so much to}} tell that of it I shall say nothing; at any rate here and now, except that Lady Ragnall was right. We did not part for the last time.|$|E
6000|$|... "No sentinels, {{and all the}} men at drill!" [...] cried Du Lhut in contempt. [...] "It is as you say, however, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> {{myself with}} their ranks open, and each as stiff and {{straight}} as a pine stump. One would think to see them stand so still {{that there was not}} an Indian nearer than Orange. We shall go across to them, and by Saint Anne, I shall tell their commander what I think of his arrangements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I looked {{straight}} at Beatrice, and she at me. We seemed to have formed an alliance in that look: she was {{the other half of}} my consciousness, I of hers. Ha! Ha! {{there were a lot of}} white narcissus, and little white hyacinths, Roman hyacinths, in the conservatory. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now, great white stars, and tangles of little ones, among a bank of green; and I can recall the keen, fresh scent on the warm air; and the look of Beatrice ... her great dark eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The only trouble is," [...] went on her companion, [...] "that the {{audience}} would undoubtedly lynch me. And, though it seems improbable {{just at the}} present moment, {{it may be that}} life holds some happiness for me that's worth waiting for. Anyway, I'd rather not be torn limb from limb. A messy finish! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> just <b>see</b> <b>them</b> rending me asunder in a spasm of perfectly justifiable fury. 'She loves me!' Off comes a leg. 'She loves me not!' Off comes an arm. No, I think on the whole I'll lie low. Besides, why should I care? Let 'em suffer. It's their own fault. They would come!" ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{are going}} on very quietly here. Miss Nightingale & Co have not {{disturbed}} me. I hope you will not send any more sick down here until our numbers are reduced, {{as there is no}} room for them in the hospitals - the weather here is very stormy and I pity the troops in camp with all my heart - their sufferings must be great and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> nothing before <b>them</b> but certain death.|$|R
5000|$|Louder Than The Musics Jono Davies {{said that}} [...] "sometimes {{when you put}} a CD on {{for the first time}} {{you have no idea what}} its going to sound like. You either get the biggest treat in the world, or the worst treat in the world! With this new release from The Museum, thankfully it was a nice treat." [...] Plus, Davies wrote that [...] "the future is very bright for The Museum. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>see</b> <b>them</b> touring round the country next year with other similar bands and doing well. With this album they havent changed the face of Christian music, but what they have done is make it sound very good." ...|$|R
