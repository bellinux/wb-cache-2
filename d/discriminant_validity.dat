2500|$|NFC {{has been}} found to be {{strongly}} associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas. Epistemic curiosity can be defined as ‘‘desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas, eliminate information-gaps, and solve intellectual problems". Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman (1992) and was defined as a [...] "personality construct that represents an individual’s aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing". Openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with [...] "aspects of being open minded, engaging in unconventional thoughts, and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself". Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and [...] typical intellectual engagement (r = [...]78) it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct. Further studies have found that NFC, [...] typical intellectual engagement, epistemic curiosity, and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated. Factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis. The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack <b>discriminant</b> <b>validity</b> they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others. A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant. NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits. For example, NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas, whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with novelty and experience seeking than NFC.|$|E

40|$|Background. Migraine-specific {{quality of}} life (MSQ) is a valid and {{reliable}} questionnaire. Linguistic validation of Persian MSQ questionnaire, analysis of psychometric properties between chronic and episodic migraine patients, and capability of MSQ to differentiate between chronic and episodic migraines were the aims of this study. Method. Participants were selected from four different neurology clinics that were diagnosed as chronic or episodic migraine patients. Baseline data included information from MSQ v. 2. 1, MIGSEV, SF- 36, and symptoms questionnaire. At the third week from the baseline, participants filled out MSQ and MIGSEV. Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) and test-retest reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients) {{were used to assess}} reliability. Convergent and <b>discriminant</b> <b>validities</b> were also assessed. Results. A total of 106 participants were enrolled. Internal consistencies of MSQ among all patients, chronic and episodic migraines, were 0. 92, 0. 91, and 0. 92, respectively. Test-retest correlation of MSQ dimensions between visits 1 and 2 varied from 0. 41 to 0. 50. Convergent, item <b>discriminant,</b> and <b>discriminant</b> <b>validities</b> were approved. In all visits MSQ scores were lower in chronic migraine than episodic migraine; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion. Persian translation of MSQ is consistent with original version of MSQ in terms of psychometric properties in both chronic and episodic migraine patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we report}} an {{inventory}} of leader behaviours that can promote creativity among R&D professionals. Specifically, we constructed and quantitatively validated a scale that was previously developed using a qualitative approach. We surveyed 584 scientists from 11 R&D laboratories in India. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the rating responses disclosed five leader behaviour factors: task-orientation; recognising and inspiring; empowering; team building and developing; and leading by example. Given acceptable evidence for convergent and <b>discriminant</b> <b>validities</b> of the factors, we argue {{for the use of}} this scale in future research in and management of creativity in R&D laboratories...|$|R

The DHS Depression and Hopelessness scales showed good internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Convergent and <b>discriminant</b> <b>validities</b> were supported through the relationship of the DHS with other established scales of depression, mood, suicidal intentions, and psychological distress. Optimal and conservative cutoff scores for the DHS Depression and Hopelessness scales were evaluated against criteria from a DSM-IV-based interview.

5000|$|The average {{variance}} extracted {{has often}} been used to assess <b>discriminant</b> <b>validity</b> based on the following [...] "rule of thumb": Based on the corrected correlations from the CFA model, the AVE {{of each of the}} latent constructs should be higher than the highest squared correlation with any other latent variable. If that is the case, <b>discriminant</b> <b>validity</b> is established on the construct level. This rule is known as Fornell-Larcker criterion. However, in simulation models this criterion did not proof reliable for variance-based structural equation models (e.g. PLS)., but for covariance-based structural equation models (e.g. Amos) only. An alternative to the Fornell-Larcker criterion {{that can be used for}} both types of structural equation models to assess <b>discriminant</b> <b>validity</b> is the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT).|$|E

The sample consisted of 434 community participants from Singapore, who were predominantly ethnic Chinese. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor analysis (CFA) confirmed that the 3 factors solution, namely (1) Self-Doubt, (2) Inability to Maintain Coping, and (3) Negative Thinking/ Worry, was the best fit for the data. Internal consistency was good for the total scale and the factor scales derived from the three-factor model. Concurrent and <b>discriminant</b> <b>validities</b> of the ASSQ - Asia (ASSQ-A) were also good, hence suggesting that the ASSQ-A is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing anxiety-related cognitive content or anxious self-talk among Asians, in particular in Singapore...|$|R

Factor analyses of personality and vocational interest items {{that proved to be}} valid in a previous Navy recruiter test validation study (W. C.

New items, selected or written to assess these constructs, along with the items found to be valid in the previous recruiter study, were administered to 194 Navy recruiters. Peer and supervisory performance ratings were also gathered. Data analyses indicated good convergent and <b>discriminant</b> <b>validities</b> in measuring many of the constructs. For approximately half of the constructs, the addition of new items enhanced validity against the performance criteria.

Somatosensory amplification correlated with somatization tendency and anxiety propensity. These results encourage further investigations in French of the determinants and consequences of somatosensory amplification, and its use as a therapeutic strategy...|$|R

50|$|Convergent and <b>discriminant</b> <b>{{validity}}</b> {{are the two}} subtypes {{of validity}} that make up construct validity. Convergent validity refers to {{the degree to which}} two measures of constructs that theoretically should be related, are in fact related. In contrast <b>discriminant</b> <b>validity</b> tests whether concepts or measurements that are supposed to be unrelated are, in fact, unrelated. Take, for example, a construct of general happiness. If a measure of general happiness had convergent validity, then constructs similar to happiness (satisfaction, contentment, cheerfulness, etc.) should relate closely to the measure of general happiness. If this measure has discriminate validity, then constructs that are not supposed to be related to general happiness (sadness, depression, despair, etc.) should not relate to the measure of general happiness. Measures can have one of the subtypes of construct validity and not the other. Using the example of general happiness, a researcher could create an inventory where there is a very high correlation between general happiness and contentment, but if there is also a significant correlation between happiness and depression, then the measure's construct validity is called into question. The test has convergent validity but not <b>discriminant</b> <b>validity.</b>|$|E
