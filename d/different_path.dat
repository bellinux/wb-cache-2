Although other portions of I-75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75.

5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a <b>different</b> <b>path.</b> Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E
5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out {{the negative consequences of}} uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a <b>different</b> <b>path</b> from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back to}} 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E
5|$|Robin Wright as Jenny Curran: Forrest's {{childhood}} friend {{with whom he}} immediately falls in love, and never stops loving throughout his life. A victim {{of child sexual abuse}} at the hands of her bitterly widowed father, Jenny embarks on a <b>different</b> <b>path</b> from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in the 1960s and the 1970s/1980s drug culture. She re-enters Forrest's life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterwards she dies of an unnamed illness, but given the time period, the movie's propensity for showing the major aspects of U.S. culture, and the character's depicted actions during the 60s and 70s, it can be speculated that she died of AIDS or Hepatitis C.|$|E

This first route, though it was intended to replace the North Beach trams, actually followed a <b>different</b> <b>path</b> between Fitzgerald Avenue and Marshland Road. Patronage of the Marine Parade section was poor, leading to the truncation of services at North Beach from 31 May 1933.|$|E

25|$|As a result, {{actuarial science}} {{developed}} along a <b>different</b> <b>path,</b> becoming more reliant on assumptions, {{as opposed to}} the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption). This concept is inconsistent with financial economics.|$|E

The Roosters had finished the 2009 season {{on the bottom of the}} ladder. Under new coach Brian Smith, and having signed troubled star Todd Carney, the Roosters improved to finish sixth on the ladder in 2010, before consecutive finals series victories against the Wests Tigers, the Penrith Panthers and the Gold Coast Titans launched the club into the Grand Final. The Roosters were thus in a position where they could become the first club since the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1934 to win a premiership after finishing last in the previous season.|$|E
25|$|After the schism in the Congregational Churches {{resulting}} in {{the foundation of the}} American Unitarian Association, some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization (later the United Church of Christ), while others voted to become Unitarian. Some of the latter eventually became part of the UUA during a consolidation of the Unitarian and Universalist churches. Universalist churches in contrast followed a <b>different</b> <b>path,</b> having begun as independent congregations beyond the bounds of the established Puritan churches entirely. Today, the UUA and the United Church of Christ cooperate jointly on social justice initiatives such as the Sexuality Education Advocacy Training project.|$|E
25|$|In any {{analysis}} of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of two bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.5‑1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational {{field of the}} Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a <b>different</b> <b>path</b> through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with {{respect to each other}} do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the appearance of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.|$|E
