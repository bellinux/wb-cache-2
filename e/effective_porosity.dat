The value for specific yield is less than the value for porosity because some water will remain in the medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces.

Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called <b>effective</b> <b>porosity).</b> Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E

This suggests that formations deeper than the depth can hold little water {{because of a lack}} of pores. Therefore, the relatively high resistivities deeper than 2 km below sea level (b.s.l.) are considered to be due to a lack of interstitial water in the bulk formation.

50|$|A {{dramatic}} {{example of}} a core <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> vs log <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> discrepancy comes from some Greensand reservoirs in Western Australia. Greensands are green because of iron-bearing glauconite which is usually recognized as illite/mica or mixed layer illite-smectite clay by x-ray diffraction. The glauconite per se will incorporate electrochemically bound water (CBW) because of the clay types. More importantly for the consideration of <b>effective</b> <b>porosity,</b> though, glauconite grains (part of the Vsh) have intra-particular microporous pore space which retains capillary-bound water. Glauconite can constitute {{a large percentage of}} the reservoir rock, and therefore the associated intra-particular pore space can be significant. Log effective porosities calculated at 25% in some Greensand reservoirs have yielded core analysis effective porosities of 35% at equivalent depths. The difference is the glauconitic microporosity which contains water at reservoir conditions and is included as part of the Vsh (non-effective porosity) by log analysis. However, glauconitic microporosity is measured as part of the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> in core plugs, even if they are humidity dried.|$|E

The prepared fibers were characterized {{in terms of}} contact angle, gas permeability, wetting pressure and morphology. CO 2 stripping from preloaded aqueous diethanolamine solution was conducted through the gas–liquid membrane contactors. The effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) concentration on the membrane properties and CO 2 stripping performance were investigated. The addition of different LiCl concentration resulted in a less finger-like structure, with highly <b>effective</b> surface <b>porosity</b> and high wetting pressure. Conversely, N 2 permeability, contact angle value and membrane pore size were reduced as the concentration of the additives were increased.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the behavior of}} debris flow run-out include source material composition, volume of initial failure, slope angle at source, source slope morphology, degree of saturation of initial failure material, the type, depth and degree of saturation of path material, presence of surface water in slide path, vegetation along run-out path, and path confinement. The <b>effective</b> soil <b>porosity</b> {{is expected to have}} a great effect on some of these factors. Although many studies using a numerical simulation have been performed to analyze debris flow run-out, the effect of ESP (<b>Effective</b> Soil <b>Porosity)</b> has not been considered as a main contributor to the length of debris flow run-out. Therefore, this study examines the effect of ESP variation on travel distance of debris flow run-out. The results demonstrate that ESP is a dominant factor in determining the travel distance and the distribution of debris flow; that is, when the slope had a larger ESP value, the slope had greater water content in the sliding segment, resulting in a faster and longer travel distance, as well as in a broader distribution of debris flow. Consequently, a larger ESP value may increase the risk of damage in the downstream region...|$|R

Capillary water generally forms part of the effective pore space for both log and core analysis.However, microporous pore space associated with shales (where water is held by capillary forces and hence is not true CBW) is usually estimated as part of the Vsh by logs and therefore not included as part of the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity.</b> The total water associated with shales is more properly termed “shale water” which is larger in value than CBW (ref. 8).

40|$|In {{semiarid}} regions, karstic aquifers are in {{some cases}} essential since they often constitute {{the only source of}} water supply. The increasing demand for water in these regions is responsible for the decreasing water table levels. As a consequence, groundwater management becomes indispensable. A robust black-box model of the Solana aquifer, a large karstic aquifer in Alicante province, is developed considering GIS-based modelling of the studied area, climatic settings and anthropic disturbances (water extractions and irrigation returns). The proposed model accurately predicts water table levels evolution (with EF index of 0. 97 and RMSE of 0. 09) and assesses the recharge rates. The model aims to become a useful tool in order to better understand the characteristics of karstic aquifers. A distinctive feature of the model is that it estimates the heterogeneous <b>effective</b> <b>porosities</b> along the depth profiles of the aquifer, which provides an advantage related to detect changes in the hydraulic transmissivity within karstic formations.

A method is presented for constructing probability distributions of 'correction factors' {{that can be used}} to correct apparent flow porosities obtained from tracer tests to obtain 'true' flow porosities in fracture systems. Although only a limited number of the many possible variations in fracture flow system properties is investigated, it is concluded that <b>effective</b> flow <b>porosities</b> derived from cross-hole tracer tests have a strong tendency to overpredict true flow porosities in fracture flow systems. This tendency toward overprediction decreases as the fracture conductivity relative to the background conductivity field decreases and as the orientation of the most conductive fractures becomes better aligned with the two wells. Tracer tests with small amounts of recirculation of water from the production well to the injection well are predicted to result in much better estimates of true flow porosity (on average), and with much less variability in the estimates, than tests with no reclrculation.

30|$|Sandstone {{reservoir}} {{performance is}} affected by many factors including the depositional parameters of grain size and type of sorting, and diagenetic processes such as cementation and compaction (Cade et al. 1994). Whether a formation has good or poor reservoir quality largely depends on the petrophysical parameters such as porosity and permeability (Schlumberger 1989). Porosity {{is the amount of}} void spaces within a rock, which can be in-filled by hydrocarbons. Permeability {{is a measure of the}} ability of fluid to travel around the void spaces. Petrographical and sedimentological analyses help support the petrophysical findings. Of particular importance in reservoir units is diagenesis. This includes processes such as compaction, dissolution, clay authigenesis, cementation and mineral replacements, which contribute to physical and chemical alterations of the rocks, and may therefore enhance or impede their reservoir quality. A comprehensive understanding of reservoir quality and characterization is improved with a qualitative and quantitative well log analysis. Through well log interpretation, important petrophysical parameters such as total and <b>effective</b> <b>porosities,</b> water and hydrocarbon saturations, volume of shale and resistivity values can be achieved. Moreover, a formation can be narrowed down into reservoir and net pay zones for great analytical conclusions. Using these three analyses, the objective of this paper in achieving a thorough reservoir quality study is accomplished.|$|R

Wall boundary pressure measurement, in combination with singularity modelling of the airfoil, was sufficient to yield required information on the wall interference flow without having to establish some value for wall porosity. The singularity modelling of the airfoil initially covered only lift and volume but was extended to include drag and pitching moment, and second order volume term.

The cross-plots identified mainly sandstone, shale and in some cases intercalations of sand and shale in all the wells. The results also confirmed that the reservoirs are moderate to clean, containing clay volumes (< 0.10  v/v) that are below the threshold that can greatly affect the porosity values. Similarly, the <b>effective</b> <b>porosities</b> of all the reservoirs are moderate to good and will allow greater flow of both oil and gas. In the three wells, reservoirs L 3, M 5, M 6, N 2, and N 3 were found to contain oil; M 2 contains gas, while the rest are water-filled. The study also shows a remarkable increase in reservoir thickness from well M through wells N and L, giving rise to good sand development towards well L. As a result of this, the sandstone reservoirs for the discovered hydrocarbons (Fig.  1) are relatively connected between wells M and N, though showing partial connectivity with well L.
