The phenomenon of <b>disintermediation</b> had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.|$|E
25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some <b>disintermediation</b> and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} trend involved raising rates paid on {{savings to}} lure deposits, {{a practice that}} resulted in periodic rate wars between thrifts and even commercial banks. These wars became so severe that in 1966, the United States Congress took the highly unusual move of setting limits on savings rates for both commercial banks and S From 1966 to 1979, the enactment of rate controls presented thrifts {{with a number of}} unprecedented challenges, chief of which was finding ways to continue to expand in an economy characterized by slow growth, high interest rates and inflation. These conditions, which {{came to be known as}} stagflation, wreaked havoc with thrift finances for a variety of reasons. Because regulators controlled the rates that thrifts could pay on savings, when interest rates rose depositors often withdrew their funds and placed them in accounts that earned market rates, a process known as <b>disintermediation.</b> At the same time, rising loan rates and a slow growth economy made it harder for people to qualify for mortgages that in turn limited the ability of the S to generate income [...]|$|E
2500|$|Michael Spence {{wrote that}} [...] "Now comes a … powerful, wave of digital {{technology}} that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and <b>disintermediation</b> has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading {{to the production of}} goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." [...] In his view, {{the vast majority of the}} cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. [...] "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [...] are compelling." [...] Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies [...] "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." [...] For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is [...] "easy to imagine" [...] that production may become [...] "extremely" [...] local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that [...] "the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution." ...|$|E
50|$|In the non-Internet world, <b>disintermediation</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} strategy for many big box retailers like Walmart, which attempt to reduce prices by reducing the number of intermediaries between the supplier and the buyer. <b>Disintermediation</b> is also closely associated with the idea of just in time manufacturing, as the removal of the need for inventory removes one function of an intermediary. The existence of laws which discourage <b>disintermediation</b> has been cited as a reason for the poor economic performance of Japan and Germany in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Economically, virtual {{communities}} can be commercially successful, making money through membership fees, subscriptions, usage fees, and advertising commission. Consumers generally {{feel very comfortable}} making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of <b>disintermediation</b> in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. <b>Disintermediation</b> eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Disintermediation</b> may {{decrease}} {{the total cost}} of servicing customers and may allow the manufacturer to increase profit margins and/or reduce prices. <b>Disintermediation</b> initiated by consumers is often the result of high market transparency, in that buyers are aware of supply prices direct from the manufacturer. Buyers may choose to bypass the middlemen (wholesalers and retailers) to buy directly from the manufacturer, and pay less. Buyers can alternatively elect to purchase from wholesalers. Often, a business-to-consumer electronic commerce (B2C) company functions as the bridge between buyer and manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Re-intermediation {{in banking}} and finance {{can be defined}} as the {{movement}} of investment capital from non-bank investments, back into financial intermediaries. This is usually done in efforts to secure depository insurance on the capital, during times of high risk and volatility in market interest rates. Conceptually, Reintermediation {{can be thought of as}} an answer to <b>disintermediation,</b> which is the movement of investment funds away from financial intermediaries into other investments. <b>Disintermediation</b> occurs naturally, as competition from different financial firms can allow for higher investment yield, which causes funds to flow away from depository institutions.|$|E
50|$|Reintermediation can {{be defined}} as the {{reintroduction}} of an intermediary between end users (consumers) and a producer. This term applies especially to instances in which <b>disintermediation</b> has occurred first.|$|E
50|$|However, Internet-related <b>disintermediation</b> {{occurred}} {{less frequently}} than many expected during the dot com boom. Retailers and wholesalers provide essential {{functions such as}} the extension of credit, aggregation of products from different suppliers, and processing of returns. In addition, shipping goods {{to and from the}} manufacturer can in many cases be far less efficient than shipping them to a store where the consumer can pick them up (if the consumer's trip to the store is ignored). In response to the threat of <b>disintermediation,</b> some retailers have attempted to integrate a virtual presence and a physical presence in a strategy known as bricks and clicks.|$|E
50|$|The new {{transformational}} paradigm {{could be}} defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, <b>disintermediation</b> and mass customization are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including <b>disintermediation,</b> customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the Internet modifies the supply chain due to market transparency. <b>Disintermediation</b> has {{acquired}} a new meaning {{with the advent of the}} virtual marketplace. The virtual marketplace sellers like Amazon are edging out the middlemen. Direct sellers and buyers connect with each other because of the platform created by the virtual marketplace vendor. There is quid pro quo for the vendor for the use of the platform, else it would make no business sense to create such a platform. If the buyer, having connected with the seller, circumvents the platform and talks to the buyer and does her deal directly with the buyer, then the platform owner is unlikely to get her revenue share. This may be considered a new form of <b>disintermediation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Elimination of {{financial}} intermediaries (banks, brokers) between the suppliers of funds (savers/investors) and the users of funds (borrowers/investees). <b>Disintermediation</b> occurs when inflation rates are high but bank {{interest rates are}} stagnant and the bank depositors can get better returns by investing in mutual funds or in securities.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{peer-to-peer}} {{asset management}} was also characterized by <b>disintermediation</b> and reliance on social networks but features like “Social Trading” {{have started to}} fade. Since [...] "Social Trading" [...] disclosed live trades, investors learnt to replicate the strategies without compensation to the best providers, who then refused to publish them.|$|E
50|$|Reintermediation {{occurred}} due to {{many new}} {{problems associated with}} the e-commerce <b>disintermediation</b> concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before <b>disintermediation,</b> supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a product's availability to Internet channels forces the producer to compete {{with the rest of the}} Internet for customers' attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded.|$|E
