40|$|This {{study is}} an econometric {{analysis}} of three consumer banking accounts from Bank One Dayton, N.

The elasticity of demand {{with respect to}} interest rates of the savings and <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> accounts is determined using multiple regression modeling and analysis. Other variables that are significant determinants of the balances of each account are also presented. An analysis of the regression results for the <b>Time</b> <b>Deposits</b> Model indicates that the demand for the Bank One Dayton <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> accounts (certificate of deposit accounts) is significantly elastic with respect to interest rate. In addition to the <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> rate, personal income, recessionary economic periods, the unemployment rate and national small <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> balances are all significant, positive determinants of <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> balances. The percentage rate difference between the savings account rate and the <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> account rate is a significant determinant of savings account demand {{and in this case}} a better indicator of demand elasticity with respect to rate than the savings rate. The elasticity of demand for savings with respect to the savings-time deposit rate is low. Increases in personal income and decreases in the savings-time deposit rate will positively effect savings account balances. The depositor’s demand for Demand deposit accounts is determined by factors that do not accrue interest to the account’s balances. Personal income is positively correlated with total demand balances but tax payments, recessionary periods, the spread between the <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> and savings rate and the installment loan rate all negatively effect demand account balances. An increase in the time deposit-savings rate should encourage a flight of funds to <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> as should a recessionary period in the economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are (1) to analyse the condition of third party deposit outstanding, its interest rate, and cost of fund set up by PT. BNI (Persero) Tbk; (2) to analyse effect of third party deposit interest rate to third party deposit outstanding; and (3) to recommend to management an appropriate third party deposit interest rate which is able to optimize composition of third party deposit. Methodology used in this study is descriptive with a case study approach. The study applies Descriptive Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression analysis as the analysis tools. The study shows that, in general, third party deposit interest rate in BNI has experienced a down turn {{over the last three years}} (2002 – 2004) for all deposit. The declining trend of interest rate was followed by a change in composition of current <b>deposit,</b> saving, and <b>time</b> <b>deposit.</b> On one hand, <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> tended to decrease, on the other hand current deposit indicated an up turn. Finally, the change in this third party deposit composition had an impact of declining BNI cost of fund over that time. Based on result of regression analysis, variables which influenced significantly to <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> are rupiah denominated <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rate and foreign currency denominated time deposi interest rate. The variable which influenced significantly to saving is foreign currency denominated <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> interest rate.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose the {{development}} of return forecasting model for mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> product in Islamic bank based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Design/methodology/approach – The analysis consists of two main elements. First element is the identification and selection of significant macroeconomic variables that determine return volatility of mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> in Indonesian Islamic bank industry. Second element is the implementation of appropriate ANNs model according to neural networks properties, and model evaluation based on simulated return predictions of mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> product in Bank Syariah Mandiri (RR-BSM). Findings – It is shown that monthly changes of return can be predicted quite well. The model provides a satisfactory result in forecasting RR-BSM for 12 months ahead with 95. 22 per cent accuracy. These results suggest that the ANNs can be applied as an adequate tool to help depositors in predicting future return of mudharabah <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> product.
