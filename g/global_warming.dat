5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens about <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> via a comprehensive slide show that, {{by his own}} estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on <b>global</b> <b>warming,</b> which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E

40|$|The Earth has warmed {{over the}} past century. The warming rate (amount of warming over a given period) varies in time and space. Observations show a recent {{increase}} in <b>global</b> mean <b>warming</b> rate, which is initially maintained in model projections, but which diverges substantially in future depending on the emissions scenario followed. Scenarios that stabilize forcing lead to much lower warming rates, as the rate depends on the change in forcing, not the amount. Warming rates vary spatially across the planet, but most areas show a shift toward higher warming rates in recent decades. The areal distribution of warming rates is also changing shape to include a longer tail in recent decades. Some areas of the planet are already experiencing extreme warming rates of about 1  °C/decade. The fat tail in areal distribution of warming rates is pronounced in model runs when the forcing and <b>global</b> mean <b>warming</b> rate is increasing, and indicates a climate state more prone to regime transitions. The area-proportion of the Earth displaying warming/cooling trends is shown to be {{directly related to the}} <b>global</b> mean <b>warming</b> rate, especially for trends of length 15 years and longer. Since the <b>global</b> mean <b>warming</b> rate depends on the forcing rate, the proportion of warming/cooling trend areas in future also depends critically on the choice of future forcing scenario.

40|$|Our {{overall goal}} was to {{quantify}} the potential for threshold changes in natural emission rates of trace gases, particularly methane and carbon dioxide, from pan-arctic terrestrial systems under the spectrum of anthropogenically forced climate warming, {{and the extent to}} which these emissions provide a strong feedback mechanism to <b>global</b> climate <b>warming.</b> This goal is motivated under the premise that polar amplification of <b>global</b> climate <b>warming</b> will induce widespread thaw and degradation of the permafrost, and would thus cause substantial changes in the extent of wetlands and lakes, especially thermokarst (thaw) lakes, over the Arctic. Through a coordinated effort of field measurements, model development, and numerical experimentation with an integrated assessment model framework, we have investigated the following hypothesis: There exists a climate-warming threshold beyond which permafrost degradation becomes widespread and thus instigates strong and/or sharp increases in methane emissions (via thermokarst lakes and wetland expansion). These would outweigh any increased uptake of carbon (e. g. from peatlands) and would result in a strong, positive feedback to <b>global</b> climate <b>warming...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Several climate events {{occurred}} in Laurentia during the Phanerozoic Eon. During the late Cambrian through the Ordovician, sea level fluctuated with ice cap melt. Nine macro scale fluctuations of [...] "Global hyper warming", or high intensity greenhouse gas conditions, occurred. Due to sea level fluctuation, these intervals led to mudstone deposits on Laurentia {{that act as}} a record of events. The late Ordovician brought a cooling period, although the extent of this cooling is still debated. More than 100 Ma later, in the Permian, an overall warming trend occurred. As indicated by fossilized invertebrates, the western margin of Laurentia was affected by a lasting southward bound cool current. This current contrasted with waters warming in the Texas region. This opposition suggests that, during Permian <b>global</b> <b>warm</b> period, northern and northwestern Pangea (western Laurentia) remained relatively cool.|$|R

Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there.

5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and <b>global</b> <b>warming,</b> with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes..

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> Scientists have speculated that <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
40|$|Although the mid- to Late Cretaceous is {{regarded}} as a <b>global</b> <b>warm</b> period, increasingly a more complex picture of warming and cooling is emerging. New techniques allow more precise dating of terrestrial localities, opening opportunities for using climate proxy approaches on terrestrial fauna and flora to better capture the complexity of Cretaceous climate. Here an attempt is made to understand the seasonality and inter-annual variability of two newly dated localities from the upper preserved portion (Cenomanian-Turonian) of the Winton Formation, Australia. Primarily quantitative approaches to palaeodendrology are used. The results suggest both seasonality and high variability in climate conditions that affect growth between years, including evidence for floods. The longest series (QM F 44338) suggests oscillatory patterns of good and poor growth in a 15 year alternating cycle similar to the contemporary Pacific Decadal Oscillation, although other potential explanations should be considered and tested.

40|$|The mid-Pliocene was a <b>global</b> <b>warm</b> period, {{preceding}} {{the onset of}} Quaternary glaciations.
