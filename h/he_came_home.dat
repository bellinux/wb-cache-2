5|$|Gröning {{wanted to}} join an elite army unit and {{set his sights on}} joining the Schutzstaffel. Without his father's knowledge, he did so in 1940 at a hotel where the SS was recruiting. Gröning says his father was {{disappointed}} to learn this when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> after having joined.|$|E
5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched {{and the other half}} is found there.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Ben showed a {{developed}} vocabulary. In 1860, {{he was sent}} to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the American Civil War began. In 1863, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina). The South's desperate need for soldiers ended this plan, and in June 1864, still not yet 17, he withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a coastal artillery unit. These plans were scuttled as well when he fell ill at home. A cranial tumor led to the removal of his left eye, and it was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{had much}} money, so they {{determined}} to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens {{of birds and}} insects. Both made extensive travels — {{in different parts of}} the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections, especially of insects. Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years; on the voyage, his ship caught fire, and his collection was destroyed; undeterred, he set out again, leading eventually (1869) to a comparable book, The Malay Archipelago. By the time <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> in November 1859, Bates had collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to describe what is now called Batesian mimicry, where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species. Bates's account of his stay, including observations of nature and the people around him, occupies his book.|$|E
25|$|In 1765 Lee {{fought in}} Poland, {{serving as an}} aide-de-camp under King Stanislaus II. After many adventures <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to England. Unable to secure {{promotion}} in the British Army, in 1769 he returned to Poland and saw action in the Russo-Turkish War. He lost two fingers in a duel in which he killed his opponent.|$|E
25|$|Following a Commonwealth Literary Fund Fellowship, in 1958, {{and with}} the support of Douglas Stewart and other {{concerned}} Australian poets such as Rosemary Dobson, David Campbell and Vincent Buckley), his supervised release from David Rice Hospital (Norwich) was organised.

25|$|Arnaz and Lucille Ball {{were married}} on November 30, 1940. Their {{marriage}} was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her, {{and also because}} <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the interlocutory decree became final. Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actress Lucie Arnaz (born 1951) and actor Desi Arnaz, Jr. (born 1953).|$|E
25|$|Every {{time when}} <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to Palampur on leave, he would visit the Neugal Cafe. Batra last came home {{on leave from}} the army in 1999, during the Holi festival for a few days. During that time, {{when he went to}} the Café for a coffee, he met an {{acquaintance}} who told him to be careful in the war, to which Batra replied: I'll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it. But I'll come for sure.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to a Chechnya in turmoil. Dzhokhar Dudayev {{had started}} a {{rebellion}} against Soviet, later Russian rule, but the Northern part of Chechnya where Kakiyev hailed from was not so enthusiastic about the secession. After allegedly witnessing atrocities, Kakiyev joined the opposition against Dudaev. In 1993 he was seriously hurt when a hand grenade meant for Dudayev exploded in his own hands. He lost a hand, an eye and his nose and had to have his face reconstructed beyond recognition, {{at a hospital in}} Moscow's Arbat Street. After the operation, Said-Magomed briefly studied at Alma Ata University and returned to Russia to take a tax police training course.|$|E

25|$|He {{was sent}} in March 1941 to Egypt via the Cape of Good Hope to {{reinforce}} the FAU detachment in Greece, but this had been captured by the Nazis before he could join, so his unit was sent to Syria {{to work at the}} Hadfield-Spears Mobile Hospital, an Anglo-French entity attached to the Free French Forces. A stay of a month in Cairo allowed Davis to view the city's mosques (with Michael Rowntree) and produce a book on the subject (see list of works below). As the mobile hospital moved through Syria and Lebanon and then along the desert to Tunisia, and eventually to Italy and southern France, Davis visited (and wrote up in his copious notebooks) such places as Baalbek, Byblos, Damascus, Krak des Chevaliers, Beaufort, Leptis Magna and El Djem. He ran the hospital laundry. By 1944, his FAU unit had reached France, and he participated in the liberation of that country. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> for demobilisation with the Croix de Guerre (oddly for a pacifist!) for his contribution to the Free French war effort.|$|E
25|$|In the Sprint Cup Series, Earnhardt hit {{a slight}} resurgence, {{and in the}} first five races of the season {{recorded}} three Top 5's and five Top 10 finishes. It began with a second-place finish to teammate Jimmie Johnson at the Daytona 500, Earnhardt's third runner up finish in the 500 since 2010. The following week at Phoenix, he led for 47 laps, but was shuffled back in traffic during a cycle caution flag pit stops, which allowed Carl Edwards to assume the lead while Junior finished in fifth place. This was followed by two more Top 10 finishes: 7th at Las Vegas and 6th at Bristol. At Fontana, Earnhardt started mid-pack and after a couple of mistakes including a lengthy pit stop caused by missed lug nuts on a right rear tire, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> in 2nd-place finish, assuming the points lead as a result of Brad Keselowski going off pace and falling back. Two weeks later in Martinsville, Earnhardt struggled throughout the race, and spun out after Danica Patrick was hit by Brian Vickers and sent into Earnhardt and ended up finishing 24th, 2 laps down, losing the points lead to Jimmie Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{travels with}} Diana {{to the family}} seat of Lyde Manor where he meets the people involved. Hugh strikes Poirot as a fine young bull of a man. He learns further details {{of the history of}} {{insanity}} in the family from Colonel Frobisher, including Hugh's grandfather who was committed to an asylum. Poirot learns that Hugh's mother died when he was ten years old in a boating accident when she was out with the Admiral, and that she was previously engaged to Frobisher before he went off to India with the British Army. When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> he learned she had married Admiral Chandler, however this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men. Poirot forces Frobisher to tell him more details of the incident with the sheep and finds out that on the night concerned, the Admiral found his son in bed with blood on his clothes and blood in the washbasin but Hugh remembered nothing of what he had done. Poirot questions the Admiral who has aged immensely since these incidents started and who feels that breaking the engagement is best for everyone, remarking {{that there will be no}} more Chandlers at Lyde Manor after he and his son have died.|$|E

25|$|As {{the race}} was heading into the closing stages, Hamilton {{seemed to be on}} a charge to try to catch the leading Brawn but in reality it looked only a mistake would stop the Brazilian winning. As Button was lapping a second off the pace just making sure his car got to the end. Kubica was {{catching}} Button at a high rate of knots but it seemed a long shot if Button was going to lose them two points. Barrichello took the chequered flag to win his first grand prix since the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in , and record the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One (including the victories of Emerson Fittipaldi, José Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Felipe Massa and Barrichello). Hamilton came second, while Finn Räikkönen came home in third. Kovalainen came fourth, while Nico Rosberg had a reasonably quiet race as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> in fifth. Fernando Alonso came sixth in his home race, championship leader Jenson Button came seventh, while Robert Kubica came eighth, only his second points scoring finish so far this season. Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two points to his tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point this weekend.|$|E
25|$|Hoad won {{his first}} Italian Championships on the clay courts of the Foro Italico in Rome in early May when he outplayed Sven Davidson in {{straight}} sets. At the French Championships Hoad survived a five-set scare against Robert Abdesselam {{in the third round}} to reach the final which he won against Sven Davidson in straight sets to claim his second consecutive title at a Grand Slam event. Unknown to the public Hoad had stayed up the night previous to the final, invited by a Russian diplomat, and was drunk when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home.</b> An intensive workout by Rod Laver got him into a state that allowed him to play the final. In May Hoad won the International Golden Ball tournament in Wiesbaden, West Germany after a straight-sets victory in the final over Art Larsen but in the Trofeo Conde de Godó in Barcelona he lost in the quarterfinal to Bob Howe. As a preparation for Wimbledon Hoad elected to play the singles event at the Northern Championships in Manchester instead of the Queen's Club Championships. He reached the final but had to bow for 34-year old Jaroslav Drobný who won the deciding set 7–5. Hoad was seeded first for the Wimbledon Championships and was the pre-tournament favorite. He lost two sets along the way to reach the final, in which he faced Rosewall. In the first all-Australian final since 1922 Hoad was victorious in four sets to gain his first Wimbledon and third successive Grand Slam championship title. Hoad also won the doubles title with Rosewall, their third Wimbledon title, outclassing Orlando Sirola and Nicola Pietrangeli in the final in straight sets. Following his Wimbledon title he entered the Midlands tournament and was beaten in the semifinal by Mike Davies. In August Hoad won the singles title at the German Championships, held on the clay courts at Hamburg, after a four-set defeat of Orlando Sirola in the final.|$|E
