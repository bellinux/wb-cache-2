40|$|An rf endcap {{trap and}} four laser sources have been {{developed}} for experiments in cavity-QED and groundstate cooling. Single " 8 " 8 Sr"+ ions have been trapped routinely and laser cooled close to the Doppler limit. A sideband <b>injection</b> <b>locked</b> <b>laser</b> system was developed to probe the " 2 S_ 1 _/_ 2 to " 2 D_ 5 _/_ 2 quadrupole transition at 674 nm. The linewidth of this laser was reduced to 6 kHz. Clearly resolved motional sidebands have been observed in 674 nm quantum jump spectra and the ion {{has been shown to be}} confined in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Micromotion minimisation in 3 -D has been implemented. A new scheme is described for avoiding so-called dark states when working at zero magnetic field. It was shown that the magnetic field could be nulled to 0. 3 #mu#T. For low temperatures the motion of the ion is that of a 3 -D quantum harmonic oscillator. The separate key elements that are necessary for a sideband cooling experiment have been achieved. The Zeeman structure of the 674 nm transition, together with all the secular sidebands, has been fully characterised. Optical pumping to the - 1 / 2 magnetic sublevel of the ground state was performed with an efficiency of 94 %. The characteristics of the 1033 nm quencher transition were investigated experimentally. Coherent excitation on the carrier of a single Zeeman component of the 674 nm transition has been demonstrated: two Rabi oscillations at a frequency of 278 kHz were observed before dephasing. Attempts at sideband cooling to the motional ground state were made, but were unsuccessful: this is due to an unexplained heating rate which is thought to be related to excessive micromotion. Data so far suggest that laser cooling to the Doppler limit has not been achieved, this may be part of the same problem. As a preliminary stage in an experiment to observe the enhancement of spontaneous decay from the " 2 D_ 5 _/_ 2 state the natural lifetime of this level has been measured.

40|$|Coherent {{photonic}} systems promise novel functionality and/or {{improved performance}} compared to direct detection photonic systems, but have {{the disadvantage of}} being sensitive to optical phase noise. The most common approach to this problem is to force one laser to track the phase of the other with a phase locked loop (PLL), so that the phase noise of the lasers cancelsout of the RF heterodyne beat note. Although the PLL approach has been implemented for semiconductor lasers, the large linewidth of these lasers and the resulting large PLL loop bandwidth severely constrain the design and limit performance. This disadvantage of the PLL approach is particularly relevant for many applications, since semiconductor lasers are preferred for system insertion. An alternative approach for establishing coherence between two <b>lasers</b> is optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking.</b> Standard theory indicates that <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> can act {{in the same way}} as a first order PLL with a bandwidth as high as several GHz, which is large enough to achieve state of the art noise levels (e. g. - 130 dBcIHz @ 1 MHz offset) with semiconductor lasers.

Suppression of the light shift is realized using a master-slave laser configuration by reducing the overall optical power delivered to the physics package as well as spoiling the injection of the slave, causing it to lase far off resonance (1 - 2 nm) as proposed by the authors several years ago [1]. In the absence of any mitigation, this (AC Stark) shift, due to near-resonant laser light reaching the atoms during their microwave interrogation period, is the largest shift in such frequency standards (2 × 10 - 11 for our fountain).

40|$|Abstract — Nonlinear period-one (P 1) {{dynamics}} of a semicon-ductor laser are investigated for radio-over-fiber uplink trans-mission. By optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking,</b> the <b>laser</b> in a base station is {{driven into the}} P 1 oscillation state, which is further locked by the uplink microwave signal through modulation on the bias current. Due to double locking by both the optical injection and current modulation, the uplink microwave signal is converted into an optical signal for transmission to the central office. Comprehensive numerical simulations reveal that the proposed uplink transmission based on the P 1 state provides wide, continu-ous, and optically-controlled tunability for the uplink subcarrier frequency, which exceeds the laser modulation bandwidth. The laser with a relaxation resonance frequency of only 10. 25 GHz is shown to support subcarrier frequencies reaching 60 GHz. Compared to the commonly used stable <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> state and the free-running state, the proposed P 1 state generates the microwave oscillation by the inherent nonlinear dynamics and thus reduces the requirement on the uplink signal strength for low-error transmission. Both electrical demodulation and all-optical demodulation are investigated, where the latter {{is found to be}} better in terms of the immunity to dispersion and the speed requirement on optoelectronic conversion. The results illustrate the capability of using the P 1 oscillation state for optically controlled uplink transmissions.
