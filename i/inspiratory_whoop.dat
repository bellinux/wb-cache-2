25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, <b>inspiratory</b> <b>whoop,</b> and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis {{has been documented}} to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|E

40|$|Pertussis {{causes a}} large number of cases and hospitalizations in Catalonia and Navarra. We made a study of {{household}} cases of pertussis during 2012 and 2013 in order to identify risk factors for hospitalization in pertussis cases. Each primary case reported triggered the study of their contacts. Close contacts at home and people who were in contact for > 2 hours during the transmission period of cases were included. The adjusted OR and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using logistic regression. A total of 1124 pertussis cases were detected, of which 14. 9 % were hospitalized. <b>Inspiratory</b> <b>whoop</b> (aOR: 1. 64; CI: 1. 02 – 2. 65), apnoea (aOR: 2. 47; CI: 1. 51 – 4. 03) and cyanosis (aOR: 15. 51; CI: 1. 87 – 128. 09) were more common in hospitalized than in outpatient cases. Hospitalization occurred in 8. 7 % of correctly-vaccinated cases, 41. 1 % of non-vaccinated cases and 9. 4 % of partially-vaccinated cases. In conclusion, <b>inspiratory</b> <b>whoop,</b> apnoea and cyanosis were associated factors to hospitalization while vaccination reduced hospitalizations due to pertussis.

Complications of pertussis, especially in infants and very young children, include pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy and death. Although vaccination protects young children, older children and adults may become infected due to waning immunity. Because they usually have milder symptoms, older children and adults with pertussis may not seek medical care, thereby increasing the likelihood of transmission to unvaccinated infants and very young children...|$|E

40|$|Pertussis is {{an acute}} {{respiratory}} infection characterized by paroxysmal cough and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>whoop</b> for over 2 weeks. The incidence of pertussis has decreased markedly after the introduction of DTwP&# 47;DTaP vaccine, but the incidence of pertussis has increased steadily among young infant and among adolescents and adults in many countries.

Forty-eight Bordetella isolates were recovered from 103 children (overall positive-culture rate, 46. 6 %) who met the clinical case definition of pertussis. Seven of 44 (16 %) B. pertussis isolates and 2 of 4 (50 %) B. parapertussis isolates were recovered only after extended incubation of nasopha-ryngeal cultures up to 12 days.

40|$|Pertussis, a cough illness {{commonly}} known as whooping cough, {{is caused by the}} bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The illness is characterized by a prolonged paroxysmal cough often accompanied by an <b>inspiratory</b> <b>whoop.</b> Disease presentation varies with age and history of previous exposure or vaccination. Young infants can present to a clinic or hospital with apnea and no other disease symptoms. Adults and adolescents with some immunity can exhibit only mild symptoms or have the typical prolonged paroxysmal cough. In all persons, cough can continue for months. Severe disease is infrequent in healthy, vaccinated persons. Infants, particularly those who have not received the primary vaccination series against pertussis, are at risk for complications and mortality. Pneumonia is the most common complication in all age groups. Seizures and encephalopathy are rare and generally only reported in young infants. Death is rare and most likely to occur in young, unvaccinated infants, although fatalities are occasionally reported among older children and adults with serious underlying health conditions. 1 In addition to B. pertussis, three other Bordetella species can cause disease in humans: B. parapertussis, B. holmesii, and B. bronchiseptica.

40|$|Pertussis, or {{whooping}} cough, is {{a highly}} contagious disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. The disease is characterised by paroxysmal cough, <b>inspiratory</b> <b>whoop</b> and post-tussive vomiting. 1 Pertussis is transmitted via direct contact with discharges from the respiratory tract of infected individuals (probably via droplets), and the incubation period is 9 – 10 days on average. 2 A second-ary attack rate of 90 % has been recorded in non-immune household contacts. 2 Worldwide, the incidence of per-tussis {{has been reported to}} be highest in children under 5 years, except where infant vaccination programs have achieved consistently high vaccination rates. 2 In NSW, there have been several changes to the immuni-sation schedule affecting pertussis vaccination in recent years. From 1985, a combined whole cell diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTPw) was included in the immunisation schedule at ages 2, 4 and 6 months, with a booster at 18 months. 3 In 1994, a fifth dose was introduced Pertussis in New South Wales, 1993 – 2005 : the impact of vaccination policy on pertussis epidemiology Abstract: Objective: To assess whether changes in vaccination policy have affected the epidemiology of pertussis in NSW between 1993 and 2005...|$|E
40|$|Pertussis (whooping cough) is an {{infectious}} illness {{caused by the}} bacterium Bordetella pertussis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a clinical case of pertussis {{is defined as a}} cough illness lasting at least two weeks with {{at least one of the}} following: paroxysms of coughing, <b>inspiratory</b> <b>whoop,</b> or post-tussive vomiting, with-out any other apparent cause. 1 Pertussis is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory droplets from an infected person. Since March 1, 2005, the Alaska State Public Health Laboratory-Anchorage (ASPHL) has been performing poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) testing in addition to culture to confirm pertussis diagnosis. 2 Either method is acceptable to confirm a diagnosis of pertussis. Methods A review of reported cases was conducted to characterize the epidemiology of pertussis in Alaska and to determine the impact of PCR testing on pertussis in Alaska. 3 Incidence rates were based on 2000 census data. Results Annual pertussis incidence rates from 1995 - 2004 were similar for Alaska and the US, with the exception of 2003, when an outbreak of pertussis involving 41 persons occurred in a remote community near Homer (Figure 1). 4 Reports of pertussis identified across Alaska contributed to the increase in pertussis incidence from January through August 2005...|$|E
