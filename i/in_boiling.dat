5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is sometimes cooked further <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> water and then served. Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, Janssen and Lockyer {{independently}} {{observed a}} yellow {{line in the}} solar spectrum that did not match {{that of any other}} element. In 1895, in each case at around the same time, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet independently observed helium trapped in cleveite. André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it. Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan, in 1886. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It was the first noble gas to be isolated. In 1898, within a period of three weeks, Ramsay and Travers successively separated krypton, neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> points. In 1898, Dorn discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of radium; Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray subsequently isolated radon in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Several foods have an {{association}} with the city. Sally Lunn buns (a type of teacake) have long been baked in Bath. They were first mentioned by name in verses printed in the Bath Chronicle, in 1772. At that time they were eaten hot at public breakfasts in Spring Gardens. They can be eaten with sweet or savoury toppings and are sometimes confused with Bath buns, which are smaller, round, very sweet and very rich. They {{were associated with the}} city following The Great Exhibition. Bath buns were originally topped with crushed comfits created by dipping caraway seeds repeatedly <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> sugar; but today seeds are added to a 'London Bath Bun' (a reference to the bun's promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition).

5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming.

5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. Large pieces of tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further <b>in</b> <b>boiling</b> water.|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} D (SED) {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently recovered enterotoxins in staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) outbreaks. The expression and production of SED were investigated in three ham products, i. e. boiled ham, smoked ham and dry-cured Serrano ham incubated at room temperature for seven days. Staphylococcus aureus was also, as a reference, grown in cultivation broth during optimal growth conditions for seven days. <b>In</b> <b>boiled</b> and smoked ham, continuous sed expression was observed throughout the incubation period with a second increase in sed expression found after five days of incubation. In smoked ham, nine times less SED per colony-forming unit of S. aureus was detected than <b>in</b> <b>boiled</b> ham. <b>In</b> <b>boiled</b> ham, the SED levels unpredictably decreased after three days of incubation. In the Serrano ham, SED was detected after five days of incubation although S. aureus growth was poor and sed expression was too low to determine.

40|$|Open Access JournalThis study {{investigated}} the impact of processing on retention of iron and zinc in D. rotundata. Fresh tubers were processed into boiled yam and yam flour and analyzed for zinc, iron, and physicochemical properties. Percent true retention (%TR) was assessed using paired samples and a formula that compensated for loss or gain of moisture and soluble solids. The retention of iron ranged from 55. 5 % to 98. 7 % <b>in</b> <b>boiled</b> yam and 25. 2 % to 54. 9 % in yam flour; retention of zinc ranged from 49. 3 % to 97. 5 % <b>in</b> <b>boiled</b> yam and 18. 9 % to 43. 1 % in yam flour. The amount of iron retained <b>in</b> <b>boiled</b> yam correlated with the amount in the fresh samples (r =. 79), likewise in yam flour (r =. 82). A similar trend was observed for zinc. From our study, we conclude that retention of iron and zinc {{is dependent on the}} variety and processing method used. The information from this study can be used by food scientists and nutritionists in choosing the appropriate processing to increase the retention of high levels of micronutrient in yams and by the yam breeders to adjust their germplasm breeding activities.
