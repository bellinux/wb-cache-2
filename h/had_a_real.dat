5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|Before {{entering}} politics, Jew was an entrepreneur. Among other enterprises, {{he managed}} his family's flower shop and owned a local taxi company named Howard Mock Jew, Inc. In addition, he invested in real estate.

5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every {{individual}} was encouraged to feel that she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E

5|$|The Kraken was {{difficult}} to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch King Kong vs. Godzilla which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> octopus crawling over miniatures. On the set, two pipes filled with 30,000 pounds of cement were used to crash and split the Edinburgh Trader: Completing the illusion are miniature masts and falling stuntmen shot on a bluescreen stage. The scene where the Kraken spits at Jack Sparrow does not use computer-generated spit: it was real gunge thrown at Johnny Depp.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

25|$|In June 1956, Miller {{left his}} first wife, Mary Slattery, whom he married in 1940, and married film star Marilyn Monroe. They {{had met in}} 1951, had a brief affair, and {{remained}} in contact since.

New England <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> chance to win their first MLS championship, in MLS Cup 2006, against the Houston Dynamo. After Taylor Twellman scored in the 113th minute, the Revs allowed an equalizing header from the Dynamo's Brian Ching less than a minute later that sent the game to penalty kicks, where the Revs lost 4–3.|$|E

Indeed, one pro was in the mains of the pro car race and therefore <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> shot at becoming National no. 1 pro, despite being only an A pro. On top of everything else, A pro needn't had been a pro {{at the start of the}} season. An amateur could theoretically race the required number of nationals as an amateur, turn pro before the Grand National and have a shot at the Pro number one title and the car.|$|E
25|$|Wollaston {{was born}} in Woking, and studied {{medicine}} at Guy's Hospital in London. She qualified in 1986 {{and worked as a}} junior hospital doctor and then as a general practitioner. After more than twenty years in clinical practice, Wollaston ran for political office. She {{was the first person to}} be selected as the parliamentary candidate for a major British political party through a postal open primary; during the campaign she emphasised that she was not a career politician and had actually <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> job. As the Conservative Party candidate for Totnes at the 2010 general election she won the seat with an increased majority, increasing it further in 2015.|$|E

[...] "He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> sense of duty", wrote J. B. Priestley.

500|$|Several {{months after}} losing the United States Championship, Konnan became a villain and joined The Dungeon of Doom. However, the gimmick was already on its way out. According to Kevin Sullivan (the {{originator}} of the stable), speaking in a retrospective interview in July 2016, Konnan [...] "didn’t fit in The Dungeon of Doom. He was forced into it." [...] Sullivan also praised Konnan highly: [...] a fabulous performer and has a great mind for the wrestling business. He should have been on his own. Putting him with us, he just lost all the steam he had. He brought the luchadors into WCW, so he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> effect on professional wrestling." ...|$|E

Soviet player Pavel Kostichkin also leveled a two-handed slash at Fleury, leading to another fight. The battle quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice for both teams. Returning from a commercial break, Canadian commentator Don Wittman understated {{the severity of the}} fighting by saying [...] "well, we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> skirmish just moments ago following a face-off." [...] Evgeny Davydov was the first player from either team to leave his bench to join the melee, prompting all players from both teams to leave their benches.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{was traded}} to the Kansas City Athletics with pitcher Jack McMahan for Spook Jacobs and $5,000 cash. He never played a game with the Athletics, who soon sent him to the Columbus Jets of the International League in late June 1956. Neither Jacobs nor McMahan lasted beyond the 1956 season in the Majors. After being traded to the Athletics, Pittsburgh's main black newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, protested that Roberts never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> chance in the Majors. However, Pirates general manager Joe L. Brown replied that Roberts was a [...] "fine young man, but a {{marginal}} Major Leaguer," [...] whose weak hitting was compounded by a lack of versatility: [...] "He was really a one-position player. He didn't have the arm to play shortstop." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} made of Stanford's music by writers from Shaw onwards {{is that his}} music lacks passion. Shaw praised [...] "Stanford the Celt" [...] and abominated [...] "Stanford the Professor", who reined in the emotions of the Celt. In Stanford's church music, the critic Nicholas Temperley finds [...] "a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience, but one that is perhaps lacking in deeply felt religious impulse." [...] In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do so. Like Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> gift, but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that [...] "only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity." ...|$|E
