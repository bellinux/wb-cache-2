6000|$|This day at {{a quarter}} to three I {{attended}} at the palace to resign [...] the seals, and had an audience of about twenty minutes. The Queen, [...] in taking them over, was pleased {{to say that she}} received them with [...] great pain. I answered that the decision which had required me to [...] surrender them had been the most painful effort of my public life. [...] The Queen said she was afraid on Saturday night [Feb. 17, when he [...] had dined at the palace] from the language I then used that this [...] was about to happen. I answered that we had then already had a [...] discussion in the cabinet which pointed to this result, and that I [...] spoke as I did, because I thought that to have no reserve whatever [...] with H. M. was the first duty of all those who had the honour and [...] happiness of being her servants. I trusted H. M. would believe that [...] we had all been governed by no other desire than to do what was [...] best for the interests of the crown and the country. H. M. expressed [...] her confidence of this, and at no time throughout the conversation [...] did she in any manner indicate an opinion that our decision had [...] been wrong. She spoke of the difficulty of making arrangements for [...] carrying on the government in the present state of things, and I [...] frankly gave my opinion to H. M. that she would have little peace or [...] comfort in these matters, until parliament should have returned to [...] its old organisation in two political parties; that at present we [...] were in a false position, and that both sides of the House were [...] demoralised--the ministerial side overcharged with an excess of [...] official men, and the way stopped up against expectants, which led [...] to subdivision, jealousy, and intrigue; the opposition so weak in [...] persons having experience of affairs as to be scarcely within the [...] chances of office, and consequently made reckless by acting without [...] keeping it in view; yet at the same time, the party continued and [...] must continue to exist, for it embodied one of the great [...] fundamental elements of English society. The experiment of [...] coalition had been tried with remarkable advantage under a man of [...] the remarkable wisdom and powers of conciliation possessed by Lord [...] Aberdeen, one in entire possession too of H. M.'s confidence. They [...] intimated that there were peculiar <b>disadvantages,</b> <b>too,</b> evidently [...] meaning Lord J. Russell. I named him in my answer, and said I [...] thought that even if he had been steady, yet the divisions of the [...] ministerial party would a little later have brought about our [...] overthrow.[345] H. M. seeming to agree in my main position, as did [...] the Prince, asked me: But when will parliament return to that [...] state? I replied I grieved to say that I perceived neither the time [...] when, nor the manner how, that result is to come about; but until [...] it is reached, I fear that Y. M. will pass through a period of [...] instability and weakness as respects the executive. She observed [...] that the prospect is not agreeable. I said, True, madam, but it is [...] a great consolation that all these troubles are upon the surface, [...] and that the throne has for a long time been gaining and not losing [...] stability from year to year. I could see but one danger to the [...] throne, and that was from encroachments by the House of Commons. No [...] other body in the country was strong enough to encroach. This was [...] the consideration which had led my resigning colleagues with myself [...] to abandon office that we might make our stand against what we [...] thought a formidable invasion.... I thought the effect of the [...] resistance was traceable in the good conduct of the House of [...] Commons last night, when another attempt at encroachment was [...] proposed and firmly repelled.... I expressed my comfort at finding [...] that our motives were so graciously appreciated by H. M. and [...] withdrew.|$|E

Sometimes top level executives discourage the upward flow of information and neglect the constructive suggestions and opinions about the work related issues of the organization. It is a time taking process and is comparatively slow too.|$|E

These elements may include whole programs, libraries, associated configuration information or data. The impact over time may be resultant deterioration of performance as the unwanted software or software components occupy memory, waste processing time, add disk I/O, consume storage and cause delays at system startup and shutdown. In the worst cases, the leftover software may interfere with the correct operation of wanted software. Bloatware can be easily removed if the user has root access on his/her smartphone. However, the rooting process has its own advantages & <b>disadvantages</b> <b>too.</b> For instance, the manufacturer's warranty may be voided if the device is rooted.|$|E

In addition, there is happening a mutual penetration of various trends {{in art and}} their exchange. Globalization describes the acceleration of the integration of nations into the global system. It contributes {{to the expansion of}} cultural ties between the peoples and human migration.

5000|$|Radio {{is another}} paid touch point. Radio {{advertisement}} {{is known as}} the [...] "theater of minds" [...] as there are no visuals (Mateo, n.d.), so listeners have to imagine the brand image on their own. Good commercials on radio encourage listeners to have a unique picture of the brand (Fill, et al., 2013). If it is used effectively it makes emotional connection with the listeners (Peacock, 2007). This could work in the favor of brand in long term. Another, big advantage of radio advertisement is that it is very cheap compare to other paid touch points (Ian, n.d.). A company can reach potential consumers frequently at low cost (Fill, etal.,2013). Reaching frequently, is very beneficial for emotional connection and thus brand favor-ability (Peacock, 2007). Just like magazine, Radio advertisement also reaches different demographics for targeting specific audience (Fill, et al., 2013). Different times of a day are for different kind of demographics, depending on what kind of programs are on, at that time. The most effective time for radio advertisement are the peak traffic hours; aspeople like to listen to radio when they are stuck in traffic (Fill, et al., 2013). Most companies like to have talk-back sessions about their brand. General people discuss on the radio what they think about a brand and where they encountered that brand. This could be a great way for brand awareness as well as brand loyalty. It is particularly excellent for small local businesses (Ian, n.d.). Radio advertising has quite a lot of <b>disadvantages</b> <b>too.</b> Just like magazine, Radio is not good for mass marketing, as it focuses on segment of market (Fill, et al., 2013). Another big problem with this is that; if listeners don't like a particular song and the advertisement was to come in that song; they switch the channel and therefore miss out on advertisement (Neha, 2011). Furthermore, {{there is a lot of}} background noise in radio advertisement; like background music, listeners doing their chores.(Ian, n.d.). Regardless, of these disadvantages many small business use radio advertisement as their paid touch point.|$|E

But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly.

And yet every brick or stone, which we pick up among the former, had fallen ages before the foundation of the latter was begun. This is owing to the kindliness with which Natures takes an English ruin to her heart, covering it with ivy, as tenderly as Robin Redbreast covered the dead babes with forest leaves. She strives to make it a part of herself, gradually obliterating the handiwork of man, and supplanting it with her own mosses and trailing verdure, till she has won the whole structure back. But, in Italy, whenever man has once hewn a stone, Nature forthwith relinquishes her right to it, and never lays her finger on it again. Age after age finds it bare and naked, in the barren sunshine, and leaves it so. Besides this natural <b>disadvantage,</b> <b>too,</b> each succeeding century, in Rome, has done its best to ruin the very ruins, so far as their picturesque effect is concerned, by stealing away the marble and hewn stone, and leaving only yellow bricks, which never can look venerable.|$|R
