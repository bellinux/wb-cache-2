40|$|Modern Swedish is {{an article}} {{language}} {{which in the}} course of its history has developed both definite and indefinite articles. The present study focuses on the grammaticalization of the postponed definite -IN, etymologically the demonstrative pronoun hinn 'yon' and the indefinite <b>EN,</b> whose <b>source</b> is the numeral 'one'. Both grammaticalizations originate with textual uses of the forms: the demonstrative to mark anaphora and the numeral to mark new, persistent referents. The processes are interdependent: the indefinite article does not grammaticalize before the grammaticalization of the definite has been triggered and its development restricts the spread of the definite article to specific uses. Since both grammaticalizations have the same sources in unrelated article languages, this detailed study of the developments in Swedish has a bearing on the studies of other languages as well.

In the case of Brazil, small hydro plants and cogeneration from sugarcane waste (bagasse) have been attractive alternatives during the past years, with hundreds of MW installed since 2004. Despite their advantages, both alternatives are hindered by seasonal yet complementary availability. This forces producers to discount (or price) the risks faced when selling firm energy contracts and may ultimately lead to projects being commercially unattractive. We propose a stochastic optimization model that defines the optimal composition of a portfolio based on these two renewable sources in order to maximize the revenue of an energy trading company. At the same time, this model mitigates hydrological and fuel unavailability risks, thus allowing the participation of both sources in the forward market environment in a competitive manner.

The vertices of an operad mapping space are just operad morphisms. The 1 -simplices represent homotopies between morphisms in the {{category of}} operads. The goal {{of this paper is to}} determine the homotopy of the operadic mapping spaces MapO 0 (En, C) with a cofibrant En-operad <b>En</b> on the <b>source</b> and the commutative operad C on the target. First, we prove that the homotopy class of a morphism φ: En → C is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which gives the action of φ on generating operations in homology. From this result, we deduce that the connected components of MapO 0 (En, C) are in bijection with the ground ring. Then we prove that each of these connected components is contractible. In the case n = ∞, we deduce from our results that the space of homotopy selfequivalences of an E∞-operad in differential graded modules has contractible connected components indexed by the invertible elements of the ground ring...|$|R

Design: Prospective case series conducted at Shaare Zedek Medical Center. Participants or Samples: 34 eyes of 17 healthy subjects and 30 eyes of 16 diabetic patients. Methods: Collected data included demographics, Snellen chart measured visual acuity, current HBA 1 C levels, previous laser treatments and swept source OCT measured central retinal subfield thickness. SS-OCT en face images were generated and flattened at three planes: ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The largest vessel was identified at the RPE level, retrieved at the GCL and IPL layers and its diameter measured. The deepest plane in the choroid at which shadow of this vessel could be identified was then measured from the RPE. Main Outcome Measures: Diameter of the largest vessel, depth of the vascular signal. Results: DME mostly affected the vascular shadow at the IPL level. At this plane, the measured vessel of the largest vessel was significantly reduced in DME (93. 3 ± 33. 5 vs. 115. 9 ± 2. 54 microns; p< 0. 01). A trend was found between DME and reduction of depth of the vascular signal (retrieved at 120. 0 ± 74. 2 microns below the RPE in diabetic eyes vs. 148. 7 ± 92. 1 microns in eyes of healthy patients aged more than 55 years; p= 0. 07).

For example, a widely used concentration ratio is the anthracene (Ant) /[Ant + phenanthrene (Phe) ], {{and if this is}} lower than 0. 10, it is taken as indicative of non burnt fossil fuel, whereas if this ratio exceeds 0. 10, this suggests combustion sources. Similarly, many other ratios exist (Table 1), and are used to reveal petrogenic or pyrogenic origin, fuel or wood combustion, or traffic related sources (Brandli et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2007). When these ratios are used to determine the sources, it is hypothesized that paired chemicals are diluted to a similar extent and that the ratios remain constant <b>en</b> route from <b>sources</b> to receptors, although in many cases it has been proven that this does not happen (Zhang et al., 2005).

The third part will deal with the problem of the western interpretation of the crisis in the Libri Carolini and the reception of the second Council of Nicea through this <b>source.</b> <b>En</b> el artículo que sigue, estudiamos la primera crisis iconoclasta en Bizancio a finales del siglo VIII. Tratamos de estudiar este problema no sólo a través de fuentes bizantinas, sino también a través de una importante fuente occidental como son los Libri Carolini. Por una parte, esta comparación de fuentes nos dará la posibilidad de clarificar ciertas aspectos acerca del carácter ideológico de las fuentes occidentales. Por otra parte, podremos arrojar cierta luz sobre el problema de la imágenes en las tradiciones oriental y occidental. En la primera parte del artículo, enfocaremos la historiografía sobre este tópico, en tanto que en la segunda expondremos los principales acontecimientos de la crisis en Bizancio.

The objective {{of this study is}} to quantify the changes in the ecosystem components, carbon pathways, and available food for small pelagic fish that occur associated with the change in physical forcing due to El Nino. Two periods are distinguished based on the observed sea level anomaly: a La Nina (LaN) period (1996) in which sea level was below normal and El Nino (EN), the average conditions for December 1997, in which the sea level was anomalously high. There are three phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano-, and net-phytoplankton) which compete for nutrients and are eaten by three zooplankton size classes. The ecosystem model is forced by alongshore wind speed measured by the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) and the European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS- 1 and ERS- 2). Larger, slower growing organisms are more sensitive to physical disturbance than smaller organisms (Carr, 1998]. In the present simulation as well, the primary effect of the El Nino (reduced nutrient supply, and increased temperature) is to reduce the biomass of large cells (netphytoplankton) and consequently of the zooplankton that rely on large cells as food <b>source.</b> <b>EN</b> conditions are accompanied by a rearrangement of carbon pathways: comparable uptake goes into reduced biomass accumulation, increased losses to respiration, reduced carbon export, and much reduced carbon available to fish. The star indicates the remotely sensed biomass (assuming a constant carbon to chlorophyll ratio of 60) as measured by the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (Nov. -Dec. 1996) and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (Dec. 1997). The model, which assumes no light limitation, overestimates total phytoplankton biomass. Additional Information is contained in the original...|$|R

5000|$|Since 2006 a {{small company}} based in England, Econovate Ltd has develop {{with the support of}} Cambridge and Bath University a papercrete formula and {{production}} process for breeze blocks to be accepted by British Standard and a green certification for Europe. This new mixture of papercrete is to withstand the wet and harsh English weather. As of 2009 Econovate {{was in the process of}} developing this product and reaching manufacturing trials stage. A patent was filed in 2011 for the production process of breeze blocks with this material. De design of machinery was necessary to achieve a successful scale up of production. In January 2013 Econovate became fully funded to set up its first demonstration plant capable of producing up to 1.5m blocks a year which expected to achieve certification by October 2015. The company has tested the product at UKAS register testing houses for 18 rigours test such as fire, strength, moisture movement, acoustics, thermal, durability and others toward the product certification. This certification by LABC was achieved in dec 2015. The company was also in the process of achieving ISO 9001, 14001, 18001 and BS <b>eN</b> 6001 (responsible <b>sourcing).</b> Its ISO 9001 certification was achieved in October 2015. Econovate with its product Econoblok is producing a breeze blokc, UK standard size (440mmx215mmx100mm) with 5Mpa and another with 7Mpa. The difference between the two will be the amount of fibre within the mixture and this can range between 55% to 79%. The more strength the less fibre thus less thermal. After gaining Certification the company has increased production and the product is called [...] "econoblok®". Initial commercialization will be in the UK until the production process is fully tested and ready for up scaling to a full size plant. From January 2017 the company will start preparing for the full size plant of 5-6 million block production, this will be based in the UK. Econovate plans to expand to other region of the world where some basic recycling system exist.|$|R
40|$|Middleboxes are an {{indispensable}} {{part of the}} datacenter networks that provide high availability, scalability and performance to the online services. Using load balancer as an example, this thesis shows that the prevalent scale-out middlebox designs using commodity servers are plagued with three fundamental problems: (1) The server-based layer- 4 middleboxes are costly and inflate round-trip-time as much as 2 x by processing the packets in software. (2) The middlebox instances cause traffic detouring <b>en</b> route from <b>sources</b> to destinations, which inflates network bandwidth usage {{by as much as}} 3. 2 x and can cause transient congestion. (3) Additionally, existing cloud providers do not support layer- 7 middleboxes as a service, and third-party proxy-based layer- 7 middlebox design exhibits poor availability as TCP state stored locally on middlebox instances are lost upon instance failure. This thesis examines the root causes of the above problems and proposes new cloud-scale middlebox design principles that systemically address all three problems. ^ First, to address the performance problem, we make a key observation that existing commodity switches have resources available to implement key layer- 4 middlebox functionalities such as load balancer, and by processing packets in hardware, switches offer low latency and high capacity benefits, at no additional cost as the switch resources are idle. Motivated by this observation, we propose the design principle of using idle switch resources to accelerate middlebox functionailites. To demonstrate the principle, we developed the complete L 4 load balancer design that uses commodity switches for low cost and high performance, and carefully fuses a few software load balancer instances to provide for high availability. ^ Second, to address the high network overhead problem from traffic detouring through middlebox instances, we propose to exploit the principles of locality and flexibility in placing the middlebox instances and servers to handle the traffic closer to the sources and reduce the overall traffic and link utilization in the network. ^ Third, to provide high availability in a layer 7 middleboxes, we propose a novel middlebox design principle of decoupling the TCP state from middlebox instances and storing it in persistent key-value store so that any middlebox instance can seamlessly take over any TCP connection when middlebox instances fail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the above cloud-scale middlebox design principles using load balancers as an example. Specifically, we have prototyped the three design principles in three cloud-scale load balancers: Duet, Rubik, and Yoda, respectively. Our evaluation using a datacenter testbed and large scale simulations show that Duet lowers the costs by 12 x and latency overhead by 1000 x, Rubik further lowers the datacenter network traffic overhead by 3 x, and Yoda L 7 Load balancer-as-a-service is practical; decoupling TCP state from load balancer instances has a negligible (3 ̆c 1...|$|R

Recommendation is the action,for an {{intelligent}} system, to supply a user of an application with personalized content so as toenhance what is refered to as ”user experience” e. g. recommending a product on a merchantwebsite or even an article on a blog. Recommendation is considered dynamic when the contentto recommend or user tastes evolve rapidly e. g. news recommendation. Many applications thatare of interest to us generates {{a tremendous amount of}} data through the millions of online usersthey have. Nevertheless, using this data to evaluate a new recommendation technique or evencompare two dynamic recommendation algorithms is far from trivial. This is the problem weconsider here. Some approaches have already been proposed. Nonetheless they were not studiedvery thoroughly both from a theoretical point of view (unquantified bias, loose convergencebounds [...] .) and from an empirical one (experiments on private data only). In this work we startby filling many blanks within the theoretical analysis. Then we comment on the result of anexperiment of unprecedented scale in this area: a public challenge we organized. This challengealong with a some complementary experiments revealed a unexpected source of a huge bias:time acceleration. The rest of this work tackles this issue. We show that a bootstrap-basedapproach allows to significantly reduce this bias and more importantly to control it.

50|$|While {{spending}} time in the WayneTech Labs in Pre-Crisis Gotham City, Supergirl of Earth-One notices a device which Lucius Fox of Earth-One explains is designed to read her subconscious physical reactions. With it, he hopes that she can help Superman of Earth-One rebuild the Phantom Zone Projector by sensing the correct placements of the parts that she subconsciously remembers from when her father Zor-El and uncle Jor-El built it {{when she was a}} girl. Superman of Earth-One hopes that by opening a way to the Phantom Zone, they'll be opening {{a way out of the}} dome that fell over Gotham City of Earth-One a year ago. However, the Phantom Zone is filled with Krypton's worst criminals. After the device that would provide a one-way trip to the Phantom Zone is created, Superman of Earth-One and Supergirl of Earth-One enter only to have the device blow up sealing them there. Suddenly from beyond the dome, Lucius Fox of Earth-One hears a voice warning that the dome will soon fall, and champions will be forced to rise from each of the cities on the planet Telos and to fight for the survival of their people. Superman of Earth-One and Supergirl of Earth-One wonder what the purpose of the dome was. Perhaps it was to protect Gotham City from a catastrophe. Perhaps it has made them features in a zoo or prisoners. Suddenly, they are overcome by shockwaves from nearby and decide to investigate the <b>source.</b> <b>En</b> route, Superman of Earth-One explains that he admires Supergirl of Earth-One for her proactive behavior. She uses her powers for good, but he always uses his to react. Without warning, the pair are attacked by Phantom Zone prisoners who are eager for revenge. Superman of Earth-One urges Kara of Earth-One to go on without him, but in so doing is overcome. Supergirl of Earth-One spots geysers of gas coming from the ground. In the gas, she sees visions of her own past, future, and inevitable death at the hands of the Anti-Monitor. Angrily, she dispels the gas as she doesn't want to see any further parts of her future. She worries that if she doesn't go back to Earth, her loved ones will die. If she does go back, she will die. Determinedly, she decides that if she is to die, it is necessary that she save others doing it. Supergirl of Earth-One gets lost in the gas, losing track of time. Eventually, she realizes that Superman of Earth-One should have been back by now, and searches for him. Supergirl of Earth-One discovers that Superman of Earth-One is surrounded by Phantom Zone prisoners. She takes out several of them leaving only two of them who are guarding Superman of Earth-One. After taking out the guards, Supergirl of Earth-One grabs Superman of Earth-One and they get away. While looking for a way out of the Phantom Zone and evading the gases, Superman of Earth-One and Supergirl of Earth-One are attacked by the Phantom Zone prisoners. Back at Gotham City of Earth-One, Lucius Fox of Earth-One is horrified when the dome goes down and the human-hating Apes from Earth-AD march into Gotham City of Earth-One.|$|R
