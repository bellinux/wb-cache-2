40|$|The ITER Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive (ECH&CD) Upper Launcher, whose {{preliminary}} design was approved in 2009, {{is on its}} way towards the final design. The design work is being done by a consortium of several European research institutes in tight collaboration with F 4 E. The main focus is the finalization of the design of all components for the First Confinement System (FCS), which forms the vacuum and Tritium barrier. The FCS comprises structural components as well as the external waveguide components in the port cell. Structural components of the FCS include the <b>flange</b> <b>seal,</b> backend frame and closure plate. The external waveguide components include the isolation valve, CVD diamond windows, miter bends and straight waveguides. Because finalizing of the design of these components is directly influenced by the layout of many in-vessel components, the design work includes also further development of the entire launcher. This paper summarizes the most recent status of the design work on the structural components of the launcher FCS, which are the support flange, the socket, the closure plate and feed-throughs for waveguides and cooling pipes. The design work includes the engineering layout of these components in accordance with system requirements, load specifications and Quality and Safety classification. An outline of the overall design of the launcher will be presented. The design progress was based on a set of related analyses, of which particular results are given.

30|$|The <b>flange</b> <b>sealing</b> {{structure}} {{was used in}} a core holder under high temperature and high pressure. The overall upstream and downstream plunger pistons were located in the chamber for confining pressure test, so that the end face of a rock was effectively contacted with the piston of the holder. Using the flexible graphite to seal the confining pressure in the rock samples and holder overcomes the shortage of traditional equipments that they cannot be applied for testing at high temperature when rubber is used for sealing. Furthermore, the copper casing subjected to thermal treatment in the vacuum was used to isolate the rock samples and confining pressure, which can effectively transfer confining pressure and reliably resist high temperature and pressure, so as to work continuously. The pore pressure and confining pressure were loaded by utilizing the EDC servo control system, which can automatically control the pressure. When pore pressure or confining pressure changed, the servo control system was able to compensate pressure, so that pressure was maintained at a certain value and did not change with temperature or other conditions.|$|R

Stylet sheath compositions are largely unknown and their mode of solidification remains to be elucidated. This report demonstrates the formation and solidification of in āere (in air) produced stylet sheaths by six hemipteran families: Diaphorina citri (Psyllidae, Asian citrus psyllid), Aphis nerii (Aphididae, oleander/milkweed aphid), Toxoptera citricida (Aphididae, brown citrus aphid), Aphis gossypii (Aphididae, cotton melon aphid), Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Aleyrodidae, whitefly), Homalodisca vitripennis (Cicadellidae, glassy-winged sharpshooter), Ferrisia virgata (Pseudococcidae, striped mealybug), and Protopulvinaria pyriformis (Coccidae, pyriform scale). Examination of in āere produced stylet sheaths by confocal and scanning electron microscopy shows a common morphology of an initial flange laid down {{on the surface of}} the membrane followed by continuous hollow core structures with sequentially stacked hardened bulbous droplets.

40|$|International audienceA {{programme}} {{of large-scale}} experiments for atmospheric dispersion {{was carried out}} by INERIS over a period extending from December 1996 to April 1997. The objectives of the test campaign were to measure anhydrous ammonia concentrations in a range of few meters to 2 kin from the release, in order to generate data to be used to improve 2 -phase discharge and dispersion modelling. The discharges were released from a 6 -tonne storage tank of pressurised liquid ammonia and through a discharge device with an outlet diameter of 2 in. Fifteen trials were carried out with various release configurations corresponding to industrial situations (impinging jets on the ground and on a wall at various distances, release through a <b>flange</b> without <b>seal</b> [...] .). The quantity of ammonia discharged from the liquid phase varied according to the tests, from 1. 4 to 3. 5 tons for durations between 7 and 14 min and, therefore, at flow rates between 2 and 4. 5 kg/s. Approximately 200 sensors were settled downwind to measure ammonia concentrations and temperature in the plume. These tests showed that for discharges with identical flow rates the distances corresponding to the same concentration vary a lot according to the configurations. These distances tend to be reduced by the presence of obstacles or retention dikes that collected liquid ammonia. In the paper, the main experimental results are presented.

40|$|Process {{safety is}} a task of {{preventing}} leaks. Leak prevention is critical because pressure vessels and piping assets in chemical plants are fabricated from materials which have limited corrosion resistance. When corrosive compounds are processed in these assets, they may suffer degradation over time due to thinning, cracking, or loss of their material properties. This problem is partially controlled by applying a safety margin known called a corrosion allowance. The corrosion allowance is determined by predicting the asset?s expected corrosion rate and its service life. However, this fixed safety margin does not consider the inherent uncertainty in an individual asset?s degradation rate due to variability in the material?s corrosion resistance, the operating parameters of the process, and the inspection techniques {{used to measure the}} progression of corrosion damage over time. Consequently, deterministic analysis is not capable of precisely estimating an asset?s safe operating life during its design stage. One of the most likely areas for leakage to occur in process equipment is at the flange connections that join assets together. Risk analyses for planning inspections of fixed equipment and piping usually treat flanges as components of their parent asset. This thesis focuses on methods to improve prediction and control of corrosion and leakage at flange connections in particular. <b>Flange</b> connection <b>seal</b> tightness can be monitored through vibration-based Non-Destruction Testing (NDT). The data gathered from this monitoring can be used to update risk models for flange connection leakage. Hierarchical Bayesian Network methods of modeling risk are demonstrated in this thesis to be capable of predicting probability of seal failure based on the mean and variance of failure rates in a population of flange connections. This allows for prediction of the probabilities based on corrosion and leak events in the plant. The results of inspection techniques are used as inputs to this risk model, enabling probabilistic decision-making...|$|R

The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) cold filling procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of cold filling the receiver and piping.

Turbulent computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to model the air flow into an ion funnel system. The results of these simulations were coupled one-way with electrodynamics simulations of the fields generated by the ion funnel. Using the turbulence kinetic energy (k), a spatially varying estimation of the fluctuating component of the velocity field was calculated. These resulting simulations more accurately predicted the ion transmission through the system. Using fused deposition modeling (FDM) novel construction methods for the ion funnel and the vacuum chamber components the ion funnel system utilizes were developed. An FDM fabricated frame, {{in the shape of}} the ion funnel, was quickly and inexpensively produced. This frame supported a flexible printed circuit board that served as both the lenses of the ion funnel and power distribution circuit. The transmission of ions was as good as the traditionally constructed ion funnel. The device cost and weighed less and had lower intrinsic impedance, requiring less power to be driven. FDM was also used to produce vacuum components by post-processing using electroplating.

Three sections of 1 inch thick spray-on foam and two sections of vacuum jacket. The model evaluates friction, turns losses and convection heat transfer between the fluid and the pipe wall. There is conduction through the foam insulation with temperature dependent thermal conductivity. The vacuum space is modeled with radiation and gas molecular conduction, if present, in the annular gap. Heat is transferred between the outer surface and surrounding ambient by natural convection and radiation; and, by axial conduction along the pipe and through the vacuum jacket spacers and welded <b>seal</b> <b>flanges.</b> The model makes extensive use of SINDA/FLUINT basic capabilities such as the GEN option for nodes and conductors (to generate groups of nodes or conductors), the SIV option (to generate single, temperature varying conductors), the SIM option (for multiple, temperature varying conductors) and the M HX macros for fluids (to generate strings of lumps, paths, and ties representing a diabatic duct).

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of machines is advantageous in predicting failure and estimating machine component lifetime. Continuous {{monitoring of}} parameters such as temperature, vibration, and strain using sensors and consequent data analysis {{can help in}} reducing machine downtime by taking corrective actions before failure. Various wireless and wired sensors may be attached to critical components such as bearings, gears, mechanical seals, shafts etc. for measurements. These sensors however are often inadequate solutions as wired sensors are dicult to mount on rotating components, especially in millimeter-size spaces that may exist {{in some of these}} components. Wireless sensors provide a viable solution for measurements in rotating components but their range and performance are often limited due to power-supply constraints. The majority of these components are enclosed in metal housings (ex. pumps and motors). In such scenarios, wireless communication is nearly impossible due to severe signal attenuation. ^ This research provides a unique solution to the above issues by implementing sensors based on temperature-induced magnetic field change of permanent neodymium magnets. Hall Effect sensors are employed to detect these changes. The static magnetic The field can pass through non-magnetic, metals such as estimates steels, copper, aluminum etc. thus allowing temperature sensing through complete metal enclosures. In this thesis, we present wireless sensors for bearing inner race and mechanical seal remote temperature measurement. A permanent neodymium ring-shaped magnet is attached to the inner race of the bearing, while temperature is read remotely using a Hall Effect sensor. The sensor is characterized on a hot plate for calibration equation and noise analysis. These calibration equations are later used for dynamic testing on bearing test rig.

40|$|The Subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) which is latched to a subsea wellhead {{is one of}} several barriers in the well to prevent kicks and blowouts and it is the most important and critical equipment, as it becomes the last line of protection against blowout. The BOP system used in Subsea drilling operations is considered a Safety – Critical System, with a high severity consequence following its failure. Following past offshore blowout incidents such as the most recent Macondo in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been investigations, research, and improvements sought for improved understanding of the BOP system and its operation. This informs the need for a systematic re-evaluation of the Subsea BOP system to understand its associated risk and reliability and identify critical areas/aspects/components. Different risk analysis techniques were surveyed and the Failure modes effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) selected to be used to drive the study in this thesis. This is due to it being a simple proven cost effective process that can add value {{to the understanding of the}} behaviours and properties of a system, component, software, function or other. The output of the FMECA can be used to inform or support other key engineering tasks such as redesigning, enhanced qualification and testing activity or maintenance for greater inherent reliability and reduced risk potential. This thesis underscores the application of the FMECA technique to critique associated risk of the Subsea BOP system. System Functional diagrams was developed with boundaries defined, a FMECA were carried out and an initial select list of critical component failure modes identified. The limitations surrounding the confidence of the FMECA failure modes ranking outcome based on Risk priority number (RPN) is presented and potential variations in risk interpretation are discussed. The main contribution in this thesis is an innovative framework utilising Multicriteria decision making (MCDA) analysis techniques with consideration of fuzzy interval data is applied to the Subsea BOP system critical failure modes from the FMECA analysis. It utilised nine criticality assessment criteria deduced from expert consultation to obtain a more reliable ranking of failure modes. The MCDA techniques applied includes the technique for order of Preference for similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Fuzzy TOPSIS, TOPSIS with interval data, and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE). The outcome of the Multi-criteria analysis of the BOP system clearly shows failures of the Wellhead connector, LMRP hydraulic connector and Control system related failure as the Top 3 most critical failure with respect to a well control. The critical failure mode and components outcome from the analysis in this thesis is validated using failure data from industry database and a sensitivity analysis carried out. The importance of maintenance, testing and redundancy to the BOP system criticality was established by the sensitivity analysis. The potential for MCDA to be used for more specific analysis of criteria for a technology was demonstrated. Improper maintenance, inspection, testing (functional and pressure) are critical to the BOP system performance and sustenance of a high reliability level. Material selection and performance of components (<b>seals,</b> <b>flanges,</b> packers, bolts, mechanical body housings) relative to use environment and operational conditions is fundamental to avoiding failure mechanisms occurrence.
