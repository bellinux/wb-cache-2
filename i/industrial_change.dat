2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded use of {{the term}} [...] "Industrial Revolution" [...] seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto, announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise. In his 1976 book , Raymond Williams states in the entry for [...] "Industry": [...] "The idea of a new social order based on major <b>industrial</b> <b>change</b> was clear in Southey and Owen, between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth {{at the turn of the}} [...] century." [...] The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui's description in 1837 of la révolution industrielle. Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of [...] "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society". [...] However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee, whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.|$|E

We utilize a panel of 227 manufacturing industries between 1960 and 1969. We find that on the one hand, the removal of de facto import quotas had significantly negative effects on real output, real output per establishment, and employment. On the other hand, for those industries where import quotas were removed, tariff protection was effective in maintaining real output and employment. However, this does not necessarily mean the success of <b>industrial</b> policy <b>change</b> because neither tariff protection nor the removal of quotas contributed to productivity growth. In that sense, the <b>industrial</b> policy <b>change</b> had limited effects...|$|R
