40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that the prior metabolism of testosterone by the secondary sexual tissues may be necessary for its androgenic effect. The effects of two anti-androgens, <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> and cyproterone acetate (17 α-acetoxy- 6 -chloro- 1, 2 α-methylenepregna- 4, 6 -diene- 3, 20 -dione) used in the chemotherapy of human prostatic carcinoma, have been examined on both the metabolism of testosterone and the retention of its metabolites by the rat ventral prostate gland. Cyproterone acetate was found to inhibit the retention of labelled metabolites of [3 H]-testosterone by prostatic nuclei, both in vivo and in vitro. This inhibition appeared to be competitive. In contrast with its effect on nuclear retention of metabolites of testosterone, cyproterone acetate had no {{significant effect on the}} metabolism of [3 H]testosterone by rat ventral prostate tissue. <b>Diethylstilboestrol</b> similarly had little effect on the metabolism of [3 H]testosterone by prostatic tissue, although it did appear partially to inhibit its initial metabolism in all the incubation systems used. <b>Diethylstilboestrol</b> inhibited the nuclear retention of dihydrotestosterone when both [3 H]testosterone and <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> were injected intraperitoneally in vivo, but had no effect on dihydrotestosterone retention when both testosterone and <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> were supplied directly to the prostate either in vivo or in vitro.

UGT activity towards bisphenol A in liver microsomes and in UGT 2 B 1 expressed in yeast AH 22 cells (22. 9 and 0. 58 nmol/min per mg of microsomal proteins respectively) was higher than that towards <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> (75. 0 and 4. 66 pmol/min per mg of microsomal proteins respectively). UGT activities towards both bisphenol A and <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> were distributed mainly in the liver but were also observed at substantial levels in the kidney and testis.

Similar results were found with wheat-germ RNA polymerase II. In the presence of rifampicin and heparin, the prokaryotic enzyme transcribed a number-average RNA chain of 670 nucleotide residues, at an average rate of 110 nucleotide residues/min, from Müllerian-duct chromatin of all developmental stages. From day 10 to day 15 there was a 44 % {{decrease in the number of}} initiation sites for E. coli RNA polymerase on Müllerian-duct chromatin.

Embryos exposed to maximally responsive doses of <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> for 2 days showed increases in Müllerian-duct chromatin template capacity, RNA-chain initiation sites, wet weight, protein and RNA. The changes seen in the oviduct of the 1 -week-old chick injected for 2 days with <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> were defined as 100 % responses.

40|$|Anaerobic eukaryotes {{are often}} devoid of {{mitochondria}} but contain special organelles {{separated from the}} cytosol by a single (in fungi) or a double (in protozoa) membrane. Hydrogenosomes from the anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix sp. L 2 are thought to catalyse the enzymic steps in the ATP-yielding metabolism of malate into acetate, H- 2 and CO 2. Isolated hydrogenosomes contain a Mg 2 +- or Mn 2 +-dependent ATPase activity. This activity {{is involved in the}} maintenance of a pH gradient across the hydrogenosomal membrane, which renders these organelles alkaline inside. ATPase activity and DELYTApH generation is sensitive to <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> but not to other known ATPase inhibitors. Typical inhibitors of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase, bongkrekic acid and carboxyatractylate reduced the ATPase activity, suggesting the presence of a nucleotide transporter.

The inhibition of oestrogen-stimulated growth, attained with nanomolar concentrations of ADIOL, was not modified by increasing concentrations of <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> up to 100 nm. This inhibition was counteracted by antiandrogens, which were unable to block the ADIOL stimulatory effect in steroid-free medium. On the other hand, in the presence of tamoxifen ADIOL showed an additive antiproliferative activity also in steroid-free medium, rather than the usual stimulatory effect.

Adrenal androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and 5 -en-androstene- 3 p, 17 p-diol (ADIOL), are the major secretory products of the adrenal gland. However, their physiological role is still unknown. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that they might affect the growth of human breast tumours (Bulbrook et al., 1971; Wang et al., 1975; Segaloff et al., 1980; Zumoff et al., 1981; Helzlsouer et al., 1992).

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{attest to the}} existence of alternative ligand binding sites on the oestrogen receptor (ER), including non-competitive inhibition by trilostane or tamoxifen. It is possible that the inhibitory action of conventional oestrogen agonists at high concentrations may indicate that they too interact at alternative ER sites, albeit at low affinity. To test this possibility an oestrogen reporter assay was used to compare the activity of different oestrogens and antagonists in breast cancer and prostate cell lines. All four cell lines tested contained different amounts of oestrogen receptor α (ERα), ERβ, progesterone receptor and coregulator mRNA. Though differences were observed in response to stimulation and inhibition, these correlated only with {{the presence or absence of}} ERα, and not with the other components. Thus stimulation of the reporter by oestradiol and oestrone was biphasic in the breast cancer cells, while prostate cells were unable to respond. Only T 47 D cells were stimulated by oestriol or <b>diethylstilboestrol,</b> however reporter activity of all the cell lines was repressed by 10 mM <b>diethylstilboestrol.</b> Reporter activity of MCF- 7 cells was inhibited by tamoxifen, raloxifene and ICI 182, 780, but stimulated by trilostane, yet all these antioestrogens inhibited agonist-stimulated activity. Trilostane also inhibited the agonism seen in cells co-treated with E 2 and tamoxifen. It is clear that several of the compounds tested may have either agonist or antagonist effects under different conditions and at different concentrations, acting through ERα alone. Though biphasic dose response curves, or hormesis, have been attributed to various mechanisms, we here provide evidence that alternative ligand binding sites may contribute to this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|At short {{intervals}} {{after the}} intravenous administration of oestradiol- 17 β, <b>diethylstilboestrol,</b> testosterone or saline control solution to ovariectomized rats, highly purified lysosome samples were prepared in substantial yield from preputial glands, sex accessory organs rich in these organelles. The preparations were essentially devoid of mitochondrial contamination. Exposure in vivo to doses of these hormones varying from 0. 1 to 5 μg/ 100 g body wt. provoked dose-dependent labilization of the lysosomal membrane surface, {{as evidenced by}} significantly diminished structural latency of several characteristic acid hydrolases, including acid phosphatase, β-glucuronidase and acid ribonuclease II, when such preparations were subsequently challenged in vitro with autolytic conditions, detergent or mechanical stress. Enhanced lytic susceptibility induced by hormone pretreatment was occasionally detectable in the initial preparation without further provocative stimuli in vitro. Comparable results were obtained with the corresponding fractions of uterus, despite the more limited concentration of lysosomes in this steroidal target organ. By the present criteria oestradiol- 17 α was essentially inert, even in a dose 25 times that effective for its active β-epimer (< 0. 1 μg/ 100 g body wt.). Pretreatment with <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> exerted substantial membrane-destabilizing influence in preputial-gland lysosome samples from orchidectomized rats. Moreover, administration of testosterone to gonadectomized animals resulted in essentially equivalent dose-dependent augmentation of lysosomal enzyme release in preputial-gland preparations of either sex. The membrane stability of lysosome-enriched preparations from uterus, on the other hand, was unaffected by testosterone pretreatment. The sensitivity, specificity and selectivity of the lysosomal response to sex steroids provide evidence for the physiological significance of this phenomenon as a general mechanism for mediation of secondary biochemical transformations in the hormone-stimulated target cell...|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that biotinylated asparaginase binds to mouse monocytes. Also, asparaginase bound to peritoneal exudate, resident, splenic, bone marrow and pulmonary macrophages, but not to neutrophils or lymphocytes. Labelled asparaginase binding to peritoneal exudate macrophages was inhibited by 20 -fold excess of unlabelled asparaginase. The binding of asparaginase to monocytes from mice injected with lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) or carrageenan was decreased. This decreased binding following treatment with LDV or carrageenan was reversed when mice were treated with <b>diethylstilboestrol.</b> In-vivo asparaginase clearance in mice infected with LDV was impaired as compared with that in uninfected mice. Neither strain nor age differences affected the binding to monocytes. The {{results suggest that the}} ability of asparaginase to bind to monocytes in vitro may reflect clearance function in vivo...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study examined the}} sequential effects of <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> (stilboestrol) on sodium balance, cardiac state, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity in six patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. Whereas metabolic balance studies did not show evidence of sodium retention during the first seven days of treatment, {{there was a significant}} and progressive increase in plasma volume after three months (mean increase 541 ml; p less than 0. 01). Stilboestrol increased supine plasma renin and angiotensin II values but the response of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity to erect posture was progressively reduced during treatment. No significant changes in blood pressure or indices of cardiac function occurred during the three months of observation. The findings of increased basal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity and an increase in plasma volume suggest an important mechanism of the cardiac complications associated with oestrogen treatment...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a hormone-dependent disease, and a {{proportion}} of patients with oestrogen receptors (ERs) will respond to ovarian ablation [1 - 3]. For this reason, oestrogen is considered bad for patients with breast cancer. This short communication presents our evolving understanding of oestrogen’s role as a survival signal in breast cancer and new emerging knowledge of the apoptotic actions of oestrogen [4]. Synthetic oestrogens based either {{on the structure of}} triphenylethylene or the very potent but shorter acting <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> [5, 6] were described more than 60 years ago. This proved to be a cheap source of new medicines. High-dose synthetic oestrogen administration was found to be effective in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer [7], but low-dose synthetic oestrogens never really became accepted as hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausa...|$|E
40|$|A rapid, {{reliable}} and sensitive procedure is {{reported for the}} detection of residues of total <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> (DES) (free and conjugated) in bovine muscle samples. Prior to analysis, the DES in the sample was enzymatically deconjugated. Subsequently the sample was subjected to a clean-up procedure using a two-trap system composed of a first cartridge of non-specific adsorbing material (C 18) and of a second cartridge containing a sulphonic acid type silica-based anion exchanger. The determination was performed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Analytical variables such as efficiency of hydrolysis, enzyme purification, hydrodynamic voltammetric studies and variation in the DES trans/cis ratio were investigated. Mean recovery of total DES was 87. 3 %. The precision of the procedure was 7. 2 % for DES levels of 0. 5 ng/g and 2. 1 % for levels of 5 ng/g...|$|E
40|$|Liver homogenates from {{mice and}} from rabbits {{transfer}} glucose from UDP-[6 - 3 H]glucose, at pH 7. 0, to oestradiol- 17 α, oestradiol- 17 β, oestradiol- 17 α 3 -glucuronide, p-nitrophenol and <b>diethylstilboestrol.</b> In the rabbit the phenolic steroids were better substrates than p-nitrophenol for the glucosyltransferase, whereas the reverse {{was true in}} the mouse. At pH 8. 0, rabbit liver, but not mouse liver, transferred glucose to oestradiol- 17 α 3 -glucuronide in better yield than that at pH 7. 0. Evidence is presented {{for the presence of}} two glucosyltransferases in rabbit liver. One of these has a pH optimum at about 8. 0, and is highly specific for oestradiol- 17 α 3 -glucuronide, whereas the other, which has a pH optimum at about 7. 0, is similar in this respect to the transferase in mouse liver...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the powerful synthetic oestrogen diethylstilboestrol[Dodds, Golberg, Lawson & Robinson, 1938] was quickly followed by the demonstration [Noble, 1938 a, 1939 a] that treatment with this material produces, in rats, the signs of apparent pituitary dysfunction (e. g. atrophy of the gonads and accessory sex organs, and inhibition of growth) associated with excessive treatment with natural oestrogen in this species. Noble[1938 b, 1939 b], applying the technique introduced by Deanesly & Parkes [1937], showed that the implantation of crystals or tablets of pure di-ethylstilboestrol could also induce alterations {{in the rate of}} body growth, and in endocrine function. The action of <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> with respect to the gonads was to some extent reversible, in that after treatment with the synthetic oestrogen the ovary of the female rat could still respond to the influence of gonadotrophic preparations. Dr A. S. Parkes, F. R. S., suggested to us that a relatively simple test object for the assay of pituitary growth-promoting extracts might be pro¬ vided by the rat whose growth had been inhibited by the implantation of tablets of solid <b>diethylstilboestrol.</b> Such a preparation would have obvious advantages, in that the technique of implanting tablets is much easier than that of hypophysectomy, and young rats of either sex could be used. The latter point would be of importance in a laboratory in which hypophys¬ ectomized rats were not easily available, as the usual method of assay employing intact rats requires adult female animals whose weight curves have risen to a 'plateau ' at 170 - 200 g., of which the supply is necessarily limited. We have accordingly investigated the possibility of using, for the assay of growth hormone, the young male rat stunted by the implantation of tablets of the artificial oestrogen. Increase in body weight, and elongation of the tail length as an indicator of skeletal growth [Freud & Levie, 1938; Freud, Levie & Kroon, 1939], have been compared as criteria of growth...|$|E
