5|$|A 2011 study {{proposed}} the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from the Tibetan Plateau {{with a narrow}} white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali's swift, A. salimali, the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth's swift, A. leuconyx, and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia, characterised by a green iridescence and shallow tail fork, is split as Cook's swift, A. cooki. The remaining subspecies are the nominate A. p. pacificus and the southern race A. p. kurodae (which includes the Tibetan population formerly named as kanoi). This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2012 paper showed that cooki {{is closely related to}} the <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift,</b> A. acuticauda, which should therefore be included in the pacificus clade, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conservation}} area or habitat in the Phobhjikha Valley, established in 2003 has, {{not only the}} black-necked cranes, but also 13 other vulnerable species such as rufous-necked hornbill Aceros nipalensis, chestnut-breasted partridge Arborophila mandellii, Pallas's fish eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus, nuthatch Sitta Formosa, wood snipe Gallinago nemoricola, Blyth's tragopan Tragopan blythii, greater spotted eagle Clanga clanga, imperial eagle Aquila heliaca, Baer's pochard Aythya baeri, Hodgson's bushchat Saxicola insignis, <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> Apus acuticauda, and grey-crowned prinia Prinia cinereocapilla. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid February. They feed on the particular type of dwarf bamboos that grow in the wetlands of the valley. The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for {{a large number of}} cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres. However, Palje [...] "Benjie" [...] Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus acuticauda) is {{a species}} of swift in the family Apodidae.It is found in Bhutan and Northeast India and is a vagrant to Thailand.Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|Fauna {{found here}} include the tiger, leopard, sambar, barking deer, Malayan giant squirrel, Himalayan black bear, serow, hoolock gibbon, rhesus macaque, Hume's pheasant, kalij pheasant, grey partridge, hill myna, and <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift.</b> Cases of Hunting and {{poaching}} {{have been reported}} in Murlen National Park.|$|E
50|$|Lengteng {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of animal species {{including}} birds. The most notable birds are the <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift,</b> grey sibia, Mrs. Hume's pheasant, grey peacock pheasant, Oriental pied hornbill, rufous-bellied eagle, and white-naped yuhina. Blyth’s tragopan was also reported from a survey in 2011. Common animal species include tiger, leopard, sambar deer, barking deer, goral, serow, hoolock gibbon, rhesus macaque and wild boars. An IUCN-classified vulnerable species of primate, northern pig-tailed macaque is reported here.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{encircled by}} matted bamboo groves and other {{alluring}} vegetations. There are varieties of butterflies, including some rare species {{found in this}} region. The Farpak area in Phawngpui is a huge grassland adjacent to a cliff area where one can sight birds like peregrine falcon, Blyth's tragopan, sunbirds, grey sibia, golden-throated barbet, Mrs. Hume's pheasant, hornbill, <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift,</b> mountain bamboo partridge, black eagle and other birds. The very rare clouded leopard has been recorded in the Farpak area since 1997. There have been instances of wild orchids being stolen from Phawngpui, efforts are being taken to protect and conserve it.|$|E

5000|$|The Phawngpui National Park is {{the natural}} home of a {{wonderful}} range of birdlife including the rare Blyth's tragopan, falcon, sunbirds, <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift,</b> and Mrs. Hume's pheasant, which is the Mizoram state bird, and also rare animals like the mountain goat, slow loris, tiger, leopard, leopard cat, serow, goral, Asiatic black bear, stump-tailed macaque and capped langur. In 2000, rare bird species were recorded such as mountain bamboo partridge, oriental pied hornbill, purple cochoa, striped laughingthrush, grey sibia, black eagle and large-billed crow. The clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa was spotted and documented {{for the first time}} in 1997. [...] The landscape {{is the natural}} habitat of various grasses (in fact is the origin of the name, phawng in Lai dialect means [...] "meadow", and -pui is the suffix for [...] "great"). The steep slopes are covered by orchids and rhododendrons, with areas of bamboos.|$|E
50|$|The Phobjika Valley {{has several}} {{vulnerable}} {{species of birds}} in the Protected Conservation Area established in 2003. The most celebrated species of the region is the black-necked crane. The other vulnerable species are the chestnut-breasted partridge (Arborophila mandellii), wood snipe (Gallinago nemoricola), Blyth's tragopan (Tragopan blythii), greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), Baer's pochard (Aythya baeri), Hodgson's bushchat (Saxicola insignis), <b>dark-rumped</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus acuticauda), and grey-crowned prinia (Prinia cinereocapilla).The Conservation Area of 163 km2, which includes Gewogs of Phobji, Gangte and Bjena under the Wangdue Phodrang dzongkhag, has been leased out for Conservation Planning and Management to the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN), a non-governmental organization (NGO) set up in Bhutan in 1987 (legally incorporated in 1997). RSPN is involved {{not only in the}} conservation management of the black-necked cranes and their habitat but also in conducting research on public education and awareness, community empowerment for conservation, and integrated conservation and development programmes, including community-based ecotourism in the valley. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid-February.|$|E
