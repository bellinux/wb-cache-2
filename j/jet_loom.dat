40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{methodology}} aimed at improving the setting up of air-jet looms by clarifying the function which links different important variables involved in the setting procedure and by proposing a method to measure the quality of fabrics depending on the factor values. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed procedure is based on the use of a load sensor: the tension profile received from it is used to analyse the weft behaviour and, sometimes, to predict any quality problems. Because of the high number of variables influencing the set up, the factorial experiments have been used to develop the setting procedure. Numerical results have been analyzed by means of a regression analysis and an ANOVA analysis. Findings – Relationships among different variables and their influence {{on the quality of the}} fabric have been derived thanks to the use of a load sensor. Research limitations/implications – So far, the proposed procedure has been developed for air-jet looms and for a limited set of fabrics, but it could be adapted in other situations as well. Practical implications – Use of the proposed procedure allows practitioners to reduce cost and time of the setting up of air <b>jet</b> <b>looms.</b> High productivity of air <b>jet</b> <b>looms</b> could be thus better exploited also for producing small batches of products. Originality/value – The combination of the load sensor and the statistical analysis allowed the development of a systematic setting procedure for air-jet looms...|$|R

40|$|Loom Speed and Tension to Reduce Warp and Weft Breaks in Air Jet Weaving is a {{published}} article of the Textile Technology department. The {{study sought to}} identify correct values of loom speed and warp tension suitable for weaving 100 % cotton yarn on Dornier double beam Air <b>Jet</b> <b>Looms,</b> AWSE 2 /E type. The causes of warp breaks are, poor quality yarn, uncontrolled temperature and humidity, uncontrolled weaving tension and loom speed. The experiments were conducted to determine warp and weft breaks at i) varying warp tension (50 cN to 85 cN) and constant speed (560 rpm,), ii) at constant warp tension(80 cN) and different loom speed (520 to 560 rpm). The company where {{the study was conducted}} is referred to as ?Company A?. Temperature and relative humidity and were kept constant at 27 ? and 75 % respectively. The yarn quality was good (11 cN/tex), according to the Ulster Statistics standard levels which was the exact tenacity of the 30 tex yarn used at ?Company A?. The results showed that warp and weft breaks occur even if the maximum warp tension during weaving is lower than the breaking strength of the yarn. A combination of high loom speed (560 rpm) and high tension (80 cN) lead to increased breaks, but breaks become reduced with the reduction in tension to 70 cNeven if the machine speed was maintained at 560 rpm. Above that tension, warp breaks start to increase. The number of warp breaks was also found to increase with the loom speed. Weft breaks also occurred due to entanglement at low warp tension (50 cN). Adjustment of warp tension and loom speed can help to determine the optimum values of warp tension and loom speed to be used {{in order to reduce the}} number of warp breaks for individual Air <b>Jet</b> <b>Looms.</b> An equation to determine the number of warp breaks which can occur at a given warp tension was modelled. This equation[eq 4] can be used to provide very good estimations for initial setting of warp tension.

One {{of the sources}} of the noise is the collision of healds caused by shedding motion on a <b>jet</b> <b>loom.</b> It was clarified in our previous report that the sound caused by shedding motion was significantly connected with heald motion during a period of shedding motion. In this report, therefore, its frequency characteristic was investigated using a Short Time Fourier Transform in order to relate the sound to the heald motion in a period of shedding motion. Power spectrum of sound showed a feature near the upper dead point of shedding motion when healds collided the heald bar.

In this report, therefore, the high response sound measuring system was arranged in order to obtain the time chart of sound pressure level caused by healds during shedding motion. High-speed video-camera was also used in order to observe the healds motion. It was clarified that the noise was significantly connected with healds motion during shedding motion.

The effect of these factors on the wetting, wicking and air permeability (AP) of the fabric samples was analysed. It was revealed that the fabric weave design and picking sequence has statistically significant effect on fabric wetting time, water spreading speed and AP of the fabric. It was found that fabrics woven in twill weave design and with simultaneous 3 PI give significantly better AP, shorter wetting time and better water spreading rate as compared to plain woven fabrics and those with double or SPI.

40|$|An air <b>jet</b> <b>loom</b> {{equipped}} with a profile reed and sub-nozzles is able to weave wider fabrics at higher speed than other types. A study {{on the characteristics of}} airflow and behavior of the weft yam in the weft passage area of the profile reed during inserting the weft yam is very important. The velocity distributions of airflow issued from a sub-nozzle in the weft passage were measured in detail by a hot-wire anemometer. The motion of a weft yarn in the weft passage was also observed by photography. The experimental results indicate that the shape of the lower jaw part of the profile reed affects positions of the maximum velocity of the air jet in a cross-section until the air jet runs {{into the bottom of the}} reed. When the front side of the profile reed is closed, the value of the maximum velocity in the weft passage is smaller than that under the normal condition because of increasing of flow leakage behind the profile reed. The position of the maximum velocity in the weft passage is found to coincide with the position of the maximum leakage from the profile reed. It is confirmed by photograph that a yam tip is led through the weft passage by the jet issued from a sub-nozzle. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|E
30|$|Whip roller {{settings}} in a weaving machine {{is one of}} the vital factor to adjust warp yarn tension properly as well as delivering fault free fabric. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore the influence of whip roller settings on various physical and mechanical properties of both grey and finished 100 % cotton denim fabric in order to select suitable position of whip roller for producing particular (3 / 1 twill) denim fabric. For this purpose total eight positions of whip roller were selected keeping constant depth with variable height in five cases and constant height with variable depth in three cases. The samples were produced in an air <b>jet</b> <b>loom</b> and some prominence like EPcm, PPcm, areal density, tensile strength, dimensional stability, air permeability, crimp% and skewness were checked. Data analysis of all the results showed that with the ascendance of whip roller, crimp% of warp yarn was decreased whereas crimp% of weft yarn was increased both in grey and finished state. Decreasing the depth of whip roller caused increment of both warp and weft crimp% in both state. Tensile strength in warp way direction was found to increase gradually up to a certain roller height and then decreased whereas air permeability showed reverse trend in both state. Warp density, Weft density as well as areal density was also affected by the alteration in settings of whip roller. Due to reduction of roller depth, warp way tensile strength and lengthwise shrinkage were reduced but air permeability had improved.|$|E
40|$|In {{this basic}} {{research}} {{for improving the}} performance of main nozzle of an air <b>jet</b> <b>loom</b> with a modified reed and auxiliary nozzles, {{the relation between the}} length of an acceleration tube and jet flow characteristics for 2 ∼ 6 kgf/cm 2 tank pressures has been eamined within both subsonic and supersonic regions of jet speed. Further, the weft drag force by the main nozzle has been measured. The results are as follows : (1) The distributions of jet speed in the subsonic flow region are little affected by acceleration tube length of the nozzle (2) In the supersonic flow region, some effects of the tube length are founded. For nozzles with the accerelation tube length L≥ 70 mm, expansion waves are generated at the nozzle exit, on the other hand, for a nozzle with L= 50 mm, compression shock waves occur. (3) In the supersonic flow region, the generation of expansion waves for nozzles withL= 70 mm causes an abrupt increase in jet diameter and a reduction of the flow speed. However for a nozzle with L= 50 mm, significant changes in jet diameter and speed can not be observed owing to the genenration of compression shock waves. (4) The weft drag force is strongly affected by the flow through an accerelation tube. The drag force is smaller as the accerelation tube length becomes shorter. 　　　本研究では, 変形おさ補助ノズル方式エァジェットルームのメインノズルの性能を向上させる基礎的研究として加速管長と噴流の空気流動特性の関係を検討した。得られた結果は次のとおりである.
