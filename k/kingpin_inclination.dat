5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. <b>Kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the <b>kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|E
40|$|The front double {{wishbone}} suspension parameters are related as a multi-body model. By replacing the new suspension and steering hard points, {{the performance of}} the suspension system is studied using CATIA and MSC ADAMS software for modeling and analyzing, respectively. In this case two tests were done, steady state circular test in ADAMS/View and parallel wheel travel in ADAMS/Car. The strut position is directly related to <b>Kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> angle and scrub radius. The increase the amount of these two parameters has an effect on steering performance in low speed and negative displacement, such as camber, caster and <b>Kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> angles in negative displacement of wheels. Moreover, the same tests in rear {{double wishbone}} suspension show that the growth has no effect on camber, caster and <b>Kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> angles. So, the major effect of this geometry is on the front independent suspension. In this project, the details were selected on electric vehicle (EV) for kinematics analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{performance}} of Hiper Strut suspension and find out the factors which affect its performance, a simulation model of Hiper Strut suspension was established based on Adams/Car and a kinematics optimization was carried out based on Adams/Insight. The result shows that both of its caster angle and <b>kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> angle change only a little during the parallel wheel travel simulation test. After modifying the coordinate values of some hard points which were found out by using Adams/Insight, the suspension gets a better performance. The established model and optimization could be a foundation for further study of this new suspension...|$|E
40|$|As {{long as a}} tire steers about a titled kingpin pivot, {{the point}} coming {{in contact with the}} road moves along its perimeter. This {{movement}} affects the determination of kingpin moments caused by the tire forces, especially for large steering angles. The movement, however, has been neglected in the literature on the steerable-tire-kinematics-related topics. In this investigation, the homogeneous transformation is employed to develop a kinematic model of a steering tire in which the instantaneous ground-contact point on the tire is considered. The moments about the kingpin axis caused by tire forces are then computed based on the kinematics. A four-wheel-car model is constructed for determining the kingpin moment of steering system during the low-speed cornering maneuver. The result shows that the displacement of the ground-contact point along the tire perimeter is significant for large steering angles. It also indicates that, at the low-speed cornering, the moment about the kingpin axis caused by vertical forces benefits self-centering while those caused by longitudinal forces, lateral forces, and &# 039;aligning&# 039; torques facilitate the turn. A parameter study is also conducted to visualize the effects of wheel alignment parameters on the kingpin moment. It appears that an increase in kingpin offset or a decrease in caster angle affects the kingpin moment such that it supports the self-centering. The effects of <b>kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> and caster trail on the moment, however, depend on the amplitude of steering angle. The result is compared to those derived from a multi-body model for validation...|$|E
