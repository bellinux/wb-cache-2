25|$|Early covered {{resonators}} {{with glass}} <b>frit</b> <b>seals</b> were unstable because contaminants outgassed from the sealing material. To overcome this, getters were {{built into the}} cavities. Getters are materials that can absorb gas and contaminants after cavities are sealed. However, getters can also release contaminants and can be costly, so their use in this application is being discontinued in favor of cleaner cover bonding processes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaser glass <b>frit</b> <b>sealing</b> is a {{joining method}} predestined in {{electronics}} for the sealing of engineered materials housings in dimensions of some 1 mm 2 to several 10 mm 2. The application field ranges from encapsulation of display panels to sensor housings. Laser glass <b>frit</b> <b>sealing</b> enables a hermetical closure excluding humidity and gas penetration. But the seam quality is also interesting for other applications requiring a hermetical sealing. One application is the encapsulation of vacuum insulation glass. The gap between two panes must be evacuated {{for reducing the}} thermal conductivity. Only an efficient encapsulating technique ensures durable tight joints of two panes for years. Laser glass <b>frit</b> <b>sealing</b> is an alternative joining method even though the material properties of soda lime glass like sensitivity to thermal stresses are much higher as known from engineered materials. An adapted thermal management of the process is necessary to prevent the thermal stresses within the pane to achieve crack free and tight glass frit seams...|$|R
50|$|Many {{devices are}} molded {{out of an}} epoxy plastic that {{provides}} adequate protection of the semiconductor devices, and mechanical strength to support the leads and handling of the package. Some devices, intended for high-reliability or aerospace or radiation environments, use ceramic packages, with metal lids that are brazed on after assembly, or a glass <b>frit</b> <b>seal.</b> All-metal packages are often used with high power (several watts or more) devices, since they conduct heat well and allow for easy assembly to a heat sink. Often the package forms one contact for the semiconductor device. Lead materials must be chosen with a thermal coefficient of expansion to match the package material.|$|R
40|$|Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) {{adopted in}} TV sets and {{computer}} monitors represent a consistent portion of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). In {{comparison with the}} recycling of WEEE such as refrigerators or washing machines, the recovery process for CRT containing devices is very difficult. CRTs are composed of four types of glass (panel, funnel, neck and <b>frit</b> <b>seal)</b> with different compositions. Furthermore, dangerous substances are contained within (i. e. lead, barium, strontium and fluorescent dust). Hence, the need to define robust processes for the design and implementation of efficient facilities for CRT cutting arises. This work describes steps guiding the design and the experimental optimal setting of a prototype facility for water-jet cutting of CRTs, {{in order to obtain}} recyclable high quality glass. Initially, a version of the cutting facility with manual movement of the cutting tool is set, in order to evaluate expectable cutting results. Subsequently, a detailed setting of automated movement of the cutting tool is carried out, in order {{to improve the quality of}} obtainable glass. As a consequence, a water-jet cutting facility which guarantees the cutting of high quality CRTs is finally set and a prototype is implemented...|$|R
40|$|A new {{interdigital}} {{design for}} large area dye solar modules is developed for {{an area of}} 30 x 30 cm(2). This design requires fewer holes in the glass substrate for electrolyte filling, than the conventional strip design. A complete manufacturing process of this module-ranging from screen printed layers to semi-automated colouring and electrolyte filling-in a laboratory-scale baseline is illustrated. As primary sealing method, a durable glass <b>frit</b> <b>sealing</b> is used. It is shown, that the lead (Pb) content present in many glass frit powders contaminates the catalytic platinum electrode during the sintering process, resulting in a lowering of the fill factor. A screen printable lead-free glass frit paste is developed, which solves this problem. Long term stability tests are presented on 2. 5 cm(2) dye solar cells, which have been completely sealed with glass fit. In consecutively performed accelerated ageing tests under 85 degrees C in the dark (about 1400 h) and continuous illumination with visible light (1 sun, about 1700 h), a 2. 5 cm(2) dye solar cell with an electrolyte based on propylmethylimidazolium iodide showed an overall degradation of less than 5 % in conversion efficiency. In a subsequently performed thermal cycling test (- 40 degrees C to + 85 degrees C, 50 cycles) a 2. 5 cm(2) dye solar cell with the same electrolyte composition also showed only a slight degradation of less than 5 % in conversion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on tire outcome of a German network project {{conducted}} with 12 partners from universities and research institutes on the material development of dye solar cells (DSC). We give an overview {{in the field and}} evaluate the concept of monolithic DSC further with respect to upscaling and producibility oil glass substrates. We have developed a manufacturing process for monolithic DSC modules which is entirely based on screen printing. Similar to our previous experience gained in the sealing of standard DSC, the encapsulation of the modules is achieved in a fusing step by soldering of glass frit layers. For use in monolithic DSC, a platinum free, conductive counter electrode layer, showing a charge transfer resistance of R-CT< 1. 5 Omega cm(2), has been realized by firing a graphite/carbon black composite under an inert atmosphere. Glass <b>frit</b> <b>sealed</b> monolithic test cells have been prepared using this platinum free material. A solar efficiency of 6 % on a 2. 0 cm(2) active cell area has been achieved in this case. Various types of non-volatile imidazolium-based binary ionic liquid electrolytes have been synthesized and optimized with respect to diffusion-limited currents and charge transfer resistances in DSC. In addition, quasi-solid-state electrolytes have been successfully tested by applying inorganic (SiO 2) physical gelators. For the use in semi-transparent DSC modules, a polyol process has been developed which resulted in tire preparation of screen printed transparent catalytic platinum layers showing an extremely low charge transfer resistance (0 - 25 Omega cm(2)) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the physical and microwave properties of ocean foam. Special foam generators were designed and fabricated, using porous glass sheets, known as glass frits, as the principal element. The glass <b>frit</b> was <b>sealed</b> into a water-tight vertical box, a few centimeters from the bottom. Compressed air, applied to the lower chamber, created ocean foam from sea water lying on the frit. Foam heights of 30 cm were readily achieved, with relatively low air pressures. Special photographic techniques and analytical procedures were employed to determine foam bubble size distributions. In addition, the percentage water content of ocean foam was determined {{with the aid of}} a particulate sampling procedure. A glass frit foam generator, with pore diameters in the range 70 - 100 micrometers, produced foam with bubble distributions very similar to those found on the surface of natural ocean foam patches...|$|R
40|$|The RF excited 2 to 3 W CW CO 2 {{waveguide}} lasers with lifetimes of {{the order}} of 10 (4) to 2. 10 (4) hours were produced. This was achieved with CO and N 2 bearing gas mixtures and with internal as well as external discharge electrodes. It is noted that these tests were conducted with unstabilized lasers which drift around in their signatures. The average power output was reduced to about one half of the highest peak power output in the signature. One of the lasers, no. 1. 1, still shows 60 % of its original output power after it was cycled on and off every 10 minutes for more than 50, 000 times. The starting voltage and driving point impedance of the RF excited gas discharge structure for different gas pressures and mixtures were measured. These data will serve as a basis for the matching and starting network optimization. The second laser body was <b>frit</b> and indium <b>sealed.</b> To our a vacuum leak between the bore and electrode holes was noted. The leak seems to be due to a defect or crack in the BeO body...|$|R
