The early warning system installed in 1999 measures the river level using radar and sends the level to the Network Control Centre at Wellington Railway Station via a RF link to Waiouru and then via the signalling network to Wellington. If the river changes level, an alarm is triggered which alerts staff to the fact. If the level is of a significant risk, the Control Centre sets the signals {{either side of the}} Tangiwai bridge to danger and warns trains in the area to stay clear by radio. The system is failsafe {{and if there is a}} problem with the system it automatically sends a <b>fault</b> <b>signal</b> to the Control Centre. In this instance, trains in the area are restricted to 25 km/h and told to take extreme care over the Tangiwai Bridge. Since 2002, it has also been backed-up by the Eastern Ruapehu Lahar Alarm and Warning System (ERLAWS).|$|E

40|$|Sparse signal {{representations}} attract {{much attention}} {{in the community of}} signal processing because only a few coefficients are required to represent a signal and these coefficients make the signal understandable. For bearing faults’ diagnosis, bearing <b>faults</b> <b>signals</b> collected from transducers are often overwhelmed by strong low-frequency periodic signals and heavy noises. In this paper, a joint signal processing method is proposed to extract sparse envelope coefficients, which are the sparse signal representations of bearing <b>fault</b> <b>signals.</b> Firstly, to enhance bearing <b>fault</b> <b>signals,</b> particle swarm optimization is introduced to tune the parameters of wavelet transform and the optimal wavelet transform is used for retaining one of the resonant frequency bands. Thus, sparse wavelet coefficients are obtained. Secondly, to reduce the in-band noises existing in the sparse wavelet coefficients, an adaptive morphological analysis with an iterative local maximum detection method is developed to extract sparse envelope coefficients. Simulated and real bearing <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> are investigated to illustrate how the sparse envelope coefficients are extracted. The results show that the sparse envelope coefficients can be used to represent bearing fault features and identify different localized bearing faults...|$|R

The similar gate drive circuit, when adopted for NPC three level converter protection, leads to false V-CE <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> for inner devices of the leg.

Moreover, this method endows {{the parameters of the}} spectrum with definite physical meanings including width, maximum singular index, minimum singular index, and corresponding singularity index of the extreme point. Therefore, this method can be applied to characterize the internal dynamic mechanism of the soft <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> of nonlinear analog circuits, making it suitable for the feature extraction of fault circuits.

30|$|A new fault {{detection}} scheme {{has been developed}} for switched T-S fuzzy systems such that the generated residual {{is designed to be}} sensitive to <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> for the faulty cases, while it is robust against the disturbances for the fault-free case. Since the <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> and disturbance inputs are considered to be in a finite frequency domain, an additional slack matrix variable Q in Lemma  4 has been introduced to reduce the conservatism. Therefore, compared to the method [32] in the full frequency domain, it is shown that the generated residuals are more sensitive to <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> and more robust against the disturbances, and hence, the faults are easier to detect. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that the LMIs solved in (81) could be very complex, which may make the computation very costly. The degree of complexity depends on the dimensions of the considered systems, the number of switching modes, and the number of IF-THEN rules in T-S fuzzy systems.|$|R
40|$|Immediate {{detection}} and diagnosis of existing faults and faulty behaviour of electrical motors using electrical signals {{is one of}} the important interests of the power industry. Motor current signature analysis is a modern approach to diagnose faults of induction motors. This thesis investigates the significance of propagated fault signatures through distributed power systems, aiming at explaining and quantifying different observations of <b>faults</b> <b>signals</b> and hence diagnoses machine faults with a higher accuracy. Electrical indicators of faults, unlike other fault indicators, (e. g. vibration signals), propagate all over the network. Therefore <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> may be manipulated by operation of neighbouring motors and the system‘s environmental noise. Both simulation and practical results clearly demonstrate the signal interference and hence confusion in diagnosis due to presence of a faulty motor nearby. Thus a knowledge based system is necessary to understand the meaning of the signals manifested at various parts of the distributed power system. On another side, taking into account that <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> are travelling all over the network, several observations can be made for events in the network. In this thesis the idea of cross evaluation of <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> considering signal propagation will be discussed and analysed. The research attempts to improve diagnosis reliability with a simple and viable framework of decision making. The thesis scope is limited to monitoring behaviour of induction motors in distributed power systems. These types of electrical motors are the main load of most industries. In this thesis, existing formulations of fault signatures would not be significantly disturbed, as distributed diagnosis can fit into an existing framework of current signature analysis. The research takes advantage of multiple areas of study to formulate propagation of <b>fault</b> <b>signals</b> while they are travelling in a scaled down distributed power system. ...|$|R

40|$|Immediate {{detection}} and diagnosis of existing faults and faulty behavior of electrical motors using electrical signals {{is an important}} interest of the power industry. Motor current signature analysis is a modern approach to diagnose faults of induction motors. The approach has some shortcomings that limit the accuracy of diagnosis. It is very vulnerable to the environmental noise, voltage harmonics, and operation of non-linear equipment. Particularly operation of other similar motors nearby may result in wrong warnings being signaled. As a result interpreting current signals usually requires extra calculation and considerations. This paper investigates the significance of propagated fault signatures through distributed power systems.
