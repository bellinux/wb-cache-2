After 30  minutes of baseline fasting manometry and EGG, subjects received saline intravenously, atropine (0. 6  mg then 0. 25  mg/hour intravenously), or bethanechol (5  mg subcutaneously). This was followed by another 30  minutes' recording and by three hours of postprandial recording after ingestion of a technetium- 99 m labelled solid meal.  RESULTS—During fasting, atropine decreased, whereas bethanechol increased, the antral manometric motility index and EGG power. Postprandially, atropine decreased the amplitude of antral contractions by DAS, decreased the postprandial antral manometric motility index, and slowed gastric emptying. Atropine caused a slight increase in postprandial frequency of antral contractions by DAS and gastric myoelectrical activity by EGG. Bethanechol slightly increased the amplitude, but slightly decreased the frequency of antral contractions by DAS and decreased the frequency of gastric myoelectrical activity by EGG, with no significant increase in the motility index or gastric emptying.  CONCLUSIONS—Cholinergic antagonism with atropine reduces antral contractility and slows gastric emptying. Cholinergic stimulation with bethanechol increases antral contractility, but decreases the frequency of antral contractions, without altering the antral motility index or gastric emptying.    Keywords: atropine; bethanechol; gastric motility; gastric scintigraphy; <b>electrogastrograph...</b>|$|E
