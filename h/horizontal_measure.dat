40|$|We {{prove that}} closed {{negatively}} curved locally symmetric spaces are locally characterized up to isometry by the Lyapunov spectra of the periodic orbits of their geodesic flows. This {{is done by}} constructing a new invariant measure for the geodesic flow that we {{refer to as the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure.</b> We show that the Lyapunov spectrum of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure</b> alone suffices to locally characterize these locally symmetric spaces up to isometry. We associate to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure</b> a new invariant, the horizontal dimension. We tie this invariant to extensions of curvature pinching rigidity theorems for complex hyperbolic manifolds to pinching rigidity theorems for the Lyapunov spectrum. Our methods extend to give rigidity theorems for smooth flows obtained as perturbations of the geodesic flows of these locally symmetric spaces. The techniques developed in this paper are focused on the symmetric spaces of nonconstant negative curvature and extend many methods used to prove rigidity theorems for uniformly quasiconformal Anosov diffeomorphisms and flows.

40|$|Measurements {{reveal that}} about 4 % to 11 % of {{residential}} electricity consumption {{is due to}} standby. Organised efforts to measure and reduce standby power consumption have been under way {{for more than a}} decade. However, the nature of standby and the policies to address standby power consumption need to change. With regard to policies, it has been the assumption for many years that a voluntary approach is faster, more flexible and less costly than a regulatory approach. However, experiences with voluntary agreements have not always lived up to expectations and revealed drawbacks with voluntary agreements which aim to reduce standby power. Regarding the nature of standby, fewer products now have a single simple standby mode, (e. g. the remote control of a TV) as the advent of advanced electronics and complex control systems now means that there are often several more complex modes where the functionality can change in real time. This paper describes the next generation of approaches to deal with standby power: on one hand the horizontal approach, which targets the simple standby mode for as many products as possible. On the other hand the power management approach tries to deal with complex standby situations to ensure that the product moves into the lowest power consumption state possible for the required task. Both approaches will be illustrated with examples, from the EU ecodesign framework directive, which is being considered for use as a regulatory framework for a <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure</b> on standby, and from the EU Code of Conduct for Digital TV Services Systems which is a voluntary measure for a more complex product...|$|E

40|$|Pressure ulcer {{incidence}} {{rates have}} remained constant despite advances in support surface technology. Interface shear stress {{is recognized as}} {{a risk factor for}} pressure ulcer development and is the focus of many shear reduction technologies incorporated into wheelchair cushions; however, shear reduction has not been quantified in the literature. We evaluated 21 commercial wheelchair seat cushions using a new methodology developed to quantify interface shear stress, interface pressure, and horizontal stiffness. Interface shear stress increased significantly with applied horizontal indenter displacement, while no significant difference was found for interface pressure. Material of construction resulted in significant differences in interface shear stress, interface pressure, and horizontal stiffness. This study shows that the existing International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16840 - 2 <b>horizontal</b> stiffness <b>measure</b> provides similar information to the new <b>horizontal</b> stiffness <b>measure.</b> The lack of a relationship between interface shear stress and the overall <b>horizontal</b> stiffness <b>measure,</b> however, suggests that a pressure and shear force sensor should be used with the ISO 16840 - 2 <b>horizontal</b> stiffness <b>measure</b> to fully quantify a cushion's ability to reduce interface shear stress at the patient's bony prominences...|$|R

40|$|<b>Horizontal</b> and {{vertical}} <b>measures</b> of inequality are related through mobility. The paper {{draws attention to}} two types of mobility: quantity mobility, which refers to mobility in income itself, and rank mobility, which refers to mobility in the position {{in the distribution of}} income. Individually matched census data for earnings in Israel are used to illustrate these concepts empirically. Mobility is measured between 1983 and 1995. It is shown that earnings in Israel are highly mobile. The high degree of earnings mobility implies that <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> of inequality considerably overstate the underlying level of inequality. The method of errors in variables is used to distinguish between current and permanent mobility and inequality. Permanent earnings are more equal than current earnings and less mobile. Finally, the methodology is applied to PSID. It is shown that earnings were more mobile in Israel than in the United States. Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
