50|$|For a transmitter, the attack-time {{delay is}} defined as the {{interval}} from the instant the transmitter is keyed-on to the instant the transmitted RF signal amplitude has increased to a specified level, usually 90% of its <b>key-on</b> steady-state value. The transmitter attack-time delay excludes the time required for automatic antenna tuning.|$|E
40|$|Very little {{information}} {{is known about}} the impact electrification has on driving behavior, or how drivers charge their electrified vehicles. The recent influx of electrified vehicles presents a new market of vehicles which allow drivers the option between electrical or conventional gasoline energy sources. The current battery capacity in full battery electric vehicles requires planning of routes not required of conventional vehicles, due to the limited range, extended charging times, and limited charging infrastructure. There is currently {{little information}} on how drivers react to these limitations. A number of current models of fully electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, transmit data wirelessly on <b>key-on,</b> key-off, and charging events. The data includes battery state of charge, distance of miles driven on gasoline and electric, energy consumed, and many other parameters associated to driving and charging behavior. In this thesis, this data was then processed and analyzed to benchmark the performance and characteristics of driving and charging patterns. Vehicles were analyzed and contrasted based on model type, geographic location, length of ownership and other variables. This data was able to show benchmarks and parameters in aggregate for 56 weeks of electrified vehicle tracking. These parameters were compared to the EV Project, a large scale electrified vehicle study performed by Idaho National Labs, to confirm patterns of expected behavior. New parameters which were not present in the EV Project were analyzed and provided insight to charging and driving behavior not examined in any previous study on a large scale. This study provides benchmarks and conclusions on this new driving behavior, such as large scale analysis of brake regeneration performance and degradation of range anxiety. Analysis of the differences on charging and driving behavior between geographic regions and experience were examined, providing insight to how these variables affect performance and driving and charging patterns. Comparison of parameters established by the EV Project and new parameters analyzed in this report will help build a benchmark for future studies of electrified vehicles. M. S...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis is {{concerned}} with the modelling, analysis and control of novel mechatronic valve actuators for automotive systems, specifically, the control of the mechanical valves to intake and exhaust gases in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Scientific studies have shown that significant benefits in terms of engine efficiency and emissions can be obtained through the adoption of variable valve actuation. Current engine technology are based on the use of a mechanical driven camshaft, which is a no flexible device due to its strongly coupling to crankshaft position. Thus, {{it is not possible to}} adjust or adapt in real time the valve features according to the engine working conditions. Hence, there is the need of designing innovative mechanisms to actuate the engine valves. In so doing, traditional mechanical cam systems can be removed and a train of single actuated valves is incorporated into the ICE, leading to the development of camless engine technology. Electro-Mechanical Valve Actuators (EMVA) have been considered as one of the most promising technological solutions to develop this novel engine technology. To achieve all the potential benefits of the EMVA systems, two crucial control problems have to be tackled and solved efficiently: the control of the first lift manoeuvre, known as First Catching Control (FCC) problem, and the control of the valve seating velocity, known as Soft Landing Control (SLC) problem. The thesis shows that the analysis and control of the EMVA device can be successfully addressed in the framework of non-smooth dynamical system and nonlinear control theory, furthermore, the tuning of non linear controllers can be successfully done by using closed loop bifurcation diagram analysis. In particular, a non-smooth mathematical model is proposed, estimated and validated experimentally. A novel <b>Key-on</b> controller is proposed to solve the FCC control problem, while a combined feedforward-sliding mode controller is proposed to solve the SLC control problem. The proposed control approaches have been tested numerically and validated on an experimental setup, leading to successful results...|$|E
