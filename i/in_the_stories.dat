5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> he narrates, the Baron {{is shown}} as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself.
