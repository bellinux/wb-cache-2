5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with <b>feathering</b> on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{appearance}} of the Saluki is one of grace and symmetry. Two coat types—smooth and feathered—are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light <b>feathering</b> {{on the back of}} the legs and thighs. The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds.|$|E
5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no undercoat. <b>Feathering</b> of the fur {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and {{on the back of}} the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E

5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen <b>feathering,</b> molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), <b>feathering</b> on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and <b>feathering</b> on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E
40|$|<b>Feather</b> pecking is {{a problem}} in {{commercial}} laying hens, particularly in loose-housing systems, where many hens can be affected by only a few <b>feather</b> peckers. In addition, <b>feather</b> pecking can become an even larger problem if it spreads throughout the flock. There are several possible ways that <b>feather</b> pecking may spread. The simplest way is that one hen may damage the <b>feathers</b> of a hen, and another hen may find the damaged <b>feathers</b> an attractive pecking target. The aim of this experiment was to determine if damaged <b>feathers</b> were feather-pecked more than undamaged <b>feathers</b> on the same body area, and to determine whether some types of feather-body area manipulations were preferred over others as pecking stimuli. Manipulations involved damaging the <b>feathers</b> on the rump, tail or belly of different hens, with two or three levels of severity of manipulation at each body area. Sixteen groups of 11 Lohmann Brown hens between 26 and 28 weeks were observed with the recipient, the <b>feather</b> pecker and the body area that was pecked all being recorded. The <b>feather</b> pecks were classified separately as either gentle or severe. Damaged <b>feathers</b> received significantly more severe <b>feather</b> pecks than undamaged <b>feathers.</b> There were also more gentle <b>feather</b> pecks to damaged <b>feathers,</b> although this did not reach statistical significance. The feather-body area manipulations that received the greatest number of severe <b>feather</b> pecks were the tail <b>feathers</b> when they were cut very short, the rump <b>feathers</b> when they were trimmed, and the rump when <b>feathers</b> were removed. These results support the suggestion that <b>feather</b> pecking does indeed spread through flocks by damaged <b>feathers</b> becoming an attractive target for feather-pecking behaviour. An unexpected result of performing the <b>feather</b> manipulations was an outbreak of cannibalism in half of the experimental groups. Even though there was no visible damage to the skin of the hens after having the <b>feathers</b> manipulated, 13 of the 16 attacked hens were wounded {{on the part of the}} body where the <b>feathers</b> had been damaged in some way...|$|R
50|$|The pin <b>feather</b> looks {{somewhat}} like a <b>feather</b> shaft. However, unlike a fully developed <b>feather,</b> the pin <b>feather</b> has a blood supply flowing through it. As such, if the pin <b>feather</b> is damaged, a bird can bleed heavily.|$|R
40|$|<b>Feathers,</b> {{unlike other}} {{cutaneous}} appendages such as hair, fur, or scales have a definite structure.

Collectively, <b>feather</b> structure determines the appearance of the <b>feather</b> coat, which can largely affect the resulting look of a <b>feathered</b> object (bird). In this paper we define the structure of individual <b>feathers</b> using a parameterization based on biological structure and substructures of actual <b>feathers.</b> We show that our parameterization can generate a large variety of <b>feathers</b> at multiple levels of detail and provide an initial step to semi-automatically generating {{a wide range of}} <b>feather</b> coats. This is achieved by specifying an intuitive interpolation between different structures and ages of <b>feathers.</b> 1...|$|R
5|$|There are {{physical}} {{differences between}} the show strains and working strains in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability and as such several physical differences have appeared. Working type dogs tend to be larger with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less <b>feathering.</b> The working strain {{seems to be more}} energetic than the show strain.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess <b>feathering.</b> Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like <b>feathering.</b> Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
40|$|The moult {{of birds}} could greatly perturb {{the life cycle}} of <b>feather</b> mites (Astigmata). These mites live on the surface of <b>feathers</b> and are {{unlikely}} to survive if they are on one when it is moulted. Therefore, we hypothesized that they would escape to other <b>feathers</b> to avoid this risk of mortality. We analysed the distribution of <b>feather</b> mites on the wings of 63 moulting individuals of 13 species of passerine birds. We used generalized linear mixed models to test whether the distribution of <b>feather</b> mites depends on the stage of moult of <b>feathers.</b> <b>Feather</b> mites were significantly less abundant on the next <b>feather</b> to fall out than on the other <b>feathers.</b> This ability to escape seems to be higher on primaries and secondaries than on tertials. At least on primaries, <b>feather</b> mites avoided not only the next <b>feather</b> to be moulted but also the second one. For primaries and secondaries the new full-grown <b>feathers</b> harboured more <b>feather</b> mites than those still growing.

50|$|The {{nature of}} the <b>feathers</b> {{preserved}} in the two immature Yixian specimens of Similicaudipteryx appeared to Xu and colleagues, who described the two <b>feathered</b> specimens, to change with age. The youngest specimen had relatively short primary <b>feathers</b> (those anchored to the hand) compared to its tail <b>feathers.</b> In the older specimen, the primary <b>feathers</b> were the same length as the tail <b>feathers,</b> and secondary <b>feathers</b> (those anchored to the lower arm) were also present. The primary <b>feathers</b> may have grown more slowly than the tail <b>feathers,</b> not reaching equal size until the animal was close to maturity, and the secondary <b>feathers</b> would not appear at all until this more mature stage. This suggests that the wing <b>feathers</b> had little use at a young age, only becoming fully developed with maturity.|$|R

5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish <b>feathering</b> of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and {{turquoise}} on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of the}} plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E
5|$|The coat of {{the breed}} {{come in a}} variety of shades with the colours being {{separated}} into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the <b>feathering</b> according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and <b>feathering</b> its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present new {{insights}} and promising directions for future research on <b>feather</b> pecking in laying hens. Our starting point was a multidisciplinary research program on <b>feather</b> pecking in The Netherlands, in which ethological, physiological, ontogenetic and genetic approaches were combined. The four topics addressed in this paper are: (1) the relation between gentle and severe <b>feather</b> pecking, (2) <b>feather</b> pecking and coping strategy, (3) causation of <b>feather</b> pecking, and (4) the possibility to solve the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking through genetic selection. When the relationship between gentle and severe <b>feather</b> pecking was studied, it was found that both forms of <b>feather</b> pecking are related at the same age. Gentle <b>feather</b> pecking at young age, however, could not be used as a predictor of <b>feather</b> pecking at adult age. Birds from high and low <b>feather</b> pecking lines that showed differences in <b>feather</b> pecking also differed in other behavioural and physiological characteristics. This may reflect line differences in coping strategy. Relating coping strategy with <b>feather</b> pecking may help us to better understand the motivations and characteristics underlying the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. On the causation of <b>feather</b> pecking, there is some evidence that it is redirected ground pecking, deriving either from a foraging or a dustbathing background. However, evidence was found that early <b>feather</b> pecking could also be interpreted as social exploration. Finally, the use of molecular genetics to help solving the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking seems promising. <b>Feather</b> pecking has been shown to be heritable and the first genetic regions (QTL) involved in <b>feather</b> pecking have been identified. To search for a solution for the <b>feather</b> pecking problem it is of importance to identify the mechanisms involved in the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. In this paper, we have combined approaches from different disciplines in order to study <b>feather</b> pecking. The results indicate that combined efforts of multidisciplinary research can be very useful in looking for possible ways to reduce <b>feather</b> pecking in practic...|$|R
25|$|However, Foth (2011) {{showed that}} some of these purported stages (stages 2 and 5 in particular) are likely simply {{artifacts}} of preservation caused by the way fossil <b>feathers</b> are crushed and the <b>feather</b> remains or imprints are preserved.

5|$|There is no {{indication}} of <b>feathering</b> on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E
5|$|Prior to , {{a flourishing}} trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, {{after the war}} began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an {{exception}} in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place {{until the end of}} the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the embargo was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The embargo created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way– from the US to Europe– to supply those needed in the war. The lack of <b>feathering</b> on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short <b>feathering</b> of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E
50|$|Fossil <b>feather</b> {{impressions}} {{are extremely}} rare and they require exceptional preservation conditions to form. Therefore, {{only a few}} <b>feathered</b> dinosaur genera have been identified. All fossil <b>feather</b> specimens {{have been found to}} show certain similarities. Due to these similarities and through developmental research, almost all scientists agree that <b>feathers</b> could only have evolved once in dinosaurs. <b>Feathers</b> would then have been passed down to all later, more derived species, unless some lineages lost <b>feathers</b> secondarily. If a dinosaur falls at a point on an evolutionary tree within the known feather-bearing lineages, then its ancestors had <b>feathers,</b> and {{it is quite possible that}} it did as well. This technique, called phylogenetic bracketing, can also be used to infer the type of <b>feathers</b> a species may have had, since the developmental history of <b>feathers</b> is now reasonably well-known. All <b>feathered</b> species had filamentaceous or plumaceous (downy) <b>feathers,</b> with pennaceous <b>feathers</b> found among the more bird-like groups.

40|$|The tedious task of {{manually}} placing <b>feathers</b> {{on computer}} animated objects involves aligning <b>feathers,</b> ensuring {{that they do}} not insect each other or penetrate the surface, deforming every <b>feather</b> to match the local surface features, and ensuring that the <b>feather</b> coat is consistent when the underlying object is animated. We present a technique for generating a <b>feather</b> coat over an object. <b>Feather</b> orientation is specified quickly and easily, <b>feathers</b> are deformed while ensuring collision prevention, and the coat can be animated. We create a vector field in the space surrounding the body object and deform <b>feathers</b> to align with the field lines. The non-intersection property of the field lines ensures that <b>feather</b> intersections are avoided. We provide a formulation of a suitable vector field and demonstrate that it is capable of producing realistic <b>feather</b> coats. The process can easily be integrated into the work-flow of standard modelling and animation processes.

25|$|<b>Feathers</b> were valued {{similarly}} to jade and turquoise in Mesoamerica.
