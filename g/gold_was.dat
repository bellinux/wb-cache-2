5|$|Rare was a {{prominent}} second-party developer for Nintendo in the 1990s, and their Killer Instinct series was produced as an exclusive partnership {{in response to the}} popularity of Mortal Kombat. Following the success of the 1995 Killer Instinct port for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Rare began a sequel for the same platform but transitioned development to its successor, the Nintendo64, upon its unveiling. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> scheduled as a launch title for the new console but was delayed until its North American release in November 1996. It was released in other regions in May 1997. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|That {{same year}} <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in California, rapidly accelerating migration to California. Reports {{commissioned by the}} federal government during this period uniformly downplayed the extent of indigenous land rights under Spanish and Mexican rule.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} {{colors of}} Kappa Pi <b>are</b> purple and <b>gold.</b> The original colors of lavender and old <b>gold</b> <b>were</b> {{adopted by the}} Alpha Chapter in 1911, but purple and <b>gold</b> <b>were</b> officially adopted at the first National Conference in 1934. Purple is used to represent sincerity, and <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> used to represent truth.|$|R
5|$|A {{piece of}} a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and {{interwoven}} with <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered in a noble's grave near Pirot in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries with a {{piece of a}} garment they had worn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Cripple Creek was {{the largest}} town in the gold-mining {{district}} that included the towns of Altman, Anaconda, Arequa, Goldfield, Elkton, Independence and Victor, about 20 miles from Colorado Springs on the southwest side of Pikes Peak. Surface <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered in the area in 1891, and within three years more than 150 mines were operating there.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gold</b> {{laundering}} <b>is</b> {{the process}} whereby illegally obtained <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> melted and recast into another form. The recasting is performed to obscure or conceal the true {{origin of the}} gold. The recast <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> then sold, thus laundering it into cash.|$|R

5|$|By 1792, Hamilton's {{principles}} {{were adopted}} by Congress, {{resulting in the}} Coinage Act of 1792, {{and the creation of}} the United States Mint. There was to be a ten-dollar Gold Eagle coin, a silver dollar, and fractional money ranging from one-half to fifty cents. The coining of silver and <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> issued by 1795.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns {{for the safety of}} the cargo during unloading, the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the Takelma Indians inhabited the Illinois Valley. Their culture was destroyed when <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered in the}} early 1850s, causing the subsequent Rogue River Wars. After an 1853 treaty, most of the Takelmas lived on the Table Rock Reservation. In 1856, after the wars ended, they were moved to the Grand Ronde Reservation and the Siletz Reservation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> also {{discovered}} in Southern California {{but on a}} much smaller scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E
5|$|Hosting the Olympic Winter Games for {{the first}} time, Japan's record {{consisted}} of a single medal: a silver in alpine skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics. In Sapporo, Yukio Kasaya, Akitsugu Konno, and Seiji Aochi won the ski jumping normal hill (70m) gold, silver, and bronze medal, respectively. Kasaya's <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> Japan's first-ever at the Winter Games. This result would persist as the country's best for the next 20 years.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gold</b> leaf <b>is</b> a type {{of metal}} leaf, but the term is rarely used when {{referring}} to gold leaf. The term metal leaf is normally used for thin sheets of metal of any color that do not contain any real <b>gold.</b> Pure <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> 24 karats. Real yellow <b>gold</b> leaf <b>is</b> about 91.7% pure gold. Silver colored white <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> approximately 50% pure gold.|$|R
5|$|In 1917, <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the founders}} of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, and was its first president. He would serve at Beth Jacob Anshe Sholom until 1919, moving to a pulpit in San Francisco. That year the {{congregation}} had 155 member families. Gold would emigrate to Palestine in 1935, and was {{one of the}} signatories of the Israeli Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, {{early in}} the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Denmark. To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue's and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia. In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.|$|E
5|$|Successful mining {{took time}} and capital, {{particularly}} once {{most of the}} timber around the Klondike had been cut down. A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($1.2 million) for wood to be burned to melt the ground, along with around $1,000 ($800,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($1.2 million) for ditches and up to $600 ($480,000) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600. The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> found, it was often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in California, and richer still than those in South Africa. In just two years, for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E
50|$|The highest karat {{version of}} rose <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> {{also known as}} crown <b>gold,</b> which <b>is</b> 22 karat. Eighteen karat red <b>gold</b> may <b>be</b> made of 25% copper and 75% gold. For 18 karat rose gold, {{typically}} about 4% silver is added to 75% gold and 21% copper to give a rose color. 14 karat red <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> often found in the Middle East and contains 41.67% copper.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gold</b> has <b>been</b> used {{as money}} for many reasons. It is fungible, {{with a low}} spread between the prices to buy and sell. <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> also easily transportable, as it has a high value to weight ratio, {{compared}} to other commodities, such as silver. <b>Gold</b> can <b>be</b> re-coined, divided into smaller units, or re-melted into larger units such as gold bars, without destroying its metal value. The density of <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> higher than most other metals, {{making it difficult to}} pass counterfeits. Additionally, <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> extremely unreactive, hence it does not tarnish or corrode over time.|$|R
5000|$|Cougar <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> an American Cheddar cheese {{produced}} at the Washington State University Creamery in Pullman, Washington. Like other cheeses {{sold at the}} creamery, Cougar <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> notable for being sold exclusively in 30oz tin cans. Cougar <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> a white, sharp cheddar that is aged at least one year. It has a nutty flavor somewhat resembling Swiss or Gouda. When properly refrigerated, Cougar <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> claimed to last indefinitely in the can. An unopened can becomes more flavorful, sharp, dry and crumbly with age. Approximately 250,000 cans of Cougar Cheese are produced annually, with around 80% of it being Cougar Gold.|$|R
5|$|Support for {{bimetallism}} {{grew in the}} 1870s, {{and resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike Gold Rush was a {{migration}} by {{an estimated}} 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike {{region of the}} Yukon in north-western Canada between 1896 and 1899. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in photographs, books, films, and artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The Little Applegate River's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled about 11,000 {{years ago by}} the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede Native American tribes. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the early 19th century. Two boomtowns—Sterlingville and Buncom—were founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly as gold and other precious metals were discovered. They slowly declined in population as the supply of <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed.|$|E
