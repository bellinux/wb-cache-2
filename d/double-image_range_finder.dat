With their {{significant}} features, {{the applications}} of {{complementary metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) image sensors covers a very extensive range, from industrial automation to traffic applications such as aiming systems, blind guidance, active/passive <b>range</b> <b>finders,</b> etc. In this paper CMOS image sensor-based active and passive <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> are presented. The measurement scheme of the proposed active/passive <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> {{is based on a}} simple triangulation method. The designed <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> chiefly consist of a CMOS image sensor and some light sources such as lasers or LEDs. The implementation cost of our <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> is quite low. Image processing software to adjust the exposure time (ET) of the CMOS image sensor to enhance the performance of triangulation-based <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> was also developed. An extensive series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the designed <b>range</b> <b>finders.</b> From the experimental results, the distance measurement resolutions achieved by the active <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> and the passive <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> can be better than 0. 6 % and 0. 25 % within the measurement ranges of 1 to 8 m and 5 to 45 m, respectively. Feasibility tests on applications of the developed CMOS image sensor-based <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> to the automotive field were also conducted. The experimental results demonstrated that our <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> are well-suited for distance measurements in this field. Sensors 2008, 8 172...|$|R

50|$|The laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> only detects the {{distance}} of one point in its direction of view. Thus, the scanner scans its entire field of view one point at a time by changing the <b>range</b> <b>finder's</b> direction of view to scan different points. The view direction of the laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> can be changed either by rotating the <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> itself, or by using a system of rotating mirrors. The latter method is commonly used because mirrors are much lighter and can thus be rotated much faster and with greater accuracy. Typical time-of-flight 3D laser scanners can measure {{the distance}} of 10,000~100,000 points every second.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{combination}} of a cheap single-point laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> (LRF) device and cameras has become increasingly useful in recent research and industrial applications. While the single dot laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> can only provide depth for a single pixel in the observed image, it’s cost and size can be useful for handheld devices or very lightweight robotic platforms. In this work, we propose two accurate calibration methods for determining the position {{and direction of the}} laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> with respect to the camera. Notably, we can determine the full calibration, even without observing the laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> observation point in the camera image. We evaluate both methods on synthetic and real data demonstrating their efficiency and good behavior under noise. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Urban Search and Rescue Simulation {{used for}} RoboCup lacks {{realistic}} response of laser <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> on smoke. In this paper, {{the behavior of}} a Hokuyo and Sick laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> in a smoky environment is studied. The behavior of the lasers is among others a function of the visibility level, and in this article this function is quantified into an explicit model. This model is implemented in a simulation environment which is the basis of the Virtual Robot competition of the RoboCup Rescue League. The behavior of both real and virtual laser <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> is compared in a number of validation tests. The validation tests show that the behavior of the laser <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> in the simulation is consistent with the real world. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{infrared}} <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> for {{a mobile}} robot has {{the advantages of}} the low sensing cost and detecting all objects in front of the mobile robot after sensing. However, it has some non-linear bias errors, the measurement data represents the Gaussian distribution, and the variance of measurement error in-creases in proportion to distance. This paper set a goal to analyze the character-istics of an infrared <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> and to correct the non-linear bias errors. The corrected infrared <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> can be utilized as an effective alternative to other sensors in indoor environment. ...|$|R
50|$|Time-of-flight and {{triangulation}} <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> {{each have}} {{strengths and weaknesses}} that make them suitable for different situations. The advantage of time-of-flight <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> {{is that they are}} capable of operating over very long distances, on the order of kilometres. These scanners are thus suitable for scanning large structures like buildings or geographic features. The disadvantage of time-of-flight <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> is their accuracy. Due to the high speed of light, timing the round-trip time is difficult and the accuracy of the distance measurement is relatively low, on the order of millimetres.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} self-calibration of robotic hand-mounted laser <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> by means of active motion of the robot. Through range-measuring of a plane of unknown {{position}} and orientation, the mounting parameters of the <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> and the coordinates of the world plane are estimated. Systematic measurement errors can also be calibrated at the same time. The approach is fully autonomous, in that no initial guesses of the unknown parameters are to be provided from the outside by humans for the solution {{of a set of}} nonlinear equations. In fact, the initial values are all found in closed forms by the algorithm itself. Sufficient conditions for a unique solution are derived in terms of controlled motion sequences. Experimental results in both a simulated and a real environments are reported.
