It {{is active in}} the morning once the sun warms the area slightly, retreats to its underground den during {{the heat of the}} day, then reemerges late in the day for another <b>feeding</b> <b>bout.</b> It feeds mostly on grasses and cereals, although small vertebrates and arthropods are also eaten.|$|E
50|$|Chemical deterrents {{in plants}} are called {{secondary}} metabolites. Secondary metabolites are compounds {{produced by the}} plant that are not essential for the primary processes, such as growth and reproduction. Toxins might have evolved to prevent consumption by animals that disperse seeds into unsuitable habitats, to prevent too many fruits from being eaten per <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> by preventing too many seeds being deposited in one site, or to prevent digestion of the seeds in the gut of the animal. Secondary chemical defenses are divided into three categories: nitrogen-based, carbon-based terpenes, and carbon-based phenolics.|$|E
50|$|Another {{study was}} done to find whether the sexual {{dimorphism}} in the nyala influenced its foraging habits. Vegetation surveys were conducted {{with the end of}} each <b>feeding</b> <b>bout.</b> It was found that females spent equal periods of time foraging in all the three habitats, but males preferred sand forest more. More differences were noted, as males ate woody species at a greater average height whereas females fed from the low herbaceous layer. It was concluded that the differences resulted from varying nutritional and energetic demands according to their diverse body sizes and differing reproductive strategies.|$|E
40|$|The free-swimming {{behavior}} of the Calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa {{is described as a}} function of food concentration and quantified turbulence. In still water, Acartia spent most of its time feeding. Time allocated to <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> did not change much as a function of food concentration (from 98 % to 81 %). Functional response to food was mainly determined by the duration of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> and the proportion of time spent in them. Lengthy <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> might be involved with the actual capture and ingestion of food, while brief <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> might be involved in the search for an optimum food density and the discrimination of food quality. Turbulence did not affect the amount of time allocated to <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> but induced a significant shift to bouts of shorter duration at low food concentration. Computed encounter rates were 2. 5 times higher in the presence of turbulence and indicated that turbulence intensity might have been enough to increase realized food concentrations to levels comparable to satiation at some of the low food concentrations tested. There is considerable information on many properties of copepod populations (e. g. abun-dance, distribution, migration) and rate pro-cesses (e. g. feeding, metabolic activity, fecun-dity) that take place at relatively large scales. At very small scales (e. g. detailed studies of appendage motions to gather food), knowledge has increased substantially in the last decade (Paffenhiifer et al. 1982; Price et al. 1983; Paf-fenhofer and Lewis 1989). However, data at intermediate behavioral scales, which could help in understanding the variability observed at larger scales, are still scarce (Piontkovski...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Most extant {{primates}} feed on insects to some degree, yet {{the nutritional}} contributions of insects to primate diets are poorly characterized. Like many small-bodied frugivorous primates, redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius) also eat insects. We quantified the nutritional contributions of insects to the diets of female redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park, Uganda, from July 2010 to June 2012 through full day follows (N = 64) using weight-based estimates of food intake. Female redtail monkeys targeted insects for 41 % of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts,</b> plant reproductive parts (including ripe fruits, unripe fruits, flowers, seeds) for 15 % of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts,</b> and leaves (including young leaves, mature leaves, leaf petioles, leaf buds) for 17 % of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b> However, females spent just under 10 % of feeding time on insects, {{in contrast to}} 42 % on plant reproductive parts and 39 % on leaves.

40|$|Bat-eared foxes Otocyon megalotis feed {{in pairs}} {{or groups of}} three when {{utilizing}} clumped prey in patches, e. g. termites, and cover 0, 87 - 1, 28 km/h. When feeding on dispersed prey, e. g. insect larvae, they are widely spaced and cover 0, 56 - 0, 83 km/h. Food patches are never re-utilized on the same day. Patch size diameter varied from 6 - 30 m, and patches were 10 to &gt; 100 m apart, while from 1, 17 min to 15 min were spent in patches. There were no significant correlations between patch size and distance moved to next patch, or time spent in a patch and distance moved to next patch, or time spent in a patch and patch size. Patches were seldom (1, 6) returned to immediately. A male and a female had similar numbers of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> per sampling period during winter or summer, but when accompanied by cubs the male fed less frequently. The male had significantly longer <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> than the female in winter, with the reverse applying in summer. Within-sex comparisons show {{that the number of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> of the male did not vary significantly between winter and summer.

50|$|The larvae {{are shown}} to {{disperse}} their {{damage on the}} plant. Larvae are shown to feed mostly during the day. They move around the plant mostly spending their time feeding. A <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> is immediately followed by a change in position, either to a new leaf or {{to another part of}} the same leaf. This dispersal of damage is seen as an adaptive behavior to hide the visual cues from predators that rely on vision. Even though P. rapae larvae are cryptic, they remain in the sun for the majority of the day, rather than hiding on the underside of the leaf. The condition of the host plant influences the larval growth significantly.|$|E

It can vary from fairly generic swarming or unsolicited mid-air interception, as is common in many Diptera, to courtship behavior involving a context-specific flight pattern and wingbeat pitch of the male, with or without repeated proboscis contact between male and female. Males often seek out smaller or larger clearings on the ground, presumably in vicinity of flowering plants or host nesting habitats that are likely attractive to females. They can return to their chosen perch or patch after every <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> or after pursuit of other insects flying over, or they can instead survey their chosen territory while hovering one or more meters above the bare patch.|$|E
50|$|Mysmenopsis furtiva from Jamaica {{lives as}} a kleptoparasite and {{commensal}} in webs of Ischnothele xera. It steals portions of its host's prey, but also consumes minute trapped insects {{that are not}} sought after by the host. In order not to be recognized, it moves only slowly when the host does not move; else it synchronizes its rapid movements with {{the movements of the}} host. M. furtiva has been observed to feed on one end of a prey animal, while the host feeds on the other. When feeding, its legs and pedipalps remain motionless, but its abdomen sways slowly and slightly. One <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> can double its abdominal volume. The host shows anti-kleptoparasite behavior, amongst others by adding silk between the kleptoparasite and the feeding site.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For many species, mate {{guarding}} {{results in}} dramatic departures from normal behaviour that reflect compromised attention to feeding and other activities. Such departures have previously {{been difficult to}} document in primates, however. Data were gathered on two aspects of male behaviour that were predicted to be constrained during consortships, individual travel distance and duration of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts,</b> for wild male baboons, Papio cynocephalus, {{in and out of}} mate-guarding episodes. In each case, consorting males were compared with themselves outside of consortships, and, in the case of distance travelled, they were compared also with non-consorting males matched for sample time and location. Males travelled significantly shorter distances while consorting than while not consorting, with the result that consorting males travelled distances similar to those travelled by females. Males also had significantly shorter <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> while consorting. The shorter travel distances and <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> experienced by consorting males may represent important constraints on male foraging activity, and probably result in decreased energy intake during mate guarding. Seasonal and non-seasonal breeding patterns will have different consequences for the magnitude of fluctuations in energy stores and depletions experienced during mate guarding, and costs of mate guarding in species that breed non-seasonally will be more difficult to document because they are necessarily smaller and temporall...|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> on fruiting trees by animal dispersers {{may have an}} effect on seed dispersal effectiveness. In this study we quantified seed removal rates and visit duration for different animal vectors in three trees of Henriettellafissanthera (Melastomataceae). The main purpose was to describe seed removal rates by different dispersers, ánd test the associatiop. of three characteristics of the dipersors that ha ve been proposed to affect bout duration times: crypsis, diet and gut capacity. We observed three primate species and 24 bird species ingesting fruits during a period of 85 h. H. fissanthera fruits correspond to the birdE dispersal syndrome, and they removed the majority of seeds, although primates removed a significant proportion offruits (40 %). The largest tree was visited more often than the medium and small trees. Our results indicated that neither crypsis or diet were associated with the average {{duration of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b>  Probably these results {{can be explained by the}} fact that the frugivories are not very exposed to aerial predators when feeding on H. fissanthera fruits, and because particular fruit preferences by frugivories seem to be very important in determining visit times. We found a positive association between average visit time and body weight (as a surrogate variable for gut capacity), but this correlation was not significant, suggesting that other factors may be more important deterrnining the duration of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> in this plant species (e. g. instantaneous fruit abundance, tree distribution and interspecific aggressions) ...|$|R

50|$|Elm leaf beetles {{become active}} in the spring once {{temperatures}} rise above 52 °F (11 °C). In fact, weather {{is one of the}} most limiting factors in the population growth of Xanthogaleruca luteola. A late spring freeze or long winter can kill off entire elm leaf beetle colonies. The imagines depart their hibernation sites (often houses), the females laying their ova on the underside of the elm leaves. The ova hatch after one week, the larvae immediately feed on the underside of the leaves. This larval stage lasts for a period of between two and three weeks, at the end of which it will migrate to the lower part of the tree in search of bark crevices in which to pupate. The next generation emerges in mid-summer after two to three weeks' pupation, and begins feeding on the leaves. The female can lay < 800 ova, but this ovipositing may be interrupted by shortening of the photoperiod to < 14 hours, inducing a brief <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> before the search for a hibernation site.|$|E

40|$|Neophobia is an {{important}} personality trait that allows animals to minimize exposure to threat. We investigated the existence of consistent individual differences {{in the level of}} neophobia in captive roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful situation, i. e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased {{in the presence of a}} novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> increased the most among individuals that had a higher concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic (high latency to first <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> and low feeding efficiency in the presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue for the study of animal personality in the wild...|$|E
40|$|Blinking serves several {{functions}} in animals, {{but it comes}} {{at the cost of}} intermittent blindness. Blinking can occur spontaneously, but it is commonly associated with head movements. As feeding animals often need to move the head down repeatedly to gather resources, intermittent blindness might represent a hitherto unappreciated cost of feeding. In addition, this cost might also be more prevalent in larger groups as feeding effort typically increases with group size. In chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), blinks associated with head movements occurred at a high frequently during <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b> While blinks tended to be short, {{the amount of time spent}} blinking was close to 50 % when feeding and increased with group size. By contrast, time spent blinking was much lower when birds simply monitored their surroundings between <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b> Intermittent blinking at this scale when feeding is likely to decrease the ability to detect predation threats in a timely fashion and to monitor neighbors effectively...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{behaviour}} {{of fifth}} instar tobacco hornworm caterpillars, Manduca sexta (Johansen) (Lepidoptera; Sphingidae), eating tobacco or artificial diet, is quantitatively described. The insects grow {{at the same}} rate on both foods. There is no daily rhythm of feeding behaviour. For most insects, feeding on either food occurs in bouts with the lengths of interfeed gaps and of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> appearing to be distributed randomly. However, in many insects there is a strong correlation between the length of a feeding period and that of the preceding non-feeding period. The proportion of time spent feeding on tobacco is much greater than on artificial diet. On tobacco, feeding periods are separated by shorter interfeed gaps than on the artificial diet, while the rate of bout initiation is similar on either food. On both tobacco and artificial diet, the proportion of time spent feeding increases as the fifth stadium proceeds. This is due to both longer <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> and shorter gaps. The rate of food acquisition within bouts does not change during the stadium. S. E. Reynolds, M. R. Yeomans and W. A. Timmin...|$|R
40|$|We used {{activity}} time-budgets {{to study}} the feeding behaviour of Trumpeter Swans breeding during 1988 - 89 on the Copper River Delta, Alaska. Local foods were proximally important for pre-nesting and incubation activities. Females spent more time feeding and had longer <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> than males during pre-nesting, but the pattern was reversed during incubation. During short incubation recesses, females fed with more intensity than males. Although physiologically capable of extended periods of fasting, females appear to rely, in part, on exogenous foods to supplement energy demands of egg laying and incubation. Pairs with young fed less and had shorter <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> than failed breeders, foregoing some feeding opportunities {{to care for their}} young. Males fed less and were more vigilant than females during brood rearing, allowing females and young more time to feed undisturbed. 'reeding was the principal prefledging activity of cygnets. Cygnet feeding and non-feeding periods alternated regularly and were relatively uniform in length over time and among broods.

40|$|Owing to the {{inherent}} difficulties of studying bluefin tuna, nothing {{is known of}} the cardiovascular function of free-swimming fish. Here, we surgically implanted newly designed data loggers into the visceral cavity of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) to measure changes in the heart rate (fH) and visceral temperature (TV) during a two-week feeding regime in sea pens at Port Lincoln, Australia. Fish ranged in body mass from 10 to 21  kg, and water temperature remained at 18 – 19 °C. Pre-feeding fH typically ranged from 20 to 50 beats min− 1. Each <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> (meal sizes 2 – 7 % of tuna body mass) was characterized by increased levels of activity and fH (up to 130 beats min− 1), {{and a decrease in}} TV from approximately 20 to 18 °C as cold sardines were consumed. The <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> was promptly followed by a rapid increase in TV, which signified the beginning of the heat increment of feeding (HIF). The time interval between meal consumption and the completion of HIF ranged from 10 to 24 hours and was strongly correlated with ration size. Although fH generally decreased after its peak during the <b>feeding</b> <b>bout,</b> it remained elevated during the digestive period and returned to routine levels on a similar, but slightly earlier, temporal scale to TV. These data imply a large contribution of fH to the increase in circulatory oxygen transport that is required for digestion. Furthermore, these data oppose the contention that maximum fH is exceptional in bluefin tuna compared with other fishes, and so it is likely that enhanced cardiac stroke volume and blood oxygen carrying capacity are the principal factors allowing superior rates of circulatory oxygen transport in tuna...|$|E
40|$|Social {{dominance}} {{is widely}} known to facilitate access to food resources in many animal {{species such as}} deer. However, research has {{paid little attention to}} dominance in ad libitum access to food because it was thought not to result in any benefit for dominant individuals. In this study we assessed if, even under ad libitum conditions, social rank may allow dominant hinds to consume the preferred components of food. Forty-four red deer hinds (Cervus elaphus) were allowed to consume ad libitum meal consisting of pellets of sunflower, lucerne and orange, and seeds of cereals, corn, cotton, and carob tree. The meal was placed only in one feeder, which reduced accessibility to a few individuals simultaneously. During seven days, feeding behavior (order of access, time to first <b>feeding</b> <b>bout,</b> total time spent feeding, and time per <b>feeding</b> <b>bout)</b> were assessed during the first hour. The relative abundance of each meal component was assessed at times 0, 1 and 5 h, as well as its nutritional composition. Social rank was positively related to {{the amount of time spent}} feeding during the 1 (st) h (P = 0. 048). Selection indices were positively correlated with energy (P = 0. 018 during the 1 (st) h and P = 0. 047 from 1 (st) to 5 (th)) and fat (only during the 1 (st) h; P = 0. 036), but also negatively with certain minerals. Thus, dominant hinds could select high energy meal components for longer time under an ad libitum but restricted food access setting. Selection indices showed a higher selectivity when food availability was higher (1 (st) hour respect to 1 (st) to 5 (th)). Finally, high and low ranking hinds had longer time per <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> than mid ones (P = 0. 011), suggesting complex behavioral feeding tactics of low ranking social ungulates...|$|E
40|$|Offspring often compete over limited {{available}} resources. Such sibling competition may {{be detrimental}} to parents both because it entails wasted expenditure and because it allows stronger offspring to obtain {{a disproportionate share of}} resources. We studied nestling conflict over food and its resolution in a joint-nesting species of bird, the Taiwan yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps). We show that adult yuhinas coordinate their feeding visits, and that this coordination limits competition among nestlings, leading to a ‘fairer’ division of resources. Transponder identification and video-recording systems were used to observe adult feeding and nestling begging behaviours. We found that: (i) yuhinas feed nestlings more often in large parties than in small parties; (ii) feeding events occurred non-randomly in bouts of very short intervals; and (iii) food distribution among nestlings was more evenly distributed, and fewer nestlings begged, during large-party <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> compared with small-party <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study in a cooperative breeding species showing that adults can influence food allocation and competition among nestlings by coordinating their feeding visits.

House finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in the US {{are susceptible to}} a recently emerged strain of the bacteria, Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Infected birds develop mild to severe conjunctivitis that could affect their foraging or social behavior. We videotaped house finches with and without conjunctivitis at a bird feeding station in Atlanta, GA to determine whether birds with conjunc-tivitis differed in feeding duration, efficiency, total food intake, or aggressive interactions. We observed 105 house finch <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> (of which 41 % were of birds with conjunctivitis). In-fected birds spent more time at the feeding station and had smaller average and minimum flock sizes.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate about the {{adaptive}} function of chimpanzee's food-associated calls. Here, we tested a new hypothesis that food-associated calls in male chimpanzees function to signal that the calling individual is likely to initiate or prolong feeding. We propose that the signal functions to coordinate activities between individuals and that its ultimate function is to retain the nearby individuals in proximity. To test this hypothesis, we collected data on social and ecological correlates of food-associates calls in male chimpanzees. The results of this study, which {{was conducted on the}} Kanyawara community in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, show that males tended to feed for significantly longer after giving food-associated calls upon initiating feeding than after remaining silent. The type of audience had a significant effect on food calling, with males producing food-associated calls more often when males rather than females and preferred rather than neutral male social partners were in close proximity. However, the total party or male party size did not correlate with food calling behaviors, suggesting that the signal “targets” those in close proximity. Finally, a male feeding partner was more likely to remain with the focal until the end of a <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> after the focal gave a food-associated call {{at the beginning of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> than when he was silent. These results support our hypothesis and suggest that one of the functions of food calling in chimpanzees might be signaling that the caller is likely to initiate and prolong a <b>feeding</b> <b>bout.</b> This information might be used by receivers to make the decision whether or not to stay with the calling individual on a feeding patch or leave him (fission). The study suggests therefore that ultimately the function of food calling might be to coordinate feeding behaviors between males. Am. J.

40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{response to}} social challenges {{has been widely}} studied, however, most work focused on adult behavior in a reproductive context although developing animals also encounter important social challenges early in life. We studied the relationship between acute sibling competition and plasma corticosterone (CURT) and testosterone (T) in common tern (Sterna hirundo) chicks, a species whose young compete for access to food by scramble interactions. Blood samples were taken in nests with two and only one single chick both immediately after a <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> and in non-challenged controls. We found that T levels were lower in siblings challenged by a <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> as compared to controls, which {{may be explained by}} the fact that T suppresses begging behavior and is only elevated in response to territorial intrusion but not sibling competition in a related species. Singletons had, corrected for body condition, generally lower CURT levels than siblings suggesting that growing up with siblings creates a competitive environment in which high CURT levels are sustained irrespective of a social challenge. CURT levels were also negatively correlated with body condition and were higher in males than in females. The latter may be related to sex-specific food requirements and susceptibility to stress. Our results suggest a possible suppressive effect of acute sibling competition on T secretion, and a positive effect on CURT levels by longer term sibling competition. The degree to which these dynamics are related to begging or aggression, or both, needs further experimental work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Results were attributable to acquired differences in the development of feeding inhibition during the meal, and not to original or acquired differences in initial rate of feeding or in the preference for 1 diet over the other in 2 stimulus tests...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of intermittent feeding, exogenous enzyme supplementation (xylanase and β-glucanase) and their interaction {{on the performance of}} broiler chickens. Furthermore, possible selective retention of starch and/or protein as well as flow pattern of the nutrients in digestive tract was studied. 144 broiler chickens (Ross 308) were fed barley based diet supplemented or not with exogenous enzyme, under either ad libitum or intermittent feeding systems from 7 to 35 days of age in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ad libitum fed birds were fed continuously, while intermittently fed birds had access to feed five times a day with four 1 hour and one 2 hour <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> a day from 7 to 12 days of age and 5 one hour <b>feeding</b> <b>bout</b> a day from 12 days of age until the end of experiment. In the last day of trial randomly selected intermittently fed birds were killed 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 and 240 minutes after feeding commencement to collect the content of crop, proventriculus-gizzard, duodenum + jejunum and ileum for determination of starch, protein and titanium dioxide as well as intestinal viscosity. There was no interaction between feeding regimen and exogenous enzyme for any of performance parameters. From 7 – 21 days of age exogenous enzyme didn’t affect body weight (BW) gain and feed intake but significantly increased AME (P 0. 05). There was no selective retention of nutrients in the crop but starch showed reduced concentration in the proventriculus-gizzard overtime. The pH significantly declined in the crop 4 hours after feeding was initiated (P 0. 05). Det var ingen selektiv retensjon av næringsstoffer i kro, men konsentrasjonen av stivelse i kjertelmage-krås sank med tiden. Det ble vist signifikant lavere pH i kro 4 timer etter tilgang på fôr (P< 0. 05) som et resultat av fermenteringsaktivitet av melkesyrebakterier. Resultatene fra dette forsøket viser at slaktekyllinger kan vise kompensatorisk vekst etter en periode med redusert prestasjon under måltidsfôring, mest sannsynlig på grunn av økt lagringskapasitet i kro. Den fraværende effekten av enzym på viskositet kan skyldes lave konsentrasjoner av løselig fiber i bygg eller metoden som ble brukt for å måle viskositet. Effekten av enzym på AME kan skyldes at tilsatt enzym hydrolyserer celleveggens ikke-stivelses-polysakkarider (NSP) eller øker konsentrasjonene av kortkjedede fettsyrer i blindtarmene...|$|E
40|$|Recordings {{were made}} of 193 pant hoots given by 6 adult males during ad lib {{sampling}} over a 16 -month period in 1988 and 1989. The {{presence or absence of}} a let-down phase, and acoustic measures of the let-down and climax phases of the calls, were compared for different call contexts to determine if an acoustically distinct pant hoot was given uniquely upon arrival at fruiting trees. The greatest proportion of pant hoots with a let-down (LD pant hoots) occurred immediately upon arrival at fruiting trees. However, LD pant hoots also occurred at other times during <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b> The frequency and duration of the first exhaled element of 19 letdown phases were measured, and four measures were made on the highest pitched element of 49 climax phases: duration, maximum and minimum frequencies, and average frequency. No differences were found in these acoustic measures that distinguished calls given immediately upon arrival at a food tree from calls given later during <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts.</b> Thus no evidence was found that an acoustically distinct pant hoot was given uniquely upon arrival at fruiting trees. However, the analyses did suggest that identifiable pant hoot variants are given in different social contexts. The proportion of LD pant hoots decreased in more interactive social contexts, and other acoustic features may be available to distinguish this pant hoot variant at long distances. We suggest that different pant hoot variants might broadcast information specific to social, as opposed to ecological, context. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{diet and}} feeding {{habits of the}} {{epaulette}} shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, were investigated through stomach content analysis. Five groups of prey items were found. The index of relative importance showed worms and crabs,to be of greatest value at 51. 3 % and 40. 1 % respectively. The three minor prey groups were shrimps (7. 7 %), small fishes (0. 7 %) and amphipods (0. 3 %). Epaulette sharks tend to be crepuscular, although <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> may occur at any time. They appear to be opportunistic predators, using olfaction and electroreception in prey capture. This species {{appears to be an}} important benthic predator in the reef flat environment on Heron Island Reef...|$|R
40|$|Foi estudado o comportamento de forrageamento de Suiriri affinis (suiriri-do-cerrado) e S. islerorum (suiriri-da-chapada), duas espécies de Tyrannidae que ocorrem em sintopia nos cerrados do Brasil central. Durante o ano de 2003 foram registradas 188 observações de forrageamento para S. affinis e 150 para S. islerorum. Foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre as duas espécies em relação à altura e substrato de forrageamento, fitofisionomia utilizada e densidade da folhagem {{no local}} do ataque. O comportamento e a direção do ataque, a espécie de planta e a distância de vôo não diferiram entre as espécies. A análise de 26 conteúdos estomacais de membros do gênero revelou o consumo exclusivo de artrópodes. A baixa porcentagem de observações de forrageamento direcionadas a frutos (apenas 7 % e 9 %, respectivamente) confirmou o caráter insetívoro do gênero. The {{foraging}} behavior of Suiriri affinis (Campo Suiriri) and S. islerorum (Chapada Flycatcher), two sintopic Tyrant Flycatchers in the Central Brazilian Cerrado (tropical savanna) was studied. During 2003, 188 <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> of S. affinis and 150 of S. islerorum were registered. Differences {{between the two}} species in the feeding height, foraging substrate, phytophysiognomy used, and foliage density {{at the point of}} foraging observation were found. The attack methods, attack direction, distance of flight, and plant species used did not differ between both species. The analysis of 26 stomach contents of members of this genus revealed only arthropods. The low percentage of <b>feeding</b> <b>bouts</b> directed to fruits (only 7 % and 9 %, respectively) confirmed the insectivorous character of this genus...|$|R
