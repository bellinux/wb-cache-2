50|$|Core {{strength}} {{is measured by}} the amount of sit-ups (a maximum of 40) the player can complete; lower-body {{strength is}} measured by the number of squats (a maximum of 60) the player can complete, and upper strength {{is measured by the}} number of push-ups (a maximum of 40) the player can complete. Flexibility is measured on a 1-7 scale by how far the player can reach forward when seated with the legs stretched out in front with feet flexed. On every 10th workout, the player will repeat this fitness evaluation as a Physical Challenge. This results in a dynamic workout program that changes with the player's physical fitness level and ability. Based on the results of each Physical Challenge, Maya will suggest one of 5 areas a player can choose to emphasize <b>in—Weight</b> Loss, Cardio, Upper Strength, Core Strength, and Lower Strength. In addition to this, Maya will also suggest an emphasis for each workout a player initiates. In addition to these workout options, the player can choose to do Yoga by selecting the Meditation Garden.|$|E

In addition, we ignore the temporal diffusion decay (i.e., let λ= 0) when generating the influence vectors such that our IV-Greedy is more robust with different decay rates. We develop a modified depth-limited search algorithm, called IV-Builder, to explore the diffusion tree of each node individually, and generate an influence vector for each node, which records its influence spread to all the nodes in its neighborhood within a depth limit of 3 (by default). IV-builder uses the same approach as we use to generate the influence matrix for community detection in (Wang and Street 2014; 2015 a). The only difference exists in the weight normalization schemes. For community detection, we normalize each <b>in-weight</b> of a node by the maximum <b>in-weight</b> of that node to capture the relative susceptibility of the node to its in-neighbors, and the influence vectors are used to differentiate vertex-pair similarity. For viral marketing, we normalize each <b>in-weight</b> of a node by the total <b>in-weight</b> of that node to quantify the absolute influence transmitted from each in-neighbor, and the influence vectors are used {{to find out which}} nodes {{are more likely to be}} activated. Due to space limit, we refer the interested reader to (Wang and Street 2015 a) for implementation details on influence-vector generation.|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} of alloxazine in {{aqueous solution}} at pH 4 (10 – 4 molar HCl) and pH 10 (10 – 4 molar NaOH) at room temperature is determined by absorption spectroscopic characterization. Know-ledge of the solubility is needed for sample preparation and quantitative spectroscopic solution characterization. Samples of different <b>in-weight</b> concentration were prepared and absorption spectra were measured versus storage time. The solubility limit concentration Csol was deter-mined by the crossing point of the linearized absorption coefficient dependences on <b>in-weight</b> pre-paration concentration below and above the solubility limit. Values of Csol = 9. 05 ± 1 μM and 14. 5 ± 1 μM were determined for alloxazine {{in aqueous solution}} at pH 4 and pH 10, respectively...|$|E

Cattle that were identified and sorted off at re-implant had a reduced prevalence of heavyweight carcasses versus unsorted cattle.

Sex differences in weight and backfat thickness were significant. Dam groups of progeny differed significantly (P<. 0 l) <b>in-weights</b> at birth and at 14 and 28 days old and in age, loin eye area, and backfat thickness adjusted to 220 pounds live weight.

40|$|Data {{describing}} 220 lots of {{beef cattle}} in the Tri-County Steer Carcass Futurity program from 2003 through 2007 {{were analyzed using}} a multiple regression statistical model to determine specific factors that influence lot low Choice and above rate and lot premium Choice (Certified Angus Beef ©) acceptance rate. Lot low Choice and above rate was similar for years 2005 - 2007. This rate was significantly lower in 2003 than 2004 but both the 2003 and 2004 rates were similar to the rate in all other years. Lots consisting of heifers had higher (P 3 ̆c. 05) low Choice and above rates than lots of steers or mixed-sex pens. The greater the amount of Angus influence in the cattle, the higher the low Choice and above rate (P 3 ̆c. 0001). An inverse relationship existed between feedlot <b>in-weight</b> and lot low Choice and above rate; those cattle with lighter feedlot arrival weights had higher...|$|E
30|$|The final {{network is}} {{constructed}} {{by taking the}} union of all complete bipartite graphs (one for each legal case) and adding the weights of corresponding edges. Thus, the edge weight in the final graph is simply {{the sum of the}} weights of the corresponding edge across all bipartite graphs. Note that the final graph is not necessarily bipartite, as lawyers win and lose cases, and participate with different sets of lawyers in different cases. Once the final network is generated, a lawyer with a large in-degree (or a large <b>in-weight)</b> and a small out-degree (or small out-weight) is likely to have a greater importance in the network. Note that lawyers that win many cases against many lawyers are indeed relevant to this network. On the other hand, lawyers that win few cases against few lawyers are likely to have a lower relevance. Last, note that some law firms tend to register several lawyers for a given legal case, allowing any of them to officially represent the firm in the suit (mostly for convenience of the firm). The definition of weights used here in some sense compensates for this practice, as it divides by the number of lawyers in the winning set.|$|E
