40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the imaging and histopathologic appearance <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> {{the hands and}} feet in abused infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The imaging findings in 11 abused infants with <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the hands and feet were examined retrospectively. All 11 infants underwent skeletal surveys; five infants also underwent nuclear bone scanning. Postmortem radiographs of the specimen and histopathologic data were available in two infants. RESULTS: A total <b>of</b> 22 <b>fractures</b> were noted. Six infants had <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the hands: six metacarpal and nine proximal phalangeal fractures. Five infants had <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the feet: six metatarsal fractures and one proximal phalangeal fracture. Torus fractures predominated, and these patterns were confirmed at the histologic examinations. These morphologic features were consistent with a mechanism of forced hyperextension. Oblique views of the hands and follow-up skeletal surveys aided in detection of these injuries. Four <b>of</b> six metatarsal <b>fractures</b> involved the first ray.

5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

40|$|The {{worldwide}} prevalence <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the proxi-mal {{part of the}} femur {{is increasing}} as {{the average age of}} the population increases. The actual number <b>of</b> these <b>fractures</b> in the United States doubled from the mid- 1960 ’s through the 1980 ’s. Frandsen and Kruse predicted that the number <b>of</b> such <b>fractures</b> will triple that of today by the year 2050. Thus. <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the proximal part of the femur are an important cause of morbidity and mor-tality in all age-groups, especially the elderly. Approximately 250, 000 <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the proximal part of the femur occur in the United States each year. resulting in annual health-care costs of more than 8. 7 billion dollars 75. Extensive debate continues with regard to the cost-effectiveness of various medical and opera-tive therapies. including the treatment <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the proximal part of the femur. Using the concept of quality-adjusted life-years, Parker et al. determined that operative treatment is the most cost-effective approach for displaced intracapsular fractures and all extracapsu-lar fractures 75. Thus, the proper treatment <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the proximal part of the femur is important not only for the continued health and vitality of the population but also for the health <b>of</b> the economy. <b>Fractures</b> <b>of</b> the proximal part of the femur occur predominantly as low-energy injuries in elderly patients and as high-energy injuries in younger patients. The high prevalence <b>of</b> these <b>fractures</b> in the elderly is related to numerous factors, including osteoporosis, malnutrition, decreased physical activity, impaired vision, neurologi-cal impairment, poor balance, altered reflexes, and mus-cular weakness.

5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
