CAF held 5% <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DAME project, and Reliance Infrastructure held the remaining 95% before DMRC {{took over the}} operations. The trains on this line are of a premium standard compared to the existing metro trains and have in-built noise reduction and padded fabric seats. The coaches are equipped with LCD screens for entertainment of the passengers and also provide flight information for convenience of air travellers.

5|$|In March 2010, {{citing a}} drop in {{production}} and difficulty servicing significant debt {{as a result of}} the 1998 Mafco transaction, shareholder MacAndrews & Forbes agreed to a debt restructuring arrangement with Panavision's creditors. Private equity firm Cerberus Capital was the lead investor in the deal, which involved a US$140 million reduction in debt and a US$40 million cash infusion. In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no longer has any <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company. In June 2013, its creditors sued over an unpaid debt of $1.7 million, threatening to dissolve the company if they win.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} years, the congregation's {{financial}} situation was precarious. The building was located ten blocks from {{where most of}} the congregants and potential congregants lived (on Grand Street, near the ferry docks), and attendance was low. Even on the High Holy Days, the sanctuary was rarely more than half full. The synagogue employed a rabbi, gabbai, and cantor, and annual expenses often exceeded the congregation's income (which came primarily from the sale of seats). To remain solvent, the congregation borrowed money against the <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building: $2,000 (today $) in 1888, and another $2,000 in 1894.|$|E

25|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance measures}} change over time. A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; earnings per share in the mid-1970s; return on <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E
25|$|In the United States today, {{the federal}} courts and most state courts have merged law and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the {{substantive}} distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality. This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless {{a temporary restraining order}} (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifically authorize only equitable relief, which forces US courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.|$|E
