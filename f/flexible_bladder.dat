50|$|The first <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> {{tank was}} {{constructed}} out of polyester and PVC in Alger (Africa) in the 1950s. It {{was invented by}} André Labaronne (patent N°1.460.825, 19 October 1965) and marketed under the brand CITAF (Citernes pour l’agriculture Française).|$|E
50|$|Bladder {{tanks are}} lightweight, flexible, mobile and {{can last for}} many years. The {{materials}} used to make bladder walls are recyclable and can be re-used for other purposes. Bladder tanks have capacities up to 1,000 cubic meters. Liquid stored in a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> tank does not evaporate and any odor it may produce is completely sealed within the tank. Contaminants cannot enter a properly sealed tank. Bladder tanks have many practical applications {{and can be found}} in agriculture, industry, civil protection, military and humanitarian organisations.|$|E
50|$|The early {{tanks were}} of welded {{aluminium}} structure with the sealing material applied as a composite layer on the outside. A major problem with welded aluminium tanks is weld decay and metal fatigue in the seams due to vibration in service. In response to this, the company started to develop <b>flexible</b> fuel <b>bladders</b> {{in the early}} 1940s. One of the earliest examples of this was a composite <b>flexible</b> fuel <b>bladder</b> with self-sealing coatings for the Supermarine Spitfire MkIX.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of an inflatable space habitat is determined by its design objectives. However common elements include interwoven layers of Kevlar and mylar around a <b>flexible</b> air <b>bladder</b> {{which is used to}} retain an atmosphere. The shape of the module is maintained by the pressure difference between the internal atmosphere and the outside vacuum. The inflatable Bigelow Aerospace modules have an internal core which provides structural support during its launch into orbit.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{bladders}} or fuel storage <b>bladders</b> are collapsible, <b>flexible</b> storage <b>bladders</b> (also {{known as}} tanks) that provide temporary or long term storage for industrial liquids (e.g. fuels). These pillow shaped tanks {{are designed for}} large volume liquid transport, industrial chemicals, potable water, sludge, and fuel storage. Standard fuel bladder tanks sizes range from 100 gal to 200,000 gal capacities and larger and custom fuel storage bladders and cells are available, although at sizes exceeding 50,000 gal there is an increased spill risk. To {{minimize the risk of}} leakage, {{and for the sake of}} containing a catastrophic spill, all fuel bladders should be housed in secondary containment. The use of fuel bladders without precautionary measures is risky and should not be undertaken. The fines involved with fuel spills are well known and the EPA has set clear guidelines for the use of secondary containment concerning fuel bladders.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicle uses hydraulic and mechanical components instead of electrical. A {{variable displacement pump}} replaces the electric motor/generator. A hydraulic accumulator stores energy. The vessel typically carries a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> of pre-charged pressurized nitrogen gas. Pumped hydraulic fluid is compressed against the bladder storing the energy in the compressed nitrogen gas. Some versions have a piston in a cylinder rather than a pressurized bladder. The hydraulic accumulator is potentially cheaper and more durable than batteries. Hydraulic hybrid technology was originally implemented in Germany in the 1930s. Volvo Flygmotor used petro-{{hydraulic hybrid}}s experimentally in buses from the early 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> {{tanks are}} made with high {{resistance}} PVC material and are welded with high frequency (HF) soldering techniques. The bladder walls are made of polyester with PVC induction. The materials used in bladder walls are generally UV resistant and are chosen for their chemical stability and resistance to mechanical abrasion. Additionally, they are fabricated specifically to allow the tank to stand independent of any external support. Different compositions of bladder walls are used to store different types of liquid. For example, a particular design may be suited for hydrocarbon storage but others {{could be used for}} liquid fertilizers, chemical products, rainwater, drinking water, or used water.|$|E

50|$|In the US, Ernst Eger of United States Rubber Company (later Uniroyal) {{patented}} a self-sealing {{fuel tank}} design in 1941; {{one of many}} companies involved in developing this technology during the war. Goodyear chemist James Merrill filed a patent in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing self-sealing tanks using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft. In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced Corsair fighters, {{as well as other}} aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first <b>flexible</b> fuel <b>bladders</b> as range extender tanks for the MkIX Spitfire. These tanks were flexible containers, made of a laminated self-sealing material like vulcanized rubber and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths.|$|R

40|$|A Proposal for SNO is {{made for}} {{simultaneous}} detection of Neutral Current, Charged Current and Elastic Scattering of Solar-neutrino induced events. The detector would be a thin (order 0. 001 "), <b>flexible,</b> transparent <b>bladder,</b> of radius 5 m to be placed within the main 6 m radius acrylic sphere. It would be filled with heavy-water containing the usual 2. 5 T dissolved NaCI to act as the neutron-to-electron converter. Up to SOKg of HB 03 would then {{be added to the}} region of heavywater between the main shell and the bladder in order to quench background neutrons from gamma induced fission of the deuterium from radioactivity in the main acrylic shell, PMTs and support structures and the lightwater. The light water region outside the main shell would be sensitive to ES signals, the heavywater region between the shell and the bladder to both ES and CC, and the region inside the bladder to ES, CC and NC. The detector could be inserted or removed {{at any time during the}} operation of SNO. In the unlikely event of rupture of the bladder SNO would still remain operational as only the NC signal would be quenched, but only for the length of time required to remove the HB 03 and/or NaCI from solution.

5000|$|IRBs {{are made}} of rubber and consist of four {{inflatable}} tubes - two side tubes, a bow tube and a keelson tube. This specific feature coupled with the obvious {{fact that they are}} used in the water, has coined the term [...] "rubber duck" [...] or simply [...] "duck" [...] to describe an IRB. Typically the rubber is coloured a shade of red termed 'Rescue Red' although a particular make of craft manufactured by Arancia come in a shade of orange.They have a rigid floor piece and a rigid transom for fitting an outboard motor (usually 25 hp).This motor is capable of providing a maximum drive speed of between 25-30 knots on flat water. 2-Stroke fuel is stored in a <b>flexible</b> fuel <b>bladder</b> and is secured by 4 clips to the floor in the bow. An IRB is crewed by two people - an IRB Operator/Driver and an IRB Crewman. The Operator sits on {{the lower half of the}} port side pontoon where he operates the outboard motor to control the boat. He has a single foot strap to help him stay in the boat. His left hand can hold on to a strap on the port side pontoon and his right hand operates the outboard motor by means of a tiller arm and throttle. The Crewman sits on the upper half of the starboard side pontoon. A handle is attached by a rope to the nose of the boat for him to hold with his left hand, while his right hand may hold a strap attached to the starboard pontoon. He balances the boat and allows it to go over large waves before they break without flipping. He also assists when going through a breaking wave, commonly referred to as [...] "punching-through". As of 2011 only one foot strap is available for a crew member.|$|R

Patients and methods: Economic evaluation of flexible-dose fesoterodine in newly diagnosed patients, including two treatment groups: standard escalating from 4 to 8 mg or fast escalating to 8 mg. Costs were estimated from health care resources utilization related to OAB, and were expressed in 2015 Euros. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) {{were obtained from}} overactive bladder questionnaire-short form. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Results: Three hundred and ninety symptomatic OAB patients treated with fesoterodine and newly diagnosed (141 in fast escalating group and 249 in standard escalating) were analyzed. Adjusted health care total costs were not statistically different; difference −€ 4. 1 (confidence interval: − 153. 3; 25. 1) P= 0. 842. QALYs were higher in fast escalating to high dose vs standard escalating group, resulting in a cost of −€ 16, 020 /QALY gained for fast escalating vs standard escalating group. Conclusion: When the cost-effectiveness threshold is set at a maximum value of € 30, 000 /QALY gained, fesoterodine fast escalating group was cost-effective vs standard escalating group 67. 6 % of the time.

We describe a novel technique of partial cystectomy that allows accurate identification of tumor margins while minimizing damage {{to the rest of}} the bladder. Methods: During the study period, 30 patients underwent partial cystectomy for invasive high-grade cancer. In 19 patients, the traditional method of tumor identification was used, ie, identifying the tumor by palpation and cystotomy. In eleven patients, after mobilization of the <b>bladder,</b> <b>flexible</b> cystoscopy was done and the light of the cystoscope was pointed toward one edge of the planned resected ellipse around the tumor, thus avoiding cystotomy. Results: Patients who underwent partial cystectomy using the novel method were similar in all characteristics to patients operated on using the traditional technique except for tumor diameter which was significantly larger in patients operated on using the novel method (4. 3 ± 1. 5 cm versus 3. 11 ± 1. 18 cm, P= 0. 032). Complications were rare in both types of surgery. The 5 -year local recurrence-free survival was marginally superior using the novel method (0. 8 versus 0. 426, P= 0. 088). Overall, disease-specific and disease-free survival rates were similar. Conclusion: The use of a flexible cystoscope during partial cystectomy is a simple, low-cost maneuver that assists in planning the bladder incision and minimizes injury to the remaining bladder by avoiding the midline cystotomy. Initial oncological results show a trend toward a lower rate of local recurrence compared with the standard method.

40|$|The {{sanitation}} agent container, {{which was}} selected {{in a trade}} off study, employs two chambers, a rigid outer container and an inner <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder.</b> The bladder contains the sanitation agent formulation and its release is controlled by a manually operated valve.

The sanitation agents were initially formulated with freons which produces an excellent foam. However freon is incompatible with the life support system and was replaced with carbon dioxide dissolved at high pressure.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 An {{experimental}} rig {{was designed}} and built to study the stability of transient evaporating films (< 5 mm) under micro-gravity conditions.

The film thickness was recorded by an ultrasound ranging method and processed via a Matlab and FORTRAN code. The temperature and pressure of the boundary conditions were collected by standard methods (strain gauges, thermistors, etc). The working fluid was almost exclusively dichloromethane (DCM). The films were superheated by a rapid pressure drop, and kept at a near constant value {{through the use of}} a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> which actively changed volume in order to achieve the desired pressure level.

40|$|In a {{cyclical}} heat load environment such as low Lunar orbit, a spacecrafts radiators are not sized {{to reject the}} full heat load requirement. Traditionally, a supplemental heat rejection device (SHReD) such as an evaporator or sublimator is used {{to act as a}} topper to meet the additional heat rejection demands. Utilizing a Phase Change Material (PCM) heat exchanger (HX) as a SHReD provides an attractive alternative to evaporators and sublimators as PCM HXs do not use a consumable, thereby leading to reduced launch mass and volume requirements. Studies conducted in this paper investigate utilizing waters high latent heat of formation as a PCM, as opposed to traditional waxes, and corresponding complications surrounding freezing water in an enclosed volume. Work highlighted in this study is primarily visual and includes understanding ice formation, freeze front propagation, and the solidification process of water/ice.

40|$|An airtight, {{flexible}} joint is disclosed for the interfacing of two pressure vessels such as between the Space Station docking tunnel and the Space Shuttle Orbiter bulkhead adapter. The joint provides for flexibility while still retaining a structural {{link between the}} two vessels required due to the loading created by the internal/external pressure differential. The joint design provides for limiting the axial load carried across the joint to a specific value, a function returned in the Orbiter/Station tunnel interface. The flex joint comprises a floating structural segment which is permanently attached {{to one of the}} pressure vessels through the use of an inflatable seal. The geometric configuration of the joint causes the tension between the vessels created by the internal gas pressure to compress the inflatable seal. The inflation pressure of the seal is kept at a value above the internal/external pressure differential of the vessels in order to maintain a controlled distance between the floating segment and pressure vessel. The inflatable seal consists of either a hollow torus-shaped <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> or two rolling convoluted diaphragm seals which may be reinforced by a system of straps or fabric anchored to the hard structures.

40|$|Collapsible {{cryogenic}} storage vessels {{may be useful}} for future space exploration missions by providing long-term storage capability using a lightweight system that can be compactly packaged for launch. Previous development efforts have identified an 'inflatable' concept as most promising. In the inflatable tank concept, the cryogen is contained within a flexible pressure wall comprised of a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> to contain the cryogen and a fabric reinforcement layer for structural strength. A flexible, high-performance insulation jacket surrounds the vessel. The weight of the tank and the cryogen is supported by rigid support structures.

40|$|An area in float {{design that}} has gained {{interest}} {{is the ability to}} transport large payloads in an efficient and persistent manner, on the orders of one ton over a period of many months. Traditional thrusters are unable to perform this mission for a long duration because of their high continuous energy usage. Additionally, the large scientific measurement payloads are traditionally repositioned using a ship. The project 2 ̆ 7 s proposed solution is to design, build and test a variable buoyancy system integrated onto a float whose purpose is to use the oceans currents as its main transport mechanism. ^ The buoyancy system was based on a closed pump-bladder configuration, where hydraulic fluid is pumped from a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> to rigid pressure tanks to control its buoyancy. After design and construction, initial bench testing was conducted, followed by tank testing in the OCE Acoustics tank and a final bay test in the west passage of Narragansett Bay. Performance characteristics of the float were found to draw an average of 4. 6 W over a 12 hour submergence-surfacing cycle and was able to change its buoyancy by 25 lbs over a 15 minute period. The float was also able to travel approximately 5 nautical miles during the bay test over one ebb tidal cycle. The tank and bay test were successful in proving the concept of the design, though additional work is needed to for the float to overcome its current problems and failures as well as to achieve its longer term goals of obstacle avoidance, persistent operation, and global communications. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bladder {{cancer is}} the fourth most common {{malignancy}} in men, with a recurrence rate of 33 - 64 %. Tumor documentation during cystoscopy of the bladder is suboptimal and might {{play a role in}} these high recurrence rates. OBJECTIVE: In this project, a bladder registration and navigation system was developed to improve bladder tumor documentation and consequently increase reproducibility of the cystoscopy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The bladder registration and navigation system consists of a stereo-tracker that tracks the location of a newly developed target, which is attached to the endoscope during cystoscopy. With this information the urology registration and navigation software is able to register the 3 D position of a lesion of interest. Simultaneously, the endoscopic image is captured in order to combine it with this 3 D position. To enable navigation, navigational cues are displayed on the monitor, which subsequently direct the cystoscopist to the previously registered lesion. To test the system, a rigid and a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> phantom was developed. The system's robustness was tested by measuring the accuracy of registering and navigating the lesions. Different calibration procedures were compared. It was also tested whether system accuracy is limited by using a previously saved calibration, to avoid surgical delay due to calibration. Urological application was tested by comparing a rotational camera (fixed to the rotating endoscope) to a non-rotational camera (dangling by gravity) used in standard urologic practice. Finally, the influence of volume differences on registering and navigating was tested. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The bladder registration and navigation system has an acceptable accuracy for bladder lesion registration and navigation. Limitations for patient determinants included changes in bladder volume and bladder deformation. In vivo studies are required to measure the effect of these limitations and functionality in urological practice as a tool to increase reproducibility of the cystoscopy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to use experimental, {{analytical}} and computational (Computational Fluid Dynamic - CFD) methodologies to investigate so-called highly transient axi-symmetric squeeze flows. These flows occur between two co-axial and parallel discs which are subjected to an impact, arising from a falling mass, which induces a constant energy squeezing system, as distinct from the traditionally investigated constant force or constant velocity squeezing systems. Experiments were conducted using a test cell comprising two parallel discs of diameter 120 mm with a <b>flexible</b> <b>bladder</b> used to contain fluid. This test cell was bolted onto {{the base of a}} drop-weight tester used to induce constant energy squeeze flows. Glycerine was used as the working fluid, the temperature of which was appropriately monitored. Disc separation, together with pressures (at three radial positions), were measured throughout the experimental stroke (typically less than 10 ms duration). Two additional pressure transducers (at the same radial position as the outermost transducer) were also used to monitor (and subsequently correct for) minor non-axi-symmetries that arose in the system. Approximately 150 tests were conducted, embracing combinations of drop height from 0. 1 to 1 m, drop mass from 10 to 55 kg and initial disc separation from 3 to 10 mm. Three elementary features were typically observed: a distinct preliminary pressure spike (1) immediately after impact corresponding to very large accelerations (exceeding over 6 km/s 2 in some experiments), a secondary major pressure spike (2) towards the termination of the stroke corresponding to diminishing disc separations and a bridging region (3) joining the two spikes corresponding to somewhat reduced pressures. While pressure distributions were observed to be closely parabolic during the major pressure spike, some uncertainty was present during the preliminary pressure spike, ascribed to sensitivities to deviations from axi-symmetry, and the likelihood of inertially generated pressures {{at the edge of the}} disc. By applying newly defined parameters of inertial composition 1 ̆ 00538 (which characterizes the ratio of temporal to spatial inertia effects) and dynamic Reynolds number 1 ̆ 007341 ̆ 007411 ̆ 00 bd 71 ̆ 00 bec 1 ̆ 00 be 1 (which represents the instantaneous ratio of inertial to viscous effects), it was established that the preliminary pressure spike is dominated by temporal inertia whereas the major pressure spike is viscous dominant. The former feature appears not to have been reported on in the formal literature. iii Four analytical models were considered, invoking the parallel flow assumption in conjunction with the Navier Stokes equations: an inviscid/inertial model, a viscous model (the lubrication approximation), a quasi-steady linear (QSL) model and a quasi-steady corrected linear (QSCL) model. The first two of these models, on incorporation of measured disc separations, and the derived velocities and accelerations, achieved acceptable correlations with pressure measurements (largely within uncertainty bounds) during the initial impact and towards the end of the stroke, respectively. The QSL model agreed satisfactorily with measurements throughout the entire duration of the experiment, while the QSCL model, by incorporating non-linear effects in an approximate linear way, yielded somewhat better correlations. By invoking the parallel flow assumption, all four models predict a parabolic radial pressure distribution. Utilizing a hypothetical case in which variations of disc separation, velocity and acceleration were considered (employing similar magnitudes and timescales to those that were measured), outputs of the QSL model yielded results that correlated closely with CFD predictions, while the QSCL data were somewhat better. On the basis of the CFD data it was also inferred that, within practical uncertainty bounds, the parallel flow assumption was valid for the range of disc separation to radius ratios embraced in the current investigation...|$|E
