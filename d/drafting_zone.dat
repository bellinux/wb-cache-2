40|$|Conventional ring {{spinning}} {{is known as}} traditional spinning system and it is most widely used system in textile industry. Despite being the most prevalent system and supplying approximately 60 % of short-staple yarn production, {{there are still some}} limitations as lower production rate, longer production flow and higher production costs. That is why, researches in textiles started to accelerate to develop alternative spinning systems. Siro-spun spinning system which is an important type of twist spinning, had been developed with the aim of reducing yarn manufacturing costs by eliminating plying and twisting processes in the production flow. The main principle of Siro-spun spinning is to feed two parallel fibre strands in <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> and allow these two fibre strands twist together on each other when they leave the front roller. In this study, it was aimed to compare the properties of two ply yarns produced by {{ring spinning}} system and Siro-spun spinning system. For this purpose, properties of Ne 40 / 2 yarns made of cotton, Tencel, polyester and micro Modal were analysed. Results showed that Siro-spun yarns have lower hairiness and unevenness than ring-spun yarns, besides mechanical properties of both spinning systems are approximate. Besides the advantages in terms of production costs, it can be also concluded that Siro-spun spinning system is a strong alternative of conventional system in terms of many yarn characteristics...|$|E

40|$|A peloton may {{be defined}} as two or more cyclists riding in {{sufficiently}} close proximity to be located either {{in one of two}} basic positions: 1) behind cyclists in zones of reduced air pressure, referred to as 'drafting', or 2) in zones of highest air pressure, described here alternately as 'riding at the front', 'in the wind', or in 'non-drafting positions'. Cyclists in <b>drafting</b> <b>zones</b> expend less energy than in front positions. Two broad models of peloton dynamics are explored. The first is an energetic model that describes peloton dynamics that oscillate through observable phase states as they emerge from collision avoidance and riders' coupled energy outputs. These phases exhibit behavioural characteristics such as convection patterns and synchronization, among others. Under the second, economic model, we discuss some basic parameters of the peloton as a system of economic exchange, and identify the resources within a peloton for which riders compete and cooperate. These include the energy savings of drafting, a near-front positional resource, and an information resource. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 1 Appendi...|$|R

40|$|Recent struggles over {{coastal zone}} policy in India {{make it a}} fertile site within which to map the actors, institutions, and knowledges {{involved}} in contemporary ecological governance. In 2007, the government <b>drafted</b> a coastal <b>zone</b> policy that marked a shift from the previous regulation approach based on hard boundaries and prohibitions, to a management framework using Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies and new scientific technologies to draw up flexible localised plans. The new policy suffered a reversal, however, when a concerted civil society campaign of opposition forced its withdrawal {{and a return to}} the earlier regulatory approach, albeit with numerous modifications. This paper argues that the power of the campaign was not just political, but also informational. It traces the multiple and intersecting trajectories through which knowledges are developed, transmitted, and employed. In particular, what emerges is the role of an important ′straddling′ or ′interface′ layer of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and technical ′experts,′ and the role of new information technologies and technologies of governance in enabling a cross-cutting circulation of knowledges.

40|$|Air {{movement}} {{is one of}} the six main variables determirzing human thermal comfort; air temperature, relative humidity, mean radiant temperature, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation are the others. Recently, HVACde sign in;zovations, energy conservation concerns, and new laboratory data on fan cooling and drafts have brought substantial ~tttention to the issue of acceptable levels of air movement in qO’ice environments. Thermal comjort standards for indoor occupancy include air movement limits that are constructed from often conflicting evidence and are frequently difficult to apply. A primary reason is that, while air movement can provide desirable cooling in "warm" conditions, it can also increase the risk of unacceptably cool <b>drafts.</b> The transition <b>zone</b> from desirable cooling to uncomfortable draft is a complicated function of physics, physiology, and human expectation. This work focuses on air movement for cooling in the expected temperature range, 25. 5 °C to 28 [...] 5 °C, of this transition zone. Fifty-four human subjects were given control of the air supply velocity from a desk fan (FAN), a floor-mounted diffuser (FMD). and a desk-mounted diffuser (DMD) single ambient air temperature. The subjects were asked to adjust the air movement as they pleased to make themselves comfortable. These tests encompassed the full temperature range of the "transition zone," 25. 5 °C to 28. 5 °C.

40|$|The Irish Sea Science Co-ordination Group (ISSCG) {{identified}} human {{impacts on}} the coastal zone as a priority area for collaborative Irish Sea marine environmental research and protection (Boelens, 1995). The identification of trends in human use of the coastal zone {{is considered to be}} an essential prerequisite to better planning of measures to manage particular activities. The study presented here on trends in human activity in coastal zones of the Maritime INTERREG II region of the southern Irish Sea was carried out by the Coastal Resources Centre (CRC) in University College, Cork, and the Centre for Research into Environment and Health (CREH) in the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. The study considered aspects of development and human impacts within the coastal zone. Once trends relating to human activities were identified, and where possible quantified, associated impacts and issues were also assessed and quantified. Trends and impacts were identified by sector, in keeping with the format adopted in the environmental assessment report entitled Ireland’s Marine and Coastal Areas and adjacent Seas (Boelens et al., 1999). Sectoral trends examined in the present study included those in demography, development, tourism, urbanisation, marine pollution, offshore resources, etc. The attributes of the associated data were assessed in relation to the purposes for which they are used, and gaps and limitations were identified. Recommendations on appropriate management measures necessary to promote sustainable use of coastal zones were made. In actuality, data on human {{impacts on the}} coastal zone of the Irish Sea are not available in an integrated form. Agencies involved in making policy decisions or in managing the use of coastal marine resources often experience difficulties in obtaining reliable information on key factors. During the preparation of this report, data were difficult to source, and when sourced they were rarely in a format suitable for analysis with regard to relevance to the coastal zone. The study concluded that the quality of information available is variable and not conducive to a systematic, comparative analysis of combined impacts of activities on the coastal zone. The information and statistics that are collected by state agencies are intended {{to meet the needs of}} specific sectoral or geographical interests, and are not necessarily appropriate for extrapolation to issues of relevance to the coastal zone. The lack of availability of information in a format suitable for assessing the characteristics of the coastal zone as an entity may be indicative of the lack of recognition, on both sides of the Irish Sea, of coastal zone management as a discipline. This limitation is identified in the <b>draft</b> coastal <b>zone</b> management policy for Ireland (Brady Shipman Martin, 1997) as the principal element to be addressed for effective future planning. The findings of the current project suggest that this limitation remains. Similarly in Wales, no single body is responsible for coastal zone management. Neither is there an agreed framework within which policy and planning can be properly integrated. Without such a thematic focus in either country it is difficult to ensure the collection and collation of pertinent data and information. Such information is imperative for making effective policy and management decisions for the coastal zone of the Irish Sea. Throughout this study, differences with regard to issues of relevance to the Irish and Welsh coasts became apparent. For example, the Welsh coast has not experienced the same extent of population pressures, development, resort renewal, habitat loss etc. commonplace in Ireland. In comparison, Wales has several coastal fora that provide a focus for co-operation between regulatory agencies and local stakeholders; this concept is as yet undeveloped in Ireland. The report assesses the impact of human activities on the coastal zone and contains recommendations related to data and information needs for effective coastal zone management, as well as sector-specific recommendations. Implementation of the recommendations of the project will be of benefit to the work of policy makers, resource managers and planners with responsibilities in the coastal zone, on both sides of the Irish Sea.

40|$|Acoustic Doppler current {{profilers}} (ADCPs) {{were used}} to measure water velocities in the tailrace at John Day Dam over a two-week period in February 2005. Data were collected by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Hydraulic Design Section, Portland District, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The objective of this project was therefore to collect field measurements of water velocities in the near-field <b>draft</b> tube exit <b>zone</b> {{as well as the}} far-field tailrace to be used for improving these models. Field data were collected during the project using five separate ADCPs. Mobile ADCP data were collected using two ADCPs mounted on two separate boats. Data were collected by either holding the boat on-station at pre-defined locations for approximately 10 minutes or in moving transect mode when the boat would move over large distances during the data collection. Results from the mobile ADCP survey indicated a complex hydrodynamic flow field in the tailrace downstream of John Day Dam. A large gyre was noted between the skeleton section of the powerhouse and non-spilling portion of the spillway. Downstream of the spillway, the spillway flow is constrained against the navigation lock guide wall, and large velocities were noted in this region. Downstream of the guide wall, velocities decreased as the spillway jet dispersed. Near the tailrace island, the flow split was measured to be approximately equal on Day 2 (25. 4 kcfs spillway/ 123 kcfs total). However, approximately 60 % of the flow passed along the south shore of the island on Day 1 (15. 0 kcfs spillway/ 150 kcfs total). At a distance of 9000 ft downstream of the dam, flows had equalized laterally and were generally uniform over the cross section. The collection of water velocities near the draft tube exit of an operating turbine unit is not routine, and equipment capable of measuring 3 D water velocities in these zones are at the forefront of hydraulic measurement technology. Although the feasibility of measuring 1 D water velocity magnitudes has been previously demonstrated by the authors, the feasibility of resolving 3 D water velocity vectors given the heterogeneity of the flow field was unknown before this study’s data were collected. Both the 1 D and 3 D data were collected by deploying three ADCPs on dual-axis rotators directly above the draft tube exit of Turbine Unit 16. These instruments collected 1 D data during both the mobile reconnaissance campaign and a later one-week period with zero spillway discharge. During the zero spillway discharge period, Turbine Unit 16 was operated over a range of discharges. Approximately 12 hours of 1 D velocity data were collected at low (12 kcfs), middle (16. 2 kcfs), and high (19. 2 kcfs) turbine discharges. The 1 D dataset indicates large differences in flow patterns and RMS velocity fluctuations among the various discharge levels. Results from this project show that it is technically feasible to measure 3 D water velocities directly downstream of an operating turbine unit using a narrow beam swath (i. e., 6 -degree) ADCP. Data products from these 3 D velocity data include a measurement of the draft tube barrel flow distribution (a. k. a., the flow split), directional changes and the general decay of velocity as flow exits the draft tube and enters the tailrace, and a relative measure of the homogeneity of the flow field...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the flow in draft tubes on hydro turbines, with different runner cone configurations, operating in the part load operating range. Dynamic wall pressure measurements on a model Francis pump-turbine and two prototype Francis turbines have been performed. The velocity distribution in the draft tube cone has been captured using two-dimensional Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) on the model pump-turbine. Video recordings of the visualized flow in the draft tube cone were performed on the model, to investigate the typical behaviour of the characteristic rotating vortex rope. Time-dependent wall pressure measurements for eleven different runner cone configurations and a grid of twelve operating points in the part load operating range were executed for the model. A semi-tapered cone were attached to the hub of the runner for ten of the runner cone configurations, whilst the eleventh beeing the original runner cone configuration. The attached cones were tested with three diameters and each at three different lengths. 2 D velocity measurements with LDV were performed for two operating points in the part load operating range for four of the runner cone configurations. This involved the three different diameter semi-tapered cones with length 2. 95 D and the original runner cone. Two components of the velocity vector, the longitudinal and the tangential, were measured in two measurement planes in the draft tube cone. A Rotating Vortex Rope (RVR) in the draft tube cone at part load is a periodic phenomenon. Each velocity measurement obtained by LDV must be referenced to the phase of the periodic phenomenon. This is achieved by phase-averaging the velocity data based on wall pressure data, i. e. the static wall pressure values acquired simultaneously with the LDV-samples. Video recording was performed at the two part load operating points for all eleven runner cone configurations. Visualization of the RVR was achieved by lowering the pressure downstream the runner to vaporize the vortex rope. For the original runner cone configuration, the results show a strong periodic behaviour for the pressure- and velocity field in the draft tube cone. It is suggested that the RVR is a phenomenon occurring after vortex breakdown, and is analog to a precessing vortex core. The semi-tapered cones influence the flow field in the draft tube, thus in the runner as well. The adverse pressure gradient in the draft tube is affected through the change in the cross-sectional area. The pressure gradient decreases as the diameter of the semi-tapered cone increases, hence this leads to a suppression of the RVR and a reduction of <b>draft</b> tube backflow <b>zones.</b> For the largest semi-tapered cone, the flow field shows almost no sign of the RVR, i. e. the flow field is stationary rotating. Wall pressure fluctuation measurements was carried out on the draft tube wall of two prototype Francis turbines. The measurements were performed for different runner cone configurations, throughout the operating range for the turbines. For the Litjfossen power plant the results indicate that both of the attached devices have a damping effect on the pressure fluctuations in the draft tube cone for high part load operation, compared to the original runner cone. For lower part load operation the devices are too small to affect the RVR significantly. For the Oksla power plant the attached cylinder is too small to give any significant damping of the pressure fluctuations on part load. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
