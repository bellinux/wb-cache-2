40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} neural network method for estimating daily global solar irradiation in the horizontal surface by meteorological data in Indonesia. The database consists of 1826 daily measured data, in term of sunshine duration, average temperature, average relative humidity and global solar irradiation. The data has been collected in Jakarta (altitude 6 ° 15 ’S, longitude 106 ° 45 ’E), a city as capital of Indonesia. The 1461 daily measured data between 2005 and 2008 are used to train the neural networks while the data for 365 days in 2009 are used as testing data. The estimation of global solar irradiation were made using four combinations of proposed model of data sets namely: (i) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> relative humidity and <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> temperature as inputs, (ii) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> relative humidity and sunshine duration as inputs, (iii) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> temperature and sunshine duration as inputs, (iv) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> relative humidity, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> temperature and <b>daily</b> sunshine duration as inputs. The output for the four combinations proposed model is <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> global solar irradiation. The comparison result show that the best model to estimate global solar irradiation is performed by (iii) and (iv) that obtain the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) at below 10 %...|$|R

40|$|Wind is the {{principal}} driver in the wind erosion models. The hourly wind speed data were generally required for precisely wind erosion modeling. In this study, a simple method to generate hourly wind speed data from daily wind statistics (<b>daily</b> <b>average</b> and maximum wind speeds together or <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> wind speed only) was established. A typical windy location with 3285 days (9 years) measured hourly wind speed data were used to validate the downscaling method. The {{results showed that the}} overall agreement between observed and simulated cumulative wind speed probability distributions appears excellent, especially for the wind speeds greater than 5 m s- 1 range (erosive wind speed). The results further revealed that the values of <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> erosive wind power density (AWPD) calculated from generated wind speeds fit the counterparts computed from measured wind speeds well with high models' efficiency (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient). So that the hourly wind speed data can be predicted from <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> and maximum wind speed data or only <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> wind speed data, respectively. Further studies are needed to examine the findings for inter-site wind data. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures and 1 tabl...|$|R
