Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> salary, for five months. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo did {{not enjoy}} a {{harmonious}} relationship with his elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> allowance. Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, had no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the {{serialisation}} of Cigars that Wallez was embroiled in a scandal after {{he was accused of}} defaming the Bureau of Public Works. The accusation resulted in a legal case being brought against the newspaper, and in response its owners demanded Wallez's resignation, which was tended in August 1933. Without Wallez, Hergé became despondent, and in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> salary was increased from 2000 and 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E

5|$|The text of {{the short}} work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a {{connecting}} recitative. The topic is to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed {{it as part of}} <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.|$|E
5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E
5|$|Hergé sought work {{elsewhere}} too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon Marché department store, and The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West for {{the rival}} L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although {{neither of them}} were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged {{to do so by}} Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Ali {{delegated}} {{the administrative}} affairs of Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar (also {{known by the}} title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar) {{and spent most of}} his time in Malacca. Muar was sparsely populated in 1855 and had a population of 800 and no formal structure of government was formed. In 1860, Sultan Ali reportedly borrowed $53,600 from a Chettiar money lender, Kavana Chana Shellapah. Sultan Ali signed an agreement with Shellapah to contribute a portion of <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> allowance to repay his debt. However, Sultan Ali found himself unable to settle his debts in time, and an angry Shellapah wrote to the British government in 1866. Pressured to liquidate his debts in time, Sultan Ali granted Shellapah the right to trade off Muar to the Temenggong of Johor as mortgage if he is unable to pay off his debts in time.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron next saw {{action in}} late 1944. From late October {{it and the}} other units of No.71 Wing {{conducted}} attacks on Rabaul and other locations in New Britain to support the Australian 5th Division's Landing at Jacquinot Bay and subsequent operations on the island. Between December 1944 and January 1945, No.6 Squadron moved to Dobodura airfield, from where it continued to support Australian Army operations in New Britain and the Aitape–Wewak area of New Guinea. There were few targets within range of Dobodura, however, and the squadron saw little combat during 1945. Despite the limited nature of the raids conducted from Dobodura, the squadron's offensive operations were hampered by a shortage of bombs. A detachment of six aircraft was deployed to Tadji between late April and 13 May to participate in attacks on Japanese positions near Wewak alongside Beauforts from No.7, No.8, No.15 and No.100 Squadrons. The squadron conducted little operational flying from late May, and in June its commander recommended in <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> report that No.6 Squadron be either disbanded or re-equipped and sent to a more active area. RAAF Headquarters {{did not respond to}} this proposal, and many other Australian squadrons were similarly under-employed at the time. The squadron's last combat operations were undertaken by a detachment of two Beauforts which were deployed to Biak during July; these aircraft bombed Japanese positions in the area alongside P-40 Kittyhawks operated by No.120 (NEI) Squadron. Following {{the end of the war}} the squadron dropped leaflets to advise Japanese troops that their country had surrendered and continued to make anti-submarine patrols. In September all of the squadron's aircrew were posted to units located further from Australia and were replaced by aircrew from these squadrons. The squadron also began regular courier flights between Dobodura and Milne Bay during the month. No.6 Squadron remained at Dobodura until 18 October 1945, when it returned to Australia and was disbanded at Kingaroy, Queensland on the 31st of the month. The squadron suffered 35 fatalities during World War II.|$|E

25|$|With {{financial}} assistance from his father, Haarmann and his fiancée opened a fishmongery. Haarmann himself briefly attempted {{to work as}} an insurance salesman, before being officially classified as disabled and unable to work by the military in 1904. As a result, <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> military pension was increased. The same year, his fiancée—pregnant with his child—terminated their engagement. According to Haarmann, this ultimatum had occurred when he had accused his fiancée of conducting an affair. As the fishmongery had been registered in her name, Erna Haarmann simply ordered her husband to leave the premises.|$|E

25|$|In 1859, Pantazi Ghica joined Dimitrie Bolintineanu in editing {{the journal}} Dâmboviţa, but, {{just a year}} later, his {{articles}} were {{the subject of a}} scandal, and he was arrested for allegedly breaking the ethics of journalism. He shared a cell with his colleague, N. T. Orăşanu, a noted adversary of Carol's rule. He was also an associate of the writer Alexandru Odobescu, and, after 1861, collaborated on <b>his</b> <b>monthly</b> literary magazine Revista Română. It was here that he published a critical review of Ciocoii vechi şi noi, a novel by his friend Nicolae Filimon, which upset the latter (as a consequence, relations between the two soured). For a while during those years, Ghica edited two satirical magazine, Păcală (named in honor of the eponymous folk hero) and Scrânciobul.|$|E

Mote was committed for trial at Chichester Crown Court on 27 April 2004. He would face nine charges of false accounting and one charge of making a false representation.

The following month, the UK Independence Party withdrew the whip from Mote on 15 July 2004 after learning from an article in The Daily Telegraph that he faced trial; Mote had failed to inform his party of the impending charges.|$|E
