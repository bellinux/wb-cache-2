500|$|On August 10, 2012, Beyoncé {{appeared}} at the Assembly for the rehearsals prior to the performance. Julia Stiles, The-Dream and Diane Warren were the celebrities who attended the performance. Prior to the performing the song, Beyoncé met with United Nations leader Ban Ki-moon. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, announced Beyoncé's performance giving a short introduction about the singer: [...] "Tonight [...] brings more than her stunning talents; she brings inspiration to help another person, to help another human being". He further recalled a [...] "dark day {{in the history of}} the U.N." [...] when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives in a terrorist attack in Iraq on August 19, 2003 adding that the event and the World Humanitarian Day both honor those lost lives and encourage others to join the effort. He further interviewed guests whose relatives lost their lives in the accident. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos also appeared encouraging everyone to log on to the website WHD-IWasHere.org by August 19 and commit to doing one good act to help someone in need further saying, [...] "I told Beyoncé: It's great that we have her, because she can reach millions of people. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> the rest of my life doing what I do, and I wouldn't reach a 10th of that number. And she said: 'Don't sell yourself short.'.|$|E

It {{was reported that}} he smoked between sixty and sixty-five cigarettes a day, equivalent to roughly three packs. See It Now was the first television program to have a report about the connection between smoking and cancer; Murrow said during the show that [...] "I doubt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> a half hour without a cigarette with any comfort or ease."

6000|$|My {{accession}} to these august offices does {{not at all}} decide the question of my remaining here permanently. I told Mr. Ripley that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> the winter at the farm, {{and that it was}} quite uncertain whether I returned in the spring. [...] .|$|R

5000|$|The {{date of the}} [...] "Immortal Beloved" [...] letter -- 6/7 July 1812 -- has {{meanwhile}} been firmly established, {{not only}} by watermarks and references, but also by a later letter by Beethoven to Rahel Varnhagen, which suggests he must have met his [...] "Immortal Beloved" [...] on 3 July 1812: [...] "I am sorry, dear V., that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> the last evening in Prague with you, and I myself found it impolite, but a circumstance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not foresee prevented me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would," [...] {{answered}} Honora. [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear to <b>spend</b> {{three years in}} such--in such an anomalous condition.

Women danced in my honour, people gave small presents, &c., but no volunteers. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{talk with them}} with sufficient ease; and took my time, lying at my ease on a good mat with cane pillow, Anaiteum fashion. I {{told them that they}} had seen on board many little fellows from many islands; that they need not fear to let their children go; that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> time and property in coming year by year and giving presents when they were unwilling to listen to what I said, but they only made unreal promises, put boys in the boat merely to take them out again, and so we went away atrakoi.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nay farther, {{the common}} motive of foreign adventures {{was taken away}} in me; for I had no fortune to make, I had nothing to seek: if I had gained ten {{thousand}} pounds, I had been no richer; for I had already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to, and that I had was visibly increasing; for having no great family, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> the income of what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands.|$|R

"It {{might be}} a good thing," [...] he mused, [...] "to take a couple who had passed their whole life here in New York, too poor and too busy ever to go; and had a perfect famine for Europe all the time. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have them <b>spend</b> their Sunday afternoons going aboard the {{different}} boats, and looking up their accommodations. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have them sail, in imagination, and discover an imaginary Europe, and give their grotesque misconceptions of it from travels and novels against a background of purely American experience. We needn't go abroad to manage that. I think it would be rather nice." ...|$|R

"Well, Sir Mungo," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch, [...] "this is all {{no doubt}} very consolatory; but I hope the king will spare {{my hand to}} fight for him in battle, where, {{notwithstanding}} all your kind encouragement, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> my blood much more cheerfully than on a scaffold." ...|$|E

6000|$|And now all was over! Oh God, {{to think}} that my hopes should be {{shattered}} in so short a time, that the ship should be so soon tossed about in the storm, and the stars hidden by the clouds! And the past delight made the present darkness all the more bitter. I groaned. In my misery I uttered a prayer to God to help me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not think <b>I</b> should live henceforth. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> go on existing with this aching void in my heart? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> days and weeks and years always with this despair. It was too terrible to last. My reason told me that time would remedy it; but time was so long, and what misery must I go through before the wound was healed! And as I thought of what I had lost, my agony grew more unbearable. It grew vivid, and I felt Giulia in my arms. I panted as I pressed my lips against hers, and I said to her,-- ...|$|R

Mrs Aldine Oosthuyzen for helping me with the processing and interpretation of the statistical data. My family for their patience when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> time with them.

60|$|At first, in unfrequented ways, I passed {{people only}} one by one, some woman walking rapidly with averted face, or {{a pair of}} {{chattering}} students; but as I came near {{the centre of the}} town the passers-by grew more frequent, and suddenly I found myself {{in the midst of a}} thronging, noisy crowd. I looked up and saw that I was opposite a theatre; the people had just come from the second funcion. I had heard that the natives of Cadiz were eager theatre-goers, and was curious to see how they took this pleasure. I saw also that the next piece was Las Borrachos, a play of Seville life that I had often seen; and I felt that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> my last evening better than in living again some of those scenes which pattered across my heart now like little sorrowful feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "You silly boy!" [...] she said, {{five minutes}} afterwards. [...] "Of course, I {{thought of it}} all along. I never made any secret of it to your father. I told him that our escape was like a fairy tale, and {{that it must have}} the same ending: 'and they married, and lived happy ever after.' He would never have let me have my way with the house, had I not confided in him. He said that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> my money as I pleased, on myself, but that not one penny should be laid out on his house; and I was obliged to tell him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{owing to}} this absurd freak of my aunt in making me her heir when my income was already {{five times as}} much as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend,</b> I have the {{nuisance}} of a large landed estate on my hands. There is a large house upon it which I suppose Marion and I will have to occupy occasionally; and there is another house, which is known as the dower house, and which is a very snug and comfortable abode. Now, it is quite clear that I am the last sort of man to look after an estate. It would worry me most out of my mind, and would be a perpetual annoyance.|$|E
6000|$|And I had no regrets. I was proud. I {{had shown}} them <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> {{with the best}} of them. Amongst strong men I had proved myself strong. I had {{clinched}} again, as I had often clinched, my right to the title of [...] "Prince." [...] Also, my attitude may be considered, in part, as a reaction from my childhood's meagreness and my childhood's excessive toil. Possibly my inchoate thought was: Better to reign among booze-fighters a prince than to toil twelve hours a day at a machine for ten cents an hour. There are no purple passages in machine toil. But if the spending of one hundred and eighty dollars in twelve hours isn't a purple passage, then I'd like to know what is.|$|E

Really a very inexpensive hobby! <b>I</b> guess you <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> $2,500 {{in a couple of}} years playing golf or bowling. The test flight was a couple of hours long, and we had a lot of fun with a J-4 Cub and a Vagabond, all flying formation and taking pictures. It flies very stable, no bad habits, and cruises 55 to 60 mph. Takeoff is in 250 feet with climbout at 40 mph. Rate of climb is 600 feet/minute. Approach at 40 mph and land at about 28 mph. All speeds are indicated." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the evening}} of April 7, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited Medora on a presidential tour of the Western United States. Most of the Badlands' {{residents}} turned out to greet him on his whistle stop. Roosevelt later recalled that “the entire population of the Badlands down to the smallest baby had gathered to meet me… They all felt I was their man, their old friend; {{and even if they}} had been hostile to me in the old days when we were divided by the sinister bickering and jealousies and hatreds of all frontier communities, they now firmly believed they had always been my staunch friends and admirers. I shook hands with them all and…I only regretted that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>spend</b> three hours with them." [...] A local hotel changed its name that same year to the Rough Riders Hotel. In 1986 the hotel was purchased and operated by the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation.|$|R

If <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>spend</b> {{all my time}} {{flying around}} the way Flitter does. I'd go on long {{journeys}} and see the Great World. I'd fly way, {{way up in the}} blue, blue sky, the way Ol' Mistah Buzzard does, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look down and see all that {{is going on in the}} Green Forest and on the Green Meadows. And I'd fly in the daytime, because there is more going on then. I wonder, now, why it is that Flitter never comes out until after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple Hills. I never see him in the daytime, and I don't even know where he keeps himself. I never thought of it before, but I wonder why it is that he flies only at night. I believe I'll ask Grandfather Frog the very next time I see him." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{presents}} {{were after}} that in gold, and very frequent and large, often a hundred pistoles, never less than fifty at a time; and I must do myself the justice that I seemed rather backward to receive than craving and encroaching. Not that I had not an avaricious temper, {{nor was it}} that I did not foresee that this was my harvest, in which I was to gather up, {{and that it would}} not last long; but it was that really his bounty always anticipated my expectations, and even my wishes; and he gave me money so fast that he rather poured it in upon me than left me room to ask it; so that, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> fifty pistoles, I had always a hundred to make it up.|$|E
60|$|I {{found it}} a relief, at Winterbourne Bishop, {{to be in a}} country which had nothing to draw a man out of a town. A wide, empty land, with nothing on it to look at but a furze-bush; or when I had gained the summit of the down, and to get a little higher still stood on the top of one of its many barrows, a sight of the distant village, its low, grey or reddish-brown cottages half hidden among its few trees, the square, stone tower of its little church looking at a {{distance}} no taller than a milestone.

60|$|It doesn't pay to {{go behind}} the scenes and see the angel-voiced tenor beat his wife. Well, I'd been behind, and I was paying for it. Or else I was a fool.

On the other hand, it must be stated that on rare occasions, on very rare occasions, I did meet rare souls, or fools like me, with whom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> magnificent hours among the stars, or in the paradise of fools. I {{was married to a}} rare soul, or a fool, who never bored me and who was always a source of new and unending surprise and delight. But I could not spend all my hours solely in her company.|$|E
