5|$|One notorious tengu {{from the}} 12th century was himself {{the ghost of}} an emperor. The Hōgen Monogatari {{tells the story of}} Emperor Sutoku, who was forced by his father to abandon the throne. When he later raised the Hōgen Rebellion to take back the country from Emperor Go-Shirakawa, he was {{defeated}} and exiled to Sanuki Province in Shikoku. According to legend he died in torment, having sworn to haunt the nation of Japan as a great demon, and thus became a fearsome tengu with long nails and <b>eyes</b> <b>like</b> a kite's.|$|E

500|$|The hind limbs were {{slender and}} of {{moderate}} length. Like the hands, the feet were very large. When resting, {{the heels of}} the legs barely overlapped each other. If stretched forward up the length of the body, the tibiotarsal articulation (the [...] "ankle") would reach beyond the <b>eyes.</b> <b>Like</b> the arms, a fringe of scalloped skin also extended from the heel {{to the base of the}} foot on each leg, continuing as a low ridge to the base of the disc of the fifth toe. The toes, like the fingers, possessed flattened discs at the tips, though they were slightly smaller in diameter. The tubercles on the tipmost joints of the fifth toes were larger than all of the other subarticular tubercles on the toes. Interspersed between them were numerous small and conical tubercles. The toes were also fully webbed.|$|E

500|$|Eston's sons also {{enlisted in}} the Union Army, both as white men from Madison, Wisconsin. His first son John Wayles Jefferson had red hair and gray <b>eyes</b> <b>like</b> his {{grandfather}} Jefferson. By the 1850s, John Jefferson in his 20s was the proprietor of the American Hotel in Madison. [...] At one time he operated it with his younger brother Beverley.

500|$|This highly nuanced {{and largely}} {{theatrical}} letter was unsigned, {{but she had}} included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems.

Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my <b>eyes</b> <b>like</b> the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo.

500|$|Seventh song [...] "Que Vuelvas" [...] {{is another}} song {{inspired}} by {{her relationship with}} Ríos. It was musically compared to Shakira's past single [...] "Estoy Aquí" [...] (1996). The following track, [...] "Tú", lyrically expresses the sweetness of love, with Shakira singing: [...] "Porque eres tú mi sol, la fe con que vivo" [...] and [...] "nunca podré vivir sin ti". The ninth song is [...] "Dónde Están los Ladrones?", a guitar-driven song which criticizes the politic and social reality in South American nations {{at the time of}} the album's release. She sings, [...] "Los han visto por ahí, los han visto en los tejados, dando vueltas en París, condenando en los juzgados. Con la nariz empolvada, de corbata o de blue jeans, los has visto en las portadas todas, sin más nada que decir". Finally, she sentences the aristocracy singing, [...] "Los han visto en los cócteles todos repartiendo ministerios". The following track on Dónde Están los Ladrones? is [...] "Sombra de Ti". During the song, Shakira remembers a past love, singing, [...] "Todas las palabras que dijimos, y los besos que nos dimos, como siempre, hoy estoy pensando en ti". The album's closing song [...] "Ojos Así" [...] is accompanied by a [...] "Lambadalike middle eastern rhythm".
