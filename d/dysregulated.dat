5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors support this model; for example, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced efflux at the MAM and preventing collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that <b>dysregulated</b> mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor suppressors includes a few that are enriched at the MAM.|$|E

In JE the tight regulation of microglial activation appears to be disturbed, resulting in an autotoxic loop of microglial activation that possibly leads to bystander neuronal damage.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) viral protein R (Vpr) plays {{a crucial role}} in viral replication and pathogenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, translocation of preintegration complex, potentiation of glucocorticoid action, impairment of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and T-cell activation. Recent studies involving the direct effects of Vpr on DCs and T cells indicated that HIV- 1 containing Vpr selectively impairs phenotypic maturation, cytokine network, and antigen presentation in DCs and <b>dysregulates</b> costimulatory molecules and cytokine production in T cells. Here, we have further investigated the indirect effect of HIV- 1 Vpr+ virus-infected DCs on the bystander CD 8 + T-cell population. Our results indicate that HIV- 1 Vpr+ virus-infected DCs <b>dysregulate</b> CD 8 + T-cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Vpr-containing virus-infected DC-mediated CD 8 + T-cell killing occurred in part through enhanced tumor necrosis factor alpha production by infected DCs and subsequent induction of death receptor signaling and activation of the caspase 8 -dependent pathway in CD 8 + T cells. Collectively, these results provide evidence that Vpr {{could be one of the}} important contributors to the host immune escape by HIV- 1 through its ability to <b>dysregulate</b> both directly and indirectly the DC biology and T-cell functions...|$|R
25|$|In abusive relationships, {{there may}} be a cycle of abuse during which {{tensions}} rise and an act of violence is committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, fear, shame, or to protect children. As a result of abuse, victims may experience physical disabilities, chronic health problems, mental illness, limited finances, and poor ability to create healthy relationships. Victims may experience psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Children who live in a household with violence often show psychological problems from an early age, such as <b>dysregulated</b> aggression which may later contribute to continuing the legacy of abuse when they reach adulthood.|$|E
25|$|In DIC, the {{processes}} of coagulation and fibrinolysis are <b>dysregulated,</b> {{and the result is}} widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called tissue factor (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumor necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This {{plays a major role in}} the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This helps to explain why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon exposure to blood and platelets, TF binds with activated factor VIIa (normally present in trace amounts in the blood), forming the extrinsic tenase complex. This complex further activates factor IX and X to IXa and Xa, respectively, leading to the common coagulation pathway and the subsequent formation of thrombin and fibrin.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To {{demonstrate}} how dysbiosis {{of the human}} microbiome can drive autoimmune disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Humans are superorganisms. The human body harbors an extensive microbiome, which {{has been shown to}} differ in patients with autoimmune diagnoses. Intracellular microbes slow innate immune defenses by <b>dysregulating</b> the vitamin D nuclear receptor, allowing pathogens to accumulate in tissue and blood. Molecular mimicry between pathogen and host causes further dysfunction by interfering with human protein interactions. Autoantibodies may well be created in response to pathogens. SUMMARY: The catastrophic failure of human metabolism observed in autoimmune disease results from a common underlying pathogenesis-the successive accumulation of pathogens into the microbiome over time, and the ability of such pathogens to <b>dysregulate</b> gene transcription, translation, and human metabolic processes. Autoimmune diseases are more likely passed in families because of the inheritance of a familial microbiome, rather than Mendelian inheritance of genetic abnormalities.

2500|$|In {{order for}} cells to start {{dividing}} uncontrollably, genes that regulate cell growth must be <b>dysregulated.</b> Proto-oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and mitosis, whereas tumor suppressor genes discourage cell growth, or temporarily halt cell division {{to carry out}} DNA repair. Typically, a series of several mutations to these genes is required before a normal cell transforms into a cancer cell. This concept is sometimes termed [...] "oncoevolution." [...] Mutations to these genes provide the signals for tumor cells to start dividing uncontrollably. But the uncontrolled cell division that characterizes cancer also requires that the dividing cell duplicates all its cellular components to create two daughter cells. The activation of anaerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), which is not necessarily induced by mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, provides most of the building blocks required to duplicate the cellular components of a dividing cell and, therefore, is also essential for carcinogenesis.|$|E
