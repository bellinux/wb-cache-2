A fuel reactor with a fuel-injection system for liquid fuels {{was designed and}} built for a chemical-looping reactor with the nominal fuel input of 10 kWth. The gas velocities in the riser section and at the gas-distribution nozzles of this unit are {{comparable to those of}} industrial circulating fluidized-bed boilers. Reference experiments were performed with an ilmenite oxygen carrier and two different fuel blends that contained 40 wt. % and respectively 80 wt. % of vacuum residue in <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>1.</b> Fuel conversion was in line with that of experiments from an earlier campaign, where <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>1</b> was used as fuel. The fuel contained a significant fraction of sulfur, but no SO 2 was detected in the flue gas of the air reactor. More experiments were performed using an oxygen carrier based on calcium manganite. The oxygen carrier was exposed to fluidization at hot conditions (more than 600 °C) for about 95 h, out of which fuel was injected during a total of 9. 6 h. Undiluted vacuum residue, <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>1</b> as well as different blends of these two were used as fuel. Furthermore, the parameters fuel flow, fuel-reactor temperature and air flow in the air reactor were varied to observe trends in fuel conversion. The experiments were carried out with a fuel flow corresponding to 4. 0 - 6. 2 kWth and an oxygen carrier-to-fuel ratio of about 1300 - 2000 kg/MWth (fuel-reactor bed mass per thermal fuel-power). With undiluted vacuum residue as fuel and a fuel-reactor temperature of 1000 °C, up to 93 % of all carbon leaving the fuel reactor was in the form of CO 2. Carbon leakage from fuel reactor to air reactor was usually below 1 % for all fuel types tested, but no SO 2 was detected in the off-gas from the air reactor. The reactivity of the calcium manganite-based material decreased {{over the course of the}} experiments, which is likely due to sulfur poisoning.

40|$|In Kuwait, most of {{the power}} {{stations}} use fuel oil as the prime source of energy. The sulphur content (S%) of the fuel used {{as well as other}} factors have a direct impact on the ground level concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) released by power stations into the atmosphere. The SO 2 ground level concentration has to meet the environmental standards set by Kuwait Environment Public Authority (KEPA). In this communication we present results obtained using the Industrial Sources Complex Short Term (ISCST 3) model to calculate the SO 2 concentration resulting from existing power stations in Kuwait assuming zero background SO 2 concentration and entire reliance on Heavy <b>Fuel</b> <b>Oil.</b> <b>1,</b> 2, 3 and 4 S% scenarios were simulated for three emission cycle cases. The computed annual SO 2 concentrations were always less than KEPA standards for all scenarios. The daily SO 2 concentrations were within KEPA standards for 1 S% but violated KEPA standards for higher S%. In general, the concentrations obtained from the combined hourly and seasonal cycle were the lowest and those obtained from the no cycle case were the highest. The comparison between the results of the three cycles revealed that the violation times cannot be solely attributed to the increase in emissions and the meteorological conditions have to be taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|Many commercialjet fuels have {{basically}} the same composition as kerosene, but they are made under more stringent specifications than those for kerosene. Other commercial and miltary jet fuels {{are referred to as}} wide-cut fuels and are usually made by blending kerosene fractions with lower boiling streams to include more volatile hydrocarbons. Because the chemical composition of kerosene and most jet fuels is approximately similar, except for the additives, kerosene used for aviation purposes is described in this monograph. The other uses of kerosene, e. g., as a <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> or lamp oil, are described in the monograph on <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> (<b>Fuel</b> <b>Oil</b> No. <b>1).</b> Readily available commercial iluminating kerosene was the fuel chosen for early jet engines, largely because its use would not interfere with needs for gasoline, which was in short supply during wartime. The development of commercial jet aircraft following the Second W orld War centred primarily on the use of kerosene-type fuels. High-altitude flying requires fuel with a very low freezing-point; also, the fuel must be extremely clean (free of foreign matter), have a very low moisture content, burn cleanly (essentially free of smoke) and not cause corrosion of engine parts in prolonged service. Different types of engines used for different types of service require fuels with specifie chemical and physical properties, and individual specifications have evolved to meet these needs. As international jet service increased, fuels with similar characteristics had to be available worldwide. Thus, steps were taken to me et these needs, although sorne variation in specifications stil exists among different countries.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{a promising}} technology for future energy conversion {{on the basis}} of combustion of fossil fuels with inherent CO 2 separation. In comparison to other carbon-capture technologies {{there is no need for}} energy demanding gas separation in order to obtain pure CO 2. In the past, CLC research has mainly focused on the use of gaseous and solid fuels. This work the first comprehensive study of the use of liquid fuels in chemical-looping combustion. The work in the thesis includes (1) investigation of several different oxygen carriers based on nickel, iron, manganese and copper with kerosene as fuel, (2) design of an injection system for heavy liquid fuels for the fuel reactor of a pilot-scale chemical-looping reactor, (3) long-term operation of ilmenite oxygen carrier with a fuel oil in a pilot-scale unit and (4) tests with ilmenite oxygen carrier and a vacuum residue from Saudia Arabia as fuel. Experiments were conducted in a bench-scale reactor and in a pilot-scale reactor, and for each reactor a fuel injection system was designed and tested. Two types of kerosene, with and without sulphur, were tested in the bench-scale reactor during 240 h of fuel injection and a fuel input between 100 Wth and 580 Wth. In the pilot-scale system, a fuel oil type 1 and different blends of a vacuum residue and <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>1</b> were tested during 72 h of fuel operation. Here, the fuel input was varied between 4. 5 kWth and about 6 kWth. Six different oxygen-carrier materials, out of which four were synthesized and two were of mineral origin, were tested in the bench-scale unit. The different materials showed clear differences in fuel conversion and structural integrity. Ilmenite oxygen carrier, which is a mineral iron-titanium oxide, was found to have a high structural stability, which was unmatched by the synthesized materials. Fuel conversion, however, was significantly lower than that of the synthesized oxygen carriers, and it is likely that temperatures above 950 °C are needed in order to achieve reasonable conversion levels. Long-term testing was carried out with the ilmenite oxygen carried in the pilot-scale reactor system. The conditions in this unit are much harsher than those in the bench-scale reactor and similar to those in an industrial-scale circulating fluidized-bed boiler. With <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>1</b> as fuel, different trends in fuel conversion could be observed with respect to reactor temperature, fuel flow and solids circulation. After modifying the fuel injection system, two different blends of vacuum residue and fuel oil were injected. At most, 80 wt% vacuum residue was blended with 20 wt% fuel oil. It was found that the conversion of the different blends tested did not deviate significantly from the conversion of unblended fuel oil. The total fuel operation time in the pilot-scale unit was about 72 h and the ilmenite particles were fluidized at high temperatures for more than 340 h without any significant problems concerning agglomeration or disintegration...|$|E
40|$|Two sugar {{mills in}} Nicaragua plan to {{generate}} electricity from bagasse during the sugarcane season and eucalyptus {{during the rest of}} the year, and to sell it to the national grid. This study compared this concept with the most logical alternative at the moment, which is electricity generated from fuel oil. Costs, macro-economic impacts and environmental emissions are considered. The low cost of land and labour means that eucalyptus can be produced more cheaply than <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>1.</b> 7 as compared to 3. 2 $/GJLHV). Consequently, it was calculated that a sugar mill can produce electricity from biomass for 4. 9 mc/kWh as compared to 5. 8 mc/kWh for electricity from an oil fired plant. About 64 % of the money spent on biomass power stays within Nicaragua, thus contributing to its GDP, whereas in the case of fuel oil 83 % goes abroad. The employment generated by the production of electricity from fuel oil is 15 person yr/MW yr, compared to 32 person yr/MW yr for biomass. Comparing biomass with fuel oil, emissions of CO 2 and SO 2 equivalents are, respectively, 67 and 18 times lower. Particulate emissions can be much higher in the biomass case because of lack of flue gas cleaning. We can conclude that biomass electricity generation by sugar mills in Nicaragua can compete with power generation from fuel oil. Moreover, it has an overall better environmental performance, creates double the amount of jobs, and contributes about four times as much to the GDP of Nicaragua...|$|E

Extended lean operation was observed for all liquid fuels tested due to the wider lean flammability range for these fuels compared to natural gas. Autoignition of the fuels was controlled by the level of inerting gas used in the vaporization process.
