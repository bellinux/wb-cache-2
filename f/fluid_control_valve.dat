40|$|A {{real-time}} and biocompatible {{flow control}} technique for microchannel based physiological experiments has been developed. Current micro flow control techniques {{are limited in}} their ability to develop physiological waveforms and maintain high flow accuracy. The new technique provides accurate real time flow control of steady and user specified complex waveforms. This low impact flow control technique offers high adaptability {{for a wide range of}} frequencies and flow rates. The system is highly scalable as the operating parameters rely on the scale of specific components. A prototype system was constructed incorporating a constant air pressure source to supply the base flow rate, a compact, disposable flow probe to measure the flow rate and a real time feedback control system to drive a <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> allows for finer control over the base flow by pinching the silicone tube carrying the flow. Performance tests were completed for this prototype, showing a steady flow error of 1. 2 %. The optimum pulsatile range was for oscillations between 1 – 3 Hz. For sinusoidal waveforms within this range the total harmonic distortion was under 2 % and the root mean square error was under 8 %. Micro PIV and thrombus growth experiments were completed to demonstrate the capacity of this flow control systems ability to be used in microchannel based physiological experiments. Micro PIV results indicate that viscous forces affect the flow profile within a high aspect ratio microchannel with fluid viscosity of 4 x 10 - 3 N. s/m 2 and a Womersley number between 0. 117 and 0. 2925. Thrombus growth experiments comparing the pulsatile flow with steady flow at the microchannel wall showed that pulsatile flow promoted higher thrombi growth.

Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders.

40|$|Downhole {{sampling}} of unboiled liquid at 1350 and 1500 m depth in the seawater-dominated Reykjanes high-temperature geothermal system in Iceland shows that metal concentrations measured at surface are minimum values due to mineral precipitation in the wells; by analogy of similar tectonic setting, host rocks and fluid composition, the metal concentrations measured in many black smoker vents at the seafloor are also minima. Fluids in the Reykjanes geothermal system react with mid-ocean ridge basalt at temperatures {{as high as}} 346 °C and contain Fe 9 - 140 ppm, Cu 14 - 17 ppm, Zn 5 - 27 ppm, Pb 120 - 290 ppb, 1 - 6 ppb Au, and 28 - 107 ppb Ag. Fluids discharged at surface from the same wells have orders of magnitude lower metal concentrations due to precipitation caused by boiling and vapor loss during depressurization. Upstream of the orifice plate at high pressure (40 bar, 252 °C) the precipitates consist mainly of sphalerite and chalcopyrite with a trace of galena and bornite. At the orifice plate of old wells, the pressure decreased sharply to 11 bar (188 °C), resulting in abundant deposition of amorphous silica together with minor sphalerite and traces of chalcopyrite. In new wells the pressure at the orifice plate decreases to 22 bar (220 °C); this pressure decrease and concomitant boiling causes deposition of fine-grained bornite-digenite solid solution together with sphalerite and galena on the <b>fluid</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> In high-pressure wells (average wellhead pressure 45 - 35 bar) most metals (mainly as sphalerite) are deposited downstream of the orifice plate, with up to 950 ppm Au and 2. 5 wt. % Ag. Bulk concentrations in the scales vary between 15 - 60 wt. % upstream and downstream of the orifice plate and diminish from there. Iron increases up well from 8 to ~ 20 wt. % and decreases downstream of the orifice plate from 6 to 2 wt. % at the separation station; Cu downhole is ~ 3 wt. % but increases to 25 wt. % on the <b>fluid</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and then decreases; Pb downhole 100 s ppm but at the wellhead is ~ 3 wt. %, increasing to 15 wt. % at the <b>fluid</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> then decreasing sharply from there...|$|R

40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through mal-function of gas lift valves (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well an-nulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This is a growing con-cern as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become difficult. The authors have pre-viously developed a thermally-actuated safety valve to prevent product backflow into the annulus {{in the event of}} check valve failure. The safety valve uses shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to translate a temperature change into a displacement and, based on commercially available SMA wire material properties, re-quires a 6 ◦C temperature change to fully actuate. In some wells, however, check valve failure may result in less than 6 ◦C tem-perature change. In this paper a new concept is developed to sharpen the austenitic phase change in SMA actuators. The concept has broad practical implications because it will allow thermally-activated devices, such as <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> to be-come much more precise, i. e., translating a small temperature change into a large displacement. The new concept uses the fact that SMA transition temperatures are stress dependent. By specifically controlling stress in the wire, the temperature differ-ence required for austenitic transition can be decreased. This is achieved with a negative-differential spring- a spring that ex-erts a decreasing amount of force as it is displaced. The concept is tested experimentally by conductively and electrically heating SMA wires connected to a negative-differential spring. Results show a 2. 9 ◦C- 5 ◦C reductions, respectively, in the temperature difference required for austenitic transition...|$|R

A hydrogel of pNIPAM becomes hydrophilic and swollen {{in an aqueous}} solution of 32 °C, its low critical solution temperature.

40|$|Mission Research Corporation (MRC) in {{cooperation}} with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed a new small remote-controlled fluid valve. The motivation for developing this valve came from the requirements of a future International Space Station experiment called Microgravity Scaling Theory Experiment (MISTE). This experiment requires an in situ, low-temperature operated, fluid valve that can be open/closed over 50 times during a 4. 5 month flight. The successful operation of MISTE and other space-based and ground-based laboratory experiments now in development will require reliable cryogenic fluid valves that are remotely operated, helium leak tight, non-magnetic, very low power, and which have a small dead volume. The new valve is normally closed and requires fluid actuation at a pressure of approximately 600 kPa to open. The heart of the valve design is found in the configuration of the valve seat and sealing poppet. The design of these two surfaces was derived from work performed previously during a five year development program for a larger MRC remote-controlled, cryogenic <b>fluid</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More than 50 of the larger valves have been produced and delivered for space flight applications. The new small valve has only three moving parts, which move less than 0. 012 cm when the valve fully opens or closes. The bearing surfaces in the valve operating mechanism are all flexure (except for the valve poppet) and thus the valve is expected to have a lifetime of thousands of open/close cycles. The materials and processes used to fabricate the new valve have been flight certified. Results from the first extensively tested prototype show repeatable behavior with a leak rate of typically 3 108 scc=s after the first open/close cycle at 4. 2 K, rising to about 106 scc=s after 100 cycles.
