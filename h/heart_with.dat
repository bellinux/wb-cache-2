40|$|Despite {{the clarity}} of the {{sequential}} segmential segmental approach to complex congenital heart malformations, the classification of <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> overriding arterial valves remains contentious. A series of 67 <b>hearts,</b> all <b>with</b> overriding arterial valves, has therefore been studied in an attempt to provide clear and unambiguous criteria for their classification. There were 51 <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> an overriding aortic valve, 13 <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> an overriding pulmonary valve and 3 specimens with overriding of both valves. In each of these categories the degree of override and the underlying morphology varied considerably. The options to classify these hearts are limited. Using the " 50 per cent rule" as a device to catalogue the type of connexion - irrespective of the morphology - all hearts were described in unambiguous fashion. A comparison with synonyms, as frequently used for purposes of classification, revealed that the latter are often insufficient properly to classify the basic abnormality. By classifying the type of connexion and describing the morphology separately, no basic problem remains in distinguishing between <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> double outlet right ventricle and subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> the morphology of Fallot's tetralogy with an aorta almost exclusively arising from the right ventricle. Similarly, the classification of <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> complete transposition and subpulmonary defect in the setting of the so-called Taussig-Bing heart is brought back to its proper perspective. Proper and consistent application of the sequential segmental approach leaves no room for ambiguity, even in complicated <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> overriding arterial valve...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between the type and size of myocardial infarcts and collateral development was studied in postmortem human <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a new approach that allows quantification of vascular beds. The coronary arteries were perfused with radioactive microspheres and were visualized by injecting a barium-gelatin mixture. The collateral supply was assessed in 6 reference hearts without infarction, 4 <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a transmural infarct and 12 <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a total of 16 subendocardial infarcts. The distribution pattern of microspheres in hearts in the reference group {{did not differ significantly}} from that in <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a transmural infarct but was significantly different (p less than 0. 01) from that in <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a subendocardial infarct, which had a much greater number of microspheres in the collateral-dependent area. Moreover, the lateral zone of myocardium at risk [...] defined as the area containing viable myocardium but within the distribution zone of the occluded artery [...] was small in <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a transmural infarct (less than or equal to 2 mm), but showed a much wider range in <b>hearts</b> <b>with</b> a subendocardial infarct. This study strongly suggests that collateral vessels play an important role during the development of myocardial infarction, both in determining infarct type (transmural versus subendocardial) and in preserving the viability of the lateral zone of the myocardium at ris...|$|R

5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker for a <b>heart</b> <b>with</b> insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – {{one at the}} time of initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had {{changed his name to}} Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the <b>heart</b> <b>with</b> a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E
