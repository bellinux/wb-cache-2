5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>months</b> {{into his}} reign, Edward forced a {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly's {{later years}} were troubled with poor health, {{including}} {{the loss of}} a leg. In late 1988, he suffered a major heart attack and was hospitalised for two months. He died in hospital in Sutherland in 1992, aged 86. O'Reilly lamented the decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died <b>just</b> <b>months</b> before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, 1824, <b>just</b> <b>months</b> {{after the}} election, {{the state capitol}} {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion was too small to host a proper reception, so the governor had to entertain the dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes {{when he was elected}} to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate.

He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E

5|$|Antoine's {{marriage}} to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne {{to members of}} the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died <b>just</b> <b>months</b> later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.|$|E
5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests <b>just</b> <b>months</b> away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|In the 1260s, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in the European perception of the Mongols, and they became regarded less as enemies, and more as potential allies {{in the fight against}} the Muslims. As recently as 1259, Pope Alexander IV had been encouraging a new crusade against the Mongols, and had been extremely disappointed in hearing that the monarchs of Antioch and Cilician Armenia had submitted to Mongol overlordship. Alexander had put the monarchs' cases on the agenda of his upcoming council, but died in 1261 <b>just</b> <b>months</b> before the Council could be convened, and before the new crusade could be launched. For a new pope, the choice fell to Pantaléon, the same Patriarch of Jerusalem who had earlier been warning of the Mongol threat. He took the name Pope Urban IV, and tried to raise money for a new crusade.|$|E

5|$|A diabetic, Keenor {{suffered}} from disabilities {{stemming from a}} hard-living lifestyle {{that may have been}} a consequence of his tough upbringing. Following his retirement from football, he found it difficult to find work due to his ill-health and it became increasingly hard to earn money. Supporters of his former club Cardiff City held a collection during one league match to raise money for Keenor and his family and the Football Association of Wales also organised a fund for him as well as donating him some money. After a long spell in hospital for treatment of his diabetes, Keenor moved his family to Lamberhurst where he and his wife ran a corner shop and also raised chickens to be sold at Christmas time. He later volunteered for the Territorial Army, serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, but was discharged in June 1939 due to continuing problems with his diabetes treatment, <b>just</b> <b>months</b> {{before the start of the}} Second World War. Two of his sons, Frederick and Alfred were both killed in action during the conflict. Keenor and his wife later visited the village of Fruges in northern France where Alfred's plane had been shot down.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into an old}} {{political}} family, Playford was {{the fifth}} Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia; his grandfather Thomas Playford II had served as premier in the 19th century. He {{grew up on the}} family farm in Norton Summit before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli and Western Europe. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a Liberal and Country League (LCL) representative for Murray at the 1933 state election. In his early years in politics, Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies, and had a maverick strategy, often defying party norms and advocating unadulterated laissez faire economics and opposing protectionism and government investment, in stark contrast to his later actions as premier. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, Richard Layton Butler, Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938, having been made a minister <b>just</b> <b>months</b> earlier in an attempt to dampen his insubordination. Playford inherited a minority government and many independents to deal with, and instability was expected; Playford was seen as a transitional leader. However, Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one-seat majority at the next election.|$|E
5|$|After its release, American Life debuted {{at number}} one on the United States Billboard 200 chart with 241,000copies sold in its first week. The sales were less than Madonna's {{previous}} studio album, Music, which debuted with 420,000copies in 2000, but {{was the only one that}} week to sell over 200,000copies. It was Madonna's second consecutive number one debut, and her fifth number one album overall in the US. The next week, sales dropped by 62% to 91,000copies, and the album slid from the top of the chart to number eight. It continued to decrease in sales down the chart and fell off the Billboard 200. In September 2003, following Madonna's performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, the album saw a sales gain of 19%, but did not chart back. On July 7, 2003, <b>just</b> <b>months</b> after the release, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipment of one million copies in the US alone. However, it became the third lowest selling studio album by Madonna behind her 2012 release MDNA and her 2015 release Rebel Heart, with sales of 680,000copies as of October 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It ranked at number125 on the year-end ranking of the albums by Billboard. In Canada, the album debuted at the top of the Canadian Albums Chart with sales of 18,000copies on May 10, 2003. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the sum was considerably less than her previous studio efforts, Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000), which debuted with 59,000and 50,000copies respectively. It gained a Platinum certification one month later from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipment of 100,000copies of the album.|$|E
