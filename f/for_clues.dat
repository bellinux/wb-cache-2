5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E
5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's search <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son.

The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate members will be meeting the colonists.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time.

Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E

5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
