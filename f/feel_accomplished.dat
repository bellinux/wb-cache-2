50|$|The {{demands and}} necessities of the circus arts {{give rise to}} {{personal}} transformation. Self-discipline is an absolute requisite with the constant practices, daily difficulties, and physical risks that characterize the social circus. Youth learn to push through these challenges, with their own efforts, {{and in doing so}} discover that they are capable and valuable beings. The social circus allows for at-risk youth to realize their own potential through the challenges that the circus brings, making them <b>feel</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Upon discovering that they are capable and intelligent beings, they start to deconstruct paradigms that they originally thought to be true. For example, Brazilian youth reevaluate the commonly held beliefs that everyone who lives in the favela is stupid, that every street child does not have a purpose or future, etc. These beliefs end up becoming a barrier to the self-development of the youth, and circus activities let them break such paradigms.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} an {{organization}} {{in the process of}} management depends largely on its efficiency and effectiveness of utilizing its human resources. Human resource is the most fundamental and decisive asset. On the other hand, whatever ample material and financial resources it may have, the institution is lifeless unless it converted to some sort of outputs with the effort of people. This {{is due to the fact}} that human resources mobilize and organize other resources to realize organizational goals and objective. To create consistently high levels of retention, first it is necessary to understand why people are leaving or being terminated. This is especially true if the organization experienced high level of employee turnover, a situation that could cripple a company in coming years. The primary purpose of this research is to show the turnover, its consequence and management in the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which is one of the largest commercial bank in the banking industry of the country. The problem statement that initiated the researcher to conduct the study is the increase in turnover of skilled manpower through time (from 2005 to 2012). The major objective of the study is to find out the problems related with this turnover and to propose retention mechanisms. To attain the above mentioned objectives interviews will be conducted and questionnaire also be distributed to a total of 160 respondents in the selected process of Head Office organs, District Offices and Branches around Addis Ababa. One of the major importance of the study is that Management, especially those in the Human Resources Management Process and other concerned organs of the Bank will get the opportunity to revise or change the current system of the Human Resource Management of the bank; particularly on retention mechanisms of the employee. The study revealed that the employees are found to be satisfied in certain facets such as their current job, relationship with their coworker, with their working environment. Conversely, employees are dissatisfied with major determinant facets such as banks competitive pay system; the current salary and benefit; training opportunities [...] Therefore, it has been recommended that training, job, promotion should be provided based on merit as per the procedure; CBE has to revise the current pay scheme by considering the external market.

40|$|History {{classes are}} {{generally}} {{well known for}} their extensive coverage of the world wars, battles, and conflicts that have shaped our society into its current form. However, the few fleeting moments in history during which nonviolent resistance succeeded {{on a large scale}} are often mentioned and subsequently dismissed. These pivotal world events are acknowledged, and as a populace we often <b>feel</b> <b>accomplished</b> knowing that the human race avoided bloodshed on some occasions, but not much thought is usually given to the strength and sacrifice it took to bring about such beneficial change. It does not take much more than a mere glance at one’s local news channel to {{come to the conclusion that}} we live in a violent world. Most civilians are aware of major nonviolent movements, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Indian Independence Movement, but there are major misconceptions about the process behind them. Nonviolent resistance as an option for solving issues, from personal to global, has become strictly theoretical. Now may just be the time to make the effort to learn about what nonviolent resistance truly means, due to the fact that the choices we make today may help determine what occurs tomorrow. The reasons why nonviolence is perceived so inaccurately today range from the confusion and difficulty that arises upon its implementation, to the lack of situations that permit its success. In a perfect world, nonviolent resistance could solve every issue. The unfortunate reality is that we live in a world that is anything but perfect, and that nonviolence may not always be the answer. Each and every living being has a theoretical line that, once crossed, permits the use of violence as a means to an end. In other words, we use our judgment to decide when violence must be used to achieve a goal, and this can range from always to never. This is where the idea of just war becomes a crucial concept to understand. Just war is only to be implemented when it is morally justifiable and it is possible to attain success with lasting peace. It becomes clear through much research that nonviolence is very possible, but only under very specific conditions. Some of the main reasons why nonviolent movements in India and the United States have worked are the integration of various societal strata, the inclusion of a concrete goal and mission statement, consideration of the time period and strategic use of resources. Nonviolence is based on the premise that the opponent considers the resister valuable. Therefore, in situations like those that deal with genocide, nonviolence is almost impossible to implement. Just war, although unfavorable to some, may be the only option that we can hope to succeed with. There are many misconceptions about nonviolence and just war, and this paper goes into great detail to enhance the reader’s understanding of both processes. [URL]...|$|E

30|$|The {{self-determination}} theory (SDT) of Deci and Ryan (1985, 1993) {{has been}} applied in many research fields as an approach to human motivation and personality (Ryan & Deci, 2017). As a part of online learning along with gamification, {{it has been used}} as a framework to investigate student’s motivation and engagement (Dichev, Dicheva, Angelova, & Agre, 2015; Lamprinou & Paraskeva, 2015; Sailer, Hense, Mayr, & Mandl, 2017; Shi & Cristea, 2016). SDT differentiates between types of motivation, gives explanations for motivational behavior and proposes predictors of high-quality learning. Intrinsic motivation is considered the most beneficial type of motivation as it is associated with activities that are done for fun and pleasure and satisfaction. In our case study, this regulation type is observed when students enjoy and have fun collecting badges. Identified motivation is observed when individuals engage in a behavior because they think it is important to them. Students collect badges since they believe collecting them is an important and valuable activity for them. Both intrinsic and identified regulations are self-determined and autonomous forms of motivation. Extrinsic motivation is exhibited when the reasons for performing a task are externally influenced, either because the task is an obligation or must be completed in order to avoid punishment. It represents a non-autonomous form of motivation. Students exhibit this regulation type when they collect badges because they are obliged to do so by the instructor. Finally, amotivation shows unwillingness or the state of lacking the interest to act (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Individuals do not care about a task and/or do not <b>feel</b> competent in <b>accomplishing</b> it. This regulation type is shown when students are not interested in collecting badges and/or do not <b>feel</b> competent in <b>accomplishing</b> the connected tasks.|$|R
