This work also focuses on analysis of the currently used shooting techniques and shooting stances, comparison of protection they can provide, and last but not least, to fill the gap in literature, wich deals with this issue. Methods This is an empirical thesis of observational character. Shooting stances were tested on a camera system named Qualisys. The results were first processed by a program for 3 D analysis, and the <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection</b> <b>provided</b> by the bulletproof vest in different positions was calculated in a program for 3 D modeling. Results: From the measured data, it was found that changing targets to the left (for right- handed) the <b>provided</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection</b> significantly changes to worse. Conversely, when changing targets to the right, the <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection</b> faired the same or slightly better than aiming forward. The worst results of all stances came from the side shooting stance in which the bulletproof vest provided almost no <b>protection.</b> Keywords <b>Ballistic</b> <b>protection,</b> shooting stances, Qualisys, 3 d analysis, vital zon...|$|R

Armour plates are up to 25 mm thick and mounted so as to <b>provide</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection</b> from 12.7 mm (.5in) bullets. Horizontal roof plate of superstructure is made of several sections to provide necessary hatches. Openings are provided for fitting of commander’s and gunner’s cupolas, two access and evacuation hatches for engineer section, holes for radio set antenna, rotating periscope, driver’s cover, refueling port and two lookout ports (for observation and for firing personal weapons). To perform engineering tasks, a tankgrade blade it fitted at the front, equipped with electric motor, pump and hydraulics. Blade assembly is an autonomous unit that can be quickly and easily attached to the hull. Vehicle firepower consists of one 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and one machine gun (M84, [...]3in/7.62 mm calibre). Vehicle concept permits fitting of weapons group station consisting of a 30 mm gun, 7.62 mm machine gun, antitank wire guided rockets and 30 mm automatic grenade launcher with appropriate optoelectronic fire control system. To protect the crew from nuclear and chemical agents a modified nuclear-chemical protection unit is built-in, consisting of anti radiation fan.

This paper presents {{the study of the}} design of a locally used ballistic helmet, i. e. Personnel Armor System for Ground Troop (PASGT) type helmet, from ergonomic perspectives and the identification of potential risk areas of injury based on the current ballistic helmet design. Two quantitative assessment techniques are employed in the investigation. First, a set of questionnaires were distributed to the current users of the PASGT helmet. The result showed that the 54. 8 % of respondents experienced pain on the parietal (top) area of their head, which is a potential risk area of head injury. Second, an experiment with 10 -mm thick sponge layer added to the interior part of the helmet was conducted to test its effect on the contact pressure between the head of the wearer and the medium size PASGT helmet while jogging on a treadmill at 8 km/h for 180 seconds. Mean of peak contact pressure with and without wearing the sponge of 2. 5 kPa and 2. 6 kPa, respectively, are obtained from the practical test. The maximum of peak contact pressure is found to be 3. 6 kPa with the sponge and 4. 2 kPa without the sponge. The results obtained in this study indicate that there are areas of discomfort interior to the PASGT helmet in contact with the wearer and that the discomfort can be minimized by appending a sponge layer to the frontal of the helmet...|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{development contract}} was undertaken on December 23, 1977 which had as its purpose {{the development and}} demonstration of a flexible armored blanket design suitable for <b>providing</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection</b> to nuclear weapons during shipment. Objectives were {{to design and fabricate}} a prototype blanket which will conform to the weapon shape, is troop-handleable in the field, and which, singly or in multiple layers, can defeat a range of kinetic energy armor piercing (AP) ammunition potentially capable of damaging the critical portion of the nuclear weapon. Following empirical testing, including the firing of threat ammunition under controlled laboratory and field test conditions, materials were selected and assembled into two blanket designs, each weighing approximately 54 kg/m{sup 2 } (11 lbs/ft{sup 2 }) and estimated to cost from $ 111 to $ 180 per ft{sup 2 } in production. A firing demonstration to evidence blanket performance against terrorist/light infantry weapons, heavy infantry weapons, and aircraft cannon was conducted for representatives of the DOD and interested Sandia employees on April 12, 1978. The blankets performed better than anticipated defeating bullets up to 7. 62 mm x 51 mm AP with one layer and projectiles up to 23 mm HEI with two layers. Based on these preliminary tests it is recommended that development work be continued with the following objectives: (1) the selection by the DOD of priority applications, (2) the specific design and fabrication of sufficient quantities of armored blankets for field testing, (3) the evaluation of the blankets by DOD operational units, with reports to Sandia Laboratories to enable final design...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Composite {{structural}} armor (CSA) is a multifunctional {{material that}} <b>provides</b> <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection,</b> stiffness, and strength at minimum weight. It {{consists of a}} multilayered architecture of polymer composites, rubber and ceramic tiles, stacked in a precise manner to obtain optimal performance. During its lifetime, CSA will experience manufacturing defects and be subjected from low to high velocity impact threats that will reduce {{the performance of the}} structure. The ability to repair a CSA is consequently an important factor in the future deployment of the CSA. The present study addresses the problem of the repair of CSA in a minimum number of steps. Several potential repair methods are introduced, and an adhesively bonded plug repair scheme is then further analyzed. Virgin (control) and repaired CSA beams are manufactured and their static behaviors are compared in a four-point bend test. The performance of a scarf patch repair is assessed. The effect of three scarf angles and two repair adhesive systems, one being low-temperature cure and the other room-temperature cure, are compared. The room-temperature cure repair system offers only a limited ability to bond to the different material layers, thereby limiting the performance of the repaired CSA. On the other hand, it is found that the low-temperature cure repair system provides sufficient interfacial strength to allow the repair to recover an appreciable amount of the original structural performance of the beams. Furthermore, it is found that the repair efficiency increases as the scarf angle decreases. This study clearly demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} repair the through-thickness section of CSA, in a single-step operation, and renew structural performance.

It was found that 12 layers of ballistic- grade Kevlar™ loosely bound {{to the rear of the}} CFRP laminate proved to be the most weight-efficient method of dissipating the kinetic energy of the projectile. Furthermore, the impact response of a non-woven symmetrical CFRP laminate has been compared to that of a woven laminate over an impact-energy regime of 92 – 459 J. At lower impact-energies there were strong indications that the non-woven laminate out-performed the woven laminate whereas at the higher impact-energies the ballistic performance was seen to be approximately the...|$|R

5000|$|The IOTV is {{designed}} to take {{the weight of the}} vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that {{is designed}} to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which {{is designed to}} defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not <b>provide</b> significant <b>ballistic</b> <b>protection.</b> The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear if using the older SAPI plates (NIJ standard III). Use of the new E-SAPI plates increase protection to armor-piercing versions of the aforementioned rounds in addition to [...]30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV <b>provides,</b> without the <b>ballistic</b> ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified as this is primarily a law enforcement standard.|$|R

In addition to the added protection offered by this turret on production M60A1s, the upper glacis armor was increased from 3.67 inches to 4.29 inches at 65 degrees while the sides over the crew compartment went from 1.9 inches to 2.9 inches at their apex. This brought the frontal armor up to the same 10" [...] line of sight armor standard of the M103 heavy tank. Shock absorbers were installed {{in the first two}} and last road wheel arms. The uncomfortable wire mesh seats were replaced by padded seats. The brake and accelerator pedal were rearranged for more efficient and comfortable operation while the steering wheel was replaced by a T bar steering control. The engine and power train were upgraded by the addition of the Continental AVDS-1790-2A and the CD-850-6A. The new engine lowered fuel consumption and smoke emissions.
