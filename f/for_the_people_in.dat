5|$|The quest {{begins when}} Link is {{chosen by the}} king of Hyrule to seek {{the help of the}} Picori after Vaati had {{destroyed}} the Picori Blade and petrified Princess Zelda. With the blade shattered, evil monsters were released into Hyrule and Vaati was able to create chaos in his search for the Light Force. Link was chosen because only children can see the Picori. On the voyage he rescues Ezlo, a strange being resembling a green cap with a bird-like head, who joins him and can make Link shrink {{to the size of the}} Minish. Although it is not revealed at first, he and Vaati are Minish (Picori)—Ezlo a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati his apprentice. Vaati became corrupted by the madness and hatred of men and took a magic hat Ezlo had made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Hyrule. The hat grants any wish made by the bearer, and Vaati wished to become a powerful sorcerer. Vaati then turned his old master, who had tried to stop them, into a hat. With the help of Ezlo, Link retrieves the four elemental artifacts and uses them to restore the Picori Blade to the Four Sword, capable of defeating Vaati.|$|E

She was very active as the president of the Dutch Red Cross and worked closely with the National Reconstruction organization. Her down-to-earth manner endeared her to her people so much that a majority of the Dutch people would soon want Queen Wilhelmina to abdicate in favour of her daughter. In the spring of 1946 Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard visited the countries that had helped the Netherlands during the occupation.|$|E

500|$|Moggach {{believed}} the novel was very filmable, [...] "despite it containing no description {{and being a}} very unvisual book". To Wright, many other period films had relied on paintings for inspiration rather than photographs, causing them to appear unreal. He thus used [...] "Austen's prose [...] many visual references <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the story", including using close-up shots of various characters. The filmmakers also changed several scenes to more romantic locales {{than those in the}} book. For instance, in the film, Darcy first proposes outdoors in a rainstorm at a building with neoclassical architecture; in the book, this scene takes place inside a parsonage. In the film, his second proposal occurs on the misty moors as dawn breaks; in the book, he and Elizabeth are walking down a country lane in broad daylight. Wright has acknowledged that [...] "there are a lot of period film clichés; some of them are in the film and some are not, but for me it was important to question them".|$|E

[...] After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E
