40|$|The {{source of}} income rules used in the United States and {{elsewhere}} in large part establish the contours of tax jurisdiction exercised by countries. The source rules {{play a vital role}} in the foreign tax credit system applicable to U. S. persons with foreign investment or business activities. The source rules also play a central role in the United States’ exercise of source taxation over foreign persons with U. S. businesses or investments. Other countries likewise use source rules or their equivalent in applying foreign tax credit or territorial systems to their residents and exercising source taxation over nonresidents. The current approach for sourcing income suffers from two related problems. First, the source rules lack coherence in that they fail to advance a consistent normative tax policy. More fundamentally, the rules fail to reflect the consistent application of the key principle appropriate for allocating nations’ primary taxing rights – namely, the benefits principle. The second problem is the variation in the source rules used worldwide. This may produce <b>double</b> taxation or <b>non-taxation.</b> This article addresses both of these problems by offering an approach for sourcing income that has the potential for being adopted by countries on a multilateral basis. The article develops an equity-based standard for sourcing that would allow for the derivation of source rules for various types of income. The core idea underlying the proposed sourcing standard is the benefits principle: income should be sourced to the country that provides the taxpayer with significant governmental benefits related to the income. Specifically, the article develops a standard that would devise source rules by evaluating the {{source of income}} on the basis of three factors: the destination of the services, property or capital giving rise to income; the location(s) of the activities giving rise to income; and the residence of the person receiving income. Based on this evaluation, the rule for a given type of income may divide the source of the income among multiple locations. By basing the source rules on an equity-based standard that allows source to be divided when appropriate, this article seeks to rationalize and harmonize the provisions used to source income for purposes of taxing cross-border investment and business activities...|$|R

40|$|The current {{tax treaty}} network was {{developed}} in the 1920 s and 1930 s in order to prevent double residence/source taxation. This kind of double taxation rarely exists any more because most countries have adopted either an exemption system or a foreign tax credit regime in their domestic (non‐treaty) law, which effectively prevents residence/source double taxation {{even in the absence of}} a treaty. Instead, as Tsilly Dagan has pointed out, the current treaties serve mostly to transfer revenue from the source country to the residence country. This suggests that treaties may be unnecessary because exemption from withholding taxes by source countries can be done unilaterally. However, in the era of globalization (post 1980), the treaties have developed two new functions, both of which apply primarily to individual taxpayers: First, to prevent <b>double</b> <b>non‐taxation</b> by ensuring that withholding taxes are collected if there is no assurance of taxation by the residence country.

40|$|Many {{economists and}} legal {{scholars}} {{claim that the}} traditional conceptual and policy framework for international taxation is defunct. The examples they offer most often to support such claims are failures of residence- or source-based taxation to achieve a variety of normative objectives. This article {{suggests that there is}} a very different way of seeing why international taxation has become intellectually controversial. The key problem is not that the globalization of economic activities makes the traditional policy tools outdated; instead, it is that scholars and policymakers have more frequent occasions to disagree about the normative goals of international taxation. Thus most current controversies are actually about the articulation of ends and not the adequacy of means. To illustrate this perspective, this article offers a minimalist account of the meanings of the concepts of source and residence. The account, I argue, successfully deflects most skeptical arguments about residence and source, and shows that the purported inadequacy of the two concepts are consequences, not causes, of inadequate normative criteria for the design of international income taxation.

40|$|In {{intra-group}} finance {{hybrid instruments}} allow for tailor-made form of finance. Hence hybrid finance {{is often used}} for international tax planning in multinational groups. Due {{to a lack of}} international tax harmonization or tax coordination qualification conflict can arise. A specific hybrid instrument is classified as debt in one country, and as equity in the other country. This may lead to double taxation. In the reverse case, <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> can arise. Against this legal background one might expect that cross-border hybrid intra-group finance is advantageous in comparison to classical debt finance in case of double-non-taxation while it can be expected to be disadvantageous in the case of double taxation of the yield. Previous studies do not include qualification conflicts. Thus the question arises how qualification conflicts are affecting an intra-group finance decision. We examine effects of such qualification conflicts, resulting from the use of cross-border, intra-group hybrid finance, on the tax-advantageousness as compared to classical debt finance.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the taxation of hybrid instruments {{and the impact}} of the new amendments adopted to the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive in Finland. A Government Bill 59 / 2015 proposed the Directive amendments to be implemented to 6 a§ of the Business Income Tax Act (EVL) to tackle hybrid mismatch arrangements and to prevent any misuse of the Directive. Hybrid instruments are financial instruments that have both equity and debt characteristics, which makes the classification to either equity or debt difficult. Finnish legislation does not recognize hybrid instruments but the classification in practice follows the legal form of the instrument. Classification problems typically arise when a hybrid loan has equity characteristics but there has been no case law so far where a hybrid loan has been reclassified as equity for tax purposes. Hybrid mismatches are born in cross-border transactions e. g. when hybrid instrument is classified differently in different tax jurisdictions. These arrangements can lead to <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation,</b> i. e. to an outcome where the income generated by the instrument is not taxed anywhere. Lately, EU and OECD have aimed to prevent aggressive tax planning and the amendments to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive are part of EU's larger plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. Amendments aim to refrain from granting the Directive benefits, i. e. tax exemption on direct investment dividends in the parent company's Member State, in situations where the same distribution is considered tax deductible in the Member State of the subsidiary. Furthermore, a general anti-abuse clause was adopted to prevent any misuse of the Directive and to ensure a greater consistency in its application in different Member States. It is applicable in situations where the arrangement is not seen "genuine" or if one of its main purposes is tax avoidance. Amendments to the Directive were implemented to Finnish Business Income Tax Act 6 a§ by adding paragraphs 8 and 9, which are applied from tax year 2016 onwards. Impacts to Finnish entities remain somewhat unclear regarding the new anti-abuse rule. Since hybrid instruments are in principle considered as debt, situations where a Finnish entity is a debtor in a hybrid arrangement seem more common than vice versa. Thus, the impact of the new legislation regarding new paragraph 8 is not likely very significant. However, companies' administrative burden will grow, as tax treatment of the dividend distribution in the source state needs to be figured out. The new regulation will also overrule any dividend exemptions in tax treaties, since it is argued {{that the purpose of the}} new regulation is to prevent <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> whereas double tax treaties' purpose is to eliminate double taxation, not to enable it...|$|E
40|$|Curbing tax {{arbitrage}} {{is one of}} the main priorities of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (endorsed by the G 20 and the G 8) ever since the public debate on base erosion fully erupted. Neutralizing the effect of hybrid mismatch arrangements has become Action No. 2 of the OECD Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. This has resulted in the recent 2014 deliverable, which is divided into two parts: recommendations for domestic law (part I), and treaty issues (part II). The authors analyse and evaluate the report on the 2014 deliverables on BEPS action point 2. They submit that, given the draw backs of specific anti-hybrid rules as to practical and political feasibility, a further review of alternatives is warranted, particularly with respect to CFC and interest deduction limitations. A more simplified mismatch rule applicable to interest seems particularly worthy of further analysis, given that hybrid mismatch arrangements almost always evolve around interest deduction (a notable exception applies with respect to payments to reverse hybrids; however, effective CFC rules may be effective in countering this particular brand of mismatches). In addition, more generic interest deduction limitations (as opposed to specific hybrid mismatch rules) may be a viable complementary way to mitigate <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> resulting from hybrid mismatches and thus act as a sufficient discouragement for entering into such arrangements...|$|E
40|$|In 1997, I {{wrote an}} article on the {{international}} tax challenges posed by the then-nascent electronic commerce, in which I suggested that the international tax regime is based on two principles: the benefits principle and the single tax principle. The benefits principle states that active (business) income should be taxed primarily by the country of source, and passive (investment) income should be taxed primarily by the country of residence. This is the famous compromise reached by the four economists at the foundation of the regime in 1923 and is not particularly controversial. It is embodied in every one of the over 3, 000 tax treaties that reduce taxation at the source of passive income while allowing source countries to tax active income if there is a permanent establishment. The single tax principle states that cross-border income should be taxed once at the rate determined by the benefits principle. In other words, cross-border income should be taxed only once at the source-country rate for active income and at the residence-country rate for passive income. But if the preferred country (i. e., source for active, and residence for passive) does not tax, it is incumbent upon the other country to do so because otherwise, I argued in my article, <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> would result, which is just as damaging as double taxation. This argument remains hugely controversial. While there are indications that the single tax principle was the idea underlying the adoption of the foreign tax credit by the United States in 1918, as far as tax treaties are concerned, the United States did not accept the single tax principle until more recent times...|$|E
40|$|PhDThis thesis {{analyses}} which principles should {{govern the}} interpretation of tax treaties. This field is complex - because tax treaties have a dual status. Tax treaties are treaties between States - which are governed by public international law, the principles {{of which have been}} codified in the 1980 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Tax treaties are also laws which can affect the domestic rights of taxpayers (and States). Different, and possibly conflicting, principles of interpretation may apply in public international, and in (different) domestic, contexts. This thesis seeks to reconcile these different principles, recognising that tax treaties should be interpreted uniformly. Only if this is done can double taxation (and <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation)</b> be avoided - and reciprocity achieved. This thesis analyses why, and when, the Vienna Convention is relevant in interpreting a tax treaty in a domestic context. It seeks to describe a uniform approach to tax treaty interpretation - which could be applied by domestic courts worldwide. It reaches four main conclusions. Firstly, a textual approach (endorsed as the starting point of interpretation at a public international level by Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention) should (also) be the starting point of interpretation in a domestic context. Secondly, the proper approach in a domestic context cannot be the mirror image of the Vienna Convention approach. Thirdly, a uniform domestic approach cannot be identical to any one particular State's approach to {{the interpretation of}} its domestic tax statutes. Fourthly, a uniform domestic approach should be autonomous - and neutral as between all States. It should recognise a tax treaty's dual status - yet be independent of any interpretative principles which are appropriate only in a purely public international, or a purely domestic, context...|$|E

The pending harmonisation should prevent the said entities from aggressive tax "optimisation" in the course of which they transfer their tax base to countries with the lowest income tax and abuse gaps and incomprehensiveness of tax regulation in individual EU member states.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to discuss whether triangular cases are problematic in Finland {{and how they are}} or would be handled in Finland when Finland is in one of the three roles of the triangular case: the source state, the residence state or the PE state. A triangular case is a situation where a resident of one state has a permanent establishment in another state, which derives income in the form of dividends, interest or royalties from a third state. Triangular cases raise two kinds of problems: firstly, there is a possibility of unrelieved double taxation, and secondly, the problem of treaty abuse and <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation.</b> The thesis is done by conducting a literary research. The main topics concerning triangular cases are international double taxation and tax treaties. These topics are discussed {{to the extent that they}} concern triangular cases. Further, EU tax law and directives are looked at, as well as Finnish international tax law. As an example case to examine triangular cases in Finland, a Nordic situation with Finland, Sweden and Denmark involved is discussed. Besides discussing triangular cases in Finland, also BEPS measures concerning triangular cases are looked at. The most relevant actions from the BEPS Action Plan are presented, and the overall impact of the action plan on triangular cases in Finland and worldwide is assessed. It was anticipated in this thesis that it would not be entirely clear how the taxing rights in triangular cases are divided. Regarding Finland the example case, however, reveals no problematic situations, and based on the example case and other research conducted in the thesis it is concluded that triangular cases in Finland are not likely to cause a lot of problems. The research further reveals that BEPS Action Plan will most likely not change the way triangular cases are handled in Finland...|$|E
40|$|In 2013 the OECD {{launched}} an unprecedented initiative {{in the field}} of international taxation focusing its activity and attention on a new emerging global issue: the erosion of the taxable bases in qualified tax jurisdiction, and the subsequent shifting of profits in fa-vour of others. This (apparently) new phenomenon is originated by the possibility given to the busi-nesses in general (and to MNEs – Multi National Enterprises - in particular) {{to make the most of}} domestic rules and of Double Taxation Conventions in order to allocate the prof-its they make in the most favourable jurisdiction. This strategy should not be confused with tax evasion or avoidance. The two latter situations are currently tackled by specific provisions in different tax systems ranging from tailor-made provisions to GAARs (- General Anti Avoidance Rules - where applicable) to the Abuse of Law doctrine. Base erosion, on the other hand, is a broader phenomenon: it occurs when a business scheme leads to remarkable savings in taxation via the proper application of domestic rules or DTCs (Double Taxation Conventions). In this respect, Academic literature has been warning policy makers and stakeholders from the risks of possible <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> induced by the overlap of DTCs with domestic rules that has ben changed trough years. Traditionally, the OECD intervention in this respect has always maintained one prior-ity: the prevention of (international) double taxation via bilateral instruments (Treaties) inspired by the Model delivered and interpreted consistently with the Commentary also drafted by the OECD itself. The explosion of the global financial crisis and the subsequent increased need for an ever increasing amount of tax revenue by many States belonging to the OECD created however the most appropriate momentum for a change of perspectives. Following the historical momentum, OECD urged for the necessity of a shift of para-digm in international taxation: time has (allegedly) come for a move from the prevention of double taxation to the implementation of an actual taxation of MNEs and cross border profits. In this respect, DTCs, the Model and the Soft law should be interpreted in a way to make actual taxation of cross border income as a certain result, preventing therefore <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation.</b> Ambitious and bold as it is, the BEPS initiative started in 2013 with a number of doc-uments and some as 15 separate actions addressing specific and qualified situations orig-inating base erosion in respective tax jurisdictions: the issue of tax coordination and dou-ble deductions are two of them, with the first being actually a remedy (also) to the sec-ond. Double deduction occurs in cases in which a cost may be deducted in both tax juris-dictions by the same legal entity (a company or a group of companies, if group relief is allowed and the group of company is considered as a legal entity) thus determining and illogic, unfair and ultimately unacceptable reduction of the overall burden. The OECD Report in this respect lists a remarkable number of different cases and sit-uations in which this outcome may be achieved by the taxpayer, without falling into any case of avoidance or abuse. Despite the considerable technical differences, with a rea-sonable margin of appreciation it could be concluded that most of them are determined by legal mismatches of qualification between the two legal jurisdictions and concerning either the flow of income or the legal entity of the case. In this respect asymmetries may concern a legal entity qualified as transparent by a jurisdiction and not by the other, or a specific income considered as an interest paid in the source State (thus deductible for tax purposes) and as dividend in the residence State (thus enjoying a full – or partial – exemption from taxation. Similar asymmetries may also concern the notion of PE (Permanent Establishment) and the ways and means to tax profits attributable to it in the different tax jurisdictions: on the top of that, the existence (or not) of the PE in the view of the two different tax ju-risdictions may also lead to <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> or double deduction of costs. Action n. 2 of the BEPS Report (on Double deductions) describes in details the differ-ent situations listed above and further ways and many o reach the same result without falling into a case of Abuse of law or tax avoidance, with some of the situations depicted that may also potentially be of some interest for the Italian legal system. As a matter of fact, in a recent past, the Italian Supreme Court decided some cases in a way to open a remarkable leeway for base erosion (or profit shifting) by the taxpayer, interpreting a DTC in a way which was perhaps not entirely consistent with the OECD guidelines applicable ratione temporis. The new BEPS initiative should help to prevent from other decisions to be taken in the same direction. While discussion on the BEPS rages on in every OECD Country (and beyond) the case of Italy is however peculiar for purely domestic reasons as well. The Italian Parliament approved very recently an Act (n° 23 passed in 2014) empow-ering the Government to reform the fiscal system making in more simple, accessible, less burdensome for the taxpayer. In this respect it also provided specific guidelines to be re-spected by the Government in its future regulatory activity (with a quasi-legislative effect). It’s noteworthy to read at Article 12 of the aforementioned Act that the Government will have to draft the future decrees “… consistently with the recommendations by supra-national organizations …”. Reference is made of course (and first of all) to the EU soft law, but there’s no literal or legal element excluding the BEPS initiative from that refer-ence. This would arguably be the first case in the recent tax history of the Country in which such a large reference is made to non domestic guidelines by the Italian Parlia-ment, allowing the Government to transform policy guidelines and soft law into legally binding provisions of the Italian law. Even if it’s still too early at this stage to assess whether the Government shall pick the opportunity and make use of this possibility or not, nonetheless it remains in line of prin-ciple the relevance of the opportunity, the impact of the OECD-inspired global order and, eventually, the attempt of making a sort of lex mercatoria fisci which has still to be however drafted in details...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the taxation issues arising from a cross-border pipeline. The first element that is addressed is the different possible classifications of a pipeline for tax purposes. The {{fact that the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) {{does not provide a}} universal classification for a cross-border pipeline, leaves tax authorities in the various jurisdictions to interpret and classify the pipeline as they see fit. This lack of consistent classification may give rise to double taxation or even <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation.</b> The study explores the definition of a permanent establishment (“PE”) and analyses the elements of the definition in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention (“MTC”) and the OECD Commentary on Article 5. In this study the assumption is made that the classification of a cross-border pipeline is that it falls within the ambit of Article 5 and should therefore be treated as a PE. If the cross-border pipeline is classified as a PE for taxation purposes the attribution of profits arising from the PE will be attributed in terms of Article 7 of the OECD MTC. In the study the attribution of profits relating to the PE created by the presence of a cross-border pipeline in various jurisdictions is analysed. The attribution of such profits can result in difficulties in determining the exact amount attributable to each of the jurisdictions which the pipeline spans. The author considers the OECD Reports (2008 and 2010 Reports) on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments to comment on whether the reports provide adequate guidance for attributing profits to such a unique situation as that of a cross-border pipeline. It is also addressed whether the attribution of profits to a cross-border pipeline can be dealt with under the general principles of attribution. Case law is also considered, in particular, the German Pipeline Decision which determined whether an underground pipeline can constitute a PE under German domestic law and under the DTA between the Netherlands and Germany. In the conclusion research indicates that there is room for development and further guidance from the OECD in its MTC and Commentary as this is a unique and potentially complex situation that cannot be placed under general provisions or left unaddressed. The current lack of guidance can result in different classifications of the cross-border pipeline which effectively results in adverse tax consequences in different jurisdictions and uncertainty to the taxpayer.

40|$|In 2013, the OECD {{initiated}} {{its very}} comprehensive and ambitious project against base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Largely {{inspired by the}} OECD, similar action to curb BEPS has been taken within the EU. An important part of these organisations’ measures concerns hybrid mismatch arrangements, commonly used by multinationals to achieve BEPS. Hybrid financial instruments, a form of hybrid mismatch arrangement, are financial instruments that bear characteristics of both debt and equity, which often leads to one country characterising the instrument as debt and another characterising it as equity. This difference in characterisation can be exploited to achieve <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation.</b> However, these instruments are not only used for tax arbitrage, but also for real business reasons. Various rules against mismatches from hybrid financial instruments have been proposed. As an example, the EU amended the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (PSD, 2011 / 96 /EU) with the directive 2014 / 86 /EU to obligate Member States to tax profit distributions that have been deductible by the distributing subsidiary. Wider action against mismatches from hybrid financial instruments has been proposed by the EU in directive proposal COM(2016) 26 final and by the OECD in Action 2 of its 15 -point Action Plan against BEPS. Only one of these anti-hybrid rules, the PSD rule, has been implemented in national laws, although only recently. The other two rules are mere proposals, which together {{with the fact that}} countries have little previous experience of such rules makes a study on them motivated. This thesis examines the feasibility of the EU and OECD measures as one of the tools available to counter mismatches from hybrid financial instruments. It analyses and compares these three rules in order to make observations on their interpretation, problems and mutual compatibility, suggesting improvements where fit. The main research method of this study is the dogmatic method. However, even the comparative method is used when the study ventures into the national implementation solutions of the PSD rule in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. 	 The rules are by no means unproblematic. Compatibility with EU primary law, chiefly the basic freedoms, is highly doubtful. There is thus a risk for these actions to be declared void within the Union. Further, these rules link the domestic tax treatment to that of another jurisdiction (linking rules), which causes complexity. This complexity together with sometimes even poorly drafted rules risks causing undesirable effects, such as mutual incompatibility, double taxation and undue compliance burden for the taxpayer. Therefore, care should be taken before introducing any of these rules...|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, {{the author}} {{discusses}} three cases. The first case, Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) {{is a case}} which has been inspired by the Groupe Steria decision. The main issue in Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) is whether the Groupe Steria decision implies that a Dutch resident parent company cannot be {{denied the right to}} take into account currency losses in respect of a UK resident subsidiary. The Netherlands has denied this right {{on the basis of the}} Dutch participation exemption. The possible inconsistency with EU law has been founded on the idea that a Dutch resident parent company could have taken into account currency losses if the UK resident subsidiary had been a Dutch resident subsidiary with a permanent establishment (PE) in the UK and that subsidiary had been included in a fiscal unity with its Dutch resident parent company. Can this single element of the Dutch fiscal unity regime be relied on because of the Groupe Steria decision? This per-element approach may be relevant not only for the Netherlands, but for all EU Member States and EEA Member States which have a group taxation regime. The two other cases to be discussed, T- 760 / 15 (The Netherlands v. Commission) and T- 636 / 16 (Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v Commission), concern the European Commission decision that Starbucks received forbidden State aid from the Netherlands through an advanced pricing agreement (APA) concluded between Starbucks and the Dutch Tax Authorities (DTA). Both the Netherlands (Case T- 760 / 15) and Starbucks (Case T- 636 / 16) have appealed the decision. The European Commission is very active in the field of taxation of MNEs and potential State aid. In the Starbucks case the arm’s length pricing is at stake, but the Commission is also active in respect of other fields. Sometimes the fields are closely related, such as in the Apple case which concerns the allocation of profits between head office and PE. However, mismatches are also under investigation, such as the mismatch of the PE concept under the US-Luxembourg tax treaty leading to <b>double</b> <b>non-taxation</b> in the McDonald’s case. The Starbucks case may also be relevant for all EU and EEA Member States, because APA practices are widely applied by the Member States. This contribution starts by discussing Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) which is followed with a discussion of the Starbucks cases. For each of the cases, an initial description of the facts is provided. Subsequently, domestic tax law and tax treaty law are addressed. Next, the considerations of the Hoge Raad (HR; Dutch Supreme Court) and the Commission are set out respectively. Thereafter, the focus is on the preliminary questions of the HR and the pleas in law and main arguments in the Starbucks cases. Potential answers to the questions raised are then provided along with comments on the positions taken by the EC, the Netherlands and Starbucks from the author’s personal perspective. These potential answers and comments are not be given in isolation, rather they are based on benchmarks. The contribution is closed by summarizing the author’s main conclusions...|$|E
