One great spear-head [...] (figure 1), like an arrow-point, is 11 {{inches long and}} 4.75 inches [...] wide at the barbs. The stem is perforated with two holes, in one of [...] which there was a portion of an oak pin. It has a flat body and [...] rounded edges, and is carefully finished by rubbing and grinding. One [...] surface is ornamented with three cup-marks from which lines radiate [...] like stars or suns, and the other has only small cups and a few [...] transverse lines. There are some shaped stones, sometimes perforated [...] for suspension, made of the same material; while another group of [...] similar objects is made of cannel coal. All these are highly [...] ornamented by a fantastic combination of circles, dots, lines, cup-and- [...] rings with or without gutters, and perforations. A small pebble [...] (plate XV. no. 10) shows, on one side, a boat with three men plying [...] their oars, {{and on the other}} an incised outline of a left hand having [...] a small cup-and-ring in the palm. The most sensational objects in the [...] collection are, however, four rude figures, cut out of shale (figs. 50- [...] 53), representing portions of the human face and person. One, [...] evidently a female (figure 2), we are informed was found at the bottom [...] of the kitchen midden, a strange resting-place for a goddess; the [...] other three are grotesque efforts to represent a human face. There [...] are also several oyster-shells, ornamented like some of the shale [...] ornaments, and very similar to the oyster-shell ornaments of Dunbuie. [...] A splinter of a hard stone is inserted into the tine of a deer-horn as [...] a <b>handle</b> (<b>plate</b> xiii. no. 5); and another small blunt implement (no. [...] 1) has a bone handle.

40|$|AbstractExact bending {{solutions}} {{of fully}} clamped orthotropic rectangular thin plates subjected to arbitrary loads are derived using the finite integral transform method. In the proposed mathematical method {{one does not}} need to predetermine the deformation function because only the basic governing equations of the classical plate theory for orthotropic plates are used in the procedure. Therefore, unlike conventional semi-inverse methods, it serves as a completely rational and accurate model in plate bending analysis. The applicability of the method is extensive, and it can <b>handle</b> <b>plates</b> with different loadings in a uniform procedure, which is simpler than previous methods. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the approach as compared with those previously reported in the bibliography...|$|R

40|$|Ziegler {{pioneered the}} study of thick-plate {{buckling}} with allowance for the effect of prebuckling in-plane deformation and concluded that this effect is of the same order of magnitude as that due to shear deformation. This research work further explores this important effect on the elastic buckling loads of rectangular plates with various boundary conditions, thicknesses, aspect ratios, and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratios. In contrast to Ziegler 2 ̆ 7 s static-kinematic approach, the incremental total potential energy approach is adopted. Based on the derived energy functional, the recent pb- 2 Rayleigh-Ritz method is applied for solution. The present energy approach is more convenient for <b>handling</b> <b>plates</b> with any combination of support conditions, as compared to Ziegler 2 ̆ 7 s approach of having to solve a somewhat difficult boundary-value problem.

Conclusions: Brunn is capable of handling the data from microplate assays. It can create dose-response curves and calculate IC 50 values.

40|$|Increased {{mobility}} and internationalization open new challenges to develop effective traffic {{monitoring and control}} systems. This is true for automatic license plate recognition architectures that, nowadays, must <b>handle</b> <b>plates</b> from different countries with different character sets and syntax. While much emphasis {{has been put on}} the license plate localization and segmentation, little attention has been devoted to the huge amount of samples that are needed to train the character recognition algorithms. Nevertheless, these samples are difficult to get when dealing with an international-wide scenario that involves many different countries and the related legislations. This paper reports a new algorithm for license plate recognition, developed under a joint research funded by Autostrade per 1 'Italia S. p. A., the main Italian highways company. The research aimed at achieving improved recognition rates when dealing with vehicles coming from different European and nearby states.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a new Kirchhoff plate model is {{developed}} for the static analysis of isotropic micro-plates with arbitrary shape based on a modified couple stress theory containing only one material length scale parameter which can capture the size effect. The proposed model is capable of <b>handling</b> <b>plates</b> with complex geometries and boundary conditions. From a detailed variational procedure the governing equilibrium equation of the micro-plate and the most general boundary conditions are derived, {{in terms of the}} deflection, using the principle of minimum potential energy. The resulting boundary value problem is of the fourth order (instead of existing gradient theories which is of the sixth order) and it is solved using the Method of Fundamental Solutions (MFS) which is a boundary-type meshless method. Several plates of various shapes, aspect and Poisson’s ratios are analyzed to illustrate the applicability of the developed micro-plate model and to reveal the differences between the current model and the classical plate model. Moreover, useful conclusions are drawn from the micron-scale response of this new Kirchhoff plate model...|$|R
