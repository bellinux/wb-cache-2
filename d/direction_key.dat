50|$|Comic {{books are}} reliant on their {{organization}} and appearance. Authors largely {{focus on the}} frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed <b>direction.</b> <b>Key</b> tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.|$|E
50|$|Strafe-jumping was {{a result}} of a bug in the code base of the 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, but it was later decided to be kept intact, as it had become a {{standard}} technique used by players. The bug itself relies on mathematics: when pressing a <b>direction</b> <b>key,</b> the game adds a unit vector in that direction to the player's movement speed. The final sum, however, is never normalized - this means that by directing the avatar away from the current kinetic vector but within 90 degrees of it, the player can exceed its own top speed.|$|E
50|$|Volume One (The Marrano of Reason) uses {{historical}} and literary materials to elicit {{a set of}} typical and recurring Marrano patterns (for example: life on two levels, overt and concealed; the use of equivocation and dual language; the search for an alternative way to salvation, replacing Jesus and Moses with philosophical reason, etc.) which in Spinoza are transposed from the context of religion to that of reason. From the other <b>direction,</b> <b>key</b> philosophical issues in Spinoza (language, politics and the multitude, the third kind of knowledge) are also, at the same time, shown to be responding to Marrano-like elements that further illuminate and contextualize them. Yovel insists that this contextualization is not reductive: Spinoza's ideas have an independent rational import that cannot be reduced to the historical circumstances {{that allowed them to}} arise.|$|E

5000|$|The 100 Bullets {{video games}} were adaptations {{of the comic}} book series of the same name, which was created by Brian Azzarello. The first {{cancelled}} title was to be developed by Acclaim Studios Austin and published by Acclaim Entertainment. It was planned to release for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004. It would star two characters: Cole Burns (a character from the comic), and Snow Falls, a character created for the video game and designed by Azzarello. Eduardo Risso (another figure involved in the comic) {{was responsible for the}} art <b>direction.</b> <b>Key</b> gameplay mechanics revealed include an auto-aim system that rewards players for patience, a [...] "rage meter" [...] that when full allows players to kill all enemies nearby, and the ability to use enemies as human shields. The game was cancelled following Acclaim's financial problems and closure in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|The Unreal series's {{movement}} and jump mechanics {{are one of}} the many things that set the series far apart from the other FPS games. While most games have the simple [...] "jump" [...] and [...] "duck" [...] commands, Unreal is {{one of the very few}} games that has a [...] "dodge" [...] mechanic. The dodge is performed by pressing any <b>direction</b> <b>key</b> twice in rapid succession. After inputting the command, the player will do a fast jump in that direction; while the idea is simple, it has added a whole level of playing style, making it much more fast-paced and requiring one to have excellent aiming (at higher levels of play at least). Wall-dodging and double jumping were added to the series in UT2003, adding yet another twist to the entire gameplay style. The dodging mechanics were tweaked in UT3, making for more ground-based combat instead of Superman-like aerial acrobatics.|$|E
