5|$|The church, {{which is}} a main {{location}} for the film, was substantially set-dressed. Despite having several original medieval wall paintings, the largest addition {{was the creation of}} the medieval mural by artist Margot Noyes. To create the impression of an austere country church, Victorian stone flags were replaced with brick pavers for the duration of filming and the original wall paintings covered up. Plastic <b>guttering</b> and other modern additions were covered up or removed. The churchyard had several gravestones added, including the large box tomb {{which is a}} focus of several scenes.|$|E

The gables are weatherboarded above the plain wall with double casement windows opening into the attic. The rear has a prominent late 18th century extension covered by the catslide roof. The rest of the rear of the building is a series of flat-roofed extensions. The roof is steeply pitched, tiled and half-hipped with over-hanging eaves Kent peg tiles, and weatherboarded gables. Forged brackets support the <b>guttering.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1889 to 1902, an {{extensive}} programme of conservation {{was carried out}} on the bridge and gate, directed by Monmouthshire County Council, which retained responsibility for maintenance. This began with the prevention of the potential collapse of the gatehouse by the insertion of metal tie rods to hold the two faces of the tower together; the four round plates {{at the ends of}} these two rods can still be seen. In 1892, conservation work began on the arches and piers of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the gatehouse exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. Roof <b>guttering</b> and downpipes were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of Old Red Sandstone, and the cruciform arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the gatehouse was restored to make it symmetrical. Concluding the 1889–1902 renovations, improvements were made to the interior of the gatehouse, and it was opened to the public in 1902.|$|E
40|$|A <b>gutter</b> {{design that}} optimises self {{flushing}} potential {{is crucial in}} rain water harvesting at the dwelling scale. Excluding and removing organic debris from a <b>gutter</b> {{is essential for the}} maintenance of water quality in water harvesting systems. There are existing debris exclusion products; however the function, performance and suitability of these products is not well understood and application is limited as they require ongoing maintenance. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the water harvesting <b>gutter</b> configuration that minimises the maintenance needs and optimises self flushing. Investigation into the conditions and processes that influence the performance of guarded and un-guarded roofs found that the failure mechanisms of <b>gutter</b> guard products was due to the entrapment of debris (above the guard) and infiltration of decomposed debris. A series of experiments was undertaken to test a set of three hypotheses, regarding the most efficient shape and slope and obstruction threshold. The results support the notion that the semi-circular <b>gutter</b> is the most efficient cross sectional shape for a <b>gutter.</b> Increasing the slope of a <b>gutter</b> increased the bed-load (sediment) transport facility of a <b>gutter,</b> but had a negative effect on the removal of buoyant debris from the <b>gutter.</b> The combination of <b>gutter</b> guard products with accessibility to the 'head' of the <b>gutter</b> and the semi-circular high slope design conditions is likely to provide an effective self flushing and low maintenance <b>gutter...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Gutters</b> can be {{described}} as the loss of continuous apposition between {{the main body of the}} endograft, the chimney stent graft, and the aortic wall. <b>Gutters</b> have been associated with increased risk of type IA endoleaks and are considered to be the Achilles' heel of chimney endovascular aneurysm repair (ch-EVAR). However, there is no classification yet to classify and quantify <b>gutter</b> types after ch-EVAR. Methods: Different <b>gutter</b> types can be distinguished by their morphologic appearance in two- and three-dimensional views and reconstructed slices perpendicular to the center lumen line. Results: Three main categories are defined by (1) the most proximal beginning of the <b>gutter,</b> (2) the length of <b>gutter</b> alongside the endograft, and (3) its distal end. Type A <b>gutters</b> originate at the proximal fabric of an endograft, type B <b>gutters</b> originate as loss of apposition of the chimney stent graft in the branch vessel, and type C <b>gutters</b> start below the fabric of the endograft. To determine eventual changes of <b>gutter</b> size during follow-up computed tomography angiograms (CTAs), measurements may be performed with dedicated software on the follow-up CTA scan to assess the extent of <b>gutters</b> over the aortic circumference, ranging from 0 ° to 360 ° of freedom, together with the maximum gap between the endograft material and the aortic wall as it appears on reconstructed axial CTA scan slices. Conclusions: The proposed <b>gutter</b> classification enables a uniform nomenclature in the current ch-EVAR literature and a more accurate risk assessment of gutter-associated endoleaks. Moreover, it allows monitoring of eventual progression of <b>gutter</b> size during follow-up...|$|R

500|$|John Henry Cound Brunt {{was born}} on 6 December 1922, {{on a farm in}} Priest Weston, near Chirbury, Shropshire to Thomas Henry Brunt and Nesta Mary Brunt (née Cound), and began his {{education}} at Chirbury village school. He had an elder sister named Dorothy (born 13 May 1920) and a younger sister Isobel (born 5 October 1923). When Dorothy was eight, the family moved to a farm near Whittington, Shropshire, where John grew up. As he became older, his fearless nature became more apparent; every week, he read the comic Tiny Tots, which featured instructions on [...] "How to teach yourself to swim". One day, he asked Dorothy {{to take him to the}} Shropshire Canal, which went through their farmland. Before his sister could stop him, Brunt had taken off all his clothes and jumped into the canal. When they finally arrived home, their mother wanted to know why he had no clothes on, and John responded that he had been teaching himself to swim. As he got older, his daredevil attitude became even more serious; on one occasion, he was found swinging himself along the <b>guttering</b> of a Dutch barn [...] above the farmyard.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Ferrara {{proposed}} {{a new project}} to build 76 units and homes in seven stages; these stages would have spanned three to four years. Ferrara undertook {{a joint venture with}} Peter Madew, who was to assist with funding and the management needed for the construction. They also proposed restoration efforts to the orphanage, which included painting, repairing holes in walls, and replacing windows. They also planned to restore the front garden, commence general landscaping, construct a recreation area, and build a number of units in the orphanage itself; an indoor swimming pool was proposed for construction in the courtyard. However, Madew claimed that restoration of the orphanage would [...] "cost millions". Ferrara later announced that he would not go ahead with the redevelopment, but instead lodge a new plan: this plan would foresee the construction of 18 new dwellings on the lot. This was objected to by the council should the building remain in its current deteriorating state. Ferrara responded by stating he would commit funds from his profits towards the building's restoration, at a cost of least $1.5 million. In late 2013, Ferrara {{proposed a}}nother development on the lot which would see the construction of 15 residential units. However, the Goulburn Mulwaree Council has demanded that Ferrara must schedule repairs to the orphanage before any approval can be granted. In response, Ferarra pledged to spend $250,000 on restoration works, covering downpipe, <b>guttering,</b> and roof repairs, as well as window replacements and external painting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale experimental {{investigation into the}} effects of box <b>gutter</b> geometry on the open channel flow conditions above siphonic roofwater outlets. In particular, the effects of channel width (300, 400, 480 and 600 mm) and length (14. 86 and 32. 00 m) were investigated through measurements of flow rate, water depth and longitudinal velocity in the box <b>gutter.</b> The experimental results showed that for the same outlet flow rate, the depth {{of water in the}} <b>gutter</b> varied by up to 211 % for the two different <b>gutter</b> lengths tested. Generally, the greatest water depths for the different flow rates were recorded in the 400 -mm wide <b>gutter</b> and the lowest water depths were recorded in the 300 -mm wide <b>gutter.</b> It was also found that the maximum flow rate through the single 110 -mm diameter outlet varied depending on the width of the <b>gutter.</b> Practical application: The depth of water in the open channel box <b>gutters</b> above the outlets of siphonic drainage systems is an important design variable and it is imperative to be able to accurately estimate these water depths during all phases of operation to reduce flood damage risk. This research study has found that for the same flow rate, varying the length of <b>gutter</b> on either side of a siphonic outlet strongly influences the depth of water along the <b>gutter</b> and above the outlet. The results suggest that there may be an optimum <b>gutter</b> width and length for which different siphonic outlets may perform more efficiently...|$|R
2500|$|The {{structure}} was damaged in the gale, heavy seas and North Sea flood of 1953 and became weaker during ensuing years. [...] By the 1970s {{it had fallen}} into disuse. By 1974 the piles over the beach were corroded, and {{this led to the}} northern half of the interior being closed to the public in 1975. In 1977 it had become dangerous to walk beneath the glass awning inside the building, and stones in rough seas had smashed the windows at the back; some window frames had come away. Concrete and iron pillars in the 1924 section had split, <b>guttering</b> had rusted and there was smashed glass on the floor, rotten woodwork and detached light-bulb holders. The building had a [...] "keep clear, dangerous structure" [...] notice on it. The assistant city architect Jed Baker said there had been insufficient funds for regular surveys and maintenance.

2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as <b>guttering</b> - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|E
