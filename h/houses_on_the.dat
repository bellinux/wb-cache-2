5|$|The {{perimeter}} wall of {{the citadel}} is not a continuous fortification wall, but consists of the façades of approximately 100 houses that have been built against each other. Because they have been built {{on or near the}} steep slope of the citadel mound, many of these façades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of the citadel. The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses {{can be found on the}} southeastern side of the mound, whereas <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern perimeter date to the 1930s–1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> citadel were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> citadel.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{played on}} The Meadows {{for the first}} two years of their history, before moving to grounds in Newington (Mayfield Park) and Bonnington Road, Leith (Powderhall), in {{different}} spells between 1877 and 1879. After the lease on Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as Hibernian Park, on what is now Bothwell Street in Leith. Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site in 1890. Hibs obtained a lease on a site that is now known as Easter Road in 1892 and have played their home matches there since February 1893.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{purchased}} a small holiday {{home on the}} mountain at Obersalzberg. Renovations began in 1934 and were completed by 1936. A large wing was added onto the original house and several additional buildings were constructed. The entire area was fenced off, and remaining <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain were purchased by the Nazi Party and demolished. Braun {{and the other members}} of the entourage were cut off from the outside world when in residence. Speer, Hermann Göring, and Martin Bormann had houses constructed inside the compound.|$|E

5|$|OTA began filing {{condemnation}} {{suits for}} homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, {{the process by}} which a government exercises its powers of eminent domain, was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and drainage work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built {{right into the}} stand itself (as shown on old {{photographs}} of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road and rented them to players. One of the players to live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.|$|E

5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a request}} from the Chief of Combined Operations Admiral Louis Mountbatten for probes of German coastal defences, No. 62 Commando, {{also known as the}} Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), mounted a number of {{operations}} in 1942. The first three missions were complete successes: Operation Barricade (14/15 August 1942), Operation Dryad, (2/3 September 1942), and Operation Pound (7/8 September 1942). Aquatint was planned for a night in mid September 1942 as a reconnaissance mission near Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, a small coastal town near Port en Bessin in Normandy. The mission was to collect information about the surrounding area, and take a German guard prisoner. Aerial reconnaissance had identified a small group of <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seafront thought to be occupied by Germans.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, {{the mayor}} of London, Boris Johnson {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces. The traffic improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches idling on Park Lane. The widening of the road distanced the <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side of Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass. Despite the traffic noise the road is still upmarket, featuring five-star hotels (such as The Dorchester, the Grosvenor House Hotel and the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel) and showrooms for several sports car models, including BMW, Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 3 January, 200 police {{officers}} from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night {{the residents of the}} <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> block were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband.

5|$|Kenwood {{was built}} in 1913, and was {{originally}} called The Brown House. On Wood Lane, off Cavendish Road, and built in a mock-Tudor style, the footprint and gardens cover , of which the house must occupy {{no more than one}} fifth and the plot may not be subdivided into more than one home under the rules of the building scheme. It was designed in 1913 by architect Theophilus Arthur Allen, who had been commissioned by local man Norman H. Johnson. Allen employed a local firm called Love & Sons in the construction of Kenwood. The hill was divided into lots around the Weybridge Golf Club, which was designed by Harry Colt in 1912. Many of the original <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> estate were built by master builder Walter George Tarrant whose firm constructed the original external garage ca.1920 (demolished ca.1995).|$|E
5|$|Not {{far from}} Beaverkill Road is {{the east end}} of the {{spillway}} road, which was closed as a security precaution following the September11, 2001 attacks, but reopened after construction of a new alignment of NY28A was completed in 2012. Past the spillway road, NY28A continues east, briefly crossing the Blue Line and leaving Catskill Park as it passes another spillway. At the spillway's southeastern tip is a junction with Stone Church Road, where the route turns back to the north and reenters the park. Now in the town of Hurley, NY28A continues to follow the irregular reservoir shoreline to the northeast, but on a slightly further inland alignment than before. The land here remains wooded, but more frequently broken by <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern side.|$|E

5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E
5|$|To the south, is the Croquet lawn, {{previously}} {{a tennis}} court – Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn {{are a number of}} structures grouped around the Victorian kitchen garden, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> estate. In 1928 he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused some controversy. Near the kitchen garden are the Golden Rose walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.|$|E
