40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which inert gases influence metabolism were investigated from several viewpoints. Groups of rats were exposed at the thermal neutral temperature of the respective mixtures, to normoxic (P sub A 02 = 100 mm Hq) environments with argon, helium or nitrogen as the diluent at a total pressure of one atmosphere. The possible influence of <b>diluent</b> <b>gases</b> on oxygen transport to the cell was examined with hypoxic (P sub A O 2 = 70 mm Hg) mixtures of the same <b>diluent</b> <b>gases.</b> Metabolic measurements included food, water, and oxygen consumption, CO 2 production, hematocrit and the rate C- 14 O 2 of expiration subsequent to intraperitoneal injection of acetate- 1 -C- 14 or glucose UL-C- 14. Argon-exposed animals showed a consistently decreased metabolic rate while, on the other hand, helium-exposed rats did not significantly alter metabolic rate relative to nitrogen. Certain indices, including acetate and glucose utilization, suggested that helium attenuated the imposed hypoxia at the cellular level while argon facilitated it as compared with nitrogen. These results suggest that metabolic influence of helium is largely thermal in nature while argon has a significant direct metabolic effect and that <b>diluent</b> <b>gases</b> may selectively influence oxygen availability to {{the interior of the}} cell...|$|R
50|$|Pure oxygen is not {{considered}} to be safe for recreational diving deeper than 6 meters, so recreational rebreathers and many professional diving rebreathers also have a cylinder of <b>diluent</b> <b>gas.</b> This diluent cylinder may be filled with compressed air or another diving gas mix such as nitrox or trimix. The diluent reduces the percentage of oxygen breathed and increases the maximum operating depth of the rebreather. The diluent is not an oxygen-free gas, such as pure nitrogen or helium, and is breathable as it will be used in an emergency either to flush the loop with breathable gas of a known composition or as a bailout.|$|E
5000|$|In the U.S., the EPA {{requires}} a data acquisition and handling system {{to collect and}} report the data. [...] emissions must be measured in pounds per hour using both an [...] pollutant concentration monitor and a volumetric flow monitor. For NOx, both a NOx pollutant concentration monitor and a <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> monitor are required to determine the emissions rate (lbs/mmBtu). Opacity must also be monitored. NOx measuring is not a current requirement, however if monitored, a [...] or oxygen monitor plus a flow monitor should be used. In monitoring these emissions, the system must be in continuous operation and {{must be able to}} sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes and then averaged hourly.|$|E
5000|$|In {{technical}} diving, where larger {{volumes of}} breathing gas {{need to be}} supplied the usefulness of pony bottles greatly diminishes. This type of diving is the province of twinsets, rebreathers or even more complex assemblages. The diver however still needs to consider bailout - an interruption of the planned dive by breathing gas problems that requires a safe exit to the surface. In certain technical diving equipment configurations the use of larger pony bottles can again come to the fore, particular if the diving is not excessively deep and decompression requirements are modest. An example {{can be in the}} case of rebreathers, where the <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> supply is also used as a bailout bottle for rebreather failure. The capacity of the diluent bottle is very often insufficient for this bailout purpose, and an appropriate larger sized pony can serve as a [...] "backup to the bailout".|$|E

50|$|Long or deep dives using {{open circuit}} scuba {{equipment}} {{may not be}} feasible as {{there are limits to}} the number and weight of diving cylinders the diver can carry. The economy of gas consumption is also useful when the gas mix being breathed contains expensive gases, such as helium. In normal use at constant depth, only oxygen is consumed: small volumes of inert gases are lost during any one dive, due mainly to venting of the gas on ascent. For example, a closed circuit rebreather diver effectively does not use up any <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> after reaching the full depth of the dive. On ascent, no diluent is added, however most of the gas in the loop is lost. A very small amount of trimix could therefore last for many dives. It is not uncommon for a 3 litre (19 cubic foot nominal capacity) diluent cylinder to last for eight 40 m dives.|$|E

The Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime in the vapor phase was carried out over the high-silica ZSM- 5 zeolites or zeolites modified with noble metals to elucidate the effects of the <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> and diluent solvent on the e-caprolactam selectivity and catalyst deactivation. The catalyst lives of the zeolites modified with noble metals were much longer than that of the unmodified zeolite during the rearrangement using carbon dioxide and methanol as the <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> and diluent solvent, respectively. Furthermore, the life of the zeolites modified with noble metals was significantly improved by using a small amount of oxygen as the <b>diluent</b> <b>gas.</b> In this case, methanol was the most suitable diluent solvent for the improvement of catalyst life. The catalyst life decreased with increased cyclohexanone oxime concentration in methanol. Therefore, the coke or coke precursor on the acid sites was presumably removed by methanol vapor. These results indicate that a prolonged catalyst life in the vapor phase Beckmann rearrangement can be achieved by the optimum combination of catalyst and reaction atmosphere. 調製ゲルにヒ素あるいはリンのような 5 価イオンを添加して調製した高シリカZSM- 5 およびこれを貴金属で修飾した触媒を用いて，シクロヘキサノンオキシムの気相ベックマン転位反応を行い，触媒の活性劣化に及ぼす希釈ガスおよび希釈溶媒の影響について検討した。希釈ガスとして二酸化炭素を用い，希釈溶媒としてメタノールを使用すると，貴金属修飾ZSM- 5 の触媒寿命が未修飾触媒の場合よりも著しく向上した。さらに，希釈ガスとして微量の酸素を含むヘリウムを用いて転位反応を行うと，貴金属修飾触媒の寿命が長くなった。この系に対しても，希釈溶媒として触媒寿命に最良の効果を与えるものはメタノールであった。シクロヘキサノンオキシム濃度を増加させると触媒寿命が短くなることから，メタノールは酸点に吸着したε-カプロラクタムのオリゴマーを脱離・除去するのに寄与していると考えられた。これらの結果から，反応雰囲気を調整することにより，固定層反応器による気相系ベックマン転位反応用触媒の寿命の延長が可能となることが分かった...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} {{by the water}} gas shift reaction (WGSR) is equilibrium limited due to thermodynamic constrains. However, this can be overcome by continuously removing the product CO{sub 2 }, thereby driving the WGSR in the forward direction to enhance hydrogen production. This project aims at using a high reactivity, mesoporous calcium based sorbent (PCC-CaO) for removing CO{sub 2 } using reactive separation scheme. Preliminary results have shown that PCC-CaO dominates in its performance over naturally occurring limestone towards enhanced hydrogen production. However, maintenance of high reactivity of the sorbent over several reaction-regeneration cycles warrants effective regeneration methods. We have identified sub-atmospheric calcination (vacuum) as vital regeneration technique that helps preserve the sorbent morphology. Sub-atmospheric calcination studies reveal the significance of vacuum level, <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate, thermal properties of <b>diluent</b> <b>gas,</b> and sorbent loading on the kinetics of calcination and the morphology of the resultant CaO sorbent. Steam, which can be easily separated from CO{sub 2 }, has been envisioned as a potential <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> due to its better thermal properties resulting in effective heat transfer. A novel multi-fixed bed reactor was designed which isolates the catalyst bed from the sorbent bed during the calcination step. This should prevent any potential catalyst deactivation due to oxidation by CO{sub 2 } during the regeneration phase...|$|E

This project aims at using the OSU patented high-reactivity mesoporous precipitated calcium carbonate sorbent for removing the CO{sub 2 } product. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the show the superior performance of the PCC sorbent over other naturally occurring calcium sorbents. Gas composition analyses show the formation of 100 % pure hydrogen. Novel calcination techniques could lead to smaller reactor footprint and single-stage reactors that can achieve maximum theoretical H{sub 2 } production for multicyclic applications. Sub-atmospheric calcination studies reveal the effect of vacuum level, <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate, thermal properties of the <b>diluent</b> <b>gas</b> and the sorbent loading on the calcination kinetics which {{play an important role}} on the sorbent morphology.

Steam calcination studies at 700 - 850 C reveal improved sorbent morphology over regular nitrogen calcination. A mixture of 80 % steam and 20 % CO{sub 2 } at ambient pressure was used to calcine the spent sorbent at 820 C thus lowering the calcination temperature.

(cont.) The substantial error at low flow rates stems from the rated lower flow limit of the controller of 250 SLPM.
