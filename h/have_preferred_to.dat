5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary veterans who were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. Many such may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> join their fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would thus have grown steadily over time until, after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if not exclusively, citizen units.|$|E

5|$|The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela {{had helped}} create, {{called for the}} {{nationalisation}} of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but {{that this was not}} feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{moderation}} and clemency {{shown by}} Kantakouzenos in this settlement, {{it did not}} gain universal acceptance. Supporters of the Palaiologoi still distrusted him, while his own partisans would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> depose the Palaiologoi outright and install the Kantakouzenoi as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, {{and had to be}} placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous appanage covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a march against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated exclave surrounded by the Serbs, refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a de facto independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.|$|E
5|$|H. altispinus {{shared the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation with fellow hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus, hypsilophodont Parksosaurus, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, horned dinosaurs Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ostrich-mimics Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, {{a variety of}} poorly known small theropods {{including}} troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct {{from those in the}} formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. H. altispinus may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> stay more landward.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

5|$|The {{extinction}} of megalodon {{set the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size {{may have contributed to the}} {{extinction of}} megalodon, as they may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The extinction of megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu had {{originally}} {{calculated that the}} game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but managed {{to reduce the number}} to 56. He has stated that he developed the ideas for the music by first reading through the script and creating the titles for all of the tracks, then composing melodies to match the themes of the story and titles. Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy V was much better than that of Final Fantasy IV. He also claimed that this resulted in the soundtrack release requiring two CDs as opposed to the one CD required for the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack. Uematsu has stated that he would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> keep the soundtrack to one CD, {{in order to keep the}} price of the album low.|$|E

5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E
5|$|William of Poitiers {{states that}} William {{obtained}} Pope Alexander II's consent for the invasion, signified by a papal banner, along with diplomatic support from other European rulers. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support before the invasion. William's army assembled {{during the summer}} while an invasion fleet in Normandy was constructed. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E

5|$|Chapter X {{examines}} whether {{patterns in}} the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, {{but not at the}} same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1758, the French and Indian War {{had gone}} very poorly for the British, whose {{military}} met few of its objectives. Following {{a string of}} French victories in 1757 in North America, coupled with military setbacks in Europe, William Pitt gained full control of the direction of British military efforts in the Seven Years' War. Embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in Europe, where France was strong, and offense in North America, where France was weak, he resolved to attack New France (the colonial holdings of France in North America) in three strategic campaigns. Large-scale campaigns were planned to capture Fort Duquesne on the Pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at Louisbourg (on Île-Royale, now known as Cape Breton Island). The third campaign, assigned to General James Abercrombie, was to launch an attack against Canada through the Champlain Valley. Pitt probably would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> have George Howe, a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader, lead this expedition, but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished Abercrombie instead. Howe was appointed a brigadier general, and placed as Abercrombie's second in command.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston would <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The {{first part of the}} ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
