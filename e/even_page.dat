50|$|The stories {{produced}} on an addventure are usually meandering, of uneven quality, and—more often than not—forever unfinished. For many users, {{it is the}} process, and not the end result, that creates their enjoyment of this format.For them, the interaction and collaboration are the point of an addventure, not merely {{the means by which}} it is produced.Sometimes as with any fiction, whether collaborative or not, it is the boundaries and restrictions that produce moments of real greatness.The ability to add only a small piece of a narrative rather than a whole conventional 'chapter' or <b>even</b> <b>page</b> of text allows those who are not as gifted at writing to still participate. This is psychologically extremely rewarding for people of all walks of life and explains the continuing and in fact growing niche popularity of the addventure genre. Some threads have attained an almost novel-like length and complexity, particularly in Never Ending Quest.|$|E

This study considers the differences between the media i. e. paper versus electronic documents in terms of the process of navigation and reading. It is believed that particular locations of information(middle of the <b>page,</b> <b>even</b> odd <b>pages)</b> will allow the paper groups to have an advantage over the digital groups while other locations such as (odd <b>even</b> <b>pages</b> and bottom of pages) will allow the digital groups to have an advantage.

50|$|The {{political}} reforms of Peter the Great (Пётр Вели́кий, Pyótr Velíkiy) {{were accompanied by}} a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization.

Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. Leo Tolstoy's (Лев Толсто́й) War and Peace, contain entire paragraphs and <b>even</b> <b>pages</b> in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.|$|R
40|$|Consider the {{question}} of why we must move our eyes across a line of text in order to read it. Generally, an entire line, paragraph, or <b>even</b> <b>page</b> fits comfortably inside our visual field, yet we laboriously move our eyes around in order to collect enough information to recognize the individual visual symbols of language. This behavior {{can be explained by the}} high concentration of cone photoreceptors in the center of our visual field (see Figure 1. 1). The central 5 o of visual angle (about two thumbnails wide at arm’s length) surprisingly account for roughly half of the cortical representation of the visual input in the brain, and thus it is only in this small area that highly selective character recognition is possible. In fact, uneven visual acuity is a pattern preserved across many branches o...|$|E
40|$|According to Baron and Richardson (1994 : 1), it {{is unusual}} {{to pick up}} a newspaper, watch the news on {{television}} or <b>even</b> <b>page</b> through a magazine without learning about aggression or violence. In South-Africa many such articles in magazines and newspapers indicate that aggression has found a place in society and is experienced daily by people. In addition, aggression is experienced daily by educators in the schools. Furthermore, examples are provided by newspaper headlines such as: “Pupil in hospital after being belted” (Sowetan, 13 May 2003 : 6) and “Bail for teacher accused of death beating” (Daily Sun, 2 August 2003 : 2). Some learners and educators encounter verbal insults, rough physical contact and hostile rejection. These aggressive encounters are sometimes perceived as aggression in a less intense form. Secondary school male educators are to supposed to build relationships with and set an example for the learners at their schools. Therefore it was hoped that a contribution could be made to lessen aggression, which is a destructive element in their relationships, not only with the learners, but potentially with all stakeholders, including colleagues, school management teams, school governing bodies and even figures within the structures of the Mpumalanga Department of Education. Against this background, the need arose for an effective way to reduce aggression, hence this research deals with secondary school male educators’ own aggression. The purpose of this research study was to explore and describe secondary school male educators’ experience of own aggression and furthermore to describe and to recommend guidelines to support those educators who experience own aggression. The participants in this research study were all white Afrikaans speaking, secondary school male educators from the Mpumalanga Department of Education. All the interviewees were between the ages of 36 and 58 years, with experience of teaching, both in the former Transvaal Education Department as well as the new Mpumalanga Department of Education. The research design was based on qualitative research because of its exploratory, descriptive and contextual nature. Qualitative research attempts to describe, interpret or reconstruct the depth, richness and complexity of an identified phenomenon in order to gain an understanding of it and insight into it (Burns & Grove, 1997 : 67). Qualitative research implies a direct concern with experience as it is lived, felt or undergone by people (Merriam, 2001 : 6; Sherman & Webb, 1988 : 7). During phase one data were collected through phenomenological interviews which were audiotaped, and field notes, reflecting the researcher’s observation during the interviews. Creswell (1998 : 51) explains that a phenomenological study describes the meaning of the lived experiences of several individuals about a phenomenon. Therefore the interviews were transcribed for data analysis purposes. Ethical guidelines, which served as standards and as the basis on which the researcher ought to evaluate his conduct during data collection, were followed. During phase two of the research study, the data were analysed according to Tesch’s method (Creswell, 1994 : 154 - 155), an approach for data reduction, after which a literature control was conducted to verify and complement the results. In a literature control, information from the literature is compared with the findings from the study, not only to substantiate the findings but also to enhance the trustworthiness of a research study. In addition, to ensure the trustworthiness of this research study, Guba’s model (Krefting, 1991 : 214 - 222; Lincoln & Guba, 1985 : 290 - 327) was applied. According to the data analysis, three themes were identified, namely: · Secondary school male educators experience their own aggression {{in a variety of ways}}. · Secondary school male educators are of the opinion that a loss of power and/or control elicits aggression. · Secondary school male educators are of the opinion that the implementation of guidelines will enable them to cope with their experience of own aggression. In view of these broad themes, guidelines were described to support secondary school male educators who experience own aggression and therefore also to facilitate mental health. The research findings showed that secondary school male educators experience own aggression in a variety of ways such as experiencing themselves as not being aggressive. They also associate their own aggression with positive as well as negative feelings. Furthermore, these male educators experience ambivalent feelings in relation to their own aggression. They experience a loss of power and/or control, and they are of the opinion that because of this loss these feelings of powerlessness and not being in control give rise to own aggression. Thus there is a need for the implementation of guidelines to support these secondary school male educators who experience own aggression. Based on these findings, guidelines were described to support secondary school male educators who experience own aggression and recommendations were made regarding an approach that would facilitate mental health. More importantly, this study firstly intended to be of value, not only to secondary school male educators, but to all educators in preventing aggressive behaviour (Aggressive behaviour refers to that behaviour directed towards the goal of harming or injuring another living being). Secondly this study also intended to prevent aggressiveness (that relatively persistent readiness to become aggressive) in a variety of different situations. Prof. C. P. H. Myburg...|$|E
