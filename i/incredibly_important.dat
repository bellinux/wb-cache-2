Though the movement coincided with the Spanish and Italian Renaissances, the Portuguese Renaissance was largely separate from other European Renaissances and instead was <b>incredibly</b> <b>important</b> in opening Europe to the unknown and bringing a more worldly view to those European Renaissances, as {{at the time the}} Portuguese Empire spanned the globe.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some <b>incredibly</b> <b>important</b> lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|The {{artifacts}} {{discovered at}} La Venta have been crucial to starting to understand Olmec religion and ideology. For example, hematite and iron-ore mirror fragments {{have been discovered}} in abundance at La Venta. Mirrors were an <b>incredibly</b> <b>important</b> part of Olmec society, used in both rituals and daily life. Celts, or “pseudo-axes,” are extremely common in both burials and offerings. It is unclear whether these artifacts were actually used in any practical way or if their meaning is ritual or symbolic. Most are smooth, but quite a few are decorated with what has been interpreted as representing religious symbolism. Such celts and other jade artifacts were offered to deities during ceremonies at La Venta and the belief in supernatural beings is evidenced in Olmec artifacts. However, {{it is difficult to}} tell which important figures remaining on the stone monuments and artifacts are gods and which are human leaders. In fact, there might have been little difference between the divine and the Olmec king, in their ideology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} reasons for these {{continuous}} changes are the political desire of an immediate outcome and {{the scarcity of}} time devoted to the constitutional drafting process. A study from 2009 showed that the average time allocated for the drafting {{part of the process}} is around 16 months [...] however there were also some extreme cases registered. For example, the Myanmar 2008 Constitution was secretly drafted for more than 17 years, whereas on the other extreme, like the case of the Japan's 1946 Constitution, the bureaucrats drafted everything in no more than a week.Nevertheless, the record for the shortest overall process of drafting, adoption and ratification of a national Constitution belongs to the Romania's 1938 Constitution which installed a royal dictatorship in less than a month. Studies on the matter showed as a general conclusion that usually non-democracies where the registered extreme cases where the constitution-making process either takes too long or is <b>incredibly</b> short. <b>Important</b> not to forget or make any confusions about it is that constitutional rights are not a specific characteristic of democratic countries, but also non-democratic countries have Constitutions, such as North Korea for example, which officially grants every citizen, among other rights, the freedom of expression.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Iftekhar {{graduated}} to playing uncle, father, and {{what came to}} be his speciality: police inspector roles, doctor or senior advocate. Generally he played 'sympathetic' characters but, on occasion, he played the heavy. One of his most memorable roles as a heavy was as Amitabh Bachchan's corrupt industrialist mentor in Yash Chopra's classic Deewaar (1975). Another of Iftekhar's classic roles was as the police inspector in Prakash Mehra's Zanjeer. It was a small part, but the scene where Iftekhar reprimands the near-hysteric Amitabh Bachchan for taking the law into his own hands is <b>incredibly</b> powerful. Another <b>important</b> role as a police officer was played by him in 1978 hit film Don.Some of his major roles came in Rajesh Khanna films like Joroo Ka Ghulam, Mehboob Ki Mehndi, The Train , Khamoshi, Safar, Raja Rani, Ittefaq, Rajput, Awam.|$|R

Don Groves of SBS marvelled at Spong's ability to single handedly bring the story to cinema: [...] "Multi-tasking as director, producer, cinematographer and editor, Spong has crafted a handsome-looking production despite working on a frugal budget. It’s an impressive effort" [...] and also gave the film four stars. Richard Watts of Artshub also gave the film four stars and named it amongst his most favourate films of the year, describing it as: [...] "an important film, and a beautiful one.".

Quturjuuk, meaning [...] "collar-bones", was a constellation that included Capella (Alpha Aurigae), Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum), and Castor (Alpha Geminorum). Its rising signalled that the constellation Aagjuuk, {{made up of}} Altair (Alpha Aquilae), Tarazed (Gamma Aquilae), and sometimes Alshain (Beta Aquilae), would rise soon. Aagjuuk, which represented the dawn following the winter solstice, was an <b>incredibly</b> <b>important</b> constellation in the Inuit mythos.

500|$|Ben Parker's {{wife and}} Peter's aunt. Field said {{the main reason}} {{she felt she had}} to be in the film was because of {{producer}} Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an <b>incredibly</b> <b>important</b> thing to have." [...] Webb said that while [...] "we all love Aunt May", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. [...] "He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment?

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} attempts to learn about contagion using observational (i. e. non-experimental) data collected from a single social network. While the conclusions of these studies may be correct, the methods rely on assumptions that are likely [...] and sometimes guaranteed to be [...] false, and therefore the evidence for the conclusions is often weaker than it seems. Developing methods that {{do not need to}} rely on implausible assumptions is an <b>incredibly</b> challenging and <b>important</b> open problem in statistics. Appropriate methods don't (yet!) exist, so researchers hoping to learn about contagion from observational social network data are sometimes faced with a dilemma: they can abandon their research program, or they can use inappropriate methods. This chapter will focus on the challenges and the open problems and will not weigh in on that dilemma, except to mention here that the most responsible way to use any statistical method, especially when it is well-known that the assumptions on which it rests do not hold, is with a healthy dose of skepticism, with honest acknowledgment and deep understanding of the limitations, and with copious caveats about how to interpret the results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to provide the}} reader with a comprehensive understanding of Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson's GKM theory. GKM theory is an <b>incredibly</b> rich and <b>important</b> mathematical theory which utilizes many diverse areas of mathematics to describe torus equivariant cohomologies in a relatively easy to understand form. Equivariant cohomology is a theory {{from the field of}} algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, which states that given a topological space, a group, and a group action, one can find the corresponding equivariant cohomology ring. These equivariant cohomology rings are important because they act as invariants for the set of the topological space, the group, and the group action. What GKM theory does is supply information about the torus action via the cohomology ring using combinatorial means rather than the standard topological ones. Amazingly, Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson's theory is a constructive proof and so provides the details on how to construct these GKM graphs, which allows the torus equivariant cohomology ring structure of the space to be read off of the graph's vertices. Our goal for this thesis was to make steps toward adapting GKM theory to a more general form of cohomology called equivariant quantum cohomology...|$|R

40|$|The Southwest is: {{an atomic}} testing zone, a paradise, a penal colony, a frontier, a mineral paradise, a fertile space, an arid zone, a forsaken wilderness, {{a region of}} mind-boggling biodiversity, an {{aesthetic}} haven, a brutal and ugly corpse-field, a mythical highway, the Devil’s Highway, everything, and nothing. This paper begins as an overview of several narrative trends that feature the Southwest as a literary space. 20 th C. Native American Literature of the Southwest has given nature a primary narrative place. Nature is resonant and enables a dialectics of self-discovery and healing. Anglo American Literature often sees the Southwest as a wilderness against which to encounter one’s identity—Nature must be confronted and overcome for both national and personal reasons. Chicano Literature asserts and celebrates the myth of Aztlán, and this paper will specifically consider the highly political and experimental Chicano novels of the 1970 s. I will also briefly discuss the much smaller, but <b>incredibly</b> revealing and <b>important</b> African American and Japanese American literary contributions to Southwestern Literature. Ultimately, I argue {{for the importance of}} drawing a literary map of the Southwest that takes into account each and every quirk, turn, and contestation provided by the many narrative strands I will investigate. The literary topography of this unique space is one that we must continue to consider for the sake of collective identities, environmental safekeeping, existential exploration, and (inter) national politics for quite some time to come...|$|R
