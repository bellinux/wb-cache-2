25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp,</b> for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. <b>Hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|E

40|$|During {{manufacturing}} and in use fiber composites emit voltatile organic compounds (VOC). Many factors {{can affect the}} emission such as the raw materials used (fibers, polymer, additives), the pulping process applied for pulp production and aging conditions. The work presented deals with emission of VOC from wood fibers as well as medium density fiberboards (MDF) made therefrom. Moreover, the emission from hemp fibers and composites made therefrom was also assessed. The results reveal that the chemical composition of VOC and their amounts depend highly on the raw material (pine wood and hemp straw) used {{as well as on}} the pulping process (thermo-mechanical process (TMP) and chemo-thermo-mechanical process (CTMP)) and pulping conditions applied. The objective of further work was to reduce the amount of VOC through adding highly reactive polyphenolic polymers such as condensed tannins during wood and <b>hemp</b> straw <b>pulping.</b> The results indicate that addition of tannins in the CTMP process improves the mechanical properties of the medium density fiberboards and lower theit emission. The emission of hemp fibers and hemp composites prepared therefrom turned out to be very low...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{feasibility}} of using cellulose fibers obtained from an agricultural waste, hemp core (Cannabis Sativa L), through different new environmental friendly cooking processes for fiber-cement production. The physical and mechanical properties of the fiber reinforced concrete, which depend on the nature and morphology of the fibers, matrix properties and the interactions between them, must be kept between the limits required for its application. Therefore, the morphology of the fibers and how its use affects the flocculation, retention and drainage processes in the fiber-cement manufacture, and the mechanical and physical properties of the fiber-cement product have been studied. The use of pulp obtained by means of the hemp core cooking in ethanolamine at 60 % concentration at 180 degrees C during 90 min resulted in the highest solids retention and the best mechanical properties among the studied <b>hemp</b> core <b>pulps.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Dewey(1943) have no words about hemp as a raw material for production of paper.Dried hemp has about 57% cellulose (the principal ingredient in paper), compared to about 40-50% in wood. Hemp also has the advantage of a lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood. This lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual production of hemp fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year. Between 1934 and 1935, the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp.|$|E

30|$|The {{viscosity}} of kenaf {{bast fiber}} {{has been found}} to be highly sensitive and variable with different pulping methods; therefore, it is important to choose proper chemicals and conditions for pulping and bleaching of kenaf bast fiber. From several pulping experiments, a nonconventional pulping method with a combination of ammonium oxalate pretreatment followed by soda pulping at normal pressure and then acidic chlorite delignification was developed to obtain high-viscosity pulp (162 centipoise). The optimum level of alkali dosage of soda pulping for high-viscosity pulp was found to be 15 % (on pulp as NaOH). Pulps showed linear relations between viscosity and xylose or glucose contents, but the combination pulping method gave extremely high pulp viscosity, beyond the relations. The highest viscosity pulp from kenaf bast fiber demonstrated a tear index about twofold and a folding endurance 6.2 -fold higher than those of Manila <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> with comparable tensile and burst indexes. The high-viscosity pulp could be used in the production of high-quality currency paper or longevity paper for special uses.|$|E
30|$|Hand-made {{rag paper}} {{was chosen as}} a model paper since most of manuscripts with {{verdigris}} to be treated are made of rag paper. Rag paper was obtained from Gangolf Ulbricht Papierwerkstatt, Berlin, Germany. It was made of linen and <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> and gelatin sized with alum. Its grammage was around 80  g/m 2. Finely ground copper acetate verdigris pigment (product no. 44450 by Kremer Pigmente GmbH, Germany) mixed with gum arabic (product no. 63320 by Kremer Pigmente GmbH, Germany) (pigment: 20 % w/v of gum arabic in water:water[*]=[*] 1 : 2 : 1) was brushed onto an area of 50 * 60  mm of the rag paper using the glass rod application method and a brushing application. The glass rod application {{was carried out by}} dragging the paint applied on a thin film of polyester onto the rag paper quickly and evenly with a glass rod. For the brushing application of the paint, the paint was brushed on the area of interest after testing the brushing performance to paint the entire area evenly. The sample was air-dried and conditioned at 80 % RH for 30  minutes in a humidity chamber and then flattened using blotters, felts, and weights.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cellulose diacetate was {{produced}} from hemp fibers. Two main stages {{were required to}} produce the product; pulp production (delignification) by soda pulping and acetylation of the pulp to cellulose diacetate. Soda pulping of hemp fibers was carried out under various conditions of temperature and liquor concentration. From {{a consideration of the}} Kappa number of pulps obtained, it could be inferred that the optimum condition for pulp production is a liquor concentration of 5 - 10 wt % NaOH at about 160 oC. These conditions produced pulp with a maximum Kappa number of about 5. The degree of polymerization of the cellulose obtained from pulping at 160 oC using 15 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution was found to be approximately 450 indicating that considerable degradation of the cellulose structure had occurred. This lends weight to the desirability of reducing the liquor concentration to the suggested range. The α-cellulose content obtained was over 98 wt. %. Cellulose acetate flake/film {{was produced}} from the pulp in three main stages; activation, acetylation and hydrolysis. Activation was carried out by mixing <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> with an equal amount of glacial acetic acid followed by acetylation at 30 °C and finally hydrolysis to diacetate...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest for using non-woody fibres as raw materials for production of paper´s pulp. The present work aims to identify and quantify the environmental impacts associated with the production of flax fibres, through 3 -year field experiment, carried out in Bologna and Pisa representative of the pedoclimatic characteristics of central Italy. Life Cycle Impact of “a one ton of fibre ready to be processed in a pulp mill” was assessed taking into account: farming, straw process (drying, scutching and baling) and transport. Inventory data for agricultural inputs and outputs were obtained directly from field experimentation and from bibliographic data about heat, transport and electricity consumption on straw processing. An economic allocation approach to assign impacts within flax seed and processed straw has been used. The CML baseline 2000 methodology was selected to quantify the potential environmental impact associated to the crops. Specifically, global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP) and photochemical oxidant formation (POP) were evaluated together with energy use (EU). Major impacts contribution arise from fertilizers use and straw processing. Cultivation phase of flax fibre at Pisa reported higher values (approximately 3 times greater) for all the impact categories. The lower impact in the flax cultivation scenario at Bologna was due to no use of mineral fertilizer and the higher flax-straw yield. It resulted also a strong reduction of the impacts with respect to those of <b>hemp</b> <b>pulp</b> in Spain {{as well as to}} the impacts of the conventional wood-pulp reported in Simapro. Furthermore, LCA tool aided to identify the materials and process that most affected the impacts: fertilizers use, diesel consumption and straw processing were identified as hot spots in both crops. Finally, non-wood pulp derived from Bologna´s Flax straw represents an opportunity to replace conventional wood pulp in Italian paper industry...|$|E
