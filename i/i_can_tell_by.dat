"Barnaby, Barnaby, thou'st been drinking, [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> thy nose, and thy eyes winking; [...] Drunk at Richmond, {{drunk at}} Dover, [...] Drunk at Newcastle, drunk all over.

Anything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get you in town? Well, good-bye, dear, good-bye!' Maude {{had never seen him}} make so hurried an exit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{statements}} are most remarkable," [...] said the voice, on concluding its questioning, [...] "but you are evidently speaking the truth, {{and it is}} equally evident {{that you are not}} of Barsoom. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> the conformation of your brain and the strange location of your internal organs and the shape and size of your heart." ...|$|R

"Jumper {{was under}} that tree when that white robber from the Far North {{tried to catch}} me, and he took that chance to leave in a hurry. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> the length of this jump. Probably he is still going. It is useless to follow him because he has too long a start," [...] said Shadow, and he snarled again in rage and disappointment.|$|R
60|$|PARAMORE. My dear Miss Craven, what {{a cynical}} thing to say! You! who are loved {{at first sight}} by {{the people in the}} street as you pass. Why, in the club <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the faces of the men whether you have been lately in the room or not.|$|E
6000|$|Hester saw it {{and said}} within herself, [...] "That boy has good blood in his veins. He's no clodhopper's son, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> his hands and feet, his air and walk. Poor lad, it's hard for him, I'll warrant, but he's not too proud for honest work, and I like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{gave you}} that {{patchwork}} {{to see what}} you would make of it, and it is as good as a diary to me, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the different squares how you felt when you made them,' continued Aunt Pen, with a twinkle in her eye as she glanced at the many-coloured bits on the carpet.|$|E
6000|$|You gratify me {{more than}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>by</b> what you say about [...] "Copperfield," [...] the more so as I hope myself that some heretofore-deficient qualities are there. You {{are not likely to}} {{misunderstand}} me when I say that I like it very much, and am deeply interested in it, and that I have kept and am keeping my mind very steadily upon it.|$|R
60|$|Not one dissentient {{voice has}} reached me {{respecting}} it. Through the dullest {{time of the}} year we held our circulation most gallantly. And it could not have taken a better hold. I saw Forster on Friday (newly returned from thousands of provincial lunatics), and he really was more impressed than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>by</b> what he had seen of it. Just what you say you think it will turn out to be, he was saying, almost in the same words.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what she}} wants, poor creeter; I'll {{let her have}} a right nice time, and warm and feed and chirk her up, and then I'll see what's {{to be done for}} her. She ain't one of the common sort, and {{goodness}} only knows what Rachel sent her here for. She's poor and sick, but she ain't bad. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> her face, and she's the sort I like to help. It's a mercy I ain't eat my supper, so she can have that bit of meat and the pie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wow!" [...] ejaculated Joe. [...] "Drops out {{of sight}} there. But that one ain't much. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the roar. When you see my hair stand up straight--then watch out!... Lassiter, you look after the women. Shefford, you stand ready to bail out with the shovel, for we'll sure ship water. Nas Ta Bega, you help here with the oar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This boat {{approaches}} the island, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{the sound that}} it is a large prahu. If it touches here it will be for the purpose of spending the night, and Malay boatmen are not always agreeable neighbours. However, it is not likely they will ramble far from where they land, so we may escape observation if we keep quiet." ...|$|E
6000|$|His face {{lights up}} with quiet malice. [...] "Don't keep them, sir," [...] he says. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> his {{expression}} that I am ridiculously low, and so being snubbed. I think of trying with three-and-six, or seven-and-six; {{the only other}} probable prices for things that I know, except a guinea and five pounds. Then I see the absurdity of the business, and my anger comes surging up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{your eyes}} on his hand. You will see that he takes up five sovereigns from the heap before him, {{and that he has}} them in his hand when he pushes the card out. You will notice how he fixes his eye upon the dealer, and that he leaves either one or five, as I have said. He does it, at times, all through the evening, {{especially}} when Gordon is dealing; for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> myself, <b>by</b> Gordon's face whether he has a good or a bad card. Of course, he can see it, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to go}} away," [...] Lucilla went on; [...] "I don't want {{to leave}} him. All I ask for, {{is a little more}} time. Time must help me to get back again to my old self. My blind days have been the days of my whole life. Can a few weeks of sight have {{deprived}} me of the feelings which have been growing in me for years? I won't believe it! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find my way about the house; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> things <b>by</b> my touch; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do all that I did in my blindness, just as well as ever, now I am blind again. The feeling for him will come back to me like the rest. Only give me time! only give me time!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Her {{left foot}} {{was nothing to}} be proud of, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you! <b>By</b> her own account, she has some horrid {{deformity}} in it, between the third toe and the fourth. No; I didn't hear her say what the deformity was. I only heard her call it so--and she said her 'poor darling' was born with the same fault, and that was her defence against being imposed upon by rogues--I remember the very words--'in the past days when I employed people to find her.' Yes! she said 'her.' I heard it plainly. And she talked afterwards of her 'poor lost daughter', who might be still living somewhere, and wondering who her mother was. Naturally enough, when I heard that hateful old drunkard talking about a child given to her by Mr. Farnaby, I put two and two together. Dear me, how strangely you look! What's wrong with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There {{is one of}} our comrades lying by the huts, Wilcox. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{his white}} ducks that it is either Mr. Towel or Joyce; whether he is alive or dead, of course I can’t say. I did not see him move, but no doubt he would be tied hand and foot. I saw nothing of the others, {{and there would be no}} reason why he should be treated {{differently}} from them if he were dead.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Propose to her. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{the glitter}} in your eye {{that you are}} {{intending}} to propose to this girl--probably this morning. Don't do it. Women are the devil, whether they marry you or jilt you. Do you realise that women wear black evening dresses {{that have to be}} hooked up in a hurry when you are late for the theatre, and that, out of sheer wanton malignity, the hooks and eyes on those dresses are also made black? Do you realise...?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can answer}} that for you," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Lavender brightly; [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> your hospitalized faces that you {{are living in the}} present; a habit which, according to our best writers, is peculiar to the British. I assure you," [...] he went on with a winning look, [...] "there is no future in that. If you do not at once begin to carve fresh niches for yourselves in the temple of industrialism you will be engulfed by the returning flood, and left high and dry upon the beach of fortune." ...|$|E
60|$|The Count and his Excellency Baron von Punter were, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you, {{astonished}} <b>by</b> the smartness of my play: {{the first}} two or three rubbers Punter beat me, but when I came to know his game, I used to knock him all to sticks; or, at least, win six games to his four: and such was the betting upon me; his Excellency losing large sums to the Count, who knew what play was, and used to back me. I did not play except for shillings, so my skill was of no great service to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} by keeping {{on the same}} way we were going past the last land, we shall strike the coast again {{on the other side of}} this bay. I think it is twenty or thirty miles across. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> the way <b>by</b> the wind in the first place, and in the second place by the {{position}} of the sun. You see it is over my right shoulder at present; there is the mark of my shadow on the side. I have got to keep it about there, making some allowance for the change in the position of the sun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{dreamed about}} him--it's the most {{extraordinary}} story: I heard him calling {{to me in the}} night. I took upon myself to dig him up. You know there are people in India--a kind of beastly race, the ghouls--who violate graves. I had a sort of presentiment that they would get at him first. I rode straight, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you; and, <b>by</b> Jove, a couple of them had just broken ground! Crack--crack, from a couple of barrels, and they showed me their heels, as you may believe. Would you credit that I took him out myself? The air brought him to and he was none the worse. He has got his pension--he came home the other day; he would do anything for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he never}} got to be Premier {{on account of his}} looks," [...] said Marilla. [...] "Such a nose as that man had! But he can speak. I was proud of being a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no use for him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get {{yourself}} some blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you're hungry. Matthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn't have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you've had your dinner. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the look of you that you're just full up with speeches, but they'll keep." ...|$|E
6000|$|He took a great {{interest}} in Isabel and remembered perfectly the walk at Neufchatel, when she would persist in going so near the edge. He seemed to recognise this same tendency in the subversive enquiry that I quoted a moment ago, and set himself to answer our heroine's question with greater urbanity than it perhaps deserved. [...] "What does it lead to, Miss Archer? Why Paris leads everywhere. You can't go anywhere unless you come here first. Every one that comes to Europe has got to pass through. You don't mean it in that sense so much? You mean what good it does you? Well, how can you penetrate futurity? How can you tell what lies ahead? If it's a pleasant road I don't care where it leads. I like the road, Miss Archer; I like the dear old asphalte. You can't get tired of it--you can't if you try. You think you would, but you wouldn't; there's always something new and fresh. Take the Hotel Drouot, now; they sometimes have three and four sales a week. Where can you get such things as you can here? In spite of all they say I maintain they're cheaper too, if you know the right places. I know plenty of places, but I keep them to myself. I'll tell you, if you like, as a particular favour; only you mustn't tell any one else. Don't you go anywhere without asking me first; I want you to promise me that. As a general thing avoid the Boulevards; there's very little to be done on the Boulevards. Speaking conscientiously--sans blague--I don't believe any one knows Paris better than I. You and Mrs. Touchett must come and breakfast with me some day, and I'll show you my things; je ne vous dis que ca! There has {{been a great deal of}} talk about London of late; it's the fashion to cry up London. But there's nothing in it--you can't do anything in London. No Louis Quinze--nothing of the First Empire; nothing but their eternal Queen Anne. It's good for one's bed-room, Queen Anne--for one's washing-room; but it isn't proper for a salon. Do I spend my life at the auctioneer's?" [...] Mr. Rosier pursued in answer to another question of Isabel's. [...] "Oh no; I haven't the means. I wish I had. You think I'm a mere trifler; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the expression of your face--you've got a wonderfully expressive face. I hope you don't mind my saying that; I mean it as a kind of warning. You think I ought to do something, and so do I, so long as you leave it vague. But when you come to the point you see you have to stop. I can't go home and be a shopkeeper. You think I'm very well fitted? Ah, Miss Archer, you overrate me. I can buy very well, but I can't sell; you should see when I sometimes try to get rid of my things. It takes much more ability to make other people buy than to buy yourself. When I think how clever they must be, the people who make ME buy! Ah no; I couldn't be a shopkeeper. I can't be a doctor; it's a repulsive business. I can't be a clergyman; I haven't got convictions. And then I can't pronounce the names right in the Bible. They're very difficult, in the Old Testament particularly. I can't be a lawyer; I don't understand--how do you call it?--the American procedure. Is there anything else? There's nothing for a gentleman in America. I should like to be a diplomatist; but American diplomacy--that's not for gentlemen either. I'm sure if you had seen the last min--" ...|$|E
60|$|But I have wandered {{very far}} away from the parade-ground at Senafe. After marching past the regiments formed in close order, the General then {{addressed}} a few words to each. To Major Pritchard of the Engineers he said how glad he was to have his own corps with him again, and that he hoped some day to employ them to blow down the gates of Magdala. To the 33d he said a few words complimenting them upon their efficiency, and regretting {{that they would not be}} led by the gallant officer whose loss he and they deplored. The General then addressed the 10th Native Infantry, complimenting them upon their conduct and efficiency. Sir Robert spoke in Hindoostanee, a language of which my knowledge is unfortunately confined to about eight words; none of these occurred in the speech, and I am therefore unable to give the text. The regiments which go on are delighted at the prospect of a move, and the 10th Native Infantry cheered lustily as they marched off with their band at their head. Fresh troops arrive as fast as others move on. While I have been writing this a portion of the 4th King’s Own have marched in, as also have the mule-battery with the light rifled guns from Woolwich. The most important, however, of to-day’s arrivals has been that of a hundred bullock-carts. A string of camels has also come in, as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the lugubrious bellowings and roar which at present fills the air. The pass is therefore proved to be practicable, and the camels and bullock-carts will be a great assistance to us. The natives must be astonished at seeing this string of carts coming up a place which all their tradition must represent as almost impassable even for their own cattle, which, like goats, can go almost anywhere. Their ideas about us must altogether be rather curious; and as we know by experience how a story expands and alters as it goes, the reports which must reach the extreme confines of Abyssinia must be something astounding. Even here they are not contented with the facts. There is a report among them that the cattle we are buying up are intended to be food for a train of elephants we have coming to help us fight Theodore, and that we have also a lion-train, which will shortly be here. Our news from Magdala is as before. Theodore is slowly, very slowly advancing. He has got heavy cannon, and insists upon taking them with him. Waagshum, the king who has been besieging Magdala, has fairly run away, and the tribes around Magdala have all sent in their allegiance to Theodore. Theodore has been writing to Rassam as if he were his dearest friend, and Rassam has been answering him as if he were Theodore’s grovelling slave. Theodore’s letter runs in this style: “How are you? Are you well? I am quite well. Fear not. I am coming to your assistance. Keep up your head. I shall soon be with you. I have two big cannon. They are terrible, but very heavy to move.” Rassam answers somewhat in this style: “Illustrious and most clement of potentates, I, your lowest of slaves, rejoice at the thought that your coming will throw a light upon our darkness. Our hearts swell with a great joy;” and more fulsome stuff of the same character. Dr. Blanc’s letters to us are at once spirited and manly. “We are delighted,” he says, “at the thought of your coming. How it will end no one can say. We are all prepared for the worst; but we have at least the satisfaction of knowing that our deaths will be avenged.” Up to the last moment of doing this we have no day fixed for Sir Robert Napier’s advance upon Attegrat. The 5th is named as the earliest date upon which a messenger can return from Grant’s party, and say when Kassa, the King of Tigre, will be at Attegrat to meet the General. It is probable that the King will start almost immediately Grant arrives, and in that case Sir Robert will have to move forward at once in order to arrive first at the place of meeting. I go on to-morrow, unless any circumstance should occur to change my plan.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to look at the creatur'; if it is a true Iroquois <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>by</b> his knavish look, and by his paint," [...] said the scout, {{stepping}} past the charger of Heyward, and entering the path behind the mare of the singing-master, whose foal had taken advantage of the halt to exact the maternal contribution. After shoving aside the bushes, and proceeding a few paces, he encountered the females, who awaited the result of the conference with anxiety, and not entirely without apprehension. Behind these, the runner leaned against a tree, where he stood the close examination of the scout with an air unmoved, though with a look so dark and savage, that it might in itself excite fear. Satisfied with his scrutiny, the hunter soon left him. As he repassed the females, he paused a moment to gaze upon their beauty, answering to the smile and nod of Alice with a look of open pleasure. Thence he went {{to the side of the}} motherly animal, and spending a minute in a fruitless inquiry into the character of her rider, he shook his head and returned to Heyward.|$|R
5000|$|Hallyards Castle {{formerly}} stood north-west of {{the main}} village. Supposed originally {{to have been a}} hunting seat of Malcolm Canmore, it was the residence of the Bishops of Dunkeld until 1539. King James V visited the palace after his defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss in late November 1542. According to John Knox, when the lady of the house tried to comfort the king, he announced that he would be dead in fifteen days. Later, his servant asked where James would spend Christmas. [...] "He answerit, with at disdainfull Smirk, I cannot tell, chuse ye the Plaice; but this <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you, or <b>by</b> Yulle-Day ye will be Maisterless, and the Realme without a King." [...] The King returned to Falkland where he learnt of the birth of his daughter Mary on 8 December. He died on 14 December. The palace was mostly demolished in 1847; some remains can be found on farmland north-west of the village centre.|$|R
