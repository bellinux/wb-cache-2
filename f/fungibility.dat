5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human physiology, renewal, and <b>fungibility</b> on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Nussbaum also refines {{the concept}} of [...] "objectification", as {{originally}} advanced by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, <b>fungibility,</b> violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. Her characterization of pornography {{as a tool of}} objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with sex-positive feminism. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of prostitution, a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the Spitzer scandal, writing: [...] "The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing one of the ones they do have is grotesque." ...|$|E
50|$|Wallets {{and similar}} {{software}} technically handle all bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of <b>fungibility.</b> Researchers {{have pointed out}} that the history of each bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the blockchain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin's <b>fungibility.</b> Projects such as CryptoNote, Zerocoin, and Dark Wallet aim to address these privacy and <b>fungibility</b> issues.|$|E

5000|$|The word <b>fungibility</b> {{comes from}} the Latin fungibilis, from the verb fungī, meaning [...] "to perform", related to words such as [...] "function" [...] and [...] "defunct". It is {{unrelated}} to the Latin and English noun fungus or its plural, [...] "fungi".|$|E
50|$|The Old Mutual Implied {{rate was}} widely adopted {{benchmark}} rate for unofficial currency exchange until intervention by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in May 2008 to prohibit {{the transfer of}} shares in Old Mutual, ABC and Kingdom Meikles Africa out of the country, therefore stopping their <b>fungibility.</b>|$|E
50|$|The major {{findings}} by Paul Mosley and others conclude {{that it is}} impossible to establish any significant correlation between aid and growth rate of GNP in developing countries. One reason for this is the <b>fungibility</b> and the leakage of the aid into unproductive expenditure in the public sector.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fungibility</b> is {{different}} from liquidity. A good {{is said to be}} liquid if it can be easily exchanged for money or another good. A good is fungible if one unit of the good is substantially equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality {{at the same time and}} place.|$|E
50|$|Belgium {{has adopted}} <b>fungibility</b> for its {{domestic}} central securities depository, CIK, which {{was set up}} in 1967-1968. According to royal decree No. 62, issued on 10 November 1967, depositors of fungible securities have the rights of co-ownership. This change was fundamental to the development of Euroclear, by then beginning to process Eurobonds and build systems.|$|E
50|$|The latest {{development}} in money uses cryptology to ensure trust & <b>fungibility</b> in a theoretically tamper-proof decentralized ledger called a blockchain. The first successful cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, and {{since its inception}} hundreds of other crypto-backed coins have been introduced. The system is more akin to tally sticks {{and other types of}} ledger-based money than to coinage, despite the name.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{strategic}} level, interoperability is an enabler for coalition building. It facilitates meaningful contributions by coalition partners. At this level, interoperability issues center on harmonizing the world views, strategies, doctrines, and force structures. Interoperability {{is an element}} of coalition willingness to work together over the long term to achieve and maintain shared interests against common threats. Interoperability at the operational and tactical levels is where strategic/political interoperability and technological interoperability come together to help allies shape the environment, manage crises, and win wars. The benefits of interoperability at the operational and tactical levels generally derive from the <b>fungibility</b> or interchangeability of force elements and units. [...] "Technological interoperability" [...] reflects the interfaces between organizations and systems. It focuses on communications and computers but also involves the technical capabilities of systems and the resulting mission compatibility or incompatibility between the systems and data of coalition partners. At the technological level, the benefits of interoperability come primarily from their impacts at the operational and tactical levels in terms of enhancing <b>fungibility</b> and flexibility.|$|E
50|$|The IRS {{decided in}} March 2014, to treat bitcoin and other virtual {{currencies}} as property for tax purposes, not currency. Some {{have suggested that}} this makes bitcoins not fungible—that is one bitcoin is not identical to another bitcoin, unlike one gallon of crude oil being identical to another gallon of crude oil—making bitcoin unworkable as a currency. Others have stated that a measure like accounting on average cost basis would restore <b>fungibility</b> to the currency.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{since one}} {{kilogram}} of pure gold {{is equivalent to}} any other kilogram of pure gold, whether {{in the form of}} coins, ingots, or other in other states, gold is fungible. Other fungible commodities include sweet crude oil, company shares, bonds, other precious metals, and currencies. <b>Fungibility</b> refers only to the equivalence of each unit of a commodity with other units of the same commodity and not to the exchange of one commodity for another, which is barter.|$|E
50|$|Gold was a {{preferred}} form of money {{due to its}} rarity, durability, divisibility, <b>fungibility</b> and ease of identification, often in conjunction with silver. Silver was typically the main circulating medium, with gold as the monetary reserve. Commodity money was anonymous, as identifying marks can be removed. Commodity money retains its value despite what may happen to the monetary authority. After the fall of South Vietnam, many refugees carried their wealth to the West in gold after the national currency became worthless.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fungibility</b> is also {{important}} {{within the context of}} product liability. If a plaintiff is injured by a fungible product but is unable through no fault of his own to identify the manufacturer of the product that actually injured him, jurisdictions that follow the doctrine of market share liability can shift the burden of disproving liability to all manufacturers of that product. If the defendants fail to rebut the presumption of liability, they will be liable pro rata based on their market share during the relevant period.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fungibility</b> {{does not}} imply liquidity, and vice versa. Diamonds, for example, can be readily bought and sold, as the trade is liquid, but {{individual}} diamonds, being unique, are not interchangeable. Therefore, diamonds are not fungible. Indian rupee bank notes, on the other hand, are mutually interchangeable, and therefore fungible, in London, {{but they are not}} easily traded there because they cannot be spent in London except at currency exchange services. In contrast to diamonds, gold coins of the same grade and weight are fungible as well as liquid.|$|E
50|$|Multi listed or cross-listed shares, by contrast, are {{technically}} {{the same}} financial instrument. <b>Fungibility</b> {{is a concern}} across markets. For example, shares of IBM cannot be purchased on NYSE and sold, same-day, on the London Stock Exchange, even though IBM is cross listed in both markets. There is a re-registration process that must occur to move the number of outstanding shares from one jurisdiction to the other. This is primarily due to market inefficiencies and structures required to maintain the integrity of registered shares within specific jurisdictions (typically regulatory driven).|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles governing identity is that of substitutivity, also known as <b>fungibility</b> — or, as it might well be called, that of indiscernibility of identicals. It provides that, given a true statement of identity, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and {{the result will be}} true. It is easy to find cases contrary to this principle. For example, the statements:are true; however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' by the name 'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood: ...|$|E
50|$|Biopharmaceuticals have posed a {{challenge}} in nonproprietary naming because unlike smaller molecules made with total synthesis or semisynthesis, there is less assurance of complete <b>fungibility</b> between products from different manufacturers. Somewhat like how wine may vary by strain of yeast and year of grape harvest, each one can be subtly different because living organisms {{are an integral part}} of production. The WHO MedNet community continually works to augment its system for biopharmaceuticals to ensure continued fulfillment of the goals served by having nonproprietary names. In recent years the development of the Biological Qualifier system has been an example.|$|E
50|$|In legal {{disputes}} in the United States, when one party is compelled to remedy another party {{as the result}} of a ruling or adjudication, the appropriate legal remedy may depend on the <b>fungibility</b> of the underlying right, obligation or property interest that is intended to be restored. Depending on whether the interests of the aggrieved party are fungible, a determination made by the trier of fact, the appropriate remedy may change. For example, a court may require specific performance (an equitable remedy) as a remedy for breach of contract, instead of the more favored remedy of monetary damages.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike with generic drugs of {{the more}} common small-molecule type, {{biologics}} generally exhibit high molecular complexity, and may be quite sensitive to changes in manufacturing processes. Follow-on manufacturers {{do not have access}} to the originator's molecular clone and original cell bank, nor to the exact fermentation and purification process, nor to the active drug substance, although they do have access to the commercialized innovator product. Overall, it is harder to ascertain <b>fungibility</b> between generics and innovators among biologics than it is among totally synthesized and semisynthesized drugs, which is why the name [...] "biosimilar" [...] was coined to differentiate these drugs from small-molecule generics.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{the slave}} traders' ledgers, Smallwood {{shows how the}} great human drama {{of the slave trade}} was reduced to notes and [...] "quantitative 'facts.'" [...] These {{accounting}} instruments, packaged as they are in the form to be transmitted to headquarters in London, both conceal and reveal the underlying stories. In order to keep alive the fiction that slaving is no more messy than other forms of commodity-trading, bookkeepers needed the instruments of ledgers and quantities, and they needed to believe in the <b>fungibility</b> of human life. [...] "People, tobacco, gold, and gunpowder, all mutually exchangeable against one another, were able to pass smoothly across transactional lines that separated one account from another" [...] (84).|$|E
50|$|Deutsch sees quantum superpositions and the Schrödinger {{equation}} {{as evidence}} for his many worlds quantum multiverse, where everything physically possible occurs in an infinite branching of alternate histories. Deutsch {{argues that a}} great deal of fiction is close to a fact somewhere in the multiverse.Deutsch extols the usefulness of the concept of <b>fungibility</b> in quantum transactions, his universes and the particles they contain are fungible in their interactions across the multiverse structure. Deutsch explains that interference offers evidence for this multiverse phenomenon where alternate histories affect one another without allowing the passage of information, as they fungibly intertwine again shortly after experiencing alternate events. According to Deutsch, our perspective on any object we detect with our senses is just a single universe slice of a much larger quantum multiverse object.|$|E
5000|$|A {{depositary}} receipt is a security that is {{offered as a}} [...] "tracking stock" [...] on another foreign market. For instance a Chinese company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the New York Stock Exchange, {{as the amount of}} capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs (American {{depositary receipt}}) or GDRs (global depository receipt) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered [...] "foreign" [...] and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as <b>fungibility)</b> and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fungibility</b> {{has been}} used to {{describe}} certain types of tasks that can be broken down into interchangeable pieces that are easily parallelized and are not interdependent on the other pieces. For example: If a worker can hand dig 1 meter of ditch in a day, and a 10-meter ditch needs to be dug, either that worker can be given 10 days to complete the entire project, or 9 additional workers can be hired for the project to be completed in a single day. Each worker can complete his piece of the project without interfering with the other workers, and more importantly, each worker is not dependent on the results of any of the other workers to complete his share of the total project (this would contrast with the digging of a 10-meter-deep hole). On the other hand, non-fungible tasks tend to be highly serial in nature and require the completion of earlier steps before later steps can even be started. As an example of a serial task that is not fungible: Suppose there was a group of nine newly pregnant women. After one month, these women would have experienced a total of nine months of pregnancy, but a complete baby would not have been formed.|$|E
