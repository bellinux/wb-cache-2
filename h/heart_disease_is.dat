5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. <b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E

5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>is</b> caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{listed by}} the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women.

Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do.

5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. <b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} whether accurate remote echocardiographic diagnosis of congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> could <b>be</b> achieved using a low cost telemedicine system.  DESIGN—Echocardiographic images obtained by a paediatrician from neonates {{suspected of having}} congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>were</b> transmitted by a telemedicine link across two integrated service digital network (ISDN) lines to a regional paediatric cardiology unit for interpretation by a consultant paediatric cardiologist. The "tele-echo" diagnosis was verified by the paediatric cardiologist on direct consultation and echocardiography.  SETTING—Neonatal unit of Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry (a district general hospital) and the regional paediatric cardiology department, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Accuracy of the diagnosis made using the telemedicine link; impact on patient management.  RESULTS—Between September 1995  and September 1997  echocardiographic images were transmitted on 63  patients. A diagnosis was made in 61  (97 %) (transmitted images were unsatisfactory in two). Congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> diagnosed in 42  patients. Fourteen patients with major congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>were</b> accurately diagnosed within 24  hours of admission using the telemedicine link and were transferred to the regional paediatric cardiology unit. A further 28  with less serious congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> continued to <b>be</b> managed at the district general hospital. Congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> excluded in 19.  Follow up consultation confirmed accurate diagnosis or exclusion of congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in 57  (93 %). There were four inaccurate diagnoses (6. 3 %; three undetected small ventricular septal defects and one pulmonary stenosis).  CONCLUSIONS—Transmitted images were of sufficient quality to allow confirmation or exclusion of major congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The telemedicine link facilitated early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate management in patients with complex congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and avoided the need for transfer in those where significant congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> excluded.    Keywords: congenital heart disease; telemedicin...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundCongenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (CHD) <b>are</b> {{the most}} common {{congenital}} anomaly in children and also {{the leading cause of}} mortality from congenital anomalies. Various factors including smoking, drinking alcohol and addiction play role in development of congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> This study <b>was</b> conducted with the aim of investigation of the prevalence of addiction in parents of children with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> compared with healthy children. Materials and MethodsThis was a case-control study conducted on 320 children with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> aged 6 months to 16 years and 320 healthy children as control group. Children referring to Ali Asghar hospital or who were hospitalized in Imam Ali Hospital were included in the study and their demographic characteristics and their parents were collected. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20. ResultsAverage age of diseased and healthy children was 4. 08 ± 4. 11 and 3. 59 ± 2. 36, respectively. The rate of addiction of father, mother and parents of children with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> higher than those of children in control group.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{incidence}} of inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>is</b> not yet {{as high as}} those of other cardiovas-cular diseases; however, inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> do have relatively high mortality rate. Therefore, update information on the economic burden of inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> {{necessary in order to}} appropriate policy making on these diseases. Materials and Methods: This study used a number of resources to obtain data, national health insurance statistics, the Korean Health Panel, and the causes of death report by the Korean National Statistical Office. The total costs of inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>were</b> estimated as the sum of direct medical care costs, direct non-medical care and indirect costs. Results: The total direct cost of inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> higher in Korean men than that of Korean women and cost due to inpatient was higher than that of outpatients cost. The costs to cover premature death were highest among all of the components used to determine the total costs for inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> representing 66. 3 % of these costs in Korea. Conclusion: Inflam-matory <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> has a relatively high mortality rate, and the costs that are associated with premature deaths consume the greatest proportion of the costs associated with this disease. In spite of some limitations of study, this could be a reliable evid-ence of economic burden of inflammatory <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> (Korean Circ J 2011; 41 : 712 - 717...|$|R

Severe behavioral problems, such as agitation or combativeness, may be managed with short term antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. In periods of mania it is recommended that antidepressants be stopped. If antidepressants are used for periods of depression they should be used with a mood stabilizer. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), while not very well studied, may be helpful {{for those who do not}} respond to other treatments.
