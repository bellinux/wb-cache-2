40|$|This paper reviews {{some of the}} {{progress}} made on wellbore stability modeling {{during the last two}} decades. First we demonstrate the improvement made on mud-pressure predictions by moving from analytic elastic solutions to finite element elastoplastic modeling. We show this progress, presenting a finite element model based on a generalized plane strain formulation <b>for</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>efficiently</b> the three-dimensional problem of stability in deviated wellbores. On a more research oriented work, we present results from two advanced theories capable of modeling localization of deformation in shear bands, which causes borehole breakouts. The first theory is based on a more established approach, the Cosserat continuum. The second theory, called gradient elastoplasticity, is being developed to resolve some of the drawbacks of gradient plasticity theories. Gradient elastoplasticity is a unified theory where both elastic and plastic parts are of gradient type. We demonstrate that both theories, in addition to localization, can also model the scale effect observed in thick-walled cylinder test...|$|E

Having long excelled in analytical throughput of single cells and particles, only recently {{with the advent}} of HyperCyt sampling technology, flow cytometry's multiexperiment throughput has begun to approach the point of practicality <b>for</b> <b>efficiently</b> <b>analyzing</b> hundreds‐of‐thousands of samples, the realm of high‐throughput screening (HTS). To extend performance and automation compatibility, we built a HyperCyt‐linked Cluster Cytometer platform, a network of flow cytometers <b>for</b> <b>analyzing</b> samples displayed in high‐density, 1, 536 ‐well plate format. To assess the performance, we used cell‐ and microsphere‐based HTS assays that had been well characterized in the previous studies. Experiments addressed important technical issues: challenges of small wells (assay volumes 10 μL or less, reagent mixing, cell and particle suspension), detecting and correcting for differences in performance of individual flow cytometers, and the ability to reanalyze a plate in the event of problems encountered during the primary analysis. Boosting sample throughput an additional fourfold, this platform is uniquely positioned to synergize with expanding suspension array and cell barcoding technologies in which as many as 100 experiments are performed in a single well or sample. As high‐performance flow cytometers shrink in cost and size, cluster cytometry promises to become a practical, productive approach for HTS, and other large‐scale investigations of biological complexity. © 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometr...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Exploring {{data sets}} by {{applying}} biclustering algorithms {{was first introduced}} in gene expression analysis. While the generated biclustered data grows with increasing rates due to the technological progress in measuring gene expression data, the visualization of the computed biclusters still remains an open issue. <b>For</b> <b>efficiently</b> <b>analyzing</b> the vast amount of gene expression data, we propose an algorithm to generate and layout biclusters with a minimal number of row and column duplications {{on the one hand}} and a visualization tool for interactively exploring the uncovered biclusters on the other hand. In this paper, we illustrate how the BiCluster Viewer may be applied to highlight detected biclusters generated from the original data set by using heatmaps and parallel coordinate plots. Many interactive features are provided such as ordering functions, color codings, zooming, details-on-demand, and the like. We illustrate the usefulness of our tool in a case study where yeast data is analyzed. Furthermore, we conducted a small user study with 4 participants to demonstrate that researchers are able to learn und use our tool to find insights in gene expression data very rapidly. ...|$|R

As an alternative to the Fourier slice based techniques, in this paper a map reconstruction method from its two-dimensional (2 -D) Laguerre Gauss (LG) expansion is presented. The LG expansion was already used <b>for</b> <b>efficiently</b> <b>analyzing</b> the orientation and the cross profile of linear patterns in images within a Maximum Likelihood approach. In particular, LG basis functions and expansion coefficients rotate by a simple phase shift, proportional to the rotation angle and the circular harmonic order. In addition, the LG expansion is linearly related to the 2 -D Hermite Gauss (2 -D HG) expansion, which allows for efficient numerical realizations and a compact model of the returns of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) waveforms, naturally suited for this high resolution scheme. The LG or the 2 -D HG truncated expansion of the map is finally computed by the linear Least Squares interpolation of a set of matched filter outputs and used for reconstructing the backscattering map. Several system aspects of the LG ISAR method are discussed and computer experiments with tight concentrations of point scatterers illuminated by UWB pulse trains are presented...|$|R
40|$|Distributed Stream Processing Systems are {{typically}} deployed {{within a single}} datacenter {{in order to achieve}} high performance and low-latency computation. The datastreams analyzed by such systems are expected to be available in the same datacenter. Either the data streams are generated within the data center (e. g., logs,transactions, user clicks) or they are aggregated by external systems from varioussources and buffered into the data center for processing (e. g., IoT, sensor data, trafficinformation). The data center approach for stream processing analytics fits the requirements ofthe majority of the applications that exists today. However, for latency sensitiveapplications, such as real-time decisionmaking, which relies on analyzing geographically distributed data streams, a data center approach might not be sufficient. Aggregating data streams incurs high overheads in terms of latency and bandwidthconsumption in addition to the overhead of sending the analysis outcomes back towhere an action needs to be taken. In this thesis, we propose a new stream processing architecture <b>for</b> <b>efficiently</b> <b>analyzing</b> geographically distributed data streams. Our approach utilizes emergingdistributed virtualized environments, such as Mobile Edge Computing, to extendstream processing systems outside the data center in order to push critical parts ofthe analysis closer to the data sources. This will enable real-time applications to respond faster to geographically distributed events.

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{grinding}} burn in steels {{and its relation}} to workpiece temperature has been studied in surface grinding using a new experimental approach. First, a test method called taper grinding is developed <b>for</b> <b>efficiently</b> <b>analyzing</b> the effects of grinding process parameters. The method is applied to study forces, residual stress, hardness, temperatures, and the onset and evolution of burn. Second, by using nano-indentation on taper-sectioned ground surfaces, an accurate assessment has been made of the true hardness of ground surfaces. Hardness variations occurring over spatial extents of just a few microns have been resolved. The first occurrence of visible discoloration, i. e. onset of visible burn, on a ground surface is found to correlate with drastic changes in its hardness, residual stress and microstructure. Visible burn is seen to be associated with either a softening or a re-hardening of the surface. The microstructure of a re-hardened layer is found to resemble that of a white etching layer (WL), a characteristic microstructure of steels. Third, measurements of the workpiece temperature field have been made at high spatial and temporal resolution using a charge-coupled device (CCD) based infra-red (IR) imaging system. Various characteristics of the temperature field and their dependence on process parameters have been analyzed. It is shown that the onset of visible burn occurs at a fixed temperature for the steel. Predictions of workpiece temperatures, and efforts to compare them to measured temperature values, {{have been found to be}} influenced by uncertainty in the knowledge of the grinding geometry. ...|$|R
