25|$|In single-voxel fMRS the {{selection}} of the volume of interest (VOI) is often done by running a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study prior to fMRS to localize the brain region activated by the task. Single-voxel spectroscopy requires shorter acquisition times; therefore <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for fMRS studies where high temporal resolution is needed and where the volume of interest is known.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{surveillance}} {{differs from}} population-wide surveillance {{in that it}} can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. For this reason, it does not identify patients {{who have never been}} tested. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.|$|E
25|$|Helium (He) is an {{inert gas}} {{that is less}} {{narcotic}} than nitrogen at equivalent pressure (in fact {{there is no evidence}} for any narcosis from helium at all), so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for deeper dives than nitrogen. Helium is equally able to cause decompression sickness. At high pressures, helium also causes high-pressure nervous syndrome, which is a CNS irritation syndrome which is in some ways opposite to narcosis.|$|E
30|$|In {{vertical}} control, the PD {{control algorithm}} had a fast response speed and short adjustment time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for balance vehicle system with large inertia. The vertical feedback took the angle and angular velocity of a gyroscope as references {{based on the}} principle of negative feedback. When the vehicle deviated from the set angle, it tended to return to the origin.|$|R
500|$|Pizzolatto {{began writing}} True Detective as a novel, but, {{as the project}} began taking {{definite}} form, felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for television. Principal photography was initially scheduled {{to take place in}} Arkansas; however, Louisiana was ultimately preferred for its generous statewide tax incentives and unique landscape. [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] was shot entirely in 35 mm film and filming for the season lasted for 100 consecutive days.|$|R

In , Ethiopian Airlines had the most numerous fleet in Africa. In 2015 the airline planned to buy 15 to 20 of Boeing's new 777X planes worth about $7.4 billion at list prices. Although the airline had initially planned to buy Airbus' A350-1000 jets, it switched to the 777X as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for operations at their high-altitude hub in Addis Ababa. It was the first airline in Africa to acquire a Boeing 787 full-flight simulator.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{it is not}} a 'story' at all, in the {{commonly}} accepted meaning of the word: it is a report. It is, I feel, almost out of place in a book of this kind. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> to a biography, or an English history.|$|E

5|$|Pizzolatto {{initially}} conceived True Detective as a novel, {{but felt}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for television. The episodes, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, were filmed in Louisiana over a three-month period. The series received positive reviews from critics and was cited {{as one of}} the strongest dramas of the 2014 television season. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a candidate for numerous television awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film, and won several other honors for writing, cinematography, direction, and acting.|$|R
5000|$|The first commercially {{available}} 4K camera for cinematographic purposes was the Dalsa Origin, released in 2003.

[...] Users could view 4K video by selecting [...] "Original" [...] from the quality settings until December 2013, when the 2160p option appeared in the quality menu. In November 2013, YouTube started to use the VP9 video compression standard, saying that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for 4K than High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC); VP9 is being developed by Google, which owns YouTube.|$|R

50|$|Pre-Beethoven {{keyboard}} music may {{usually be}} as easily {{played on a}} chamber organ as on a piano or harpsichord, and a chamber organ is sometimes preferable to a harpsichord for continuo playing as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for producing a sustained tone.|$|E

5000|$|Other grammarians have {{supported}} the practice by analogy with Latin, such as Robert Lowth, who used the construction when {{he wrote in his}} 1762 textbook A Short Introduction to English Grammar that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for informal than for formal English: [...] "This is an Idiom which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar style in writing; but the placing of the Preposition before the Relative <b>is</b> <b>more</b> graceful, as well as more perspicuous; and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style."

50|$|The Lancia Delta {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} rally cars ever, having won the World Rally Championship for manufacturers six times between 1987 and 1992. After the abolition of Group B Lancia was forced, as were all other manufacturers, to compete with Group A cars. The Delta HF4WD was therefore pressed into service for the 1987 season. Despite some flaws <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for rallying than its rivals and easily won the 1987 championship. The Delta's dominance helped it out in the Italian market at least, where a 42% sales increase in the first half of 1987 was directly attributed to its rallying successes.|$|R

50|$|The more {{traditional}} maneuver is more time consuming and requires more sailing skill, but is more flexible {{and less likely}} to fail as it gives the helmsman more time to make adjustments and corrections to the course and the approach. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>suitable</b> for the open sea and rougher, windier conditions.|$|E

5000|$|The Flash Eurobarometer was {{introduced}} in the 1990s and consists of interviews, conducted by telephone, which are undertaken on an ad hoc basis. The main advantage of the Flash survey, as opposed to a normal Eurobarometer survey, is that it is much faster, providing results almost instantaneously.
