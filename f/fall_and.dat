5|$|Campus {{newspapers}} {{include the}} independent student newspaper, The BG News, published since 1920. It {{was known as}} the Bee Gee News before assuming its current name on September 21, 1951. The paper is available for free at 135 newsstands. In 2009 the paper became available on a web portal known as BG Views. The paper prints 7,000 copies of the paper Monday through Friday during the <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> spring semesters, and on Wednesday during the summer. The university's independent, student operated yearbook was first published in 1918 but stopped after one edition for six years. In 1924 it resumed production and was published every year as a record of students, activities, and events for a given year. In 2008, the yearbook was replaced with a magazine format, The Key Magazine, and is published semi-annually, in <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> spring semesters.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, Kemp {{chartered}} the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwest Railway Company of Texas {{and constructed}} a rail line into the wheat-producing region of Oklahoma, {{when it became}} the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwestern Railway. Kemp organized the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Southern Railroad, which connected Wichita Falls with the coal fields around Newcastle near Graham in Young County, Texas. He also established the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Wellington, which linked Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Wellington in Collingsworth County, Texas. Kemp {{served as president of}} each of these rail companies. In 1911, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas purchased Kemp's remaining lines, including the eighteen miles of the Wichita Falls Railway.

5000|$|In 1911, the MKT {{purchased}} railroad lines {{held by the}} industrialist Joseph A. Kemp of Wichita Falls, Texas.

Kemp's brother-in-law, Frank Kell, was a partner {{in some of these}} lines, including the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Southern Railroad, which remained a Kemp-Kell property until it was abandoned in 1954. In 1923, the Katy acquired another Kemp/Kell property, the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwestern Railway, which extended from Wichita Falls to Forgan in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The route to Forgan was abandoned in 1973, and Altus, Oklahoma, became the northern terminus of the railroad. The remaining 77-mile link between Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Altus was absorbed in 1991 by the Wichita, Tillman and Jackson Railway.

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> become rain.|$|E
40|$|Accident {{prevention}} {{is one of}} the four priorities for the NHS as set out in the White Paper Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation.

This paper further highlights the link between <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> osteoporosis and the resulting injuries <b>and</b> deaths. <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> osteoporosis are common in older people. A fall in people with osteoporosis is likely to result in a worse outcome due to the increased risk of fracture. <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> fractures are associated with high morbidity, mortality and substantial costs...|$|R
