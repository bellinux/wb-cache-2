5|$|Just before Najib {{spoke at}} 22:00 MYT, an {{emergency}} meeting {{was called in}} Beijing for relatives of Flight 370 passengers. Malaysia Airlines announced that Flight 370 was assumed lost with no survivors.

5|$|According to Lennon, the {{inspiration}} for the first two verses was the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune who <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 in Redcliffe Gardens, Earl's Court. Browne had been a friend of Lennon and McCartney, and had, earlier in 1966, instigated McCartney's first experience with LSD. Lennon adapted the song's verse lyrics from a story in the 17 January 1967 edition of the Daily Mail, which reported the ruling on a custody action over Browne's two young children.|$|E
5|$|It {{was another}} 12 {{minutes before the}} {{collapse}} occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be held back. The roof, girders and debris fell across four passenger trains, blocking all tracks. The part of the western wall that fell <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> through the wall and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).|$|E

5|$|The {{breakaway}} {{was eventually}} caught {{at the bottom}} of the final climb. Valverde, who <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> earlier in the day, was the first to attack. As soon as he was caught, his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking to take back the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) being {{captured by the}} Daleks, along with his companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), who are about to divorce. They are sent by the Daleks to the Asylum, a planet where insane Daleks are exiled, to enable the Asylum to be destroyed before the insane Daleks can escape. The Doctor is helped along the way by Oswin Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman), a woman whose spaceship <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> on the planet {{a year ago and}} has been trapped there since then.|$|E
5|$|The small moon Dia, 4 {{kilometres}} in diameter, {{had gone}} missing since its discovery in 2000. One {{theory was that}} it <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> into the much larger moon Himalia, 170 kilometres in diameter, creating a faint ring. This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although {{it is still possible}} that a different moon may have been involved.|$|E

5|$|The winning {{time was}} set {{early on in}} the stage, by Cervélo TestTeam rider and reigning Lithuanian {{national}} time trial champion Ignatas Konovalovas. Konovalovas, the 79th man to leave the starthouse, {{was one of the last}} riders to take the course before it started to rain. Garmin's Bradley Wiggins started his ride not long after, and though he had the best time at the second and third intermediate time checks, he was slowed by the rain he encountered on the last part of the course as well as a stopped Bbox Bouygues Telecom team car attending to Matthieu Sprick, who <b>had</b> <b>crashed.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 <b>had</b> <b>crashed.</b> When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed {{out of the room and}} refused to give an answer.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search effort for the wrecked airship Italia, which <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> on the polar ice northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rain from}} Typhoon Phanfone made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting {{from behind the}} safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg {{immediately}} fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced oversteer, and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead {{over the next four}} laps, overtook him on the 29th lap and pulled away. Jules Bianchi made contact with the rear of a tractor crane at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap that was tending to Adrian Sutil's car (which <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> one lap earlier) and the race was prematurely ended three laps later. The race result was counted back two laps, and Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{decides to}} use Roney's optic-encephalogram, {{a device that}} records {{impressions}} from the optical centres of the brain, and see the visions for himself. Roney's assistant, Barbara Judd, is most sensitive; placing the device on her, they record a violent purge of the Martian hive to root out unwanted mutations. Quatermass concludes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and genetically altered to give them abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artefact {{is one of the}} ships that <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> {{at the end of its}} journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently {{as a result}} of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> in the same spot {{as a result of}} a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} forward from Waigani to {{enable it to}} join the {{fighting}} later as a counterattacking force. They, along with the 2/9th, were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 3 Airstrip to KB Mission. Meanwhile, the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce the forces that were already ashore. These reinforcements, consisting of 567 men from the 3rd Kure SNLF and 200 from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF, left Rabaul on 28 August. At around 4:30pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy– consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers– and subsequently reported this to the Allied headquarters. Believing that further landings were about to occur, Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 18th Brigade. Orders were also passed for the 30 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield. The attack did not take place, though, and consequently {{early in the morning}} on 29 August they returned, albeit minus two aircraft which <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> during the move.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 <b>had</b> <b>crashed.</b> Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India <b>had</b> <b>crashed</b> into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
