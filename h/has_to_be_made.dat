5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Wonka announces {{a contest}} whereby {{children}} that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars {{will be given}} a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) from Düsseldorf; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) from Buckinghamshire; the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) from Atlanta; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) from Denver. Charlie hopes to find a ticket but his chances are small as money is tight, and the best <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly crushed when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper (Oscar James) to see that he keeps the ticket and gets back home with it.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem for}} the early twenty-first century is that during crime scene investigations, a {{decision}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{at an early stage}} whether to attempt to retrieve fingerprints through the use of developers or whether to swab surfaces in an attempt to salvage material for DNA profiling. The two processes are mutually incompatible, as fingerprint developers destroy material that could potentially be used for DNA analysis, and swabbing is likely to make fingerprint identification impossible.|$|E

25|$|Cellos are {{constructed}} and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs {{call for the}} removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular wood glue, because it cannot be steamed open when a repair <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> by a luthier.|$|E
25|$|However, {{if there}} will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then an {{alternative}} strategy to scoring more runs is minimising the amount of resource they use before the coming interruption (i.e. preserving wickets). While the best overall strategy is obviously to both score more runs and preserve resources, if a choice <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> between the two, sometimes preserving wickets {{at the expense of}} scoring runs ('conservative' batting) is a more effective way of increasing Team 2's target, and sometimes the reverse ('aggressive' batting) is true.|$|E
25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} total current {{supplied}} is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that causes the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacity.|$|E

25|$|Chomsky differentiates competence, {{which is}} an {{idealized}} capacity, from performance being the production of actual utterances. According to him, competence is the ideal speaker-hearer's knowledge {{of his or her}} language and it is the 'mental reality' which is responsible for all those aspects of language use which can be characterized as 'linguistic'. Chomsky argues that only under an idealized situation whereby the speaker-hearer is unaffected by grammatically irrelevant conditions such as memory limitations and distractions will performance be a direct reflection of competence. A sample of natural speech consisting of numerous false starts and other deviations will not provide such data. Therefore, he claims that a fundamental distinction <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> between the competence and performance.|$|E
25|$|Using A-constants is {{practical}} when {{a decision}} on the implant power <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> during surgery because {{the power of the}} lens varies in a 1:1 relationship with the A-constants: if A decreases by 1 diopter, IOL power decreases by 1 diopter also. This straight relationship adds to the simplicity and popularity of the A-constant. Other constants used in modern IOL formulas include the ACD value in Binkhorst and Hoffer-Q formulas, the a0, a1, and a2 constants of the Haigis formula, and the Surgeon factor (SF) in Holladay formulas. True anterior chamber depth (ACD) is measured between the posterior corneal surface and the anterior lens surface. This measure is {{not to be confused with}} the anterior chamber constant (ACD constant) used in IOL power calculation formulas.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} AI applications can {{be divided}} into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if shiny then pick up"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class {{can be seen as a}} decision that <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.|$|E

25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers {{over and over again}}, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} {{over and over again in}} such a way or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E

Film producers and directors can submit a film for consideration to HDFD, which verifies the completeness of the application and compliance with Academy rules. According to the latest revision of the HDFD criteria in 2007, these include that the film must have had its cinema release between 1 October and 30 September in the preceding year and that the application enclosed must contain a written statement confirming that all financial obligations to performers and craftspeople involved with the film's production have been fulfilled. A 17-member committee composed of HDFD members then proceeds to vote for nominated films in a secret ballot.|$|E

500|$|According to Academy rules, the {{selection}} of each country's official submission <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> by [...] "one organization, jury or committee that should include artists and/or craftspeople {{from the field of}} motion pictures". In Germany's case, {{the selection}} committee and procedure are organized by the Munich-based German Films Service + Marketing GmbH, known as Export-Union of German Cinema until 2004. Film producers and distributors can submit a film for consideration to German Films, which verifies the completeness of the application and the compliance with Academy rules. A committee composed of representatives of nine different German film institutions and film industry trade groups selects a film for submission to the Academy. German Films is not represented in the committee and concentrates solely on the organizational aspects. Although East Germany used to submit films sparingly, West Germany and later reunified Germany have been regular participants, and have sent a film to the Academy in every year except from 1962 to 1964 and in 1991. The refusal of the selection committee to submit a film in 1991 was highly controversial.|$|E
500|$|The film's ending {{was changed}} shortly before its {{theatrical}} release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, {{who saw the}} film {{less than a month}} before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's villain. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. In 2009, Harlin explained that Deep Blue Sea was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, [...] "Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of plastic paper. And things that you wouldn't think would ever float, they float.
