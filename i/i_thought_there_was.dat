5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
500|$|Back then I didn't {{realize the}} power of my character. [...] I didn't realize the image I had created and {{what it meant to}} so many people. [...] Ruth was so underwritten, so what I was able to bring to it was what made it special to me. [...] The looks, the affection, the pats on the head, the tone and inflection. [...] I got to bring that to her character, and that was all <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was.</b> [...] I didn't know what was being {{received}} {{on the other side of}} the screen.|$|E
500|$|All That Glitters was series creator Norman Lear's {{attempt to}} {{duplicate}} his {{success with the}} syndicated soap opera spoof Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Lear described the premise simply: [...] "God created Eve first, took out her rib {{and gave her a}} companion so she wouldn't be lonely." [...] Lear {{came up with the idea}} on a trip to Washington, D.C.: [...] "I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a series in it—a five-times-a-week series: I went to bed thinking about that, and I woke up the next morning thinking what would happen if the male-female equation were changed? What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?” ...|$|E

500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan {{as a girl}} next door and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then {{it occurred to me that}} one of these women should be divorced... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E
500|$|At age 30 (the {{minimum age}} {{required}} {{to hold the}} office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: [...] "I liked to [...] at night when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a better chance of}} finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode an 8.9 rating out of 10 and wrote [...] "...the real reason to watch, as always, was Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin and their fantastic comedic performances." [...] Canning responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception}} of the Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth storyline, calling it [...] "silly". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that Jack taking on the Larry Braverman persona [...] "gave Baldwin a chance to play a delightfully goofy strain of those occasional glimpses we get of a happy Jack." [...] Like Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was favorable to Jack going to the reunion, but most enjoyed the character impersonating Larry Braverman, observing it was a [...] "well-used plot device" [...] as Baldwin [...] "made it believable". TV Guides Matt Mitovich was positive about [...] "Reunion", calling it a [...] "nice" [...] episode. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the episode, and said that [...] "Reunion" [...] was the first episode of the season that [...] "I think the show benefited from the refocused attention on its core characters. The reunion plot was so strong, and the Carrie finale so inspired, that I hope the viewership ratings reflect positively and encourage a continuance of this creative trend." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he was [...] "much more amused" [...] by Rob Sussman's [...] "still-simmering rage" [...] against Liz, because he [...] "scored many of the show's biggest laughs." [...] He said that he found the second plot [...] "a little underwhelming though <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a neat meta-textual element to it", but wrote that it [...] "scored some nice shots at the vapid narcissism of actors but it promised more than it could deliver." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it said that despite the [...] "super-capital-A-list guest stars" [...] that guest starred at the beginning of the season, [...] "Reunion" [...] got back [...] "to the show's core cast... the show gave us probably the best episode of the season." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and [...] "funny in most of the usual 30 Rock ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin McHugh {{wanted to}} take charge of Donegal after McEniff left the job. However, he was {{prevented}} from doing so by the Donegal County Board in a snub that would be echoed in Jim McGuinness's numerous later attempts to get the same jobMcGuinness was, however, ultimately successful; after being rejected by the Donegal County Board on several occasions he would go on to be Donegal's most successful manager since McEniff. McHugh was hurt by his rejection, saying: [...] "I thought there was another All-Ireland in Donegal and that's why I went for that job. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> another All-Ireland there, {{and there was a lot}} of good players coming too.

2500|$|The source {{material}} for the two seasons of Nero Wolfe was written between 1939 (Over My Dead Body) and 1966 (Death of a Doxy), with most stories written in the 1950s. Jaffe said he chose {{to stick with the}} era for the adaptations [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> so much style that people could identify with and that we could play off. Ultimately, {{the most important thing is}} that the audience remain removed from the show by three or four decades. You can't do what Paramount did and update it and make the language modern. The whole thing doesn't make sense, because the tonal idiom doesn't play in the modern world. You have to separate it; you have to create that proscenium arch; you have to create poetic distance—otherwise there's no art in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 25 March 1919, Fokker married Sophie Marie Elisabeth von Morgen in Haarlem. This {{marriage}} {{ended in}} divorce in 1923. In 1927, he married Canadian Violet Eastman in New York City. On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to 'vertigo victim' {{at the request of}} her husband's staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, [...] "I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing that could be more important than my airplanes... I have now learned, by bitter experience, that one must give a little too; in love one has to use one's brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more".|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Gordon won {{the pole}} {{for the race}} and dominated. Kevin Harvick took the lead from Denny Hamlin with 7 laps to go, but a caution forced the race to have a green-white-checkered finish. Harvick and Ryan Newman, who were {{the top of the}} 4 {{championship}} contenders, restarted on the front row. Harvick held off Newman to score his fourth win of the season and take the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup title. “I was just holding the pedal down and hoping for the best,’’ Harvick said. [...] "This new format has been so stressful. I’m going to go sleep for a week." [...] We didn't have quite enough,” Newman said. “That's disappointing, but like I said, it was an awesome team effort, and I think, again, this is a great racetrack to have a race like this, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some amazing passing, and we don't get that at every racetrack.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While her {{predecessor}} {{and mentor}} Peter Deutsch was [...] "among the most hawkish congressional Democrats on Middle East issues", Wasserman Schultz, {{who took over}} his seat for Florida's 20th district, [...] "a heavily Jewish swath of Broward County", has taken a more centrist approach. During 2005 she spoke in approval of President George W. Bush's proposals to give financial aid to the Palestinian Authority in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said [...] "We {{want to continue to}} focus on making sure that... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [...] first four years, {{there was a lack of}} leadership coming from the administration. I know many people in the Jewish community were happy with the president's position on Israel, but the way <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an absence of leadership. ...

2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E
