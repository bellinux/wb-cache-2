50|$|Transatlantic service {{needed a}} higher thrust {{version of the}} {{existing}} turbojet and a demonstrator engine with a single-stage <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> attached to the compressor was run. It was difficult to start and operate. This experience led to the aft-fan which didn't compromise {{the operation of the}} gas generator.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 MV {{started work}} on thrust augmentation. The {{resulting}} Metropolitan-Vickers F.3 {{was the first}} British turbofan engine to be designed, built and tested. Indeed, {{it could be said}} that the F.3 was also the very first 3-shaft jet engine to be built, although the configuration was completely {{different from that of the}} much later Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan series, since the fan was located at the rear of the engine, not unlike that of the General Electric CJ805-23. Using a stock F.2/2, MV added a separate module to the rear of the engine (directly behind the HP turbine) which comprised contra-rotating LP turbines attached to two contra-rotating fans. Apart from the first stage nozzle guide vanes, the LP turbine was completely statorless, with four consecutive rotor stages. Rotors 1 and 3 drove the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> clockwise (viewed from front), whereas the rear fan was driven anticlockwise by rotors 2 and 4. Although the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> had inlet guide vanes, there were no vanes between the contra-rotating fan rotors or, downstream, any exit guide vanes. The core and bypass streams exhausted through separate coaxial propelling nozzles.|$|E

5|$|The Stadium {{has hosted}} three Challenge Cup Finals, {{which are usually}} played at Wembley, from 2003 to 2005. In 2003 the Bradford Bulls {{defeated}} the Leeds Rhinos 22–20 in <b>front</b> of 71,212 <b>fans.</b> St. Helens defeated Wigan 36–16 in 2004 in <b>front</b> of 73,734 <b>fans,</b> while Hull F.C. defeated Leeds 25–24 in 2005 in <b>front</b> of 74,213 <b>fans,</b> the largest rugby league crowd at the stadium.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} a twin-spool, axial-flow {{turbofan}} {{with a high}} bypass ratio of 5.6:1 and an overall pressure ratio of 45:1. The <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> {{is attached to the}} three-stage low-pressure compressor; the 23:1 pressure ratio 10-stage high-pressure compressor includes five blisk stages for weight reduction. The low-emission combustor has a case with integrated OGV diffuser for weight reduction. There is a two-stage high-pressure and four-stage low-pressure turbine. The engine and aircraft accessory drive extracts energy from the high-pressure, high-speed rotor. It is equipped with a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) control system, providing fault isolation and engine functionality and diagnostics capability.|$|E
50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the fan rotor blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|E
50|$|Turbofans {{are usually}} more {{efficient}} than turbojets at subsonic speeds, but their large frontal area also generates more drag. Therefore, in supersonic flight, and in military and other aircraft where absolute performance, weight, and drag have a higher priority than fuel efficiency, engines tend to either have smaller fans (or multiple smaller fans) or use other engine designs entirely. Typically, turbofans in civilian aircraft usually have a pronounced large front area to accommodate a very large fan, as their design involves a much larger mass of air bypassing the core so they can benefit from these effects, while in military aircraft, where noise and efficiency are less important compared to performance and drag, a smaller amount of air typically bypasses the core. Turbofans designed for subsonic civilian aircraft also usually have a just a single <b>front</b> <b>fan,</b> because their additional thrust is generated by a large additional mass of air which is only moderately compressed, rather than a smaller amount of air which is greatly compressed.|$|E

40|$|The series/parallel tandem {{fan engine}} is {{evaluated}} for application in advanced STOVL supersonic fighter aircraft. Options in engine cycle parameters {{and design of}} the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> flow diverter are examined for their effects on engine weight, dimensions, and other factors in integration of the engine with the aircraft. Operation of the engine in high-bypass flow mode during cruise and loiter flight is considered {{as a means of}} minimizing fuel consumption. Engine thrust augmentation by burning in the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> exhaust is discussed. Achievement of very short takeoff with vectored thrust is briefly reviewed for tandem fan engine configurations with vectorable <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> nozzles. Examples are given of two aircraft configuration planforms, a delta-canard, and a forward-swept wing, to illustrate the major features, design considerations, and potential performance of the tandem fan installation in each. Full realization of the advantages of tandem fan propulsion are found to depend on careful selection of the aircraft configuration, since integration requirements can strongly influence the engine performance.

40|$|Penalized {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for selecting variables and fitting high-dimensional data. It {{is well known that}} the LASSO is biased and thus cannot attain the estimation efficiency of the oracle selector. Recent studies [6, 7, 8, 10, 11] showed that due to the interference of the bias, the LASSO requires quite strong conditions for consistent variable selection. Since the ℓ 1 penalty has the smallest bias among all convex penalty functions with selection features, these studies naturally draw our attention to methodologies based on concave penalties, or equivalently, nonconcave penalized likelihood. Frank and Friedman [5] considered the ℓα penalty for general α ≥ 0, which is strictly concave for α < 1. Their main interest was to use α as a hyperparameter to “bridge ” between the subset selection with α = 0 and the ridge regression with α = 2. Important progresses were made by Fan and Li [3], who advocated the unbiasedness and continuity as essential for variable selectors and carefully developed the SCAD method.

40|$|An approximately. 25 {{scale model}} of a Tandem Fan nacelle {{designed}} for a Type A V/STOL aircraft configuration was tested in a 10 -by- 10 foot wind tunnel. A 12 inch, tip driven, turbofan simulator was used to provide the suction source for the aft fan inlet. The <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> inlet was faired over for this test entry. Model variables consisted of a long aft inlet cowl, a short aft inlet cowl, a shaft simulator, blow-in door passages and diffuser vortex generators. Inlet pressure recovery, distortion, inlet angle of attack separation limits were evaluated at tunnel velocities from 0 to 240 knots, angles of attack from - 10 to 40 degrees and inlet flow rates representative of throat Mach numbers of 0. 1 to 0. 6. High inlet performance and stable operation was verified at all design forward speed and angle of attack conditions. The short aft inlet configuration provided exceptionally high pressure recovery except at the highest combination of angle of attack and forward speed. The flow quality at the fan face was somewhat degraded {{by the addition of}} blow-in door passages to the long aft inlet configuration due to the pressure disturbances generated by the flow entering the diffuser through the auxiliary air passages...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Results {{are given}} of wind-tunnel tests of a nacelle-shaped body fitted with two lifting fans in tandem. Lift, drag and {{pitching}} moment were measured {{both with the}} fans installed with axes vertical and also in a modified arrangement with 15 deg rearward tilt. In the latter case, the effects of simple inlet and exit cascades were also examined. The effects of aerodynamic interaction between efflux and mainstream were almost as serious for this slab-sided nacelle as when the same fan was installed in a large wing. The adverse effect on lift was slightly reduced by rearward movement of the fan when only one fan was in use and the other duct sealed, but a greater improvement was obtained when the <b>front</b> <b>fan</b> was used and allowed to induce additional downflow through the open rear duct thus reducing {{the magnitude of the}} lower surface suctions. Five-tube yawmeter traverses in the two vertical fan ducts just above the fans showed much less flow maldistribution at forward speeds compared with the fan in wing because of the 1 -diameter length of duct between surface and traverse station. The decay of the cross flow with depth and the effect of variation of one fan rotational speed upon the flow in the other duct were also examined...|$|E
