5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and <b>hepatopancreas</b> are visible through the shell but are often {{slightly}} obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the <b>hepatopancreas</b> is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
25|$|Lobsters, like snails and spiders, have blue blood {{due to the}} {{presence}} of hemocyanin which contains copper. In contrast, vertebrates and many other animals have red blood from iron-rich hemoglobin. Lobsters possess a green <b>hepatopancreas,</b> called the tomalley by chefs, which functions as the animal's liver and pancreas.|$|E
2500|$|The gut of E. superba {{can often}} be seen shining green through the animal's {{transparent}} skin, an indication that this species feeds predominantly on phytoplankton – especially very small diatoms (20μm), which it filters from {{the water with a}} feeding basket. The glass-like shells of the diatoms are cracked in the [...] "gastric mill" [...] and then digested in the <b>hepatopancreas.</b> The krill can also catch and eat copepods, amphipods and other small zooplankton. The gut forms a straight tube; its digestive efficiency is not very high and therefore a lot of carbon is still present in the feces.|$|E

50|$|Arthropods, {{especially}} detritivores in the Order Isopoda, Suborder Oniscidea (woodlice), {{have been}} shown to be able to store heavy metals in their <b>hepatopancreas.</b> This could lead to bioaccumulation through the food chain and implications for food web destruction, if the accumulation gets high enough in polluted areas; for example, high metal concentrations are seen in spiders of the genus Dysdera which feed on woodlice, including their <b>hepatopancreas,</b> the major metal storage organ of isopods in polluted sites.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hepatopancreas</b> of a crab is {{also called}} tomalley, or crab [...] "fat"; in crabs the tomalley is yellow or yellow-green in color. In Maryland {{and on the}} Delmarva Peninsula, the <b>hepatopancreas</b> of the blue crab is called the [...] "muster" [...] or [...] "mustard", {{probably}} because of the yellow color, {{which is not the}} bright yellow of regular prepared yellow mustard, but closer to one of the brown mustards, such as Dijon mustard. Particularly when eating steamed or boiled crabs, it is considered a delicacy.|$|E

A pair of short anterior ceca emenates from the transition between pylorus and gut, appearing as short tubes. The <b>hepatopancreas</b> fills most of the cephalothorax {{and parts of the}} pleon and is formed by two bunches of tubular diverticles which are each connected to the pylorus via a main duct.

50|$|As few as five {{bacteria}} {{can lead to}} clinical disease. When they enter the host, the bacteria colonise the heart and <b>hepatopancreas.</b> They may be engulfed by phagocytosis into the lobster's blood cells, but continue to survive within the blood cells, feeding on the cytoplasm. The lobster's blood cell count drops, and the infection develops into septicaemia. The stores of glycogen in the <b>hepatopancreas</b> become depleted, concentrations of glucose and lactic acid in the blood drop, and concentrations of adenosine triphosphate in muscles also fall. In a severe infection, {{the ability of the}} lobster's blood pigment haemocyanin to carry oxygen may be reduced by up to 50%.|$|E

5000|$|Rediae:The rediae are {{the second}} larval {{stage of the}} {{trematode}} life cycle, that develops from the miracidum and contains germ cells that develop into cercariae. The rediae {{are found in the}} second intermediate host, the snail. Rediae can range from 0.45 mm to 3 mm, and the larger rediae can contain up to 76 cercariae. [...] Rediae and cercariae are found in all tissues of the host snail, but primarily in the gonads and the digestive gland.,Rediae destroy the gonads, invade the <b>hepatopancreas,</b> damage it by 1) increased pressure from rapid growth, 2) active ingestion by the parasites, and 3) the disposition of parasitic wastes. Furthermore, parasites take up glycogen and lipids from the <b>hepatopancreas.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>hepatopancreas,</b> {{digestive}} gland or midgut gland is {{an organ}} of the digestive tract of arthropods, molluscs and fish.

50|$|S. aeruginosa {{breathes}} with gills. The right tentacle is thickened in {{the male}} but not the female. The dry weight of composition of this species is as follows: 28.6% foot, 23.06% intestine, 9.78% gonad, 8.58% <b>hepatopancreas,</b> 29.98% other tissue. The diploid chromosome number of Sinotaia aeruginosa is 2n=16.|$|E
50|$|A. nebulosa {{serves as}} the first {{intermediate}} host for a parasite, the brachylaimid trematode Renylaima capensis. Branched, cercariogenous sporocysts of this parasite massively develop in A. nebulosa. These sporocysts {{are attached to the}} <b>hepatopancreas,</b> body wall, pallial floor and even to the genital system. This fluke is highly specific at the first intermediate host level.|$|E
50|$|Crab duplex-specific {{nuclease}} is a nuclease {{derived from}} kamchatka crab <b>hepatopancreas</b> that displays a strong preference for cleaving double-stranded DNA and DNA in DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes, compared to single-stranded DNA. Moreover, the cleavage rate of short, perfectly matched DNA duplexes by this enzyme is essentially {{higher than that}} for non-perfectly matched duplexes of the same length. It {{has been applied to}} SNP detection and RNA normalization.|$|E
50|$|Whitespot {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} caused by a family of related viruses. First reported in 1993 from Japanese P. japonicus cultures, it spread throughout Asia {{and then to the}} Americas. It has a wide host range and is highly lethal, leading to mortality rates of 100% within days. Symptoms include white spots on the carapace and a red <b>hepatopancreas.</b> Infected shrimp become lethargic before they die.|$|E
50|$|The {{digestive}} system comprises a foregut, a midgut and a hindgut, and is situated dorsally. The foregut {{begins at the}} mouth, passes through the oesophagus, and opens into a sac which contains the grinding apparatus of the gastric mill. The <b>hepatopancreas</b> feeds into the midgut, where digestive enzymes are released, and nutrients taken up. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus.|$|E
50|$|S. aeruginosa is a herbivorous deposit feeder. It consumes mainly epiphytic algae, but its diet also {{includes}} detritus, bacteria, aquatic plants, sand grains, diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Its consumption of cyanobacteria during algal blooms {{may result in}} bioaccumulation of toxic microcystins (microcystin-LR, microcystin-RR) from Microcystis in the gonads, the <b>hepatopancreas</b> and the digestive tract. Adult snails feeding ad libitum under ideal laboratory conditions eat 16.0 mg of fish food daily.|$|E
