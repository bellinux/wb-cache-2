5000|$|Assignment. On the AGCH, {{the network}} sends the RR <b>Immediate</b> <b>Assignment</b> <b>message</b> (GSM 04.08 Section 9.1.18) for a {{dedicated}} channel, usually an SDCCH. This message is {{addressed to the}} MS by inclusion of the 8-bit tag from the corresponding RACH burst and a time-stamp indicating the TDMA clock state when the RACH burst was received. If no dedicated channel is available for assignment, the BTS can instead respond with the RR Immediate Assignment Reject message, which is similarly addressed and contains a hold-off time for the next access attempt. Emergency callers receiving the reject message {{are not subject to}} the hold-off and may retry immediately.|$|E
5000|$|Paging Success by far is {{the most}} complex KPI to deal with as the process of paging touches almost all the nodes in GSM system and is {{influenced}} by performance of each of them. That’s the reason why this write up on paging looks too interwoven and cross refers to too many things. But the plus point with paging is by the time paging success rate in a network gets improved; almost all the other KPIs too stand improved. In response to an incoming call, the MSC initiates the paging process by broadcasting a [...] "paging request" [...] message on the paging sub channel (IMSI or TMSI of the MS and its Paging Group) and starts timer T3113. A [...] "paging message" [...] consists of the mobile identity (IMSI or TMSI) of the MS being paged and its [...] "paging group number". A Paging Request Message may include more than one MS identification. The maximum number of paged MS per message is 4 when using [...] "TMSI" [...] for identification of the MS (maximum number of paged MS per message is 2 when using IMSI). The BSC receives this page and processes the paging request and schedules it for transmission on the PCH at appropriate time. The MS on its part will analyse the paging <b>messages</b> (and <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>messages)</b> sent on the paging sub channel corresponding to its paging group. Upon receipt of a [...] "paging request" [...] message, MS will initiate within 0.7s an <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> procedure. Upon receipt of a page at the MS, the MS responds by transmitting a channel request on the RACH. BSS {{in response to the}} received [...] "channel request", will process it and immediately assign the MS a SDCCH (<b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> / assignment reject; done over AGCH). MS Paging response- After receiving the <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> command, MS switches to the assigned [...] "SDCCH" [...] and transmits a [...] "Paging Response". The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated with information field containing the [...] "PAGING RESPONSE" [...] message and the [...] "paging response" [...] is sent to the MSC. Upon receipt of the [...] "Paging Response" [...] MSC stops the timer T3113. If the timer T3113 expires and a [...] "Paging Response"message has not been received, the MSC may repeat the [...] "Paging Request" [...] message and start T3113 all over again. The number of successive paging attempt is a network dependent choice.|$|R
5000|$|Very Early Assignment. The network {{makes an}} <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> to the TCH+FACCH {{in the initial}} RR {{establishment}} and performs the entire transaction on the FACCH. The SDCCH is not used. Because <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> starts the FACCH in a signaling-only mode, the network must send the RR Channel Mode Modify message at some point to enable the TCH part of the channel.|$|R

50|$|A {{more general}} language, endowed <b>assignment</b> <b>message,</b> is studied by Hatfield and Milgrom (2005). Milgrom {{provides}} an overview of these issues in Milgrom (2011).|$|R
5000|$|As a {{concrete}} {{application of the}} idea of simplifying messages, Milgrom (2009) defines <b>assignment</b> <b>messages</b> of preferences. In <b>assignment</b> <b>messages,</b> an agent can encode certain nonlinear preferences involving various substitution possibilities into linear objectives by allowing agents to describe multiple “roles” that objects can play in generating utility, with utility thus generated being added up. The valuation over a set of objects is the maximum value that can be achieved by optimally assigning them to various roles. <b>Assignment</b> <b>messages</b> can also be applied to resource allocation without money; see, for example, the problem of course allocation in schools, as analyzed by Budish, Che, Kojima, and Milgrom (2013). In doing so, the paper has provided a generalization of the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem (a mathematical property about Doubly Stochastic Matrices) and applied it to analyze when a given random assignment can be [...] "implemented" [...] as a lottery over feasible deterministic outcomes.|$|R
40|$|Assignment {{messages}}" are maximally general {{messages to}} describe substitutable preferences {{by means of}} a linear program. With "integer assignment messages," there exist integer-valued Walrasian allocations, extending a result of Lloyd S. Shapley and Martin Shubik (1971). Any pure Nash equilibrium profile of the Walrasian mechanism with participants limited to <b>assignment</b> <b>messages</b> is also a Nash equilibrium of the unrestricted Walrasian mechanism. Assignment exchanges are generalizations of single-product double auctions and are related to ascending multi-product clock auctions and the Vickrey mechanism. <b>Assignment</b> <b>messages</b> also have additional applications in mechanism design.

30|$|An <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> assigns {{the value}} of the {{expression}} τ directly to the variable x. A delayed assignment evaluates {{the value of}} τ directly but assigns it in the next step of clock(x).|$|R
30|$|This {{form of a}} {{variable}} assignment is called an <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment.</b> It sets {{the value of the}} variable x for the current step to the value given by the evaluation of the expression τ.|$|R
5000|$|... b. Fast Associated Control Channel (FACCH)The FACCH is {{transmitted}} {{instead of a}} TCH. The FACCH ‘‘steals” the TCH burst and inserts its own information. The FACCH is used to carry out userauthentication, handovers, and <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Address {{assignment}} and cryptographic key initialization is sometimes performed by closing a contact on the device while having a master controller broadcast an <b>assignment</b> <b>message.</b> Security is via a simplified encryption system.|$|R
30|$|This form of {{variable}} assignment is called an delayed <b>assignment.</b> Like the <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment,</b> it evaluates the expression τ {{with the values}} of the current step, but this value is assigned to the variable x only in the following step.|$|R
30|$|Optimizations are {{possible}} e. g.dependclk if no delayed assignments exists and trans(x) {{is a constant}} value (e. g. false). In this case, the variable xnxtnxt can completely be removed because it always holds a constant value. Similarly, optimizations {{are possible}} if there are not <b>immediate</b> <b>assignments</b> for a variable x. In this case, the translation shown for the control flow can be used.|$|R

40|$|A state {{feedback}} method of reduced order for eigenvalue assignment is developed in this paper. It offers <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> of m eigenvalues, with freedom to assign the remaining n m − ei-genvalues. The method also enjoys a systematic one-step application {{in the case}} where the system has a square submatrix. Further simplification is also possible in certain cases. The method is shown to be applicable to uncontrollable systems, offering the simplest control law when having maximum uncontrollable eigenvalues...|$|R
30|$|The {{semantics}} of {{the intermediate}} format is as follows. In contrast to traditional guarded commands[32 – 34], guarded actions follow the synchronous model of computation. In each macro step, all actions {{refer to the}} same point of time, i.e., the evaluation of all expressions contained in the guarded actions refers to the same variable environment. If the guard τ of an <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> γ⇒x=τ is true, the right-hand side τ is evaluated to determine the value of variable x in the current macro step, while a delayed action defers the update to the following step.|$|R
50|$|The {{researchers}} also credited the Midtown Court with changing conventional sentencing practices for low-level offenses, which were typically either sentences of “time served” (i.e., {{the time spent}} in jail between arrest and appearing in court) or short-term jail (a month or less). Sentencing at the Midtown Court produced significantly more intermediate sanctions than the city’s conventional arraignment court. Intermediate sanctions included <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> to community restitution projects (with offenders often beginning their sentences within 24 hours of their arraignments) to mandatory participation in social services, such as drug treatment or job training.|$|R
50|$|When Peter {{arrived in}} Prague in 1356 {{at the age}} of 23, his <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> was to take over the {{construction}} site at St. Vitus Cathedral, which had languished since the death of Matthias of Arras in 1352. It is indicative of Peter's talents that the most important building in the Empire was then entrusted to such a young architect. Peter continued the works at St. Vitus from the ambulatory and chapels, which were partially complete, and gradually changed the Matthias plan while keeping continual references to the original vision.|$|R

When he expressed his desire to pursue a literary rather than a naval career, his father engineered his <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment,</b> before graduation, to a long voyage [...] "to clear his head of nonsense". After the three-year tour ended, by which time he was graduated ship-board and twice promoted to full ensign, he nonetheless resigned from the Navy, was disowned by his family, and embarked on {{his career as a}} writer in the liberal camp of 1860s Russia.|$|R
30|$|GPRS {{stations}} use the PRACH {{to initiate}} a packet transfer by sending their requests {{for access to the}} GPRS network service, and listen to the PAGCH for a packet uplink assignment. The uplink <b>assignment</b> <b>message</b> includes the list of PDCH (Packet Data CHannels) and the corresponding Uplink Status Flag (USF) values per PDCH. GPRS stations keep listening to the USFs of the allocated PDCHs. If the corresponding USF is set, it means that the GPRS station has now been granted access to the next PDCH block.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the war in}} Korea edged into 1953, several {{classes of}} Infantry School OCS {{students}} were given authorization to transfer to the Medical Service Corps upon graduation. [...] These selected officers (with previous medical experience) were assigned to Korea (after a short training course at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas), with the explicit duty of {{trying to keep the}} direct inductee Medical Officers alive. [...] This was necessary because of the shortage of medical officers and the lack of combat preparation training provided to them after their direct induction into the Army and their <b>immediate</b> <b>assignment</b> to Korea.|$|R
30|$|Similar to Quartz programs, the AIF {{description}} adds {{an implicit}} default reaction: if no action has determined {{the value of}} the variable in the current macro step, then a variable either gets a default value or stores its previous value, depending on the declaration of the variable (obviously, this is the case if the guards of all <b>immediate</b> <b>assignments</b> in the current step and the guards of all delayed assignments in the preceding step of a variable are evaluated to false). Thereby, event variables are reset to a default value while memorized variables store their value of the previous step.|$|R

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of our applicative-layer {{congestion}} control {{approach is to}} define policies, in order to dynamically and cooperatively schedule messages transmission in the network. Messages scheduling is carried out according to priorities, evaluated {{as a function of}} the utility of the concerned messages, the sender application and the neighborhood context. The messages transmission in the vehicular network is carried out in an efficient and cooperative manner, by favoring vehicles holding the highest-priority messages to send. Therefore, our approach is divided into three steps that we present hereafter: dynamic priority <b>assignment,</b> <b>message</b> scheduling and cooperative message transmission.|$|R
30|$|All subchannels in the ST phase are {{assigned}} to only one station {{at a given time}} (i.e., OFDM operation), and stations are scheduled in time. The schedule and order of access to the medium are determined by the access point and enforced through broadcast messages indicating the schedule, or through explicit poll (TO <b>assignment)</b> <b>messages.</b> Transmission by stations is only allowed in response to such messages. This policy along with a carrier sense mechanism is used to coordinate contention free access to the medium during the ST phase. This mechanism utilizes the interframe spaces described earlier.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} that performs asynchronous backtracking on distributed CSP s, with dynamic {{ordering of}} agents is proposed, ABT DO. Agents propose reorderings of lower priority agents and send these proposals whenever they send <b>assignment</b> <b>messages.</b> Changes of ordering triggers a different computation of Nogoods. The dynamic ordered asynchronous backtracking algorithm uses polynomial space, similarly to standard ABT. The ABT DO algorithm {{with three different}} ordering heuristics is compared to standard ABT on randomly generated DisCSP s. A Nogood-triggered heuristic, inspired by dynamic backtracking, is found to outperform static order ABT by a large factor in run-time and improve the network load...|$|R

This language is essentially a flat representation of Antescofo's code, as a finite state machine extended with local and global variables, with delays and with concurrent threads creation. It features a small number of simple instructions which are either blocking (wait for external event, signal or duration) or not (variable <b>assignment,</b> <b>message</b> emission and control) ...|$|R
50|$|Later, the {{proposal}} was refined and broadened to include other Arab countries in coordination with the existing US-Arab Chamber of Commerce (New York) and the Saudi Chambers of Commerce.
