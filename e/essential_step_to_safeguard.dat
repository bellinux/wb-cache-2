The Safe Drinking Water Act requires that water quality in a water distribution network be sampled at locations which are representative of the whole network system. Different tools based on optimization techniques can be employed for identifying water quality monitoring stations in a water distribution network. In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied for this purpose. The steps involved in the developed methodology are presented with an application on hypothetical networks. Then its validity was tested against two cases presented in the literature and gave similar results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Awareness of {{infertility}} risk factors is an <b>essential</b> first <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>safeguard</b> future fertility. Whereas {{several studies have}} examined university students’ awareness of female fertility and related risk factors, the topic of male infertility has not been well examined. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess young men and women’s awareness, knowledge and perceptions {{of infertility}}, male and female infertility risk factors and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2008 with a multi-ethnic sample of sixteen male and twenty-three female Ottawa university students, followed by qualitative data analysis to identify major themes. Interview topics included awareness of male and female infertility risk factors, infertility diagnosis/treatments and personal options in the event of future infertility. Results Participants were generally familiar with infertility as a biomedical health problem, could identify sex-specific risk factors but overestimated fertility of women in their thirties and ART success rates. Reproductive health knowledge gaps and confusion of the physiological life-stage of menopause with infertility were apparent. Most participants would pursue in vitro fertilization or international adoption in the event of personal infertility. Some participants wished to use a ‘natural’ approach and were concerned with potential side effects of ART-related medications. Conclusions The general awareness of infertility in young adults is promising and supports the potential uptake for health promotion of fertility preservation. This study underscores the continued need for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and promotion for adolescents and young adults...|$|R

Data classification engages categorizing information to predefined levels. For every level, organizations must allocate different levels of security controls and restrict the number of employees or persons who can access the information. Data classification would be difficult in large organizations with significant content to estimate and classify. With the assistance of a data classification approach, organizations can recognize and implement proper setting for private access control and also can obtain decision based on the obtained result from data classification. Machine learning techniques are one of the best classification approaches in the recent development. Many techniques are available under the machine learning approaches and the most important objective of machine learning research is to automatically learn to identify complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. In this paper, data classification usingmany Machine Learning Techniques has been discussed. This paper focuses on better Machine Learning Techniques which supports data classification are available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} {{globalization}} and fast economical and technological change yesterday's and today's recipes for success do not provide a guarantee for tomorrow's success. To retain competitiveness companies nowadays are forced to carry out complex changes in an increasingly faster, more efficient and more successful manner. Strategic change normally is initiated either in anticipation or {{as a reaction to}} external changes. However, the implementation of change processes quite often fails in practice. Actually the success rate of all strategies is only about 10 %. In approximately 70 % of all cases the new strategy fails during the implementation process. Therefore the paper presents a procedure model for quality-oriented design and implementation of strategic change processes. The model is based upon both existing approaches in the management of changes and the criteria of the EFQM Excellence Model. The stages of the procedure model are supported by a combination of tools and methods that allow employees in charge to carry out every <b>essential</b> <b>step</b> of implementation. <b>To</b> <b>safeguard</b> the implementation process the Quality Gate Concept is used. The application of our concept will be illustrated by case studies carried out in projects with various companies...|$|R
