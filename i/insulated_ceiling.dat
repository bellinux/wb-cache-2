As this air flow rate will be supplied through the dynamically <b>insulated</b> <b>ceiling</b> and a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system (MVHR), energy loss is not a major concern so 1 air change per hour (ach) will be assumed.

These studies were performed via field data measurements and simulation using two identical test building located in Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor campus. The performances were appraised by the thermal impact and energy consumption of air-conditioning system for three cooling modes. The three cooling modes are 24 -hours, office-hours (daytime) and residential-hours cooling (nighttime) which are represents the occupied period in the building types. A Field data measurement was performed using real external condition while simulation study was performed using Model Year Climate data of Subang, Malaysia. Results show that the installation of thermal insulation to improve the thermo physical properties of building envelope in roof, ceiling and wall have the significant impact in thermal and energy performances. The use of computer simulation of Integrated Environmental Solution was first validated to ensure the acceptable output from the simulation before to further the investigation. From the field study, {{it was found that}} the roof and ceiling insulation most significant for the daytime cooling when saving the energy up to 0. 56 % and 13. 24 % respectively.

40|$|Exploring {{the energy}} saving and {{efficient}} intervention {{options available to}} governments, Winkler et al (2002) measured the energy cost-benefits of different interventions in low cost housing across South Africa. These interventions included installing <b>insulated</b> <b>ceilings</b> (retrofitting), roof insulation, partitions, wall insulation, window insulation, solar water heaters (SWH) and compact fluorescent lights (CFL's). Of these interventions, wall insulations and ceiling installations were the most cost-effective interventions. This approach was coined "Heat as medicine" by Howden‐Chapman (2011) and a CBA conducted by his team concluded a 2 : 1 benefit to cost ratio (B:C) from the insulation process (IEA, 2011). Mathews and van Wyk (1996) found that by installing a ceiling in a low cost house, a 74 % saving in energy consumption can be made during winter and Spalding-Fecher et al (2002) found a R 781 saving in energy per year per household from ceiling installations. With ceilings having such a substantial cost-effective impact on energy efficiency, this paper will be focusing on the ceiling retrofitting intervention in addressing energy poverty. Surprisingly, solar water heater interventions offer a much smaller net benefit, {{as a result of}} high installation costs and increased usage of water. Having attended conferences on this topic and engaged with low-cost house residents in the Western Cape, the SWH intervention is often seen by the households as a luxury item, which they would happily exchange for more direct benefits such as ceilings and affordable and energy-saving cooking stoves...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands and {{in other}} {{moderate}} climates, residential buildings with low thermal mass (e. g. steel frame constructions) demand less heating energy during intermittent use compared to high thermal mass buildings; this {{is caused by a}} shorter pre-heating period. Although low thermal mass buildings are sensitive to overheating, these problems can be alleviated, e. g., with stricter blind control strategies or appropriate ventilation strategies. Another solution is to increase the building’s thermal storage capacity. However, the latter will reduce the low thermal mass benefit of a shorter pre-heating period. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a concept with an adaptable storage capacity. The concept combines the benefits of buildings with low and high thermal mass by applying adaptable thermal storage to a lightweight building. The proposed adaptable thermal storage concept consists of phase change materials (PCMs) as thermal storage medium placed above a thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>ceiling.</b> This ceiling can be opened or closed to influence airflow to the PCMs and thus thermally couple or decouple the PCMs from the room. In this paper, we investigate the potential of this concept using computational building performance simulation. To assess the potential, the design of the concept needs to be optimized. Since the performance of the concept strongly depends on its operation, it is necessary to integrate optimal control strategies during the design optimization. A design optimization method which includes model predictive control is discussed in this paper...|$|R

Thermal comfort (TC) parameters were measured according to ISO 7730 : 2005 and a building characterization was performed. The overall PM 2. 5 mean concentration of the 22 ECC was above international reference levels in summer and winter seasons. TVOC, bacteria, CO and CO 2 showed significantly higher indoor levels compared to outdoor, in both seasons. Indoor PM 10, TVOC, bacteria and CO 2 present significant differences between seasons. TVOC, bacteria and CO 2 show significant variation between ECC rooms and 4 % of fungi samples were positive for pathogenic Aspergillus species. The winter predicted mean vote (PMV) index showed a ‘slightly cool’ thermal sensation scale which may potentiate respiratory tract infections.

40|$|Because {{of damage}} to the wooden {{structure}} or mould on the suspended ceiling, examinations were made in three ice sports arenas in Northern Germany. Measurements of temperature and relative humidity inside and outside these arenas gave interesting results: During relatively warm winter periods the measured surface temperature {{at the bottom of}} the roof above the ice rink was lower than the air temperature in the arena, resulting in a significantly higher relative humidity at the roof than outside the building. Thus, condensed water was dripping from the roof construction to the ice. Depending on the construction, at the end of the winter the moisture content of the wooden structure was very high, partially resulting in wood destroying fungi, or the steel parts were corroding, respectively. In this paper the climatic conditions in ice sports arenas are simulated including conductivity, convection and radiation in a simplified model. The results were discussed for different parameters. Finally two different solu-tions are shown to lower the moisture content in the timber construction or the steel corrosion, respectively: • An <b>insulated</b> suspended <b>ceiling</b> below the roof construction may protect timber or steel from the low ice temperature with the resulting high humidity. • If the arena is closed to the outside air, an air-conditioning system may dry the air in the arena.

Water, waste and sanitation standards are generally better than in many of the other cities in Africa. Though it has high consumption of electricity and water, it makes up on consumption with consistently strong environmental policies and good governance with strong local structures in place. In an attempt of greening the electricity sector, the city of Johannesburg is keen to promote solar power as a way to reduce carbon emissions and cut electricity costs. The authorities with funding from the Danish Development Agency have spent US$ 1.2 million installing solar water heaters in 700 low cost homes in Cosmo City, a housing development. To add on this, the Johannesburg Road Agency has been installing solar power signals at key city intersections since 2009. In addition to saving energy, the signals are not susceptible to power failures, which cause congestion and higher fuel consumption from queuing drivers. The City of Johannesburg is currently implementing a ‘Climate Proofing of Urban Communities’ Project in 700 Cosmo City low income houses. Climate proofing involves promoting development that reduces the risks of climate change. The project started in July 2008. It involves the installation of Solar Water Heater (SWH) units, as well as the installation of <b>insulated</b> Isoboard <b>ceilings</b> and distribution of Compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) to 700 low-income households in Cosmo City.

The model is based upon the cost of house mouse damage to commonly used types of insulation in walls, as measured in laboratory experiments. Components of the damage are 1) the cost of insulation replacement and 2) increased heating costs due to damaged insulation. Damage costs are compared to the expense of conducting mouse control using anticoagulant rodenticides in permanent bait stations located throughout the structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} certain workmanship requirements {{applying to}} insulants in cavities. It presents previously reported measured {{values for the}} effects of edge gaps, and compares these results with new laboratory measured results for the heat transfer across <b>insulated</b> wall and <b>ceiling</b> cavities, in configurations which permit natural convection to flow around the insulant. The results show the ex-istence of a threshold edge gap width of a few mm for the onset of convection in upward heat flow, but no threshold gap width of detectable size for horizontal heat flow. The loss of thermal performance from convection, as expected, outweighs that previously reported for non-convecting gaps. SUMMARY THERE IS NOW a considerable amount of data [1 - 8] concerning the lossof thermal performance of structural cavities which can result from ther-mal bridging of various forms and degree. In many of these reports, losses of 3 to 5 % of the cavity insulating value for each 1 % of gap width (i. e., edge gap as a percent of cavity width), seem to be quite typical, although there are a few reports in which the loss reaches 10 % or more per 1 % of gap width. To give a perspective to these figures, note that a gap of 1 % would mean a gap width of 5 mm when the frame spacing is at 500 mm, and so would not be difficult either to detect or to avoid. At least one case has been reported [7] in which degradation was much more severe even than above. This is recognisably a case where convective air circulation has enabled heat to bypass the insulant. It occurred in a wall panel, where the convective circulation pressure difference may be relatively large. The corresponding condition applying in ceiling cavities, where the convective circulation pressure must be much smaller, was not reported...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) {{is a type}} material {{which is}} more and more used to create structures, for example yachts and airplanes. The materials generally have a high strength to weight ratio, allowing lightweight structures. In buildings little use is made of FRP, in this study the possibility to use the material to create lightweight floors is explored. The goal of the study is the design of a long span floor (25 m) with the use of FRP. The total thickness should be limited to 1. 0 m, as a result a plenum is not possible. The installations need to be integrated in the structural height of the floor. The floors should be safe and comfortable for its users. The first part of the study is a design part. The shape of the floor plate and the distribution system for the ventilation and lighting are adapted to each other. To be able to build fast and be able to reuse the floor plates simple connections are made which depend on shape and bolts. A radiating ceiling is developed with a water-filled layer. This ceiling can be used for heating and cooling, also during fire, as a structural layer and for improvement of acoustics. In {{the second part of the}} study the safety of the floor during a fire is determined and the comfort of the floor regarding sound insulation and vibrations caused by walking is determined. For a sufficient long fire safety level, provisions are needed. A layer of mineral wool, also improving the room acoustics, can <b>insulate</b> the <b>ceiling</b> leading to a fire safety of at least 40 minutes. The alternative is the use of the water-filled ceiling, with this solution the fire safety is close to infinite. The sound insulation of the floor is determined with an adaptation of the mass-law, taking sound insulation reducing effects into account. The resulting sound insulation is sufficient for most uses, but not for floors separating residences. Due to their low weight the floors will vibrate well due to footfall. With the use of the SBR publication ‘Trillingen van vloeren door lopen’ and FEM analysis the performance of the floor is determined. The result was insufficient, the floor plates need a higher stiffness, increasing material use and as a result cost. Conclusions: Long span FRP floors can be made. The floors can be safe and comfortable with a high level of integration of the installations. The floors can be disassembled and reused. A drawback is the high costs, these are caused by the expensive materials used. A shorter span (7. 2 m) floor will be less expensive, but compared with conventional floors the cost are still a factor three too high to be competitive.

40|$|Köket på centralsjukhuset i Karlstad har byggts om. Efteråt har fuktproblem lokaliserats i vissa delar av krypgrundens tak under köket. Landstingsfastigheter, som sköter lokalerna, är intresserade av att få bort fukten samt undersöka hur klimatet i krypgrunden skulle förändras vid eventuella åtgärder med detta syfte. Genom mätningar av temperaturer och fuktighet på olika platser i krypgrunden har klimatet fastställs. De mätningar som gjordes momentant var yttemperaturer på krypgrundens golv och tak samt kökets golv. Även luftens hastighet i krypgrunden mättes. Under en tvåveckorsperiod loggades även lufttemperatur och relativ luftfuktighet i krypgrunden. Data från mätningarna användes sedan som indata då {{modeller}} byggdes i simuleringsprogrammet COMSOL. I COMSOL gjordes tre tvärsnitt i 2 D över krypgrunden. Två 3 D-modeller under ett av de områdena som drabbats av fuktproblem modellerades också. Med hjälp av modellerna simulerades hur tre olika fall av isolering; fem respektive tio cm jämt fördelat isolering samt välvd isolering, i krypgrundens tak vid de problematiska områdena skulle påverka klimatet i krypgrunden. Som alternativ till isolering provades också att simulera flänsar i taket med syftet att leda upp värme från luften till taket. Mätningarna visade att krypgrunden håller en jämn temperatur även då temperaturen utomhus varierar. Idag håller krypgrunden en medeltemperatur på 16, 8 °C och luften har en medelhastighet på 0, 046 m/s. Analys av fuktigheten i grunden visar att fukten troligtvis inte kommer utifrån utan istället från sanden som utgör grundens golv. För att undvika kondensationsproblem i grunden bör temperaturen inte underskrida 13, 1 °C. Simuleringarna visade att tilläggsisolering är ett bra alternativ för att höja taktemperaturen i de fuktdrabbade områdena. Isoleringen sänkte också medelhastigheten hos luften, vilket gör det enklare att kontrollera fukthalten i krypgrunden. Mest effektivt var det med välvd isolering. After {{reconstruction of}} the kitchen at the Central Hospital in Karlstad, moisture problems were detected {{in certain parts of}} ceiling of the crawl space under the kitchen. Landstingsfastigheter, who manages the premises, was interested in removing the moisture and how the climate of the crawl space would change in the event of measures to this end. Through measurements of temperature and humidity at different locations in the crawl space, the climate in the crawl space was determined. The measurements that were made were instantaneous surface temperatures of the floor and ceiling of the crawl space and the kitchen floor, as well as the movement of air in the crawl space. During a two-week period the air temperature and relative humidity in the crawl space was logged. Data from the measurements were then used as input data for the models, which were built in the simulation software COMSOL. In COMSOL three cross-sections of the crawl space were made in 2 D. Two 3 D models describing the properties of the crawl space in one of the areas affected by the moisture were also made. The models were used to simulate the effect of five and ten cm of insulation, respectively, as well as how arched insulation in the roof of the crawl space in the problem areas would affect the climate of the crawl space. As an alternative to insulation flanges in the roof were also simulated, with the aim to transfer heat to the ceiling from the air. The measurements showed that the crawl space temperature was maintained even when the outdoor temperature varied. Today the average temperature in the crawl space is 16. 8 °C and the average air movement is 0. 046 m/s. Analysis of the humidity in the crawl space shows that the moisture probably doesn’t enter the crawl space from the outside, but rather from the sand that makes up the ground floor. To avoid condensation problems in the crawl space all temperatures should exceed 13. 1 °C. The simulations showed that adding insulation is a good option for raising the ceiling temperature in the areas affected by moisture. The insulation also lowered the average air movement, making it easier to control the moisture content in the crawl space. The most effective way to <b>insulate</b> the <b>ceiling</b> was to use arched insulation...|$|R

The object was to see if there were enough people interested in attending continuing musical soirées in their home. The concert took place in early 1991 in the lounge room of John and Carmel's home. A group of principal teachers from the Queensland Conservatory of music performed Schubert's Octet. At the end of the concert a meeting was convened with a number of those attending including Margot and Doug Anthony, Jean Brewer, Peter and Judy Budd, Viv and Neville Hibbard and Murwillumbah lawyer Greg Rooney. They all agreed that a further concert should be held. However it was suggested that it be held in the historic Tyalgum Literary Institute Hall.The Tyalgum Literary Institute Hall 1907In 1986 local Tyalgum theatrical artists, William Gill and Les Peterkin, formed the Tyalgum Theatre group and produced a number of theatrical spectaculars. They were [...] "Vive La Tyalgum", [...] "Alice In Bananaland", [...] "Red, Hot and Blue", [...] "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Tyalgum", [...] "All Aboard the SS Tyalgum","The 1988 B-Centennial Show","Mucho Muchacha"and [...] "South Pathetic" [...] at The Tyalgum Literary Institute Hall.Video clips from some of these shows can be seen at TYALGUM THEATRE GROUP on YouTube.The Tyalgum Theatre group raised over $16.000 for local charities during that time. A new curtain, stage lighting and a sound system was also installed by the TTG. However, there was a constant problem with the uninsulated corrugated iron roof which made audiences freeze in the winter and boil in the summer. Whenever it rained performances had to stop because of a loud noise. It was suggested that a remedy might be to <b>insulate</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> The shows were presented in the form of Dinner Shows and the hall was set up with tables. Meals were provided by the Local Hall Committee. The Theatre Group also performed at the Tyalgum Hotel. Shows were cast from interested and enthusiastic locals from Tyalgum and Murwillumbah.At the time Greg Rooney was involved in promoting the proposed Murwillumbah Amphitheatre on Hospital Hill in Murwillumbah as a bicentennial project. Peter Knowland, one of Australia's leading acoustic engineers, visited Murwillumbah as part of the feasibility study. He was asked to also visit the Murwillumbah Civic Centre (which was having acoustic problems) and The Tyalgum Literary Institute Hall. His strong advice with respect to the Tyalgum Hall was to not insulate the internal roof structure as in his opinion the Hall had an excellent acoustic. In his view this resulted from a combination of the ripple corrugated iron ceiling that dispersed the echo, the wooden floors and the particular dimensions of the hall that gave it such a warm and clear sound. He provided a written report on the hall. He suggested that any remedial work to solve the noise and insulation problems with the roof should be constructed on top of the current roof which should remain as the internal surface.Another influence on the birth of the Tyalgum Festival was a concert arranged in the late 1980s by Musica Viva. The performance was by the Australia Ensemble led by Dean Olding at the Anglican Church in Murwillumbah. There were six people in the audience. There were more performers on stage than in the audience. It became clear of the importance of having an inspiring venue that would complement excellent performances and as such attract audiences. It was felt that Musica Viva might agree to continue subsidising performances in the Tweed Valley if s a better venue could be found.|$|R
