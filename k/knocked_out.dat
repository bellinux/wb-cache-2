40|$|American options {{give us the}} {{possibility}} to exercise them at any moment of time up to maturity. An optimal stopping domain for American type options is a domain that, if the underlying price process enters we should exercise the option. A <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> option is a American barrier option of <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> type, but with more general shape structure of the <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> domain. An algorithm for generating the optimal stopping domain for American type <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> options is constructed. Monte Carlo simulation is {{used to determine the}} structure of the optimal stopping domain. Results of the structural, and stability of studies are presented for different models of payoff functions and <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> domains...|$|R

PTEN works by dephosphorylating PIP3 to PIP2 which limits AKTs ability to bind to the membrane, decreasing its activity.
