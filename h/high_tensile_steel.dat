25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>steel</b> cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the M.52 was cylindrical and, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was constructed of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>steel</b> with light-alloy covering. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle-like arrangement placed over the upper area around it. The engine was positioned with its center of gravity coincident with that of the aircraft and the wings were attached to the main structure just aft of the engine. The use of a shock cone in the nose was another key design choice; the inlet cone slowed incoming air to the subsonic speeds determined by the engine, but with lower losses than a subsonic aircraft pitot intake. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used. The nose wheel was positioned close to the pilot's feet and the main wheels were fitted onto the main fuselage, folding out under the wings when deployed.|$|E

25|$|The {{weight of}} the hull could {{generally}} be reduced by using higher grades of steel that were lighter and thinner for the same strength, reducing dimensions, particularly length, or using advanced construction techniques like welding that saved weight over the conventional riveting. The Japanese used the same <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>steel</b> for the Hatsuharu class as they did for the older destroyers and chose not to increase {{the power of the}} turbines and boilers to achieve the desired high speed, but lengthened the hull to offset the reduced power of the light-weight machinery. The beam was increased to counter some of the extra top-weight, but the draft was reduced to reduce hull resistance, which also reduced stability by lessening the area of the hull beneath the waterline in comparison to the area above it, which was subject to pressure from the wind. Electric welding was extensively used to reduce weight although it was at an early stage of development in Japan and was still problematic.|$|E
25|$|James Horsfall was a {{wire drawer}} from Digbeth who invented <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>steel</b> wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, {{rebuilding}} it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He {{was a major}} manufacturer and exporter of the piano wire to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames. The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months. The strengthened wire also made possible the construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.|$|E
2500|$|Cheaper steel bicycle {{frames are}} made of mild steel, also called <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>steel,</b> such as {{might be used to}} {{manufacture}} automobiles or other common items.

One of the most successful older steels was Reynolds [...] "531", a manganese-molybdenum alloy steel. More common now is 4130 ChroMoly or similar alloys. Reynolds [...] and Columbus are two of the most famous manufacturers of bicycle tubing. A few medium-quality bicycles used these steel alloys for only some of the frame tubes. An example was the Schwinn Le tour (at least certain models), which used chromoly steel for the top and bottom tubes but used lower-quality steel {{for the rest of the}} frame.|$|E

30|$|The test beams {{were divided}} into eleven groups and each group {{contained}} three identical specimens. Group number 1 is the control group in which the beams were cast using ordinary formwork. The beams in this group were reinforced with 2 ϕ 12  mm <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength <b>steel</b> bars at the tension side and 2 ϕ 12  mm <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength <b>steel</b> bars at the compression side as well as shear reinforcement (stirrups) of Ø 8  mm at 200  mm spacing. The beams incorporating reinforced mortar forms were grouped according to the mesh type, number of steel mesh layers, type of core material, and shear connection method. For all the beams incorporating precast reinforced mortar forms, the core of material was reinforced with two <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength <b>steel</b> bars of 12  mm diameter in the tension side only. Neither reinforcing bars at the compression side nor stirrups were used in these groups. Two types of steel mesh were used to reinforce the U-shaped forms namely; welded wire mesh and X 8 expanded steel mesh. Single or double layers of the steel mesh were used as shown in Table  1. In {{the design of the}} test specimen it was assured that the total percentage of steel reinforcement (reinforcing bars and steel mesh) did not exceed the maximum percentage allowed by the design code. This is an important issue that should be observed by the designers at the practical application stage. Shear connection between the reinforced mortar form and the core for groups 5 and 10 was provided by fixing bolts through the sides and bottom of the forms while {{for the rest of the}} groups bonding agent was applied on the inner surface of the forms before casting the core.|$|R
