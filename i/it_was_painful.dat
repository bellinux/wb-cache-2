[...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>painful</b> at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

Domenech later criticised the condemnation of Henry and France, and questioned the right of former French players like Cantona and Lizarazu to criticise his record as the French coach.|$|E
