40|$|Abstract: The {{shipments}} of hazardous materials (<b>HAZMATs)</b> induce various {{risks to the}} road network. Today, {{one of the major}} considerations of transportation system managers is <b>HAZMATs</b> shipments, due to the increasing demand of these goods (because it is more used in industry, agriculture, medicine, etc.), and the rising number of incidents that are associated to hazardous materials. This paper presents a tool for <b>HAZMATs</b> transportation authorities and planners that would reduce the risk of the road network by identifying safe and economic routes for HM transshipment. Using the proposed linear integer programming model, the HM management system could determine an optimal assignment for all origin–destination pairs for various hazardous materials in a transportation network and so reduce the vulnerability due to <b>HAZMATs</b> releases such as population and environmental vulnerability. The model is implemented and evaluated for the hazardous materials routing within Fars, Yazd, Isfahan, and Chaharmaha-o-Bakhtiyari provinces of Iran. The branch-and-bound algorithm is applied to solve the model using the Lingo software package...|$|R

While venturing the streets, Magnus finds herself under attack by a savage humanoid creature, but is saved by two men in <b>Hazmat</b> suits, who proceed to capture and decontaminate her. Magnus is later shocked to discover that her protégé, Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), {{is the leader of}} the survivalist group. Unlike his original personality, Zimmerman is acting far more violent and aggressive, and believes Magnus to be an imposter, citing she died three years ago. As more creatures attack the base, Magnus escapes and returns to the Sanctuary, where on the way she is joined by a young girl, Jessica Mitchell (Nicole Muñoz).|$|E
5|$|The city is {{protected}} by more than 700 full-time, paid firefighters of the Newark Fire Department (NFD). Founded in 1863, the NFD operates out of 16 firehouses throughout the city that are organized into 3 battalions {{under the command of}} a deputy chief. There is also a Safety Battalion, Battalion2, and a Special Operations Battalion, Battalion 6, on duty 24/7. The NFD operates 16 engine companies, 8 ladder companies, 1 rescue company, an Urban search and rescue (USAR) Collapse Rescue Unit, 2 fire boats, a scuba diving unit, an air cascade unit, a foam unit, a mobile command unit, a <b>HazMat</b> unit, and numerous special, support, and reserve units. The NFD responds to approximately 45,000 emergency calls annually. In 2006, the NFD responded to 2,681 fire and hazardous condition calls.|$|E

Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing <b>hazmat</b> suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E

5|$|Transportation of {{hazardous}} materials {{for commercial purposes}} in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as <b>HAZMAT</b> (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Beyond this interchange, {{the route}} comes to two-way toll plaza {{and has a}} U-turn ramp from the {{southbound}} direction to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, <b>HAZMAT</b> trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route’s signage changes from northsouth to eastwest.

Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC <b>hazmat</b> people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E

40|$|According to the ADR 2007 all European tunnels {{have to be}} {{classified}} into five categories limiting more and more restrictively the passage of vehicles carrying hazardous materials (<b>hazmats)</b> : from class A where the transport of all <b>hazmats</b> is allowed, to class E where none of them can pass, considering in the intermediate classes the restrictions on explosive, toxic and inflammable materials. The ADR 2007 states that the competent authority has to assign the road tunnel {{to one of the}} five categories. On the other hand, each carrier is free to travel in the resulting road network along a minimum cost route. We aim at a decision support model to decide which tunnels to interdict to which types of <b>hazmats</b> so as to minimize the total transportation risk. Despite a single-level formulation has been developed, it cannot be used to solve realworld tunnel interdiction instances because the huge number of variables. In this work, we develop a Lagrangean decomposition approach for the single-level formulation and a Lagrangean heuristic.

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) finds {{managing}} her household {{without her}} husband Jim (John Krasinski) {{to be more}} difficult than anticipated, as she struggles with duties such as taking out the trash. Her already frazzled condition worsens when she finds lice on her daughter CeCe, leaving her no choice but to wash all the clothing in the house. At work the next day, she notices Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) frantically scratching her head, and realizes she may have transferred the lice from CeCe to the office. She initiates an investigation and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who experienced lice infestations as a child in foster care, finds that all of the employees except Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) have lice. Given her disregard for cleanliness, the employees assume Meredith is responsible; Pam defends her but neglects to admit her guilt. To eliminate the lice, Meredith shaves her head. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) also overreacts, donning a <b>hazmat</b> suit and accidentally exposing himself to a hallucinogenic bug bomb that causes him to faint. On Erin's advice, the other infected employees pair up to put mayonnaise on each other's hair to suffocate the lice, which allows Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin to spend time together and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to prank Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) in retaliation for his affair with her husband. Pam's mother calls to inform her that CeCe still has lice; the other staff overhear and realize Pam is responsible for the lice infestation, much to Meredith's delight.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{work on the}} risk-averse routing of {{hazardous}} materials has focussed on ways of finding the safest route between a pair of points. For repeated shipments where the arc incident probabilities are unknown, it is shown that the safest strategy is in general to use a mix of routes.

In {{order to determine the}} safest set of routes and the safest share of traffic between these routes, a minmax problem is formulated. The properties of the optimality conditions are explored.

40|$|Transportation of {{hazardous}} materials play {{an essential role}} on keeping a friendly environment. Every day, a substantial amount {{of hazardous}} materials (<b>hazmats),</b> such as flammable liquids and poisonous gases, need to be transferred prior to consumption or disposal. Such transportation may result in unsuitable events for people and environment. Emergency response network is designed for this reason where specialist responding teams resolve any issue as quickly as possible. This study proposes a new multi-objective model to locate emergency response centers for transporting the hazardous materials. Since many real-world applications are faced with uncertainty in input parameters, the proposed model of this paper also assumes that reference and demand to such centre is subject to uncertainty, where demand is fuzzy random. The resulted problem formulation is modelled as nonlinear non-convex mixed integer programming and we used NSGAII method to solve the resulted problem. The performance of the proposed model is examined with several examples using various probability distribution and they are compared with the performance of other existing method...|$|R
