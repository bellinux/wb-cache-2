5|$|The Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of {{the western}} Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries. This Kannadiga dynasty is {{sometimes}} called the Kalyani Chalukya after its regal capital at Kalyani, today's Basavakalyan in Karnataka and alternatively the Later Chalukya from its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty of Badami. The dynasty is called Western Chalukyas to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> the contemporaneous Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, a separate dynasty. Prior {{to the rise of}} these Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta controlled most of Deccan and Central India for over two centuries. In 973, seeing confusion in the Rashtrakuta empire after a successful invasion of their capital by the ruler of the Paramara dynasty of Malwa, Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty ruling from Bijapur region defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under Someshvara I who moved the capital to Kalyani.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E

5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E

With the introduction of TOPS in 1968 they were to have been classified as Class 72, to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> the later built units. However, instead they became Class 73/0. In the early 1970s the locomotives were renumbered 73001-73006.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between brain death and states that {{may be difficult to}} <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> brain death, (such as barbiturate overdose, alcohol intoxication, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma, and chronic vegetative states). Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. Such is the case with anencephaly.|$|E
25|$|During the {{development}} of plant leaves, the specialized guard cells <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> “guard mother cells”. The density of the stomatal pores in leaves is regulated by environmental signals, including increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which reduces the density of stomatal pores in the surface of leaves in many plant species by presently unknown mechanisms. The genetics of stomatal development can be directly studied by imaging of the leaf epidermis using a microscope. Several major control proteins that function in a pathway mediating {{the development}} of guard cells and the stomatal pores have been identified.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} of PEA as a genetic subgroup has been disputed by Pentland and Proulx. Pentland questions the Eastern Algonquian {{status of the}} southern New England languages and Powhatan and Carolina Algonquian. Proulx has proposed that the similarities can be explained {{as the result of}} diffusion. Goddard has countered that the extent of the similarities would require extensive diffusion very early in the breakup of the Eastern Algonquian languages and that such a position would be difficult in principle to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> analyzing PEA as a genetic subgroup.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD exhibit {{what is known}} as overvalued ideas. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be {{uncertain}} whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do ERP therapy on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> psychotic disorders.|$|E
25|$|Acellular {{cementum}} forms first. The cementoblasts <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> follicular cells, {{which can}} only reach {{the surface of the}} tooth's root once Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the root surface at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, are also secreted. Acellular cementum contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the cementum, and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.|$|E
25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> {{cells of}} the dental papilla. They begin {{secreting}} an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E

Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> the maroon and white of Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the maroon of the Queensland rugby league team. Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue {{was added to the}} jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{previously}} mentioned river terraces, the one known as TT-4 is only visible near Narros del Castillo (Ávila). Terrace TT-3 {{is the best}} preserved of the lot; although its height on {{the bed of the}} stream is not constant, it clearly stands out on the floodplain. Terrace TT-2 is quite well preserved as well, although it has been more heavily sculptured by other small tributaries of the Trabancos River. By contrast, terrace TT-1 is greatly eroded; although some sections survive to the south of the municipality of Alaejos (Valladolid), they are very difficult to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> the colluvium floor that covers the Superficie de Alaejos. Entering into land in the municipality of Pollos, the stream stops to form river terraces, cutting traversely and lowering enough (between 40 and 60 meters) to meet the terrace deposits of the Duero River.|$|E
25|$|The Piraeus Apollo is {{a product}} of the late archaic period (530–480 BC) in which the Greek {{sculpture}} attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create an harmonious whole. It is among the very few such bronzes that have survived. The statue seems to <b>differentiate</b> <b>from</b> the previous formality and represents a kind of motion. The symmetry and the analogies of the members are closer to the post-archaic sculpture which gives more emphasis not to the illusive reality but to the analogy and the interaction of each member with the others in the whole. In the last few decades of the 6th century, the philosophical mystic currents were to have a considerable influence on late archaic art. The logical move from Ionian natural philosophy to metaphysics was the conscious decision of post-archaic mind. In post-archaic period, the illusive imaginative reality was displaced by harmony and symmetry.|$|E
