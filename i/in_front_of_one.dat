25|$|A 'face-ball', 'second man play' or 'cut-out pass' is a {{pass that}} travels {{through the air}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> or more attacking players (who do not catch it) to another player further down the line. Defenders may mistakenly focus on the next player in the attacking line, who does not receive the ball, {{potentially}} leaving the actual ball-receiver unmarked.|$|E

The base was made of stones inlayed in concrete with a rough oblong block of stone with a smoothed face panel as its tablet. This panel had the Japanese inscription.|$|E

Most of the fighting consisted of shooting arrows at a great distance. On at least one occasion the Muslims were able to storm the fortresses.

25|$|The 1986 NSWRL Grand Final at the SCG {{between the}} John Monie coached Parramatta and {{defending}} premiers Canterbury-Bankstown, coached by Warren Ryan, and played <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> {{of the smallest}} Grand Final crowds in years (45,843), would go down as the lowest scoring and only try-less Grand Final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4–2 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), {{at the time the}} record number of points scored in a career.|$|E
25|$|Lord Clifden {{started the}} 1864 {{season in the}} Claret Stakes in April, where he only faced two rivals. As Parr led him onto the course a large crowd {{surrounded}} him. They got so close {{that they had to}} be ordered to get back of course officials. After the start, Rapid Rhone had a clear lead. Lord Clifden never got on terms and faded in the straight to finish second, ten lengths behind Rapid Rhone. On 9 June at Royal Ascot he run in the Gold Cup <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the largest crowds ever seen at Ascot. However he spent the whole of the race {{at the rear of the}} field and could not challenge the leaders. In the end he finished unplaced, over 20 lengths behind winner Scottish Chief. Little Stag was second and Lord Zetland third. In late July Lord Clifden was allotted top weight of 8st 12lb for the Chesterfield Cup run over one and a quarter miles at Goodwood. With half of a mile left to run, Lord Clifden was struck into by his half-sister Lady Clifden. This caused him to blunder and fall on his head, throwing John Osbourne to the ground, although the jockey did not sustain any serious injuries. The race was won by King of Utopia. Later the same day Lord Clifden walked over for a sweepstakes of £100 each. He was then retired to stud. For part of his four-year-old season, Lord Clifden was trained by William Bevill.|$|E

500|$|Davison's {{purpose in}} {{attending}} the Derby and walking onto {{the course is}} unclear. She did not discuss her plans with anyone or leave a note. Several theories have been suggested, including that she intended to cross the track, believing that all horses had passed; {{that she wanted to}} pull down the King's horse; that she was trying to attach one of the WSPU flags to a horse; or that she intended to throw herself <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the horses.

500|$|The 1901 {{game was}} played in 35-minute halves at Regents Field <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the largest crowds that ever {{attended}} a game {{up to that time}} in Ann Arbor.

The second touchdown was scored at the 9-minute mark in the first half by left tackle Hugh White on a [...] "mass play" [...] on Chicago's left end. Shorts missed the kick for goal from touchdown. In the second half, Shorts scored Michigan's third touchdown after 5:45 had been played in the second half but missed the kick for goal as Michigan extended its lead to 16–0. Shorts also scored Michigan's fourth touchdown and kicked goal at the 7:30 mark of the second half. Michigan's defense held Chicago to three first downs, never allowed the Maroons into field goal range, and forced 11 punts while the Wolverines punted only once.|$|E

50|$|Some {{people are}} able to {{consciously}} uncouple their eyes, either by over focusing closely (i.e. going cross eyed) or unfocusing. Also, while looking at one object behind another object, the foremost object's image is doubled (for example, placing <b>one's</b> finger <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> face while reading text on a computer monitor). In this sense double vision is neither dangerous nor harmful, and may even be enjoyable. It makes viewing stereograms possible.|$|R

2500|$|Binocular rivalry was {{discovered}} by Porta (1593, as cited in Wade, 1996). Porta put one book <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> eye, and another {{in front of the}} other. He reported that he could read from one book at a time and that changing {{from one to the other}} required withdrawing the [...] "visual virtue" [...] from one eye and moving it to the other. According to Wade (1998), binocular colour rivalry was first reported by Le Clerk (1712). Desaguiliers (1716) also recorded it when looking at different colours from spectra in the bevel of a mirror. The clearest early description of both colour and contour rivalry was made by Dutour (1760, 1763; see translations by O'Shea, 1999a, b). To experience colour rivalry Dutour either crossed his eyes or overdiverged his eyes (a form of free fusion commonly used also at the end of the 20th century to view Magic Eye stereograms) to look at differently coloured pieces of cloth (Dutour, 1760) or differently coloured pieces of glass (Dutour, 1763). To experience contour rivalry Dutour again used free fusion of different objects or used a prism or a mirror <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> eye to project different images into it. The first clear description of rivalry in English was by Charles Wheatstone (e.g., 1838). Wheatstone invented the stereoscope, an optical device (in Wheatstone's case using mirrors) to present different images to the two eyes.|$|E
2500|$|An eyepatch is a {{small patch}} that is worn <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> eye. It may be a cloth patch {{attached}} around the head by an elastic band or by a string, an adhesive bandage, or a plastic device which is clipped {{to a pair of}} glasses. It is often worn by people to cover a lost or injured eye, but it also has a therapeutic use in children for the treatment of amblyopia. (See orthoptics and vision therapy.) Eyepatches used to block light while sleeping are referred to as a sleep mask. [...] Eyepatches associated with pirates are a stereotype originating from fiction.|$|E
