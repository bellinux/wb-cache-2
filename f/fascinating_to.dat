5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E

Writers Homes was part of his effort to get to know Washington D.C.:I was just really <b>fascinated</b> <b>to</b> discover that writing and writers had existed in D.C. before me. I live in the Brookland neighborhood, and was <b>fascinated</b> <b>to</b> find out that Sterling Brown lived a few blocks from me and {{wanted to know more about}} him — that kind of started a progression of interest in writers, playwrights and poets and novelists who called Washington home.|$|R

25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|E
25|$|Because the British edition {{lacked the}} Epilogue, which {{accounts}} for Ishmael's survival, {{it seemed that the}} story was told by someone who was supposed to have perished. Many reviewers in British magazines recognized a violation of the rules of fiction and criticized the author for the serious flaw. Other reviewers, however, found the book too <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> dismiss for these reasons. Some of the scornful British reviews were either reprinted or quoted in American periodicals, wrong-footing the American readers because they had access to the Epilogue. About 3,200 copies were sold during the author's life.|$|E
25|$|Later on in {{the history}} of the Dutch East Indies, as a new wave of Europeans were brought into the colony, many adopted the Indonesian styles, many even went so far as to wear {{traditional}} Javanese kebaya at home. Batik was also a big influence for the Dutch. The technique was so <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> them that they took the technique to their colonies in Africa where it was adopted with African patterns. For the most part, Europeans in the Dutch East Indies, stuck to traditional European styles of dressing. Fashion trends from Paris were still highly regarded and considered the epitome of style. Women wore dresses and skirts and men wore pants and shirts.|$|E

Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net summarized his review claiming the album is [...] "one tough son of a bitch that may still have you humming melodies long after you've ejected the disc."

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Grey's {{has also}} been {{credited}} to have changed the perception on how good and bad television can be defined, The A.V. Club write, [...] "Since The Sopranos burst onto the scene, we’ve too often classified a show as [...] "good" [...] based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s {{has been among the}} very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." ...|$|E

In an article for The Guardian, Theroux noted, [...] "It was <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> see {{the power of a}} family to create its own bizarre ideology and pass it down through the generations." [...] In a statement in The Age, Theroux posited, [...] "Maybe, through my enthusiasm, people reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them." [...] The Western Mail quoted Theroux on how he selects subject matter which interests him, [...] "The subjects I'm interested in are quite extreme. They're so far beyond the pale of normal human interaction that you're never going to get a reality show on that territory." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s Coward {{continued}} to write musicals and plays. After the Ball, his 1953 adaptation of Lady Windermere's Fan, {{was the last}} musical he premiered in the West End; his last two musicals were first produced on Broadway. Sail Away (1961), set on a luxury cruise liner, was Coward's most successful post-war musical, with productions in America, Britain and Australia. The Girl Who Came to Supper, a musical adaptation of The Sleeping Prince (1963), ran for only three months. He directed the successful 1964 Broadway musical adaptation of Blithe Spirit, called High Spirits. Coward's late plays include a farce, Look After Lulu! (1959), and a tragi-comic study of old age, Waiting in the Wings (1960), {{both of which were}} successful despite [...] "critical disdain". Coward argued that the primary purpose of a play was to entertain, and he made no attempt at modernism, which he felt was boring to the audience although <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> the critics. His comic novel, Pomp and Circumstance (1960), about life in a tropical British colony, met with more critical success.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{returned}} to Stratford {{in the summer}} of 1960 to play Viola in Twelfth Night and Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra. The New York Post wrote of her Cleopatra, [...] "Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> watch." [...] Hepburn herself was proud of the role. Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962). It was a low-budget production, and she appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary. She called it [...] "the greatest [...] this country has ever produced" [...] and the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone [...] "the most challenging female role in American drama", and felt her performance was the best screen work of her career. Long Day's Journey Into Night earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. It remains one of her most praised performances.|$|E
500|$|Balthier {{has been}} {{compared}} to other characters in fiction. Simon Wigham of Console Obsession called Balthier his [...] "favourite by quite a wide margin", comparing him to James Bond due to his [...] "humorous lines". RPGFan editor Stephen Harris compared his voice to that of Ian Fleming's depiction of Bond. 1UP.com editor Andrew Pfister compared the duo of Balthier and Fran to that of Han Solo and Chewbacca, two characters from the Star Wars franchise, adding that they are far more interesting than any other character in the [...] "modern FF era". Gideon Emery's work as Balthier's English voice actor was acclaimed by Eurogamer writer Martin Robinson {{as one of the best}} ones from the entire game as [...] "it's <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> think how the game's wider perception might have changed if he was placed as the leading man". In August 2017, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age producer Hiroaki Katō discussed the possibilities of Balthier and Fran of having the their own spin-off games based on gamers' demands.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Constantine and Woodall {{moved from}} the BBC to ITV in a deal reputedly worth £1.2 million {{to start a new}} show, Trinny & Susannah Undress..., on 3 October. The second series of Trinny & Susannah Undress... was {{transmitted}} in June 2007, and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage. [...] Constantine found it warming that people could open up to them as confidantes, and also said [...] "It's been <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> see how looking good and having faith in your appearance makes you into a sexier person, which makes you attractive to your partner again." [...] Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining, and as a result, she often went home crying. The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme. On 16 October 2006, they both appeared on NBC's The Today Show and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show.|$|E
500|$|Pat and Mike was {{the last}} film Hepburn {{completed}} on her MGM contract, making her free to select her own projects. She spent two years resting and traveling, before committing to David Lean's romantic drama Summertime (1955). The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing a lonely spinster who has a passionate love affair. She described it as [...] "a very emotional part" [...] and found it <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> work with Lean. At her own insistence, Hepburn performed a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result. The role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of her finest work. Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress. The following year, Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company, playing Portia in The Merchant of Venice, Kate in The Taming of the Shrew, and Isabella in Measure for Measure. The tour was successful and Hepburn earned significant plaudits for the effort.|$|E
