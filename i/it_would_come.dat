5|$|The laurels for the day’s action {{went to the}} defenders. The aim of the Luftwaffe was to {{wear down}} the Fighter Command without {{suffering}} excessive losses in the process, and in this it had failed. It cost the attackers five aircrew killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, for each British pilot casualty. In terms of aircraft, it had cost the Luftwaffe five bombers and fighters for every three Spitfires and Hurricanes destroyed in the air or on the ground. If the battle continued at this rate the Luftwaffe would wreck Fighter Command, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> close to wrecking itself in the process.|$|E
5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E

5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that {{said he was in}} danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E

25|$|There are {{views of}} Hegel's thought as a {{representation}} of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical idealism. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific dialectical idealism, such as existentialism, the historical materialism of Marx, historism, and British Idealism.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} fuel is another alternative under development in various countries, alongside, hydrogen vehicles though hydrogen {{is actually an}} energy storage medium, not a primary energy source, and consequently {{the use of a}} non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use. Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by battery powered vehicles, there are applications where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> in useful. Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples. Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third as efficient as batteries and double the efficiency of gasoline vehicles.|$|E
25|$|At Dantu County, Liu Yao {{contemplated}} {{moving to}} Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡; around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) to take shelter. However, Xu Shao {{advised him to}} go to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) instead. He explained that Kuaiji Commandery had an abundance of resources so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> under attack by Sun Ce very soon. Yuzhang Commandery, however, shared borders with Yu Province to the north and Jing Province to the west, so it would be more convenient for them to form alliances with other warlords such as Cao Cao and Liu Biao to counter the threat of Yuan Shu. Liu Yao heeded Xu Shao's suggestion and travelled to Yuzhang Commandery.|$|E

25|$|In May 1943, No. 12 Squadron {{was ordered}} to move to Merauke in western New Guinea, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{under the command of}} No. 72 Wing. The squadron's 270-man strong advance party arrived in Merauke on 8 July but found that no {{facilities}} had been constructed for the unit. As a result, its aircraft were stationed at Cooktown, Queensland, where they were used for anti-submarine patrols and the escort of shipping. No. 12 Squadron gradually moved to Merauke between September and November 1943, and continued to be employed mainly in maritime patrols. The squadron's only contact with the Japanese during its period at Merauke took place on 9 October when a Vengeance unsuccessfully attacked a float plane.|$|E
25|$|I was {{initiated}} into a college secret society—a {{couple of hours}} of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as {{in a kind of}} pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> out all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was led down flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that just as my father passed from this earth, I was lying in a coffin during my initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.|$|E
25|$|On August 17, 2010, the 160GB PS3 slim {{previously}} {{released in}} Japan was announced for North America during Gamescom 2010. The 320GB model was also announced {{to be headed}} for NA, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> with Move and Sports Champion. Because {{it is going to}} be a Move bundle, it would not be released until September 19 which is when Move launches. Currently, there is no way to purchase the 320GB model outside of the Move bundle, except in the United Kingdom where it is available to purchase with GT5 for £284.99. Because of the 160GB model, Sony has discontinued manufacturing of the 120GB model. The 160GB retails for $299 USD, and the 320GB for $399. Feature-wise, these new models are identical to the previous slim models.|$|E

25|$|Obama {{resigned}} from the Senate effective November 16, 2008. Initially, {{it was thought that}} his replacement would be named by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Since the term for the seat expired in January 2011, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> up for its normal election in 2010 with no special election necessary. Blagojevich was expected to name Obama's immediate successor in the Senate by January 3, 2009. However, on December 9, 2008, the status of Obama's succession in the Senate was cast in doubt after Blagojevich was arrested on federal corruption charges, which included allegedly attempting to sell the appointment. Although placed in federal custody and released on $4,500 bail, as long as he remained governor Blagojevich continued to have sole authority to make the appointment. Several Democrats, including Sen. Dick Durbin, asked the Illinois General Assembly to schedule a special election instead. Blagojevich appointed Roland Burris to fill Obama's vacated seat.|$|E
25|$|Outside his land, {{the first}} {{development}} took place. A Federal style {{house was built}} at 146 Madison Avenue in 1828, the oldest extant house in the district today. Nearby, 143 Madison went up five years later. It, too, is a Federal building, but with some exterior alterations from the later 19th century. After {{the opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825 sparked economic growth, new residential land was sought. While most of <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> north and west of downtown, Trinity Place was opened (as Broad Street) in 1836. The first rowhouses in the future Mansion Historic District, 16–24 and 39–45a Trinity, were built in 1839–40 along with 2 Ashgrove Street nearby. David Orr, one of the wealthiest men in Albany, built the row at 57-65 Grand around the same time, the last houses in the district built in High Greek Revival style. This marks the beginning of the Mansion neighborhood as it is known today.|$|E

500|$|Nero celebrated {{this peace}} {{as a major}} achievement: he was hailed as imperator and held a triumph, {{although}} no new territory had been won, and the peace reflected a compromise rather than a true victory. For although Rome could prevail militarily in Armenia, politically, she had no genuine alternatives to the Arsacid candidacy on offer for the Armenian throne. Armenia would henceforth be ruled by an Iranian dynasty, and despite its nominal allegiance to Rome, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> under increasing Parthian influence. In the judgment of later generations, [...] "Nero had lost Armenia", and although the Peace of Rhandeia ushered {{in a period of}} relatively peaceful relations that would last for 50 years, Armenia would continue to be a constant bone of contention between the Romans, the Parthians, and their Sassanid successors. For the short term however, the peace that Nero secured was kept by both sides, even while the bulk of Rome's eastern forces was involved in the suppression of the Jewish Revolt.|$|E
