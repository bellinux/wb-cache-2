The efficiency of cross cutting and quantity of sawdust produced in relation to different cutting chain settings, chain producers and wood species has been measured. The trial was set up to include two tree species (fir and beech) and saw chains from two different producers. The chains were filed at three different top plate <b>filing</b> <b>angles</b> and depth height gauges. All factors were significant in terms of cutting efficiency and wood dust production. The top plate angle recommended by producers proved to be the most efficient, with the smallest quantity of inhalable wood dust. Cutting chain settings can be adapted to the specific requirements of the user; however, safe working practices should be followed. Significant differences between chain producers mean that users should conduct rational decision making when choosing a saw chain...|$|R

The behavior of such a system subjected to a weak steady shear is analyzed. We explore the director structures and flow behaviors of the system in flow-aligning and flow tumbling regimes. Combining asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations, we extend previous studies to give a complete characterization of the steady states for both contractile and extensile particles in flow-aligning and flow-tumbling regimes.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{atmospheric}} neutrino {{data in the}} context of three flavor neutrino oscillations taking account of the matter effects in the earth. With the hierarchy among the vacuum mass eigenvalues μ_ 3 ^ 2 ≫μ_ 2 ^ 2 ≥μ_ 1 ^ 2, the solution of the atmospheric neutrino problem depends on δ_ 31 =μ_ 3 ^ 2 - μ_ 1 ^ 2 and the 13 and 23 mixing angles ϕ and ψ. Whereas the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino data imposes only a lower limit on δ_ 31 > 10 ^- 3 eV^ 2, the zenith angle dependent suppression observed in the multi-GeV data limits δ_ 31 from above also. The allowed regions of the parameter space are strongly constrained by the multi-GeV data. Combined with our earlier solution to the solar neutrino problem which depends on δ_ 21 = μ_ 2 ^ 2 -μ_ 1 ^ 2 and the 12 and 13 mixing angles ω and ϕ, we have obtained the ranges of values of the five neutrino parameters which solve both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problems simultaneously.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the number of {{rotations}} to fracture of the M-Wire GT® Series X(TM) rotary files compared to the original ProFile® GT® rotary files in a simulated curved canal. Eighty GT® Series X(TM) files of 25 mm length were divided into eight groups of ten, one for each of the new GT® Series X(TM) files. Eighty original ProFile® GT® files of 25 mm length were divided into eight groups of the same tip and taper sizes consistent with the GT® Series X(TM) file groups. Files were rotated at 300 rpm. While the angle may have slightly changed due to the flexure property of the <b>file,</b> the <b>angle</b> was the same for each file with the same tip and taper. The time to fracture was recorded and rotations to fracture were calculated. The data collected was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, followed by specific post-hoc contrasts comparing the two brands for each tip and taper combination. The results show the M-Wire GT® Series X(TM) files were significantly more resistant to fracture by cyclic fatigue than the ProFile® GT® rotary instruments for the following tip and taper sizes: 20 /. 04, 30 /. 04, 30 /. 06, 30 /. 08, and 40 /. 08.

40|$|International audienceFar-fi eld {{decomposition}} {{methods are}} among the most powerful means to accurately compute the forces on an aircraft. They allow distinguishing between the drag components associated with the various physical phenomena: shock waves, viscous interactions and lift-induced vortex, without yet being fit to apply to unsteady confi gurations. Van der Vooren and Destarac have for example developed a powerful and reliable method used widely in the industry but restricted to steady flows. Gari epy has made a first attempt in generalizing it but his decomposition still holds terms that cannot be matched with physical phenomena. This paper presents another generalization to unsteady flows of Van der Vooren formulation. The demonstration relies on a strong theoretical background and allows the breakdown of drag into the three usual components only. This new unsteady formulation is applied to an OAT 15 A profi le with bu ffeting, then to a NACA 0012 pro <b>file</b> at high <b>angle</b> of attack with natural vortex shedding, and finally to an oscillating profi le.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the number of rotations to fracture of NiTi rotary files when operated at different speeds and at different angles. Sixty size 25 Profile® nickel titanium rotary files were tested, thirty 0. 04 and thirty 0. 06 taper. Files were operated at speeds of 350 or 600 rpm and at angles of 25 °, 28 °, and 33. 5 °. The time to fracture was recorded and the numbers of rotations to fracture were calculated. The data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test with alpha =. 001. The results show a significant difference in the number of rotations fracture according to taper and <b>angle.</b> <b>Files</b> of. 06 taper fractured more readily than files of. 04 taper as the speed increased, and the time to fracture decreased for both tapers as the angle increased.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the number of {{rotations}} to failure of three different rotary file systems. ProFile, Sequence, and Liberator files in sizes 25 and 40 with 0. 04 taper were divided into groups of five and rotated against a grooved metal block mounted to a Universal testing machine at 31 and 34 degrees. Each file was rotated at 300 rpm until fracture occurred. The number of rotations to fracture were calculated. Use of a three-way ANOVA and Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD multiple comparison tests revealed significant differences for the angle of deflection, size, and type of <b>file.</b> An increased <b>angle</b> of deflection resulted in a decreased number of rotations to failure for all three file types. An increased size of file also resulted in a decreased number of rotations to failure in all the groups. Liberator and Sequence files required fewer rotations to failure than ProFiles in all groups tested except the size 25 files rotated at the less severe angle. ProFiles appear to be more resistant to flexural fracture than Liberator and Sequence files unless the files are of smaller size with a less severe curvature. Care should be taken to limit the number of uses when using larger size files, especially Liberator and Sequence files, around severe curvatures...|$|R
40|$|EPID images {{acquired}} in cine mode during arc therapy have inaccurate gantry angles recorded in their image headers. In this work, methods {{were developed to}} assess {{the accuracy of the}} gantry potentiometer for linear accelerators. As well, assessments of the accuracy of other, more accessible, sources of gantry angle information (i. e., treatment log files, analysis of EPID image headers) were investigated. The methods used in this study are generally applicable to any linear accelerator unit, and have been demonstrated here with Clinac/Trilogy systems. Gantry angle data were simultaneously acquired using three methods: i) a direct gantry potentiometer measurement, ii) an incremental rotary encoder, and iii) a custom-made radiographic gantry-angle phantom which produced unique wire intersections as a function of gantry angle. All methods were compared to gantry angle data from the EPID image header and the linac MLC DynaLog file. The encoder and gantry-angle phantom were used to validate the accuracy of the linac’s potentiometer. The EPID image header gantry angles and the DynaLog <b>file</b> gantry <b>angles</b> were compared to the potentiometer. The encoder and gantry-angle phantom mean angle differences with the potentiometer were 0. 13 ° ± 0. 14 ° and 0. 10 °± 0. 30 °, respectively. The EPID image header angles analyzed in this study were within ± 1 ° of the potentiometer angles only 35 % of the time. In some cases, EPID image header gantry angles disagreed by as much as 3 ° with the potentiometer. A time delay in frame acquisition was determined using the continuous acquisition mode of the EPID. After correcting for this time delay, 75 % of the header angles, on average, were within ± 1 ° of the true gantry angle, compared to an average of only 35 % without the correction. Applying a boxcar smoothing filter to the corrected gantry angles further improved the accuracy of the header-derived gantry angles to within ± 1 ° for almost all images (99. 4 %). An angle accuracy of 0. 11 ° ± 0. 04 ° was determined using a point-by-point comparison of the gantry angle data in the MLC DynaLog file and the potentiometer data. These simple correction methods can be easily applied to individual treatment EPID images in order to more accurately define the gantry angle...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) satellites {{are widely}} used for Earth observation applications as weather conditions and cloudiness do not affect them. However, {{in order to be}} usable, data provided by those satellites need to be processed. This processing requires determination of imaging parameters that are closely linked to the spacecraft position and velocity on its orbit. For example, the difference in velocity of the Earth's surface and the spacecraft produces Doppler shift in the received signal. This decay, called Doppler centroid, {{is one of the most}} important parameters required by spaceborne SAR signal processing. As an illustration, the Antarctic anomaly that occurred in ERS data processing induced severe azimuth ambiguities ("ghosting") in the whole image. Those parameters also vary in relation to the attitude angles of the platform. In order to estimate the Doppler centroid, determination of orbital parameters and their evolution has to be made. In this paper, the method to perform orbital osculating elements calculation and imaging parameters determination for SAR satellites, starting from state vectors or two-line elements <b>files</b> and attitude <b>angles,</b> will be introduced as well as the perturbation due to the Earth flatness, called the J 2 perturbation. The near-circular orbit often used by Earth observation satellites makes the perturbation equations of the J 2 parameter unstable, and the introduction of new orbital parameters is required in order to be able to determine the evolution of the orbital parameters. Simulations will be performed and the resulting osculating elements will be presented and explained for short-term and long-term variations for different kinds of orbits, such as GEO, SSO, LEO and Molnya-orbit. Full analysis of the imaging parameters will be made for the SAOCOM satellite with particular attention to the Doppler centroid phenomenon: its sensitivity with relation to the attitude angles and the way to cancel it by setting the yaw steering dynamically.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to introduce, describe, and {{critically}} examine the IBM and Hewlett-Packard PANOSE systems of (electronic) font classification. Microsoft's TrueType Font (TTF) file format allows font developers the option of classifying their fonts according to one or both systems, and writing that information into a special location in the TTF file for use by other software. Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive survey of 13, 000 TTF files was examined for information about their use of either classification system. Findings – The classification systems are intended to help perform font substitution, as used when (part of) a document asks to be displayed in a font that is not present on the user's computer system, in which case the next nearest font is automatically chosen. However, of the nine sources of font compendia examined, only three had supplied adequate information about their fonts’ classifications in order to make this process workable. The other six sources had almost no coverage. When a font was classified by both classification systems, the two systems mapped poorly on to each other, suggesting that at least one system must be ill-specified. PANOSE, the more detailed and slightly more popular system, showed poor internal consistency. Research limitations/implications – Sampling of the universe of fonts was opportunistic, and avoided expensive font developers who may be more conscientious adopters of the classification systems. The reliance on historic secondary data means that it is not always possible to distinguish between limitations of the systems per se and limitations of the users of the systems. This article's arguments are based on data derived from difficult-to-picture distinctions. Practical implications – Fonts are rarely classified at the source of manufacture or distribution. To compensate for this shortcoming, software tools are required that can classify TTF files at the point of use (i. e. on one's own system) and fill in the information which is missing from the TTF files found there. Furthermore, a better classification of fonts is required, in particular one that does justice to the variety and richness of display fonts. This should break free from the hard-to-perceive minutiae of traditional, historically-derived methods. Instead, it should be psychologically grounded in the distinctions that people (i. e. the users) see in fonts, rather than those taught to graphic designers.

40|$|Plants are sessile {{organisms in}} need to {{acclimate}} {{to the changes}} in the surrounding environment by changing their metabolism and growth behavior. Responses to external stimuli such as gravity, light, or touch can result in tightly coordinated growth responses, regulating the final shape and size of an organ. The coordination of organ growth has to occur on several levels. Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall, which governs final cell shape and cell size. These walls allow for expansion by deposition and loosening of cell wall material; and simultaneously for directionality through alignment of the load-bearing cellulose fibrils. At the same time, these cell walls generate a connecting matrix that links adjacent cells and requires for these cells to grow in units, so called symplastic growth. ^ In plants with helical aligned cell files along axial organs, this connection through the cell wall is thought to cause cells to rotate in-phase around the organ axis, with a decrease of cell <b>file</b> length and <b>angle</b> towards organ axis from the outer cell layers inwards. At the same time, if cell anisotropy is not altered, the organ diameter increases dependent on the angle described by the cell files. ^ In addition to these biomechanical constraints imposed on cells within one organ, cell directionality also affects organ growth behavior. If elongating cells are oriented helically around an axial organ, their growth axis is not aligned with the organs growth axis. The cell growth vector can be divided into its components parallel and perpendicular to the organ growth axis, the first one drives organ growth, the second a rotation of the organ tip, both in an angle dependent manner. Organ growth is decreased, most likely due to the parallel vector component being shorter than the cell growth vector. ^ Cell directionality is regulated by several cellular factors. Cortical microtubules are positioned along the plasma membrane of the cell. In elongating cells they are organized in parallel arrays, approximately perpendicular to the growth axis of the cell, forming 2 ̆ 2 hoop-like 2 ̆ 2 structures around the cell. They are thought to guide cellulose producing enzyme complexes into and within the plasma membrane, resulting in cellulose fibrils being aligned in a similar manner. Cellulose fibril alignment in turn guides turgor pressure driven expansion, and thus directionality of cell expansion. In this work, the mutant twd 1, defective in a FKBP-like immunophilin that displays a helical cell file orientation, was used to elucidate relationships between cell-cell and cell-organ growth, as well as to investigate cortical microtubules and cell wall components in regard to the altered cell file orientation. ...|$|R
