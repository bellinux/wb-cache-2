5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

[...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{all know}} that Social Security {{is running out of}} money, {{and it has to be}} fixed. You have {{proposed}} to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. So where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years? ...|$|E

I think the whole thing, and in a moment it is before you--created.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} the best way, if you will have it so, lad. I have left money with Johnson, at Ramgur, for the next herd that is to come down here; and have orders from my agent on their agents, at Dalla, for those that I am going to buy for the Manipur column. So I don't want the money now and, suppose the dhow were to be lost going up, the cash might go with it. So, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> order.

Be persuasive; don't fret her; tell her it's all right, {{the matter is}} in my hands, but it isn't good form to hurry so grave a matter as this. Explain to her {{that we have to}} go by precedents, and that I believe this one to be new. In fact, you can say I know that nothing just like it has {{happened}} in our army, therefore I must be guided by European precedents, and must go cautiously and examine them carefully. Tell her not to be impatient, it will take me several days, but it will all come out right, and I will come over and report progress as I go along. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea, Dorcas?" ...|$|E
