25|$|Travel on {{highways}} {{outside of}} {{towns and cities}} in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must {{be paid to the}} presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Completing the road infrastructure <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, {{a catcher}} {{can make a}} {{successful}} pick-off throw to a base to surprise an inattentive or incautious baserunner. Especially at the higher levels of baseball (where this play almost never results in an out), the catcher's snap throws are mainly for psychological effect. If the runner knows that the catcher often attempts snap throws, the runner <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a smaller lead from his base before each pitch, which will allow the infielders an extra {{fraction of a second}} to throw the runner out at the next base if he attempts to advance (as, for example, when a ground ball is hit). Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals and former MLB catcher Iván Rodríguez are known for using pickoffs with success, particularly at first base. Teams may sometimes call a deliberate play, the pitchout, wherein the pitcher intentionally throws the ball wide and high to the catcher, who comes out of his crouch to receive it and relays the ball quickly to a base to put a runner out.|$|E

"White" [...] {{is derived}} from an Old English word meaning clean or pure, and the village of Whitwell <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> its name from a well or spring with a {{reliable}} supply of fresh water. The original White Well, located towards {{the south end of}} the village was once a place of veneration as a 'holy well' and a site of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. The waters of the well were believed to contain healing powers for the infirm. The tradition of Well Dressing was started and now occurs annually at the site of the well. Each year the well is dressed and blessed by the local vicar giving thanks for water and a blessing for the village.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust {{and author of the}} Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became [...] "the most {{important}} country house in Europe". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own [...] "little Foreign Office... the hub of resistance". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, [...] "I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, [...] "there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late".|$|E

2500|$|Relationship {{maintenance}} activities are {{a critical component}} to maintaining high quality relationships. [...] While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one {{may be in a}} skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted.

[...] As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Polymerization <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{place through}} either ionic and/or radical {{processes}} which are initiated by plasma formed from the glow discharge. The classic view presented by Yasuda [...] based upon thermal initiation of parylene polymerization [...] {{is that there}} are many propagating species present at any given time as shown in Figure 3. This figure shows two different pathways by which the polymerization may take place. The first pathway is a monofunctionalization process, bears resemblance to a standard free radical polymerization mechanism (M•)- although with the caveat that the reactive species may be ionic and not necessarily radical. The second pathway refers to a difunctional mechanism, which by example may contain a cationic and a radical propagating center on the same monomer (•M•). A consequence is that 'polymer' can grow in multiple directions by multiple pathways off one species, such as a surface or other monomer. This possibility let Yasuda to term the mechanism as a very rapid step-growth polymerization. In the diagram, Mx refers to the original monomer molecule or any of many dissociation products such as chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen. The M• species refers to those that are activated and capable of participating in reactions to form new covalent bonds. The •M• species refers to an activated difunctional monomer species. The subscripts i, j, and k show the sizes of the different species involved. Even though radicals represent the activated species, any ion or radical could be used in the polymerization. As can be seen here, plasma polymerization is a very complex process, with many parameters effecting everything from rate to chain length.|$|E
