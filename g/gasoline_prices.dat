5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High <b>gasoline</b> <b>prices</b> also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in <b>gasoline</b> <b>prices</b> since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Eesti Kiviõli and New Consolidated Gold Fields {{established}} the service station chain Trustivapaa Bensiini (now: Teboil) in Finland, which in 1940 sold more shale-oil-derived gasoline in Finland {{than did the}} entire conventional gasoline market in Estonia. Since 1935, Estonian shale oil has been supplied to the German Kriegsmarine as a ship fuel. In 1938, 45% of Estonian shale oil was exported, accounting for 8% of Estonia's total exports. Although {{the price of oil}} shale-based gasoline was at least triple that of global <b>gasoline</b> <b>prices,</b> high production and bilateral agreements with Germany facilitated its export. In 1939, Estonia produced 181,000tonnes of shale oil, including 22,500tonnes of oil that were suitable gasoline equivalents. The mining and oil industry employed 6,150 persons.|$|E
5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year of an accident while the government counts only traffic deaths occurring within 30 days of a crash. The National Safety Council's statistics show {{that the increase in}} 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low <b>gasoline</b> <b>prices,</b> and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the relative impacts of various factors in affecting ridership, to quantify their short-run and long-run effects, and to test the symmetry in ridership in response to rises and falls in <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> and transit fare. The {{results show that the}} effect of <b>gasoline</b> <b>price,</b> albeit small, is significant, extends over a year and mainly derives from its rise not fall. Fare is most influential both in terms of short-term and long-term elasticities and its effect is largely contributed by fare increases. The combination of these two results points to the policy of increasing <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> over decreasing transit fare to encourage ridership. On the relationship between service and fare, the results support the ‘demand follows supply’ hypothesis. The results also provide empirical evidence that ridership responds differentially between a rise and a fall in <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> or transit fare. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examined}} the long-run and short-run relationship between <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> and sectoral output in Nigeria {{for the period}} from 1980 to 2010. Six sectors (agriculture; manufacturing; building and construction; wholesale and retail; transportation and communication) of the economy were examined. The long run regression estimate showed that <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> is a significant determinant output in all sectors examined with exception to the building and construction sector while the short run error correction estimate revealed that only output of the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors of the Nigerian economy is affect by <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> increase in the short run.

40|$|Regular and {{frequent}} <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> cycles are being observed in many Australian and Canadian markets. What is driving these price cycles {{has been the}} subject of academic studies and government investigations. The existing explanations for these price cycles all rely on the presumption that drivers are intensively sensitive to <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> differentials at the station level. However, no empirical evidence exists in the literature to support this presumption. This paper provides the first piece of empirical evidence. This paper uses a unique price and quantity data set and novel instruments to estimate the station level gasoline demand in the cycling market of Perth, Australia. The elasticity estimates confirm that drivers in the Perth area are indeed very sensitive to <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> differentials. Copyright 2009 The Author.

30|$|Li et al. (2009) {{considered}} a supply contracting problem {{in which the}} buyer firm faces non-stationary stochastic price and demand. This study indicated that the selection of suppliers is particularly affected by price uncertainty. Moreover, Awudu and Zhang (2013) proposed a stochastic production planning model for a biofuel SC under demand and price uncertainties. Demands of end products are uncertain with known probability distributions, and the prices of end products follow geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Benders decomposition (BD) method with Monte Carlo simulation technique is applied to solve the proposed stochastic production planning model. In addition, Paul et al. (2014) developed an EOQ model for a coordinated two-level SC under energy (<b>gasoline)</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty and defective items in transshipment. The authors show that as the <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty increases, both the total cost and shipment size increase. So, this indicates that the <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> influences the SC coordination.|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} much {{interest}} in the future retail <b>price</b> of <b>gasoline</b> among consumers, industry analysts, and policymakers, {{it is widely believed}} that changes in the <b>price</b> of <b>gasoline</b> are essentially unforecastable given publicly available information.

Our key finding is that substantial reductions in the mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) of <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> forecasts are feasible in real time at horizons up to two years, as are substantial increases in directional accuracy. The most accurate individual model is a VAR(1) model for real retail gasoline and Brent crude oil prices. Even greater reductions in MSPEs are possible by constructing a pooled forecast that assigns equal weight to five of the most successful forecasting models. Pooled forecasts have lower MSPE than the EIA <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> forecasts and the <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> expectations in the Michigan Survey of Consumers.

40|$|The {{ability to}} model and perform {{decision}} making is an essential feature of many real-world applications including the forecasting of commodity prices. In this study, a forecasting model based on a relatively new Swarm Intelligence (SI) behaviour, namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), is developed for short term time series forecasting.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the first essay {{is to examine the}} impact of the voluntary environmental policy on technological innovation in household appliance firms. The key hypothesis is that firms participating in the ENERGY STAR program were more likely to innovate in response to the 1997 ENERGY STAR criteria update than firms that did not participate. Because participation in the voluntary environmental policy is not random, a time-varying instrument variable—a participation in the Green Light Program—is used to account for unobserved heterogeneity. NBER patent data from 1990 to 2003 related to the energy efficiency of household appliances is matched with COMPUSTAT to include firm-level financial information. A Poisson fixed effect model with an instrument variable estimator reveals significant evidence regarding the impact of ENERGY STAR on participating firms’ patents. The environmental innovation literature reveals a positive relationship between environmental policy and innovation. However, the impact of the domestic energy efficiency policy on foreign innovation is underexplored. Using global patent data from the European Patent Office World Patent Statistical Database, an identification comes from two quasi-experiments: the Top Runner Program in 1998 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We find strong evidence the domestic energy efficiency policy positively affects domestic patenting. In addition, the analysis provides strong evidence the domestic energy policy leads to technological advances in foreign patenting, especially by Japanese inventors. Moreover, we find strong evidence the domestic policy’s uncertainty negatively affects domestic light-emitting diode patenting, specifically among Japanese inventors. The third essay fills the gaps in cognitive process understanding of human behaviors between future <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> perception and the willingness to purchase hybrid vehicles. How consumers form future <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> beliefs and its impacts on decision making process in underexplored in literature. Using the monthly Michigan Survey of Consumers conducted in July 2008 to November 2008, we pool five cross sections and run a generalized linear model. We find statistically significant evidence that current and long-term future <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> perceptions affect the willingness to buy hybrid vehicles. This chapter also shows the long-term future <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> perceptions predict better than the short-term future <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> beliefs. Understanding the effect of <b>gasoline</b> <b>price</b> on the willingness to buy more fuel-efficient cars has an important policy implication for the gasoline tax and other economic incentives to internalize negative externalities.
