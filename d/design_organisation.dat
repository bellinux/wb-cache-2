2500|$|Considering {{the early}} cemeteries of Kent, most {{relevant}} finds come from furnished graves with distinctive {{links to the}} Continent. However, there are some unique items, these include pots and urns and especially brooches, {{an important element of}} female dress that functioned as a fastener, rather like a modern safety pin. The style of brooches (called Quoits), is unique to southern England in the fifth century AD, with the greatest concentration of such items occurring in Kent. Seiichi Suzuki defines the style through an analysis of its <b>design</b> <b>organisation,</b> and, by comparing it with near-contemporary styles in Britain and on the continent, identifying those features which make it unique. He suggests that the quoit brooch style was made and remade as {{part of the process of}} construction of new group identities during the political uncertainties of the time, and sets the development of the style in the context of the socio-cultural dynamics of an emergent post-Roman society. The brooch shows that culture was not just transposed from the continent, but from an early phase a new [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] culture was being developed.|$|E

40|$|Product and {{interaction}} designers are important beneficiaries of ergonomics research. The availability of ergonomics data, guidelines, models, methods, techniques and case studies {{which could be}} used during the design process is immense. Despite this, {{a review of the literature}} suggests that these resources are not exploited or effectively implemented within the design process due to cultural differences in design approach. However, implicit in the literature is the notion that designers have empathy and covert understanding of ergonomics principles. Two studies are described which investigate how far ergonomics methods pervade <b>design</b> <b>organisations.</b> The first study, a telephone survey, explores how and what type of current ergonomics principles are currently used in 48 commercial consulting organisations. The second study contrasts two <b>design</b> <b>organisations</b> to gain more detailed insights into how different design cultures can affect the adoption of ergonomics principles. Broad conclusions are drawn on what type of delivery mechanisms should be provided in order that the implementation of ergonomics principles is more effective...|$|R
