40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} a reliable control method to maintain the visual hue consistency of 2 ̆ 2 critical colors 2 ̆ 2 on a four-color lithographic press. The term 2 ̆ 2 critical colors 2 ̆ 2 indicates those colors which are deemed by the customer or pressman to be important for a particular job and will require special attention to maintain their hue consistency. It was hypothesized that a densitometer, which automatically computes <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness using the Preucil method, could be used to measure critical colors and maintain their computed hue consistency. In order to analyze the effect of the control method monitoring <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness, the press sheets controlled by this method (the experimental group) were compared with the press sheets controlled by the pressman 2 ̆ 7 s visual judgment only (the control group). Colors with different hue and halftone-dot sizes were chosen as critical colors for the experiment. During the production of the experimental group, the <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> values of critical colors were controlled to remain within an arbitrary tolerance of ± 4 -percent from the measured <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> values on the O. K. sheet, as indicated acceptable by a previous study. From the sample press sheets drawn from the experimental group and the control group, the <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness values of each critical color were analyzed by three ways: (1) by the comparisons of standard deviation and mean; (2) by F tests; and (3) by utilizing the GATF Color Triangle. The experimental results in the F tests indicated that in most cases there was no significant difference in the variances of the <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness values of the critical colors between the two groups. However, the comparisons of standard deviation and mean, and the GATF Color Triangles indicated that in most cases the <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness values of the experimental group varied less and remained closer to the measured values on the O. K. sheet than the control group. It was concluded that a densitometer could be used to measure and monitor the hue consistency of critical colors. However, the control method monitoring <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness was not always reliable, because of the inconsistency of the relationship between calculated <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness values and the visual appearance of colors. For this reason, further analysis of the experimental data was made for saturation and ink hue using the GATF Color Hexagon. It indicated that saturation and ink hue as calculated and plotted were better monitors to be used for hue consistency than <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness. However, there was still a problem that the same saturation and ink hue values may produce different colors. It was suggested that monitoring the three filter density readings of critical colors would be a more reliable control method to maintain the hue consistency of critical colors...|$|E
40|$|Paper surface {{efficiency}} (PSE) is {{a response}} resulting from the combination of paper gloss and oil absorptivity. A review of previous studies regarding the effect of paper surface efficiency on printed process color appearance is presented. This previous work related densitometric responses to PSE in terms of <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness. This current study investigated the PSE response in a similar manner, but densitometric responses were replaced by colorimetry. The colorimetric terms used were chroma (C*), huedifference (AH*), and lightness(L*). These correspond to <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness of the densitometric responses. Simple linear regression models relating the PSE and each response were constructed based on 13 kinds of paper printed with Hint cyan ink. The variable due to paper color was suppressed. The densitometric analysis generated results that verified Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s investigation. These found that as the PSE increased, <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness decreased. The colorimetric analysis indicated a large color difference in the cyan ink due to PSE difference between coated and uncoated papers. This difference was more than 10 AE units. The difference was mainly due to the differences in chroma (AC*) and lightness (AL*); however, {{there was a small}} amount of hue-difference (AH*). The linear relationships between PSE vs. C* and PSE vs. L* were established and the correlation coefficient (r) was calculated. This analysis found that the correlations were significant and were used to predict the colorimetric responses (C*, L*) of an ink when printed on papers having different PSE. The models generated with the Flint Inks were tested with 9 additional papers printed at RIT with cyan ink to confirm the results and usefulness of the predictions. This analysis suggested the same concept as the previous one that there is a significant linear correlation between PSE vs. C* and PSE vs. L*- The straight lines that were generated were not the same for the two groups of prints that were investigated. This thesis contributes a useful framework for evaluating color using colorimetry as a function of PSE. With additional study, colorimetric analysis could become a better method for evaluating color in printing than densitometry...|$|E
50|$|NTSC {{receivers}} have a {{tint control}} to perform colour correction manually. If {{this is not}} adjusted correctly, the colours may be faulty. The PAL standard automatically cancels <b>hue</b> <b>errors</b> by phase reversal, so a tint control is unnecessary yet Saturation control can be more useful. Chrominance phase errors in the PAL system are cancelled out using a 1H delay line resulting in lower saturation, which is much less noticeable to the eye than NTSC <b>hue</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a four-tube camera, {{there is a problem with}} {{colorimetry}} if the signal from the luminance tube is used in unmodified form to represent ‘Y’, because that signal is likely to be panchromatic, rather than having a characteristic similar to the luminance signal given by the equation above. Consequently, if the colour difference signals use this unmodified version of 'Y', the decoded colour display in the receiver will have saturation and <b>hue</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s some Japanese set {{manufacturers}} developed decoding systems {{to avoid paying}} royalties to Telefunken. The Telefunken license covered any decoding method that relied on the alternating subcarrier phase to reduce phase errors. This included very basic PAL decoders that relied on the human eye to average out the odd/even line phase errors. One solution was to use a 1H analog delay line to allow decoding of only the odd or even lines. For example, the chrominance on odd lines would be switched directly through to the decoder and also be stored in the delay line. Then, on even lines, the stored odd line would be decoded again. This method effectively converted PAL to NTSC. Such systems suffered <b>hue</b> <b>errors</b> and other problems inherent in NTSC and required {{the addition of a}} manual hue control.|$|R
40|$|Purpose:  To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} real and simulated age-related changes in crystalline lens yellowing on Farnsworth–Munsell (FM) 100 hue performance. Methods:  FM 100 hue total and partial error scores (PES) were measured {{in a group of}} younger (n = 10, mean age = 22. 2 ± 2. 65 years) and a group of older (n = 10, mean age = 54. 5 ± 2. 64 years) normal observers along with psychophysical estimates of crystalline lens optical density and pupil size. Three younger observers underwent repeated FM 100 hue testing under a variety of simulated age-related lens yellowing conditions, using filters with well-defined transmittance properties which attempted to mimic the real age-related lens yellowing changes of the older group. Results:  FM 100 hue total and PES were significantly higher in the older age group compared with the younger group (p < 0. 01). Lens density measures were significantly higher in the older age group compared with the young group (p < 0. 01), but showed less scatter than individual FM 100 <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> scores. Simulated lens yellowing in the three younger observers, equivalent to the level of that of the older observers, did not affect any of their FM 100 hue total or PES. Conclusions:  Simulation of age-related lens yellowing in younger observers has little effect on FM 100 <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> score. A variety of other factors such as pupil size, background illuminaton level, iris colour and macular pigment density may contribute to the age-related increase in FM 100 hue scores...|$|E

It is hypothesised that short term changes in blood glucose level affect visual pathway function in IDDM. METHODS [...] Colour discrimination was measured in 10 uncomplicated aretinopathic IDDM patients during hyperinsulinaemic clamp, with the Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test (100 hue test). After stable euglycaemia, patients were made hyperglycaemic (14 mmol/l), maintained euglycaemic (5 mmol/l), and rendered hypoglycaemic (2. 5 mmol/l), in random order, on separate occasions at least 1 week apart. RESULTS [...] Short term (1 - 2 hours) changes in blood glucose did not affect colour discrimination: mean (SD) 100 <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> score at 2. 5 mmol/l was 34 (22) compared with 35 (33) at 5 mmol/l, and 39 (28) at 14 mmol/l.

40|$|The slow {{progression}} of diabetic retinopathy {{makes it difficult}} to assess the effects of intervention therapy. There is thus a need for surrogate markers of visual change in diabetes. Colour vision tests and electroretinography (ERG) may be useful in this regard; yet little is known of their relative performance in the assessment of visual dysfunction in diabetes. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare colour discrimination (100 hue test) and ERG indices (oscillatory potentials (OP) and pattern ERG (PERG)) in the evaluation of aretinopathic IDDM patients. Colour discrimination was abnormal in 10 aretinopathic IDDM patients when compared with nine age matched controls; mean square root 100 <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> scores were 10. 38 (SD 2. 89) versus 4. 77 (1. 87) respectively, p < 0. 01. OP implicit times of the ERG were also abnormal; for example, for right eye, mean OP 1 implicit time for diabetics versus OP 1 implicit time for controls was 20. 1 (2. 0) versus 18. 6 (1. 4) ms, p = 0. 03. Comparison of the two techniques suggested that the 100 hue test was more sensitive and more specific than ERG OP implicit times in the detection of diabetic visual dysfunction in these patients...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of luminance on colour bleeding artefacts. Colour bleeding artefacts are the distortions due to sub sampling and quantisation of colour images during compression. Performance of the IrfanView ™ JPEG and JEG 2000 codecs were evaluated for colour reproduction under varying luminance levels. Authors argue that the luminance signal, Y influence the hue of a colour image. Six colour test patterns having same hue and step luminance values were designed and used to compress and reconstruct with the Irfanview ™ codecs. The luminance affects the hue of the reconstructed image differently for different hue values. The relationship cannot be generalised that increasing luminance values result in increasing <b>hue</b> <b>errors.</b> At some luminance values, hue did not show any errors. However, in general, with increasing compression ratio the colour bleeding due to the cross luminance effect increases. Based on the proposed methodology, the Irfanview ™ JPEG 2000 codec outperformed the JPEG codec for colour reproduction...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects on}} the image quality of CaCO 3, SiO 2, talc, and sericite on coated inkjet paper. The papers serve as dye sublimation transfer paper for printing on fabrics. The brightness, smoothness, and contact angle of the coated papers were evaluated. The papers were then printed with a textile color image evaluation test form, and the imprinted images were evaluated with respect to six criteria of the solid ink density, tone value increase, print contrast, ink trapping, grayness, and <b>hue</b> <b>error.</b> The overall printed image quality was correlated with the smoothness and brightness of the coated paper but showed no correlation with the contact angle. For single-pigment-coated papers, CaCO 3 produced paper with the best color difference performance and could be substituted for silica. On the other hand, SiO 2 {{was found to be}} suitable for blending with talc, calcium carbonate, and sericite, and its combination with these materials generally produced better image qualities than silica alone. Talc and sericite, when blended with silica as composite coating pigments, produced better printed image qualities than those as single-pigment-coated papers. The overall image quality ranking suggests that the best performance was achieved with CaCO 3 -, SiO 2 /talc-, CaCO 3 /SiO 2 -, SiO 2 /sericite-, and SiO 2 -coated papers...|$|E
40|$|Optical density (OD) of the {{crystalline}} lens {{has been shown}} in non-diabetics to increase linearly with age over the first five decades and at an increased rate thereafter; in insulin dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients, lens OD increases with age and with duration of diabetes at a rate similar to that in non-diabetics over the age of 60 years. Recently, it has been established that colour discrimination is abnormal in a majority of young patients with uncomplicated IDDM and angiographically normal retinas. Colour discrimination loss was attributed to functional abnormalities in the retina or neural pathways; yet the possibility exists that increases in lens OD may account for part or all of the colour discrimination loss in IDDM. In the present study, colour discrimination was compared in aretinopathic IDDM patients and age-matched controls, and then in a group of aretinopathic IDDM patients individually matched to controls with respect to lens OD. Colour discrimination was significantly worse in diabetic patients than in age-matched controls, and was significantly worse when diabetic patients were compared with controls matched for OD. The magnitude of the difference in 100 <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> score between diabetic patients and OD matched controls was, however, considerably less than the difference between diabetic patients and age-matched controls. These data suggest that colour discrimination loss in aretinopathic IDDM patients cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} diabetes induced increases in lens OD, but must involve abnormalities of the retina or its neural connections...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} random dot printing and conventional halftone printing with respect to color characteristics. Random dot printing is similar to continuous tone printing or very high frequency screen ruling and is capable of overcoming the limitatio of halftone printing. The randomly selected dots are achieved by the grain structure of the pre- sensitized printing plates. The advantages and the disadvantages of this process over conventional halftone printing process are discussed. The images and the test targets of both the processes were exposed to, and printed from a single plate for each process color so as to eliminate the ink and press variables. The experimental steps and the criteria for the plate exposure and processing have been discussed. The design of the flat {{and a copy of}} the reproduction are also included. For the purpose of objective evaluation of the color characteristics tone reproduction of both the processes and of each process color were studied. The <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> introduced by two different processes were measured. The proportionality of unwanted densities with the wanted density for each process color were derived and curves were plotted. Further, the attributes of colors, such as lightness or brightness, saturation and dominant wavelength (hue) were compared by plotting the chromaticity diagram (eIE 1931). The chromaticity diagrams were plotted for two different standard light sources and the results were discussed. For a better representation of the data an enlarged chromaticity diagram was used. The results may be interpreted to show that the random dot process allows a larger color gamut, produce brighter colors and shows less proportionality failure...|$|E

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that inherited red-green color deficiency, which involves both the protan and deutan deficiency types, is common in men. For red-green defective observers, some reddish colors appear desaturated and brownish, unlike those seen by normal observers. Despite its prevalence, few studies have investigated the effects that red-green color deficiency has on the psychological properties of colors (color emotions). The current study investigated the influence of red-green color deficiency on the following six color emotions: cleanliness, freshness, hardness, preference, warmth, and weight. Specifically, this study aimed to: (1) reveal differences between normal and red-green defective observers in rating patterns of six color emotions; (2) examine differences in color emotions related to the three cardinal channels in human color vision; and (3) explore relationships between color emotions and color naming behavior. Thirteen men and 10 women with normal vision and 13 men who were red-green defective performed both a color naming task and an emotion rating task with 32 colors from the Berkeley Color Project (BCP). Results revealed noticeable differences in the cleanliness and hardness ratings between the normal vision observers, particularly in women, and red-green defective observers, which appeared mainly for colors in the orange to cyan range, and in the preference and warmth ratings for colors with cyan and purple <b>hues.</b> Similarly, naming <b>errors</b> also mainly occurred in the cyan colors. A regression analysis that included the three cone-contrasts (i. e., red-green, blue-yellow, and luminance) as predictors significantly accounted for variability in color emotion ratings for the red-green defective observers {{as much as the}} normal individuals. Expressly, for warmth ratings, the weight of the red-green opponent channel was significantly lower in color defective observers than in normal participants. In addition, the analyses for individual warmth ratings in the red-green defective group revealed that luminance cone-contrast was a significant predictor in most red-green-defective individuals. Together, these results suggest that red-green defective observers tend to rely on the blue-yellow channel and luminance to compensate for the weak sensitivity of long- and medium-wavelength (L-M) cone-contrasts, when rating color warmth...|$|R
40|$|To analyze color {{errors and}} their {{sources in the}} color {{reproduction}} process, the reproduction is visually evaluated and compared visually with the original scene color scales and also with the original transparency viewed on a variable brightness illuminator (D 5000) with an opaque reflective white surround. Graphs (press plate curves, single color proofs and END of single color proofs) {{have been added to}} the Kodak tone-reproduction diagram (1960) to obtain more complete steps in the analysis of the tone-reproduction and the color balance. The GATF Evaluation Method of Ink Color is tested and the GARC colorimetric system, which is a modified Adam’s chromatic value system, is used to analyze colorimetric measurement. The slightly dark reproduction, the shift of the color balance to bluish cyan in the reproduction; the shift of hues, the magenta toward red, the cyan and the green toward blue; and the desaturation of the blue, the cyan and the yellow are discovered as errors in the reproduction. The possible improvements of these errors are discussed. The hope to combine the tone-reproduction analysis, the GATF Evaluation of Ink Color and the GARC colorimetric system into one system of analysis of the color errors is not fulfilled, because the mask percentages obtained from the Evaluation of Ink Color do not agree with that of the reproduction process and the <b>hue</b> <b>error</b> and grayness of the Evaluation of Ink Color do not correspond with the visual hue and the color saturation. However, the results of the colorimetric analysis, such as hue errors and the saturation of reproduced color, correspond quite well to the visual evaluation and the results of the tone-reproduction of the colorimetric analysis can be related to the reproduction process. It is concluded that great benefit is obtained by using the three systems; the subjective evaluation, the tone-reproduction analysis and the GARC colorimetric system for the analysis of the color reproduction process...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if there is a proper press sequence for a specific set of process inks on a specified type of paper. In the past, the literature on this subject has been of a qualitative and generalized nature. This study attempts to put the matter on a quantative basis under strict controls. A standard set of process proofing inks for web offset are chosen to be printed onto a coated type of offset paper by an IGT Printability Tester. Various techniques are devised for printing solid strips of the inks with minimum density variation across each strip and from strip to strip. The density range of each ink is found by employing various techniques devised by the manufacturer of the IGT, and by using mathematical formulas. The density of each ink is plotted against its ink quantity, as read by each of three filters on a densitometer: Green, Yellow and Blue. The GATF formulas for determining the color characteristics of process inks are then employed. The results are tables for each ink showing the theoretical density of each filter reading at specified ink quantities, with the GATF <b>Hue</b> <b>Error,</b> Grayness and Efficiency factors included for those ink quantities. These tables allow for the predicted result of any overprints at specified ink quantities by adding the density of each filter reading at the desired ink quantity of each ink. In order to be as accurate as possible, a special technique is devised to read both single and overprint densities of ink films printed on the IGT. Overprints are made using an IGT Printability Tester, and a densitometer to compare actual to predicted values. Under controlled trapping, all conditions are kept constant, but the sequence is reversed. The sequence that comes the closest to the predicted values is the preferred sequence. This is found to be: Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Although a preferred color sequence does exist for the set of inks used in this study, it is pointed out that a change in this sequence may help the overall result in certain cases...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to Organic Solvents (OS) {{used in the}} dry {{cleaning}} industry (DCI), {{has been found to}} be associated with neurotoxicity and changes in colour vision (CV) and contrast sensitivity (CS). The purpose of this thesis is to investigate whether the degree to which exposure to occupational levels of organic solvents (OS) in the {{dry cleaning}} industry is associated with neurotoxic symptoms and low and high level visual and cognitive functions. To address this issue a series of comprehensive studies were conducted to examine the impact of exposure to OS in both low level (contrast and colour vision) and high level visual functions (global motion, global form perception) also visual cognitive changes (visual search). The study was conducted in two populations in Colombia and Australia at risk of exposure to OS used in the DCI, but have different regulations for exposure. The range of duration of occupational exposure to OS of the participants was from 1 - 15 years. Control groups of people with community levels of exposure to OS used in DCI were also assessed in both countries (n= 35 each site). Visual function measures assessed were CS, CV using the Farnsworth 100 <b>Hue</b> <b>error</b> score, Visual Search (VS), Glass Pattern Perception (GPP) and Global Motion Perception (GMP). Neurotoxic symptoms were assessed using the World Health Organization recommended questionnaire, the Q 16, in its original form and a Likert scale modified version. Major results were that dry cleaners had poorer CS (extending to lower spatial frequencies than reported previously), hue discrimination, deficits in form and motion detection (decreased GPP and, GMS sensitivity) and higher Q 16 scores than non-dry cleaners (p< 0. 05) for both countries. Visual search was unaffected in drycleaners and non- drycleaners in both countries suggesting that OS used in the DCI affect lower order VF but not higher-level cognition. There was no beneficial effect of specific regulations to OS exposure to DCI. Within drycleaners, severity of neurotoxicity symptoms and deficits in both low and high level visual functions were unrelated to exposure durations experience by the sample suggesting that the effects occur even with short exposures. The low and high level visual function measures had greater sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between drycleaners exposed to OS used in the DCI and people with only community levels of exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{computers}} {{and their impact on}} the graphic arts and printing industry has, and will continue to, change the methodology of working and workflow in prepress operations. The conversion of analog materials (prints, artwork, transparencies, studio work) into a digital format requires the use of scanners or digital cameras, coupled with the knowledge of output requirements as related to client expectations. The chosen input sampling ratio (sampling rate in relation to halftone screening) impacts output quality, as well as many aspects of prepress workflow efficiency. The ability to predict printed results begins with the correct conversion of originals into digital information and then an appropriate conversion into the output materials for the intended press condition. This conversion of originals into digital information can be broken down into four general components. First, the image must be scanned {{to the size of the}} final output. Second, the input sampling ratio must be determined, in relation to the screening requirements of the job. This ratio should be appropriate to the needs of the printing condition for the final press sheet. Third, the highlight, highlight to midtone and shadow placement points must be determined in order to achieve the correct tone reproduction. Fourth, decisions must be made as to the image correction system to be employed in order to obtain consistent digital files from the scanner and prepress workflow. Factors relating to image correction and enhancement include such details as gray balance, color cast correction, dot gain, ink trapping, <b>hue</b> <b>error,</b> unsharp masking, all areas that impact quality. These are generally applied from within software packages that work with the scanner, or from within image manipulation software after the digital conversion is complete. The question of what is the necessary input sampling ratio for traditional AM screening has traditionally been based on the Nyquist Sampling Theorem. The basis for determining input sampling ratio requirements for frequency modulated (FM) screening is less clear. The Nyquist Theorem (originally from electrical engineering and communications research) has been applied to the graphic arts, leading to the general acceptance of a standard 2 : 1 ratio for most prepress scanning work. The ratio means that the sampling rate should be twice the screen frequency. This thesis set out to determine if there are dif ferences in input sampling ratio scanning requirements, based on the screen frequency rx selection (lOOlpi AM, 1751 pi AM and 21 |lFM used in this study), when generating films and/or plates for printing, that might question this interpretation of the Nyquist Sam pling Theorem as it relates to the graphic arts. Five images were tonally balanced over three different screening frequencies and six different sampling ratios. A reference image was generated for each condition using the Nyquist Sampling ratio of 2 : 1. Observers were then asked to rate the images in terms of quality against the standard. Statistical analysis was then applied to the data in order to observe interactions, similarities and differences. A pilot study was first run in order to determine the amount of unsharp masking to use on the images that would be manipulated in the main study. Seven images were pre sented from which four were selected for the final study. Thirty observers were asked for their preference on the amount of sharpening to use. It was found that for this condition (7 images) observers preferred the same amount of sharpening for the 1751 pi AM and 21 u FM screens, but slightly more sharpening for the lOOlpi AM screen. This information was then applied to the main study images. An additional image previously published was added after the pilot study, as it contained elements not found in the other images The unsharp masking applied to this image was the same as at the time of publication. The main study focused on the interaction of image type, screen frequency and varia tions of input scanner sampling ratios as it relates to output. The results indicated that image type, sampling ratio, sampling ratio - frequency interaction were factors, but fre quency alone was not. However, viewing the interaction chart of frequency and sampling ratio for the 1751 pi AM and 21 u FM screens alone, an insignificant difference was indi cated (at a 95 % confidence level). The conclusion can therefore be drawn that at the higher screen frequencies tested in this study, viewer observations showed that the input sampling ratios should be the same for 1751 pi and 21) 1 FM screens. Continuous tone orginals should be scanned at a sam pling ratio of 1. 75 : 1. This answered the question of whether FM screening technology can withstand a reduced input sampling ratio and maintain quality, which this study finds cannot. At the lower screen ruling of lOOlpi the input scanner sampling ratio requirement, based on viewer preferences of the five images presented, can be reduced to a 1. 5 : 1...|$|E
