The [...] "Apothecary's Rose", R. gallica varietas officinalis, was grown in the Middle Ages in monastic herbaria for its alleged medicinal properties, and became famous in English history as the Red <b>Rose</b> of Lancaster. <b>Gallicas</b> are shrubs that rarely grow over 4 feet (1.25 m) tall and flower once in Summer. Unlike most other once-blooming Old Garden <b>Roses,</b> <b>gallicas</b> include cultivars with flowers in hues of red, maroon, and purplish crimson. Examples include 'Cardinal de Richelieu', 'Charles de Mills', and 'Rosa Mundi' (R. gallica varietas versicolor).|$|R

(French <b>rose)</b> in the analysed grassland. Other aspects analysed here are its interrelation with different parameters of the vegetation as botanical composition, biodiversity and pastoral value. The vegetation data were collected using the linear point-quadrate method. The analysed permanent grassland has a relatively constant contri-bution of the species R. gallica L. in the vegetation sward. The grassland where it was developed this study was dominated by Festuca valesiaca Schleich. ex Gaudin and Filipendula vulgaris Moench., other species with important contributions being Achillea millefolium L., Plantago lanceolata L. and R. gallica L. The fertilisation and harvesting of the biomass hasn’t influenced the contribution of R. gallica L. during the six years of researches. Key words: fertilisation, floristic composition, grassland, Rosa gallica L., vegetatio...|$|R
