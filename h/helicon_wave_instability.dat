40|$|The {{problem of}} {{nonlinear}} Landau damping of <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> in dusty plasma in particular emphasis to {{the acceleration of}} soliton is presented here. This {{in the framework of}} a collisionless, anisotropic homogeneous dusty plasma in one dimension, can be well described by two coupled dynamical equations of the generalized Zakharov type, with one extra nonlocal term coming from Landau damping. Nonlinear-nonlocal term gives rise to essential contributions relative to the local term. Then under different conditions, kinetic nonlinear Schrödinger equation is constructed and nonlinear decrement is obtained for two cases. It is noticed that the time dependant term in the ponderomotive force plays a significant role for this kind of damping. Additionally, it is shown that nonlinear Landau damping leads to the amplitude modulation of dust <b>helicon</b> <b>waves,</b> further modulational <b>instability,</b> and maximal growth rate is obtained when the group velocity of the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> reaches the dust-acoustic speed. It is demonstrated that how the nonlinear Landau damping leads to the acceleration of soliton, which is eventually slowed down after transferring some of its energy to the wave. Emission of dust-acoustic wave by accelerated soliton is discussed briefly. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency {{discharges}} {{are performed}} in low magnetic fields (0 - 10 mT) using {{three types of}} helicon-wave exciting antennas with the azimuthal mode number of $|m|$ = 1. The most pronounced peak of plasma density is generated {{in the case of}} phased helical antenna at only a few mT, where the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> with $|m| = 1 $ is purely excited and propagates. An analysis based on the dispersion relation well explains the density-peak phenomenon in terms of the correspondence between the antenna one-wavelength and the helicon wavelength. The $m=+ 1 $ <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> propagates even in high magnetic fields where the density peaks are not observed, but the $m=- 1 $ <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> disappers. It is expected theoretically that the $m=- 1 $ <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> shows cutoff behavior in a low density region, [M. Kramer, Phys. Plasmas 6, 1052 (1999) ], and the cutoff of $m=- 1 $ <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> experimentally observed coincides with the calculated one.

In our theoretical model, the r. f. current {{distribution of the}} launching antenna is taken into account {{as well as the}} finite size of the plasma cylinder. Computational results based on the data of present-day helicon devices are shown. In particular, the efficiency of various types of antennae is studied {{for a wide range of}} experimental parameters. In particular, we discuss the role of magnetic field-aligned electron Landau damping for the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> absorption. In many cases, the numerical findings can reasonably be understood in terms of the wavenumber spectra of the antenna and the fast (<b>helicon)</b> <b>wave</b> dispersion relation.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> {{absorption}} and electron heating in a pulsed helicon discharge was examined. It was evidenced {{that the}} strong damping of the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> {{as well as}} the electron heating is closely related to the excitation of turbulent ion-sound fluctuations origi-nating from a parametric <b>instability.</b> The axial <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> damping was found to increase with the turbulence level of short-scale density fluctuations. The evolution of the fluctuations is related to the electron heating as shown by emission spectroscopy and compensated Lang-muir probe measurements. These findings prove {{for the first time that}} the anomalous RF power absorption {{as well as the}} electron heating in helicon discharges can be associated with the excitation of small-scale turbulent fluctuations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{generation}} of <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> for high density plasma sources {{is determined by}} the dispersion relation and plasma power balance. <b>Helicon</b> <b>wave</b> plasma sources inherently require an applied magnetic field of. 01 - 0. 1 T, an antenna properly designed to couple to the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> in the plasma, and an rf power source in the 10 - 100 s of MHz, depending on propellant choice. For a plasma thruster, particularly one with a high specific impulse (> 2000 s), the physics of the discharge would also have to address the use of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating and magnetic expansion. In all cases the system design includes an optimized magnetic field coil, plasma source chamber, and antenna. A preliminary analysis of such a system, calling on experimental data where applicable and calculations where required, has been initiated at Glenn Research Center.

40|$|Abstract. By using phased bifilar antennas, <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> {{have been}} excited by {{applying}} fields which rotate either in space or in time, or both simultaneously. The {{direction of rotation}} is made to favour either m =+ 1 orm=− 1 waves, where m is the azimuthal mode number, and m is measured directly. Rotation in time {{is found to be}} more effective than rotation in space and makes possible a direct comparison of m = ± 1 excitation. An m = − 1 structure was seen only in the antenna near field, while m = + 1 modes propagate far downstream. Up to 2 kW of RF power, density profiles and antenna loading measurements show that m < 0 (left-hand) waves are poorly coupled, and m = + 1 (right-hand) waves are necessary for good plasma production.

40|$|Abstract. Measurements of the radial and axial {{profiles}} {{of both the}} plasma parameters and the wave properties in a long, thin helicon discharge show {{that most of the}} RF power is deposited near the antenna and that a dense, cool (Te < 2 eV) plasma can be obtained in the downstream region. The density n and electron temperature Te profiles in that region can be explained quantitatively with classical collisional theory, and factor-of-two agreement can be obtained on total particle and energy balance. Spatial modulation of the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> amplitude {{can be explained by the}} beating of two different radial modes launched simultaneously by the antenna. Though the <b>helicon</b> <b>wave</b> can be shown to be essential to the production of high densities, it plays little role in the downstream evolution of the plasma.

40|$|The most {{efficient}} antennas for exciting <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> {{can be traced}} back to the so-called Nagoya Type III antenna. Its physical mechanism that couples radiofrequency (rf) energy to the plasma was explained by John Dawson in the 1970 s but has not been published in readily accessible journals. Helical and Boswell-type antennas are modifications of this antenna. In all cases it is the current elements parallel to the dc magnetic field (B-field, B 0) that are important: they create electrostatic fields (E-fields). Though whistler waves are purely electromagnetic, their confinement in a cylinder to form <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> causes them to be partly electrostatic. Computations of the E-fields in helicons are given to shown their importance. I.

40|$|The uncommonly high RF {{absorption}} {{efficiency of}} helicon discharges has been {{thought to be}} caused by Landau damping of <b>helicon</b> <b>waves</b> and the concomitant acceleration of primary electrons. By constructing an energy analyzer that accounts for RF fluctuations in plasma potential, it is shown that Landau-accelerated electrons are too sparse to explain the ionization effi-ciency. Instead, RF absorption and ionization are found to be consistent with the mechanism of mode coupling to Trivelpiece-Gould modes at the plasma boundary. Ever since Boswell 1 reported the high densities produced by helicon discharges, the reason for the efficiency of these discharges in converting RF power into plasma density has been a conundrum. In 1991, Chen 2 proposed the Landau damping hypothesis, in which electrons are accelerated by “surfing ” on the <b>helicon</b> <b>waves,</b> which have the proper phase velocity to bring electrons to the peak of the ionization cross section.
