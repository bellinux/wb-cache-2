50|$|The {{charge to}} be multiplied {{was applied to}} the first of these (plate A), which stood on an {{insulating}} post. A moveable insulated metal plate (B) was brought close to A (though not permitted to touch it), and then grounded. The charge on A caused charge separation on B due to electrostatic <b>induction.</b> <b>Plate</b> B was then moved away, breaking its earth connection. Since B was insulated, it acquired and retained a small charge opposite in sign to the charge on A. Plate B was transferred by means of an insulating rod to be brought into electrical contact with the third metal plate C which was insulated. Since both B and C were conducting, B would transfer a portion of its charge to C. To maximise the transferred charge, C was placed in close proximity to a final metal plate D, which was earthed.|$|E

The use of local drug delivery has been of added advantage over systemically given drugs, to date many local drug delivery vehicles were used which include drug incorporated Gels, resorbable microspheres etc but a very economical and effective drug delivery system was very much needed for wide spread use of this mode of drug delivery for treatment of periodontal infection, which happens to be the most prevalent cause of tooth loss. In this invitro study, the drug release patterns of two most economical and easily made resorbable base materials like sodium alginate and cellulose acetate strips incorporated with drugs most commonly used in treatment of Periodontitis like Metronidazole and Indomethacin (used as anti inflammatory agent) were evaluated, in salivary substitutes using spectrophotometer.

40|$|AbstractWe {{performed}} in vivo experiments in chick embryos that examined whether application of an exogenous source of Shh protein mimics {{the ability of}} the notochord to induce ectopic floor plate cells in the neural tube. Shh cannot act alone to induce a floor plate. However, coapplication of Shh and chordin, a BMP antagonist normally coexpressed with Shh in the notochord, results in a marked switch from dorsal to ventral cell fate, including a dramatic and widespread <b>induction</b> of floor <b>plate</b> cells. These data provide in vivo evidence that notochord-derived BMP antagonists may normally generate a permissive environment for the Shh-mediated <b>induction</b> of floor <b>plate.</b> Further experiments performed to address the source of BMPs that are inhibited by the action of chordin suggest that they derive specifically from the surface ectoderm and dorsal-most neuroepithelium. These data indicate that, at neural groove stages, dorsally derived BMPs affect ventral-most regions of the neural plate, suggesting a novel long-range action of BMPs.

Two experimentally useful criteria of myxospore induction are the conversion of vegetative rods to optically refractile short rods or ovoids {{and the development of}} resistance to sonic lysis. The use of optical refractility as the first morphological criterion of myxospore induction has facilitated an analysis of <b>induction</b> on developmental <b>plates.</b> The time-dependent changes in the cell population from vegetative rods to the final products of development, autolysed cells and myxospores, were determined in liquid suspension by interrupting cells from developmental plates before the first appearance of myxospores. The treatment of cells involved a two-step induction system. The cells were first aerated in buffer at 32 degrees C (preinduction) and then aerated in 1 % tryptone (Difco) at 32 degrees C (<b>induction).</b> At early <b>plate</b> times (0 to 18 h) there was little or no response to these treatments. After 18 h, many of the cells undergoing development on plates responded to preinduction in buffer by subsequent induction to myxospores in tryptone medium (intermediate cells). After 32 h, cells induced to myxospores in tryptone medium and did not require preinduction (competent cells). After 36 h, cells begin to undergo differentiation to myxospores on plates. These results indicate that there was a sequence of physiological changes in developing cells that are defined by the differential response of cells to treatment in liquid suspension.

In vertebrates little is yet known on the patterns of PCD and its role during the early phases of development, when embryonic tissue layers migrate and pattern formation takes place. We describe the spatio-temporal patterns of cell death during earlyXenopusdevelopment, from fertilization to the tadpole stage (stage 35 / 36). Cell death was analyzed by a whole-mountin situDNA end-labeling technique (the TUNEL protocol), as well as by serial sections of paraffin-embedded TUNEL-stained embryos. The first cell death was detected during gastrulation, and as development progressed followed highly dynamic and reproducible patterns, strongly suggesting it is an important component of development at these stages.

5000|$|Induction of {{the floor}} plate during {{embryogenesis}} of vertebrate embryos has been studied extensively in chick and zebrafish and {{occurs as a result}} of a complex signaling network among tissues, the details of which have yet to be fully refined. Currently there are several competing lines of thought. First, floor plate differentiation may be mediated by inductive signaling from the underlying notochord, an axial mesoderm derived signaling structure. This is supported experimentally in chick, in which floor <b>plate</b> <b>induction,</b> as well as associative ventral nervous tissue differentiation, is mediated by the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is expressed in a gradient with highest concentration localized in the notochord and floor plate. In vitro tissue grafting experiments show that removal of this molecule prevents differentiation {{of the floor}} plate, whereas its ectopic expression induces differentiation of floor plate cells. [...] An alternative view proposes that neural tube floor plate cells stem from precursor cells which migrate directly from axial mesoderm. Through chick - quail hybrid experiments as well as genetic interaction experiments in zebrafish, it appears that notochord and floor plate cells originate from a common precursor. Furthermore, in zebrafish, Nodal signaling is required for differentiation of medial floor plate cells whereas Shh is expendable. These data may indicate that the floor <b>plate</b> <b>induction</b> mechanism in amniotes and anamniotes differs. [...] To reconcile these differences, a dual-mode induction model has been proposed in chick. In this model, exclusively ectodermal cells are induced to become medial floor plate during gastrulation by prechordal mesoderm, possibly through Nodal signaling. Later in development during neurulation, extended contact and interaction between notochord and fated floor plate cells causes differentiation, suggesting a cooperative effect between Nodal and Shh signaling.|$|R

When isolated whole or ventral, but not lateral, neural plate fragments from stage 9 embryos were cultured for 4 days in collagen gels, floor plate and neural markers were observed. Our results suggest that floor plate and motor neurons can form in a delayed fashion in vivo after notochord ablation and in vitro from isolated neural plates.

Several lines of evidence indicate that Shh is involved in floor <b>plate</b> <b>induction,</b> somite patterning, and regulation of anterior-posterior polarity in the vertebrate limb. In this report, we investigate the biochemical behavior of Shh {{in a variety of}} expression systems and embryonic tissues. Expression of mouse Shh in Xenopus oocytes, COS cells, and baculovirus-infected insect cells demonstrates that in addition to signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation, chicken and mouse Shh proteins undergo additional proteolytic processing to yield two peptides with molecular masses of approximately 19 kDa (amino terminus) and 27 kDa (carboxy terminus), both of which are secreted. In transfected COS cells, we show that the 19 -kDa peptide does not accumulate significantly in the medium unless heparin or suramin is added, suggesting that this peptide associates with the cell surface or extracellular matrix. This retention appears to depend on sequences in the carboxy-terminal part of the peptide. Finally, detection of the 19 -kDa product in a variety of mouse and chicken embryonic tissues demonstrates that the proteolytic processing observed in cell culture is a normal aspect of Shh processing in embryonic development. These results raise the possibility that amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Shh may have distinct functions in regulating cell-cell interactions in the vertebrate embryo...|$|R
