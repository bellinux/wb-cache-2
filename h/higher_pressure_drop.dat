The chemical variations of the crude oil have a large impact on the viscosity of crude oil, ranging from 0.1 to 100  Pa s which could result in non-Newtonian behaviors (Nunez et al. 1991; Ghannam and Esmail 2006).

In the early gas reservoir development, when the BHP is higher, the <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is, the greater gas flow rate is, the bigger rate of sulfur deposition is, and the more obvious decrease in water breakthrough time is.

Measured parameters included system airflow, fan power draw, outdoor unit power draw, cooling capacity, pressure drops across filters and coils, and duct leakage.

40|$|Microreaction {{technology}} was conceived, {{thanks to the}} advances on microfabrication by the semiconductor industry. The �first applications of microchannels used for performing reactions {{date back to the}} early nineties. Since then, many conferences dedicated to this topic are held worldwide such as the International Microreaction Technology Conference (IMRET) or the International Conference on Microchannels and Minichannels. The small dimensions of the microchannels lead to very high heat and mass transfer rates, reactions are therefore performed very efficiently on these devices. However, the small dimensions of the channels lead to <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drops.</b> In addition, microchannels are very susceptible to clogging. This thesis studies the e�ffect of di�fferent microchannel configurations in terms of mixing, mass transfer, residence time distribution and reaction.

Numerical {{analysis}} by using Fluent ® {{has been carried}} out to investigate the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> of single phase flow in a 2 meter long of rifled tube and smooth tube which is placed horizontally. The rifled tube or also known as spiral internally ribbed tube that is used in this investigation has an outside diameter 45. 0 mm and inside equivalent diameter 1 of 33. 1 mm while the smooth tube has an outside diameter 45. 0 mm and inside diameter 34. 1 mm.
