Pre-payments can be returned in part, or in full, {{where it is}} deemed [...] "just to do so having regard to all the circumstances."

However, such a provision differs from the previous system of reimbursement established in Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd, where pre-payments could only be recovered where {{that had been a}} total lack of consideration. With regard to the second situation, any financial obligation due (as in Chandler v Webster) is excused, subject to where expenses have been incurred by the payee. In this instance, the courts may award an amount up to what was payable prior to the frustrating event. Gamerco SA v ICM/Fair Warning (Agency) Ltd demonstrates the application of this section.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of a {{contract}} of events and circumstances which occurred after the contract was entered into. The study principally examines the application of the English doctrine of frustration with comparative reference to the law applicable in Saudi Arabia. The main objective is to analyse how the English doctrine and its Saudi equivalents can provide an excuse or defence in circumstances where a party is prevented from performing contractual obligations. The study proceeds as follows. First, the doctrine of frustration is described {{in the context of a}} general overview of how a contract might be discharged. The historical development of the doctrine of frustration is then outlined together with its limitation and justifications. The application of the doctrine is then discussed in the most likely circumstances where it would be applied. The next step is to consider the central issue of commercial hardship, specifically whether it is recognised in English and also in Saudi law. Then remedies available when a contract has been frustrated are examined as well as the functionally equivalent rights and liabilities arising under the <b>frustrated</b> <b>contract.</b> The evidence presented to this point is then discussed in relation to the use of force majeure clauses and in particular their relationship with the doctrine of frustration. The study concludes that, while the English doctrine of frustration has witnessed significant developments, since it emerged as a departure from the rule of strict liability, it is still applied within a very narrow remit. Thus, the best way for contracting parties to deal with supervening events is by providing for force majeure clauses. The practical consequence of this is that where reliance upon these clauses becomes increasingly significant, with a consequent lessening of the importance of the ‘default’ rule of the doctrine of frustration. In Saudi Arabia, contract law is heavily reliant on Islamic jurisprudence, which does not have a general theory of impossibility. Instead, the concept of impossibility is drawn from scattered statements and applications in the jurisprudence, which appear broader and so perhaps less rigid than the English doctrine of frustration...|$|E

50|$|Mr Hunt owned an oil {{concession}} in Libya. He {{contracted with}} BP {{to exploit the}} oil. The contract said (1) Hunt would transfer BP half the concession (2) BP would transfer Hunt 'farm in' contributions in cash and oil (3) BP would explore for and develop the oil (4) BP provided all funds until the oil was found, and (5) the profits would be shared, but 3/8 of Hunt's share would go to BP until 125% of the farm in contributions and half the costs of BP were covered. A massive oil reserve was found in 1967. However, in 1971 the Libyan government was overthrown and replaced by Muammar Gaddafi. It took over BP's half share. BP had already covered half its costs.

Lord Reid explained the distinction between a contract becoming more onerous, and being of a different kind: ...|$|R
5000|$|Under the English common law, {{contractual}} obligations were deemed sacrosanct, so failure to honour a contract {{could lead to}} an order for specific performance or internment in a debtor's prison. In 1863, this harsh rule was softened by the case of Taylor v Caldwell which introduced the doctrine of frustration of contract, which provided that [...] "where a contract becomes impossible to perform and neither party is at fault, both parties may be excused their obligations". In this case, a music hall was burned down by Act of God before a contract of hire could be fulfilled, and the court deemed the <b>contract</b> <b>frustrated.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Early {{common law}} cases held that {{performance}} of a contract always had to take place. No matter what hardship was encountered contracting parties had absolute liability on their obligations. In the 19th century the courts developed a doctrine that contracts which became impossible to perform would be frustrated and automatically come to an end. In Taylor v Caldwell Blackburn J held that when the Surrey Gardens Music Hall unexpectedly burnt down, the owners did not have to pay compensation to the business that had leased it for an extravagant performance, because it was neither party's fault. An assumption underlying all contracts (a [...] "condition precedent") is that they are possible to perform. People would not ordinarily contract to do something they knew was going to be impossible. Apart from physical impossibility, frustration could be down to a contract becoming illegal to perform, for instance if war breaks out and the government bans trade to a belligerent country, or perhaps if the whole purpose of an agreement is destroyed by another event, like renting a room to watch a cancelled coronation parade. But a <b>contract</b> is not <b>frustrated</b> merely because a subsequent event makes the agreement harder to perform than expected, as for instance in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC where a builder unfortunately had to spend more time and money doing a job than he would be paid for because of an unforeseen shortage of labour and supplies. The House of Lords denied his claim for contract to be declared frustrated so he could claim quantum meruit. Because the doctrine of frustration is a matter of construction of the contract, it can be contracted around, through what are called [...] "force majeure" [...] clauses. Similarly, a contract can have a force majeure clause that would bring a contract to an end more easily than would common law construction. In The Super Servant Two Wijsmuller BV contracted to hire out a self-propelling barge to J. Lauritzen A/S, who wanted to tow another ship from Japan to Rotterdam, but had a provision stating the contract would terminate if some event made it difficult related to the 'perils or dangers and accidents of the sea'. Wijsmuller BV also had a choice of whether to provide either The Superservant One or Two. They chose Two and it sank. The Court of Appeal held that the impossibility to perform the agreement was down to Wijsmuller's own choice, and so it was not frustrated, but that the force majeure clause did cover it. The effect of a <b>contract</b> being <b>frustrated</b> is that it is that both parties are prospectively discharged from performing their side of the bargain. If one side has already paid money over or conferred another valuable benefit, but not got anything in return yet, contrary to the prior common law position, the Law Reform (<b>Frustrated</b> <b>Contracts)</b> Act 1943 gives the court discretion to let the claimant recover a 'just sum', and that means whatever the court thinks fit in all the circumstances.|$|R
