25|$|The {{executive}} board approved the SDDS and GDDS in 1996 and 1997 respectively, and subsequent amendments {{were published in}} a revised Guide to the <b>General</b> <b>Data</b> Dissemination System.

25|$|In 1995 the International Monetary Fund {{began work}} on data {{dissemination}} standards with the view of guiding IMF member countries to disseminate their economic and financial data to the public. The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination standards and they were split into two tiers: The <b>General</b> <b>Data</b> Dissemination System (GDDS) and the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> was sued (under the Sherman and Clayton {{antitrust}} acts) by competitors for their practice of bundling RDOS with the <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> Nova or Eclipse minicomputer. When <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> introduced the <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> Nova, {{a company called}} Digidyne wanted to use its RDOS operating system on its own hardware clone. <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> refused to license their software and claimed their [...] "bundling rights". The US Supreme Court set a precedent called Digidyne v. <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> in 1985, and the Supreme Court let a 9th circuit decision stand, and <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> was eventually forced into licensing the operating system because it was ruled that restricting the license to only DG hardware was an illegal tying arrangement.|$|R
25|$|While {{the figures}} of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy {{remained}} commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, {{partly as a result}} of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. Francis Amasa Walker, Superintendent of the 1870 Census, used census and Surgeon <b>General</b> <b>data</b> to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 Census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final step}} of {{knowledge}} discovery from data is {{to verify that}} the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the <b>general</b> <b>data</b> set. This is called overfitting. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish [...] "spam" [...] from [...] "legitimate" [...] emails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would {{be applied to the}} test set of e-mails on which it had not been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as ROC curves.|$|E
60|$|We shall lose {{ourselves}} in mere hypothesis unless we return in some degree to first principles, and, whenever we can, to such statistics as there are. It {{is certain that}} an annual payment can only be made by Germany over a series of years by diminishing her imports and increasing her exports, thus enlarging the balance in her favor which is available for effecting payments abroad. Germany can pay in the long-run in goods, and in goods only, whether these goods are furnished direct to the Allies, or whether they are sold to neutrals and the neutral credits so arising are then made over to the Allies. The most solid basis for estimating {{the extent to which}} this process can be carried is to be found, therefore, in an analysis of her trade returns before the war. Only on the basis of such an analysis, supplemented by some <b>general</b> <b>data</b> as to the aggregate wealth-producing capacity of the country, can a rational guess be made as to the maximum degree to which the exports of Germany could be brought to exceed her imports.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>General</b> also {{encountered}} {{legal problems}} related to bundling although in this case, {{it was due to}} a civil suit from a would-be competitor. When <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> introduced the <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> Nova, a company called Digidyne wanted to use its RDOS operating system on its own hardware clone. <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> refused to license their software and claimed their [...] "bundling rights". The US Supreme Court set a precedent called Digidyne v. <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> in 1985 by letting a 9th circuit appeal court decision on the case stand, and <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> was eventually forced into licensing the operating system because it was ruled that restricting the license to only DG hardware was an illegal tying arrangement. Even though the District Court noted that [...] "no reasonable juror could find that within this large and dynamic market with much larger competitors", <b>Data</b> <b>General</b> [...] "had the market power to restrain trade through an illegal tie-in arrangement", the tying of the operating system to the hardware was ruled as per se illegal on appeal.|$|R
