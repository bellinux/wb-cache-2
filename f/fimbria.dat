All primates have a plica sublingualis, and the <b>fimbria</b> linguae (plica fimbriata) found under the tongue of apes may be a vestigial version, although that is still disputed. The structure and appearance of the sublingua, frenal lamella, lingual frenulum, and other sublingual tissue vary greatly between primates, and as a result, their terminology is often confused.|$|E

The P <b>fimbriae</b> were morphologically similar to type 1 <b>fimbriae.</b> The purified P <b>fimbriae</b> agglutinated neuraminidase-treated human P 1 and P 2 k erythrocytes but not p erythrocytes, which lack all P-blood group-specific glycosphingolipids. However, coating of neuraminidase-treated p erythrocytes with globoside rendered such erythrocytes agglutinable by the P <b>fimbriae.</b> The hemagglutinations were in all instances fully inhibited by the synthetic alpha-D-Galp-(1 - 4) -beta-D-Galp- 1 -O-Me glycoside. The binding specificity of the P <b>fimbriae</b> {{could also be}} demonstrated by using <b>fimbriae</b> coated onto latex particles and nontreated erythrocytes. It was thus concluded that the P <b>fimbriae</b> recognize and bind to the alpha-D-Galp-(1 - 4) -beta-D-Galp carbohydrate sequence occurring in the series of P-blood group antigen-specific glycosphingolipids. In contrast to both type 1 <b>fimbriae,</b> all four P <b>fimbriae</b> preparations showed multiple bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The S <b>fimbriae</b> were morphologically {{identical to}} type 1 and P <b>fimbriae</b> of E. coli and showed a hemagglutination that was abolished when erythrocytes {{were treated with}} neuraminidase. Hemagglutination by the purified <b>fimbriae</b> was inhibited by orosomucoid but not by its desialylated derivative. Of the oligosaccharides tested, sialyl-(alpha 2 - 3) -lactose and sialyl-(alpha 2 - 3) -N-acetyllactosamine had the strongest inhibitory activities. It was concluded that S <b>fimbriae</b> have the strongest affinity for (alpha 2 - 3) -linked sialyl galactosides.

2500|$|Other {{biological}} {{examples of}} a catch bond mechanism is seen in bacteria that tightly cling to urinary tract walls in response to high fluid velocities and large shear forces exerted on the cells and bacteria with adhesive tips of <b>fimbria.</b> [...] Schematic mechanisms of how increased shear force is proposed to cause stronger binding interactions between bacteria and target cells show that the catch bond acts very similar to a Chinese finger trap. For a catch-bond, the force on the cell pulls the adhesive tip of a <b>fimbria</b> to close tighter on its target cell. As {{the strength of the}} forces increases, the stronger the bond between the <b>fimbria</b> and the cell-receptor {{on the surface of the}} target cell. For a cryptic-bond, the force causes the <b>fimbria</b> to swivel toward the target cell and have more binding sites able to attach to the target cell ligands, mainly sugar molecules.

Hydrophobic amino acids comprised 33. 6 % of all amino acids in the fimbrillin, which lacked cystine, phenylalanine, and arginine. Serologically, the type 3 <b>fimbriae</b> were also distinct from the type 1 <b>fimbriae.</b> Purified type 3 <b>fimbriae</b> agglutinated tannin-treated human blood group O erythrocytes; this confirms the role of type 3 <b>fimbriae</b> as hemagglutinins.

2500|$|The Roman {{response}} to this was immediate and Mithridates was defeated in 85 B.C. by Sulla and pushed out of Greece the following year in the First Mithridatic War. Kohn challenges this assertion slightly, suggesting that a Roman General, <b>Fimbria,</b> had defeated Mithridates in 84 B.C. while Sulla and his army defeated the Greeks, who had allied themselves with Mithridates, in 85 B.C. A few years later a Roman General Murena invaded Mithridate's land, sparking the Second Mithridatic War, in the Kizil Irmak River area. Mithridates emerged victorious in this encounter around 82 B.C. During the 70s B.C. Mithridates came to further blows with Rome now against the Roman General Lucullus who [...] forced Mithridates out of Pontus. Mithridates was now forced to flee to Armenia where he sought refuge with his son-in-law, King Tigranes I [...] "the Great" [...] of Armenia, who after refusing to surrender to the Romans was also be invaded by Lucullus and his army. Tigranocerta fell to the Romans during this campaign after a battle {{in the autumn of}} 69 B.C., the following year Lucullus attempted to continue the subjugation of Armenia, however, his army was unprepared for the mountainous region and climate. A second battle occurred at Artaxata in 68 B.C. where Mithridates was again be defeated. Despite this Lucullus and his army was forced to retreat to the Euphrates Valley. In 66 B.C., Lucullus was recalled to Rome and Pompey took over the command. Armenia was subdued the same year. Finally in 64-63 B.C., Pompey pushed Mithridates into the Crimean peninsula where he committed suicide ending the Third Mithridatic War.|$|E
6000|$|Turning now to Moths: most {{of these}} rest {{motionless}} with their wings depressed during the whole or greater part of the day; and the upper surfaces of their wings are often shaded and coloured in an admirable manner, as Mr. Wallace has remarked, for escaping detection. With most of the Bombycidæ and Noctuidæ,[508] when at rest, the front-wings overlap and conceal the hind-wings; so that the latter might be brightly coloured without much risk; and they are thus coloured in many species of both families. During the act of flight, moths would often be able to escape from their enemies; nevertheless, as the hind-wings are then fully exposed to view, their bright colours must generally have been acquired {{at the cost of}} some little risk. But the following fact shews us how cautious we ought to be in drawing conclusions on this head. The common yellow under-wings (Triphaena) often fly about during the day or early evening, and are then conspicuous from the colour of their hind-wings. It would naturally be thought {{that this would be a}} source of danger; but Mr. J. Jenner Weir believes that it actually serves them as a means of escape, for birds strike at these brightly coloured and fragile surfaces, instead of at the body. For instance, Mr. Weir turned into his aviary a vigorous specimen of Triphaena pronuba, which was instantly pursued by a robin; but the bird’s attention being caught by the coloured wings, the moth was not captured until after about fifty attempts, and small portions of the wings were repeatedly broken off. He tried the same experiment, in the open air, with a T. <b>fimbria</b> and swallow; but the large size of this moth probably interfered with its capture.[509] We are thus reminded of a statement made by Mr. Wallace,[510] namely, that in the Brazilian forests and Malayan islands, many common and highly-decorated butterflies are weak flyers, though furnished with a broad expanse of wings; and they “are often captured with pierced and broken wings, as if they had been seized by birds, from which they had escaped: if the wings had been much smaller in proportion to the body, it seems probable that the insect would more frequently have been struck or pierced in a vital part, and thus the increased expanse of the wings may have been indirectly beneficial.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Fimbriectomy {{is a very}} {{uncommon}} type of {{tubal ligation}} that is performed by removing the end (<b>fimbria)</b> of the fallopian tube leaving only the tubal segment attached to the uterus. After fimbriectomy, if the remaining tubal segment is long enough, {{the end of the}} tube can be opened and 'new' <b>fimbria</b> can be created by a procedure called a neofimbrioplasty. These [...] "new" [...] <b>fimbria</b> are not actually <b>fimbria,</b> but they are the cilia from the inside of the fallopian tube that have been exposed by everting the tubal lumen much like the petals of a rose are exposed once the rose blooms. These 'new' <b>fimbria</b> are much less effective at collecting (catching) an egg that has been released from the ovary than the real <b>fimbria</b> that had been removed during the fimbriectomy performed by the surgeon who did the original tubal ligation. During a neofimbrioplasty the tubal end is opened and folded back (marsupialized) so that the tubal end remains open and exposing the internal lining of the tube.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} as this army crossed the Hellespont while giving chase to Mithridates' forces, <b>Fimbria</b> {{seems to have}} started a {{rebellion}} against Flaccus. While seemingly minor enough to not cause immediate repercussions in the field, <b>Fimbria</b> was relieved of his duty and ordered back to Rome. The return trip included {{a stop at the}} port city of Byzantium, however, and here <b>Fimbria</b> took command of the garrison, rather than continue home. Flaccus, hearing of this, marched his army to Byzantium {{to put a stop to}} the rebellion, but walked right into his own undoing. The army preferred <b>Fimbria</b> (not surprising considering his leniency in regard to plunder) and a general revolt ensued. Flaccus attempted to flee, but was captured shortly after and the Consular commander was executed. With Flaccus out of the way, <b>Fimbria</b> took complete command.|$|E
40|$|Four {{strains of}} diarrheagenic Escherichia coli {{originally}} isolated from distinct geographic regions {{were found to}} produce unusual thin aggregative <b>fimbriae</b> requiring depolymerization in formic acid prior to analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoelectron microscopy of native <b>fimbriae</b> and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of the corresponding 18 -kDa fimbrins showed that these E. coli <b>fimbriae</b> were serologically cross-reactive with SEF 17 (Salmonella enteritidis <b>fimbriae</b> with a fimbrin molecular mass of 17 kDa). The E. coli and S. enteritidis fimbrins had similar total amino acid compositions and highly conserved N-terminal amino acid sequences. These results indicate that E. coli and S. enteritidis produce biochemically related, aggregative <b>fimbriae</b> which constitute {{a new type of}} intergenerically distributed <b>fimbriae</b> for which we propose the descriptive name GVVPQ <b>fimbriae</b> {{on the basis of the}} conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence...|$|R
40|$|Salivary proline-rich {{proteins}} (PRPs), {{which were}} purified from parotid saliva, were adsorbed onto 15 -nm-diameter gold particles to visualize specific binding of the salivary molecules to Actinomyces viscosus type 1 <b>fimbriae.</b> Negatively stained preparations incubated with PRP-gold conjugates but not bovine serum albumin-gold complexes bound specifically to bacteria possessing type 1 <b>fimbriae,</b> A. viscosus T 14 V-J 1 and 5519. Binding of the PRP-gold probes to strains deficient in type 1 <b>fimbriae,</b> i. e., strains 5951 (type 2 <b>fimbriae</b> only) and 147 (no <b>fimbriae),</b> was negligible...|$|R
40|$|Porphyromonas gingivalis W 50 (ATCC 53978) {{possesses}} {{the gene for}} fimbriae; however, the surface-expressed <b>fimbriae</b> are sparse and have not been previously isolated and characterized. We purified <b>fimbriae</b> from strain W 50 to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography [H. T. Sojar, N. Hamada, and R. J. Genco, Protein Expr. Purif. 9 (1) : 49 - 52, 1997]. Negative staining of purified <b>fimbriae</b> viewed by electron microscopy revealed that the <b>fimbriae</b> were identical in diameter to <b>fimbriae</b> of other P. gingivalis strains, such as 2561, but were shorter in length. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, the apparent molecular weight of isolated fimbrillin from strain W 50 {{was found to be}} identical to that of the fimbrillin molecule of strain 2561. Unlike 2561 <b>fimbriae,</b> W 50 <b>fimbriae,</b> under reducing condition, exhibited a monomeric structure on SDS-PAGE at room temperature. However, under nonreduced conditions, even at 100 degrees C, no monomer was observed. In immunoblot analysis as well as immunogold labeling of isolated <b>fimbriae,</b> polyclonal antibodies against 2561 <b>fimbriae,</b> as well as antibodies against peptide I (V-V-M-A-N-T-G-A-M-E-V-G-K-T-L-A-E-V-K-Cys) and peptide J (A-L-T-T-E-L-T-A-E-N-Q-E-A-A-G-L-I-M-T-A-E-P-Cys), reacted. However, antifimbrial antibodies against strain 2561 reacted very weakly compared to anti-peptide I and anti-peptide J. Negative staining of whole W 50 cells, as well as immunogold electron microscopy with anti-peptide I and anti-peptide J, showed <b>fimbriae</b> shorter in length and very few in number compared to those of strain 2561. Purified <b>fimbriae</b> showed no hemagglutinating activity. Amino acid composition was very similar to that of previously reported <b>fimbriae</b> of the 2561 strain...|$|R
