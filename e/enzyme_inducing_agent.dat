Up to that time half-life was well recognized in terms of basic chemical principles as an appropriate measure of the rate of elimination and reflective of changes in the rate of elimination. The difference between chemistry and pharmacokinetics, however, is that in chemistry the volume in which the reaction occurs does not change. In contrast, in pharmacokinetics, disease states and differences in physiology can change the space available in which the drug may distribute in the body. Thus, it was necessary to develop a pharmacokinetic measure of volume that was independent of elimination, i. e., Vss. Now, the relationship between Vss and clearance led to a unique measure of time of drug in the body, the mean residence time. Although this parameter is calculated in all PK programs, very few pharmaceutical scientists know how it can be useful. Very recently, we have shown that the concepts of accumulation, prediction of which is the clinically relevant use for half-life and mean residence time, are flawed and that the appropriate time dependent parameter to predict accumulation has not been previously correctly identified. Finally, when clearance concepts were developed our understanding of the importance of drug transporters was nonexistent. A critical, and generally unrecognized assumption (which is only explicitly stated in Professor Rowland’s seminal 1973 paper), {{in the development of the}} theory of clearance is that the unbound drug concentration in the organ of elimination is in a constant equilibrium with the unbound drug concentration in the systemic circulation, where drug concentration measurements are made. Transporter drug–drug and disease interactions may, in fact, change this equilibrium and potentially what we consider as intrinsic clearance, may not be independent of an eliminating organ volume parameter, contrary to what we have been teaching for the past 37  years...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{study of}} the effects of glutethimide on antipyrine metabolism was performed to ascertain how patients with varying degrees of liver damage responded to microsomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducing</b> <b>agents.</b> The administration of 250 mg glutethimide daily for one week resulted in significant enhancement of antipyrine metabolism in 4 patients with compensated cirrhosis and 5 patients with features of hepatic failure as well as 7 control subjects without liver disease. Even patients with very severe liver disease did undergo microsomal enzyme induction. Changes in antipyrine half-life after glutethimide were directly proportional to the original antipyrine half-life so that the greatest absolute alterations due to enzyme induction occurred in patients with the most severely impaired hepatic function. These results indicate that not only is antipyrine metabolism severely impaired in patients with liver failure, but elimination rates are markedly altered by <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducing</b> <b>agents.</b> Thus, although these results cannot be extrapolated to all inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes nor to all drugs metabolized by microsomal oxidases, it is suggested that safe and effective management of drug therapy in these patients requires measurement of plasma levels...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} in 13 healthy subjects {{to determine whether}} treatment with rifampicin results in induction of the metabolism of mephenytoin. Daily dosing with 600 mg rifampicin for 22 days caused a three to eightfold increase in the 0 - 8 h urinary R/S ratio of mephenytoin following oral administration (100 mg) of racemic drug to extensive metabolizers of the anticonvulsant. This {{was accompanied by a}} 40 to 180 % increase in the 0 - 8 h urinary excretion of the 4 '-hydroxy metabolite. Four weeks after discontinuing rifampicin, both metabolic indices had returned to their baseline values. By contrast, rifampicin had no effect on either measures of metabolism in subjects of the poor metabolizer phenotype. Thus, it appears that the activity of the enzyme (P- 450 MP) mediating the genetically determined 4 '-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin can be significantly modulated by <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducing</b> <b>agents</b> such as rifampicin and possibly environmental agents with a similar ability...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic microsomal enzymes play an {{important}} role in thyroid hormone homeostasis. Glucuronidation of thyroxine is the rate limiting step in the biliary excretion of thyroxine in the rat; the monodeiodinases are important in the conversion of T 4 to T, and reverse T 3 and subsequent deiodinations. Phenobarbital is known to affect thyroid function in rats due to an alteration of hormone disposition. We have further characterized these effects and have demonstrated that phenobarbital increases the biliary excretion of thyroxine glucuronide primarily as a result of an induction of hepatic thyroxine glucuronyltransferase. Studies on the mode of action for phenobarbital promotion of thyroid follicular neoplasia were conducted using an initiation-promotion model established by Hiasa et a 1 (35). In this model, we demonstrated that supplemental administration of thyroxine blocked the promoting effect of phenobarbital and furthermore, using various dosages of thyroxine, we observed that the tumor promoting effect of phenobarbital was directly proportional to the level of plasma TSH. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that the the tumor promoting effect of phenobarbital in the thyroid gland is mediated via increased secretion of pituitary TSH as a compensatory response to the known effects of phenobarbital on peripheral thyroid hormone disposition. Since a number of microsomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>inducing</b> <b>agents</b> have increased the incidence of thyroid follicular neoplasia in rat carcinogenicit...|$|R

Carp pituitary extract (CPE) and three different GnRH based synthetic hormones viz., Ovaprim, Ovatide and Wova-FH were used as <b>inducing</b> <b>agents.</b> Experiment was conducted following a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The brooders were injected with different doses of hormones and kept in the breeding hapas at 2 : 1 male to female ratio. All the <b>inducing</b> <b>agents</b> <b>induced</b> the fishes to breed, whereas no breeding was observed in the control set. Spawning success rate varied depending on the rate of inducement {{and the type of}} <b>inducing</b> <b>agent</b> used. CPE at a dose of 9 mgkg− 1 of female and 3 mgkg− 1 of male as well as the synthetic hormones at 0. 5 mlkg− 1 of female and 0. 2 mlkg− 1 of male brooders were found to be effective in inducing the fishes to breed in captivity. Efficacy of the synthetic hormones was significantly higher than that of CPE (P< 0. 05). Dose of hormone apparently affected the percentage of fertilization, egg output, hatching rate and spawn production.

Whereas EPS did not affect G. pallida infection, LPS reduced nematode infection significantly in concentrations as low as 1 and 0. 1 mg ml− 1.

40|$|To exert {{cytotoxicity}} chromium VI (Cr(VI)) has to {{be reduced}} inside cells. This is achieved through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Enzymatic mechanisms include DT-diaphorase, cytochrome P 450, and NADPH cytochrome c reductase, and non-enzymatic mechanisms involve reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid. The extent of cytotoxicity of Cr(VI) may thus {{be influenced by the}} availability of non-enzymatic reductants, and by the activities of the reductase enzymes. In the present paper we have investigated the effect of pretreatment with the <b>inducing</b> <b>agents,</b> phenobarbitone (PB) and 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 -MC), on the response of rat hepatocytes to Cr(VI). Pretreatment with PB increased the activity of NADPH cytochrome c reductase, and 3 -MC increased DT-diaphorase activity in hepatocytes. Both inducers increased cytochrome P 450 content, while neither influenced intracellular GSH content or the activity of glutathione reductase. Pretreatment with either PB or 3 -MC resulted in amelioration of Cr(VI) toxicity both in terms of hepatocyte viability, and to a greater extent, in terms of Cr(VI) induced GSH loss. We propose that the <b>inducing</b> <b>agents</b> increase the amount of enzymatic reduction of Cr(VI) relative to non-enzymatic reduction. Thus, less GSH is used in the reduction of Cr(VI), and intracellular GSH does not fall as rapidly as in cells from control animals therefore cell integrity is better maintained.

40|$|Purpose: Methimazole is {{the most}} {{convenient}} drug used {{in the management of}} hyperthyroid patients. However, associated with its clinical use is hepatotoxicity as a life threatening adverse effect. The exact mechanism of methimazole-induced hepatotoxicity is still far from clear and no protective agent has been developed for this toxicity. Methods: This study attempts to evaluate the hepatotoxicity induced by methimazole at different experimental conditions in a mice model. Methimazole induced hepatotoxicity was investigated in different situations such as <b>enzyme</b> <b>induced</b> and/or glutathione depleted animals. Results: Methimazole (100 mg/kg, i. p) administration caused hepatotoxicity as revealed by increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity as well as pathological changes of the liver. Furthermore, a significant reduction in hepatic glutathione content and an elevation in lipid peroxidation were observed in methimazole treated mice. Combined administration of L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), as a glutathione depletory agent, caused a dramatic change in methimazole induced hepatotoxicity characterized by hepatic necrosis and a severe elevation of serum ALT activity. Enzyme induction using phenobarbital and/or β-naphtoflavone beforehand, deteriorated methimazole induced hepatotoxicity in mice. N-acetyl cysteine (300 mg/kg, i. p) administration effectively alleviated hepatotoxic effects of methimazole in both glutathione depleted and/or <b>enzyme</b> <b>induced</b> animals. Conclusion: The severe hepatotoxic effects of methimazole in glutathione-depleted animals, reveals the crucial role of glutathione as a cellular defense mechanism against methimazole induced hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, the more hepatotoxic properties of methimazole in <b>enzyme</b> <b>induced</b> mice, indicates the role of reactive intermediates in the hepatotoxicity induced by this drug. The protective effects of N acetylcysteine could be attributed to its radical/reactive metabolite scavenging, and/or antioxidant properties as well as glutathione replenishment activities...|$|R
