5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E

25|$|For {{industrial}} applications, {{as well as}} in the arts, permanence {{and stability}} are desirable properties. Pigments that are not permanent are called fugitive. Fugitive pigments <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> time, or with exposure to light, while some eventually blacken.|$|E

25|$|Nonsynaptic plasticity, can {{function}} {{to alleviate the}} effects of brain damage. When one of the vestibular nerves is damaged, disparity in the firing rates of neurons in the vestibular nuclei causes unnecessary vestibular reflexes. The symptoms of this damage <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> time. This is likely due to modifications of intrinsic excitability in the neurons of the vestibular nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Protracted {{symptoms}} {{continue to}} <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> {{a period of}} many months or several years. There is no known cure for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome except time, however, the medication flumazenil {{was found to be}} more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4–266 weeks. This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
500|$|Pigments {{bound in}} glue had an optical quality that {{rendered}} [...] them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid. Unlike oil, which makes chalk appear translucent, chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white. Similarly, [...] more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium. [...] The whites are chalk in areas mixed with lead white, {{especially in the}} Magdalen's mantle and veil, Christ's shroud and the Virgin's veil. The artist used four blue pigments, an unusual number for paintings of the period, with indigo predominating. [...] As a plant-derived pigment, indigo it {{has a tendency to}} <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> time. Azurite and lead-white line the under-paint, while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead-tin yellow. The sky and Nicodemus' collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite, while the Virgin's dress is azurite mixed with ultramarine and smalt, a blue ground-glass pigment. The Entombment is one of the earliest Western pictorial works of art in which the use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that the pigment was not invented during the sixteenth century, as had previously been believed.|$|E

2500|$|Emotional exhaustion, which {{related to}} {{employee}} health and burnout, {{is related to}} overall organizational justice perceptions. As perceptions of justice increase employee health increases and burnout decreases (Liljegren & Ekberg, 2009). [...] Distributive, procedural, and interactional justice perceptions are able to capture state specific levels of emotional exhaustion which <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> time; however, overall organizational justice perceptions give the most stable picture {{of the relationship between}} justice perceptions and emotional exhaustion over time (Liljegren & Ekberg, 2009).|$|E
2500|$|Male Maratus species mostly {{display to}} the females, in {{courtship}} dances, brilliantly coloured upper surface of their abdomen, often with extensions and fringes. Colours {{are produced by}} two main methods using scales (or modified hairs). One mechanism uses pigments to produce reds, whites, and creams in barbed scales that help scatter light. To produce blues the spiders use arrays of nanostructures reflecting light of particular wavelengths, {{in the case of}} Maratus splendens a shiny, sometimes violety blue. The [...] nanostructures are embedded in flat, convex, sac-like scales, amplifying reflected light, according to University of Groningen’s Doekele Stavenga. This is the only animal where this kind of reflection has been shown. Stavenga compared Maratus colours with patterns on butterfly wings, the colors of flowers, and the feathers of the parotia bird. The blues produced by nanostructures in Maratus do not <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> time, unlike the normal pigmenting method. Other blue animals, like beetles, are rare but also use nanostructures. Nathan Morehouse of the University of Pittsburgh found Maratus volans have four different photoreceptors (tetrachromats) allowing them to see red, blue, green, and ultraviolet and also resolve the intracies of the male’s display designs.|$|E

50|$|Initially, the Fading Affect Bias {{was widely}} {{accepted}} {{as the process}} whereby the emotional valence of certain events <b>fades</b> <b>over</b> time. More specifically, early researchers largely believed {{that there was a}} general <b>fading</b> <b>over</b> time of emotional content and intensity in relation to specific life events, regardless of whether the experiences were positive ones or negative ones. However, later studies found that cognitive processes occur that cause the emotional intensity of negative events to dissipate at a faster rate than positively perceived events. Many conclusions have been drawn regarding FAB, and many explanations have been proposed for why it even exists.|$|R

60|$|Kurt sat {{and moved}} {{about in a}} gloomy kind of trance {{for a day and}} a half, until his father was laid to rest beside his mother, in the little {{graveyard}} on the windy hill. After that his mind slowly cleared. He kept to himself the remainder of that day, avoiding the crowd of harvesters camping in the yard and adjacent field; and at sunset he went to a lonely spot on the verge of the valley, where with sad eyes he watched the last rays of sunlight <b>fade</b> <b>over</b> the blackened hills. All these hours had seemed consecrated to his father's memory, to remembered acts of kindness and of love, of the relation that had gone and would never be again. Reproach and remorse had abided with him until that sunset hour, when the load eased off his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... ...In {{writing to}} your father (which, however, I shall {{not be able to}} do by this same post) I will tell him a little better what has been {{happening}} to me and why I have been so unsociable. This unsociability is in truth all that has been happening--as it has been the reverse of the medal, so to speak, of the great arrears and urgent applications (to work) that awaited me here after I parted with you. I have been working in one way and another with great assiduity, squeezing out my American Book with all desirable deliberation, and yet in a kind of panting dread of the matter of it all melting and fading from me before I have worked it off. It does melt and <b>fade,</b> <b>over</b> here, in the strangest way--and yet I did, I think, while with you, so successfully cultivate the impression and the saturation that even my bare residuum won't be quite a vain thing. I really find in fact that I have more impressions than I know what to do with; so that, evidently, at the rate I am going, I shall have pegged out two distinct volumes instead of one. I have already produced almost the substance of one--which I have been sending to [...] "Harper" [...] and the N.A.R., as per contract; though publication doesn't begin, apparently, in those periodicals till next month. And then (please mention to your Dad) all the time I haven't been doing the American Book, I have been revising with extreme minuteness three or four of my early works for the Edition Définitive (the settlement of some of the details of which seems to be hanging fire a little between my [...] "agent" [...] and my New York publishers; not, however, in a manner to indicate, I think, a real hitch.) Please, however, say nothing whatever, any of you to any one, about the existence of any such plan. These things should be spoken of only when they are in full feather. That for your Dad--I mean the information as well as the warning, in particular; on whom, you see, I am shamelessly working off, after all, a good deal of my letter. Mention to him also that still other tracts of my time, these last silent weeks, have gone, have had to go, toward preparing for a job that I think I mentioned to him while with you--my pledge, already a couple of years old to do a romantical-psychological-pictorial [...] "social" [...] London (of the general form, length, pitch, and [...] "type" [...] of Marion Crawford's Ave Roma Immortalis) for the Macmillans; and I have been feeling so nervous of late about the way America has crowded me off it, that I have had, for assuagement of my nerves, to begin, with piety and prayer, some of the very considerable reading the task will require of me. All this to show you that I haven't been wantonly uncommunicative. But good-night, dear Peg; I am going to do another for Aleck. With copious embraces, ...|$|E
