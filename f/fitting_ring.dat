40|$|It is {{not known}} why the Angelchik {{prosthesis}} prevents gastro-oesophageal reflux. A review of 53 barium meal examinations in 39 patients with the prosthesis showed that in 43 examinations the prosthesis was below the diaphragm. In 38 of these a small knuckle of stomach had herniated through the prosthetic ring alongside the oesophagus, forming a small intra-abdominal para-oesophageal hernia. Radiological reflux occurred in only one patient with such a hernia. In the remaining five examinations where the prosthesis was correctly situated in the abdomen, there was no hernia within the prosthetic ring and reflux occurred in three. In ten examinations the prosthesis had migrated into the mediastinum. None of these showed a hernia and reflux occurred in eight. It is suggested that the Angelchik prosthesis results {{in the formation of}} a small para-oesophageal hernia within a loosely <b>fitting</b> <b>ring</b> within the abdomen and this is a requirement for the success of the Angelchik prosthesis. Radiographically the intra-abdominal para-oesophageal hernia inside the prosthesis results in buttressing of the intra-abdominal oesophagus {{in a manner similar to}} a fundoplication...|$|E
40|$|Author: Sosnick Lab, University of Chicago ### Description For protein concentration, gas {{pressure}} is applied directly to ultrafiltration cell. Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit membrane holder into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, <b>fitting</b> <b>ring</b> on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|E

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients undergoing contact lenses <b>fitting,</b> after intracorneal <b>ring</b> for keratoconus. The criterion for contact lens fitting was unsatisfactory visual acuity with spectacle correction as referred by the patients. All patients were intolerants to contact lenses prior to intracorneal implantation. Visual acuity analysis {{was done by}} conversion of Snellen to logMAR scales. The comfort was evaluated according subjective questioning of good, medium or poor comfort. RESULTS: Nineteen patients {{were included in the}} study. Two patients (10. 5 %) did not achieved good comfort with contact lenses and underwent penetrating keratoplasties. All the others 17 patients showed good or medium comfort. Four rigid gas-permeable contact lenses were fitted, one piggyback approach, 3 toric soft contact lenses, 2 soft lenses specially design for keratoconus and 7 disposable soft lenses.

40|$|This paper applies a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) electric field analysis program {{to calculate the}} field distribution at the live-end of 110 kV non-ceramic insulators used in the Queensland transmission system. A number of 110 kV insulator configurations have been modelled, including a post, a longrod and a horizontal vee assembly, to determine the electric field on the sheath at the live end. It has been observed that birds will only chew the dead end of insulators. Based on modelling and the proximity of bird chewing damage to the live end, the maximum electric field that birds will tolerate has been estimated. Of particular interest to this research was the effect of corona ring geometry on the electric field at the live-end of high voltage non-ceramic insulators. At 110 kV, manufacturers do not recommend the <b>fitting</b> of corona <b>rings</b> to reduce the electric field. However, for 330 kV non-ceramic insulators, manufacturers recommend <b>fitting</b> corona <b>rings</b> at the live end to reduce the electric field so that sheath damage due to corona discharge is minimised.

40|$|The {{majority}} of debris discs discovered {{so far have}} only been detected through infrared excess emission above stellar photospheres. While disc properties can be inferred from unresolved photometry alone under various assumptions for the physical properties of dust grains, there is a degeneracy between disc radius and dust temperature {{that depends on the}} grain size distribution and optical properties. By resolving the disc we can measure the actual location of the dust. The launch of Herschel, with an angular resolution superior to previous far-infrared telescopes, allows us to spatially resolve more discs and locate the dust directly. Here we present the nine resolved discs around A stars between 20 and 40 pc observed by the DEBRIS survey. We use these data to investigate the disc radii by <b>fitting</b> narrow <b>ring</b> models to images at 70, 100 and 160 μm and by fitting blackbodies to full spectral energy distributions. We do this with the aim of finding an improved way of estimating disc radii for unresolved systems. The ratio between the resolved and blackbody radii varies between 1 and 2. 5. This ratio is inversely correlated with luminosity and any remaining discrepancies are most likely explained by differences to the minimum size of grain in the size distribution or differences in composition. We find that three of the systems are well fit by a narrow ring, two systems are borderline cases and the other four likely require wider or multiple rings to fully explain the observations, reflecting the diversity of planetary systems.
