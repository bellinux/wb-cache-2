5000|$|Microcrystalline {{cellulose}} (MCC) is pure partially depolymerized cellulose synthesized from α-cellulose precursor. [...] The MCC can be synthesized {{by different}} {{processes such as}} reactive extrusion, enzyme mediated, steam explosion and acid hydrolysis. The later process can be done using mineral acids such as H2SO4, HCl and HBr as well as ionic liquids. The role of these reagents is to destroy the amorphous regions remaining the crystalline domains. The degree of polymerization is typically less than 400. The MCC particles with size lower than 5 µm must not be more than 10%. The MCC is a valuable additive in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and other industries. Different properties of MCC are measured to qualify its suitability to such utilization, namely particle size, density, compressibility <b>index,</b> <b>angle</b> of repose, powder porosity, hydration swelling capacity, moisture sorption capacity, moisture content, crystallinity index, crystallite size and mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are also important to predict the thermal behavior of the MCC upon heat stresses.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical approach for lowering the outlet flow ripple of a crescent pump by applying a tandem crescent pump {{consisting of two}} gear pairs with an <b>index</b> <b>angle</b> between them. The outlet flow of the tandem pump is obtained by summing the flow produced by the two gear pairs, and the flow ripple of the tandem pump can be attenuated by properly selecting the design parameters {{in terms of the}} <b>index</b> <b>angle</b> and the displacement ratio between the two gear pairs. A lumped parameter model is presented for evaluating the crescent pump’s flow ripples, and experiments were performed on a single crescent pump to validate the model from the aspects of the steady-state flow-pressure characteristics and the outlet pressure ripples. In this way, the main causes of the flow ripple could be identified by comparing the kinematic flow with the actual flow evaluated by the model. Additionally, simulation results suggested that a tandem pump with an <b>index</b> <b>angle</b> of 13. 85 ° and displacement ratio of 0. 5 could lead to a more than 45 % decrease in the outlet flow ripple than a single pump with the same displacement {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|The wintertime NAO is {{traditionally}} {{defined as the}} first Empirical Orthogonal Function of monthly sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies for all winters and therefore remains fixed in space. The associated NAO index represents the projection of SLP onto the fixed NAO pattern. The NAO index is positive when the pressure contrast between the two centers of action is particularly strong; it is negative when the contrast is weak. This index represents an incomplete description of the wintertime NAO as the pattern is found to shift location on decadal timescales.

The main goal of this work is to reduce the disturbing noise generated by axial piston swash plate type hydrostatic pumps by attenuating the shaft torque variation. The analysis begins by deriving the equation of the shaft torque {{as a function of the}} average torque and the total number of pistons that are used within the rotating group. A swash plate control law is derived according to which if the swash plate is adjusted continuously, would give a constant shaft torque.

Orodispersible tablets are an innovative technology, which disperse rapidly, usually {{in a matter of}} seconds, without the need for water, providing optimal convenience to the patient. The taste masking was done by complexing Nizatidine with methacrylate copolymer, Eudragit E 100 in different ratios by mass extrusion method.

The biological activity of fermented soybean (natto) {{is very similar to}} that of t-PA. We investigated the effect of the dietary supplement of natto on peripheral nerve regeneration. The peripheral nerve injury was produced by crushing the left sciatic nerve with a vessel clamp in Sprague-Dawley rats. The injured animals were fed orally either with saline or natto (16 mg/day) for seven consecutive days after injury. Increased functional outcome such as sciatic nerve functional <b>index,</b> <b>angle</b> of ankle, compound muscle action potential and conduction latency were observed in natto-treated group. Histological examination demonstrated that natto treatment improved injury-induced vacuole formation, S- 100 and vessel immunoreactivities and axon loss. Oral intake of natto prolonged prothrombin time and reduced fibrinogen but did not change activated partial thromboplastin time and bleeding time. Furthermore, natto decreased injury-induced fibrin deposition, indicating a tolerant fibrinolytic activity. The treatment of natto significantly improved injury-induced disruption of blood - nerve barrier and loss of matrix component such as laminin and fibronectin. Sciatic nerve crush injury induced elevation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production and caused apoptosis. The increased production of TNF-alpha and apoptosis were attenuated by natto treatment. These findings indicate that oral intake of natto has the potential to augment regeneration in peripheral nerve injury, possibly mediated by the clearance of fibrin and decreased production of TNF-alpha.

40|$|In this dissertation, a new {{diagnostic}} method for detecting rotor broken-bars and inter-turn short-circuit faults in induction motors is introduced based on electromagnetic field laws governing {{the operation and}} performance of induction machines. The basis of this new method is to monitor {{the orientation of the}} axis of the induction machine 2 ̆ 7 s magnetic field, and hence compute (estimate) the range of its oscillation due to the above mentioned types of faults in a synchronously rotating frame of reference. Differences in the pendulous oscillations due to broken-bars and inter-turn faults required different signal processing approaches (or algorithms) for detecting the range of the pendulous oscillations, the so-called swing <b>angle</b> <b>indices.</b> Moreover, these algorithms for obtaining the swing <b>angle</b> <b>indices</b> have been developed as practical fault indicators which diagnose effectively these faults even in the presence of some system and measurement noises. Furthermore, these algorithms and techniques have been applied, experimentally tested and investigated {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions, for two quite distinct and different induction motors, whose designs are of two distinct natures, under different load levels and different excitation systems. Using these swing <b>angle</b> <b>indices</b> for rotor broken-bars and stator inter-turn short circuit faults, namely, Δδ 1 and Δδ sc, respectively, the severity of any such fault was effectively evaluated in a much more reliable manner than in case of using more conventional fault indicators such as frequency spectral side bands or negative sequence current/impedance components, etc. Specifically, this characteristic regarding the evaluation of the fault severity is also evaluated by making comparisons between the swing <b>angle</b> <b>indices</b> and the well-known side band component techniques as well as negative sequence current component for the cases of broken bars and inter-turn faults, respectively. Thus, in this dissertation, all three main steps of a diagnostic procedure are addressed concerning the so-called swing <b>angle</b> <b>indices,</b> while these three steps are (1) introducing the fault signature (or index), (2) developing the fault identification technique and (3) ascertaining the strength or robustness of the fault index for purposes of fault severity evaluations.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} cartilage thickness distribution and compressive properties {{in the context of}} optimal alignment planning for periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). The Biomechanical Guidance System (BGS) is a computer-assisted surgical suite assisting surgeon’s in determining the most beneficial new alignment of a patient’s acetabulum. The BGS uses biomechanical analysis of the hip to find this optimal alignment. Articular cartilage is an essential component of this analysis and its physical properties can affect contact pressure outcomes. Patient-specific hip joint models created from CT scans of a cohort of 29 dysplastic subjects were tested with four different cartilage thickness profiles (one uniform and threenonuniform) and two sets of compressive characteristics. For each combination of thickness distribution and compressive properties, the optimal alignment of the acetabulum was found; the resultant geometric and biomechanical characterization of the hip were compared among the optimal alignments. There was an average decrease of 49. 2 +/- 22. 27 % in peak contact pressure from the preoperative to the optimal alignment over all patients. We observed an average increase of 19 +/- 7. 7 degrees in center-edge angle and an average decrease of 19. 5 +/- 8. 4 degrees in acetabular <b>index</b> <b>angle</b> from the preoperative case to the optimized plan. The optimal alignment increased the lateral coverage of the femoral head and decreased the obliqueness of the acetabular roof in all patients. These anatomical observations were independent of the choice for either cartilage thickness profile, or compressive properties.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} aeroelastic {{analytical model}} of helicopter rotors with trailingedge flaps for primary and vibration controls has been developed. The derivation of system equations {{is based on}} Hamilton principles, and implemented with finite element method in space and time. The blade element consists of fifteen degrees of freedom representing blade flap, lag, torsional, and axial deformations. Three aerodynamic models of flapped airfoils were implemented in the present analysis, the unsteady Hariharan- Leishman model for trailing-edge flaps without aerodynamic balance, a quasi-steady Theodorsen theory for an aerodynamic balanced trailing-edge flap, and table lookup based on wind tunnel test data. The trailing-edge flap deflections may be modeled as a degree of freedom so that the actuator dynamics can be captured properly. The coupled trim procedures for swashplateless rotor are solved in either wind tunnel trim or free flight condition. A multicyclic controller is also implemented to calculate the flap control inputs for minimization of vibratory rotor hub loads. The coupled blade equations of motion are linearized by using small perturbations about a steady trimmed solution. The aeroelastic stability characteristics of trailing-edge flap rotors is then determined from an eigenanalysis of the homogeneous equations using Floquet method. The correlation studies of a typical bearingless rotor and an ultralight teetering rotor are respectively based on wind tunnel test data and simulations of another comprehensive analysis (CAMRAD II). Overall, good correlations are obtained. Parametric study identifies {{that the effect of}} actuator dynamics cannot be neglected, especially for a torsionally soft smart actuator system.

These powders belong to group C of the Geldart classification and are characterized as cohesive powders with a non-free flow and a difficult fluidization. The fluidization of the powders {{was carried out in}} a glass column of 103 mm inner diameter and 1500 mm height. The experiments and analysis performed included measurements of the physical properties of the powders such as the particle size, density, specific surface area and the flow properties of the powders like the Hausner's index, the angle of repose, the angle of slide, consolidation and shearing (via shear cell testing). The results obtained with the nanometric TiO 2 powders show a more complex behavior than the micronic powders; with a low strength value (Hausner <b>index,</b> <b>angle</b> of repose and angle of slide), the TiO 2 powders have a free flow or intermediate-flow and a non-free-flow for higher strength intensities (consolidation and shearing). This behavior is related to the structure of the nanometric particles in the packed bed; the evolution of this structure is made up of individualized and spherical agglomerate shapes and is not perturbed by stresses of low intensities. Indeed, the latter seems to modify the structure of the powder (group C of Geldart classification) to acquire a behavior typical of group A, B or D in the Geldart classification. With high stress values, the individualized agglomerates are disintegrated and the powder is reduced to a more compact structure. The fluidization of TiO 2 powders seems to evolve in a more homogeneous way than the micronic powders. This behavior is related to the initial structure being made up of stable agglomerates. Thus, this fluidization is made by agglomerates with a gas velocity of 3 × 10 (6) to 4. 6 × 10 (6) times the gas velocity for fluidizing the primary particles. A numerical approach based on a force balance in agglomerating fluidized beds was developed in order to estimate the agglomerates sizes...|$|E

In this paper, using spectral observations made by ASD Spectroradiometer for predicting soil moisture content, two soil indices were also investigated involving the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), NMDI (Normalized Multi-band Drought Index) indices. Correlation and regression analysis showed a high relationship between PDI and the soil moisture percent (R 2 = 0. 9537) and NMDI (R 2 = 0. 9335). Furthermore, we also simulated these data according to the spectral range of some sensors such as MODIS, ASTER, ALI and ETM+. Indices relevant these sensors have high correlation with soil moisture data. Finally, we proposed a new <b>angle</b> <b>index</b> which shows significant relationship between new <b>angle</b> <b>index</b> and the soil moisture percentages (R 2 = 0. 9432). <b>angle</b> <b>index</b> relevant bands 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 MODIS also showing high accuracy in estimation of soil moisture (R 2 = 0. 719) ...|$|R

In this study, we incorporated the filtration of compressed air and robotic technologies such as position control and image processing to realize a contamination-free non-contact wettability assessment system using the above approaches. With the contamination-free system, we can evaluate the damage to cells from just the air-jet application and we can compare the cell wettability to the conventional wettability <b>index,</b> contact <b>angle.</b>|$|R
