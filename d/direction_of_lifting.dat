2500|$|Much of the {{reduction}} of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to [...] "fly out" [...] any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have <b>lift,</b> its center <b>of</b> mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight.

We show {{that in the case of}} zero topological entropy the flow has properties similar to integrable systems. In particular there exists a non-trivial continuous constant of motion which measures the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> geodesics <b>lifted</b> onto the universal covering ^ 2.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified the}} appearance <b>of</b> negative Magnus <b>lift</b> on a sphere rotating about an axis perpendicular to an incoming flow {{at a critical}} Reynolds number using large-eddy simulation and obtained the statistically time-averaged lift and pressure coefficients around the sphere. We have now numerically investigated the unsteady characteristics of the boundary layer around a rotating sphere at three Reynolds numbers (1. 0 x 10 ^[4], 2. 0 x 10 ^[5], and 1. 14 x 10 ^[6]). At a Reynolds number in the subcritical or supercritical region, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> force followed the Magnus effect independent of the rotational speed. In contrast, at the critical Reynolds number when a particular rotational speed was imposed, negative lift was observed and a boundary-layer transition occurred only {{on one side of}} the sphere, as indicated by the visualization of the vortical structures around the sphere. A change in these structures and a shift of the separation points along with a change in the Reynolds number or rotational speed of the sphere were investigated in the context of boundary layer transition by using visualization around the sphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study is to {{investigate}} the effect of particle-pair interaction for various separation distances and angular positions. The results obtained are used in a particle-laden turbulent jet flows in order to improve the existing Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) models. In the first part, a detailed numerical study of particle interaction is carried out by varying the separation distances and angular positions between two-spherical-particles for wide range of Reynolds numbers. Different factors like drag, lift, wake structures, flow patterns and shedding frequencies are investigated. Volume of Solid (VOS) method based on Volume of Fluid (VOF) is used to represent the particles. Separation distances Do between the particles is varied from 1. 5 to 12 D (D being diameter of particle) and the angle is varied from 0 to 180. A wide range of Reynolds numbers from 10 to 600 are used. Independent of Reynolds number, greatest reduction in drag of trailing sphere is observed in tandem position i. e. when placed in the wake of leading or reference sphere and the effect can be seen even up to large separation distances of 12 D. However in all positions other than tandem, the interaction effects can only be observed up to Do = 6 D. The change in separation distance and angular position also affects both the magnitude and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> force. As the angular position is changed from 0 to 90, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> force between two spheres changes from attraction to repulsion. The wake structures and flow are substantially altered at small separation distances of Do 3 D compared to Re less than equal to 200. In the unsteady region i. e Re > 275 - 280, increasing the Reynolds number from 300 to 600 results in a greater reduction of drag of the downstream sphere at small separation distances i. e. Do 2 D. Lift, wake structures and shedding frequencies are also observed to be strongly dependent on the separation distance and angular positions of particles. The results indicate the importance of particle interaction in the modeling of multi-phase flows even in the case of rather dilute flows, i. e. large inter-particle distances. This emphasis the need of including the drag and the lift forces in modeling multi-phase flows with Lagrangian Particle Transport (LPT). Based on separation distance and angle, drag and lift corrections are tabulated for different Reynolds number from 10 to 600. The corrections are incorporated in two-phase turbulent jet flows as a modifying factors for drag and lift forces in particle equation of motion. The effect of aerodynamic interaction is then analyzed by varying the Stokes numbers and mass loadings. The aerodynaimc effect is largely dependent on Stokes number and particle number density and is effective in dilute flows with void fraction on the order of 10 ^{- 4 }. The effect on particle dynamics is only observed in the radial direction at Stokes number of 314 and 50 resulting in enhanced dispersion of the particles. However, at a relatively low Stokes number flow (10), the effect is found in the axial direction also. In addition particles gain high radial velcoities which results in more dispersion compared to cases excluding aerodynamic interaction. The rms of axial velcoity fluctuations for the continuous phase along the axis of the jet is found to be large, resulting in faster decay of the axial velocity and higher radial velcoity in three-way case. The results will help in understanding and improving the current multi-phase models...|$|R

Next, the ride dove down into a corkscrew, then a slight left turn over the park midway into a cutback. The ride then traversed back over the midway, under the first corkscrew and entered a second corkscrew. It then quickly entered a counter-clockwise helix. Exiting the helix, the ride made a right hand turn onto a final brake run, which would then lead straight into the ride station.|$|R
5000|$|To do {{a barrel}} roll in its purest form, from the pilot's perspective, it may best {{be thought of}} as a roll around a point on the horizon that is 45 degrees off the flightpath. Starting from a level flight, the pilot will usually pick such a point on the horizon as a reference, which is {{typically}} between the nose and the wing-tip, out the side window (if the plane has side windows). This point can be anything in that area, like a distant lake, mountain peak, or cloud. The pilot will then pull back on the stick, bringing the plane up into a brief climb. As the nose passes through the horizon, the pilot begins to apply aileron input, which is accomplished by easing the stick to either the right or the left. As the airplane rolls it will continue to pitch in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> vector. The pilot will need to carefully control the roll rate, keeping the nose 45 degrees off the reference point on the horizon as the nose traces a circle around this spot.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} the Universe may inflate due to moduli fields, corresponding to flat <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> supersymmetry, <b>lifted</b> by supergravity corrections. Using a hybrid-type potential we obtain a two-stage inflationary model. Depending on the curvature of the potential the first stage corresponds to a period of fast-roll inflation or a period of `locked' inflation, induced by an oscillating inflaton. This is followed by a second stage of fast-roll inflation. We demonstrate that these two consecutive inflationary phases result in enough total e-foldings to encompass the cosmological scales. Using natural values for the parameters (masses of order TeV and vacuum energy of the intermediate scale corresponding to gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking) we conclude that the Î·-problem of inflation is easily overcome. The greatest obstacle to our scenario is the possibility of copious production of cosmologically disastrous primordial black holes due to the phase transition switching from the first into the second stage of inflation. We study this problem in detail and show analytically that there is ample parameter space where these black holes do not form at all. To generate structure in the Universe we assume the presence of a curvaton field. Finally we also discuss the moduli problem and how it affects our considerations.

40|$|The {{changes in}} force {{characteristics}} {{as well as}} the shedding patterns for various dual sphere configurations are studied. The Reynolds numbers considered are 300, 600 and two different inflow conditions are used: steady and pulsating. The sphere formations are defined by the separation distance D- 0 between the spheres and the angle between the line connecting the centres of the spheres and the main flow direction, gamma. The position of one of the spheres is varied in the range 0 degrees- 90 degrees using a 15 degrees increment. Two separation distances are studied; 1. 5 D and 3 D. The method used for the simulations is the Volume of Solid (VOS) approach, a method based on Volume of Fluid (VOF). A major conclusion from this work is that the sphere interaction alters the wake dynamics by obstructing the vortex shedding (generating a steady wake or a wake with lower Strouhal number) and by changing the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lift</b> force so that it in most cases is directed in the plane containing the sphere centres. The results also show that changing the inflow condition gives the same relative change in drag and lift as for a single sphere. The drag is substantially reduced by placing the sphere downstream in a tandem arrangement and slightly increased in a side-by-side arrangement. However, the effect is decreased by increasing separation distance and increasing Reynolds number. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Dissymmetry <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> is an {{aerodynamic}} phenomenon {{caused by}} the rotation of a helicopter's rotors in forward flight. Rotor blades provide lift proportional {{to the amount of}} air flowing over them. When viewed from above, the rotor blades move in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> flight for half of the rotation (advancing half), and then move in the opposite direction {{for the remainder of the}} rotation (retreating half). A rotor blade produces more lift in the advancing half. As a blade moves toward the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> flight, the forward motion of the aircraft increases the speed of the air flowing around the blade until it reaches a maximum when the blade is perpendicular to the relative wind. At the same time, a rotor blade in the retreating half produces less lift. As a blade moves away from the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> flight, the speed of the airflow over the rotor blade is reduced by an amount equal to the forward speed of the aircraft, reaching its maximum effect when the rotor blade is again perpendicular to the relative wind. Coaxial rotors avoid the effects <b>of</b> dissymmetry <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> through the use of two rotors turning in opposite directions, causing blades to advance on either side at the same time.|$|R
