500|$|Meanwhile, {{a violent}} {{criminal}} named John Mosley (Michael Kelly) is also {{searching for the}} Beacon. After killing one of Olivia's mentors, Mosley kidnaps and tortures Peter {{to find out the}} location. After he recovers the beacon from the grave of Robert Bishop, John Mosley is taken down by Olivia. The beacon escapes into the earth, and The Observer reports that its departure was [...] "on schedule." [...] Peter confronts The Observer about the beacon, only to have a gibberish conversation that implies that the Observer knows what Peter <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> before he says it, or, as Peter puts it, [...] "he knew me [...] he was inside my head." [...] The Observer then knocks Peter out with an advanced sort of stun gun.|$|E
500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E
2500|$|MacArthur is a premillenialist and pre-tribulationist {{in regards}} to the timing of the rapture and other end time occurrences, and stated, [...] "I'm {{committed}} to the fact that Jesus will come to set up a literal earthly kingdom and that He will come seven years before the kingdom, He will come prior to the tribulation." [...] However, MacArthur has tried to distance himself from others within the line of thought, such as minister Tim LaHaye and novelist Jerry B. Jenkins of fame for the Left Behind series. MacArthur remarked during a sermon, [...] "...somebody out there <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Oh boy, he's in to the Left Behind series." [...] No—I'm not in to Rapture-fiction and I'm not in to wacky charts. You don't see me up here with a big chart and a stick. And I'm not in to newspaper exegesis where...everything that happens in the news fulfills some obscure Old Testament prophecy...I reject the wacky world of newspaper exegesis and cartoon eschatology and crazy interpretation like the locusts of Revelation 9 being helicopters..." ...|$|E

2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E

60|$|I do {{not know}} {{anything}} so sad as a dinner {{where you are going}} to get up and say something by-and-by, and you {{do not know}} what it is.

6000|$|The view he {{took was}} so plainly the right one, {{that there was}} no more to be said. As I rose to conduct him to my lady's room, he asked if Mr. Franklin wished to be present.

6000|$|These {{may seem}} selfish considerations; but you can't, in sound morals, condemn {{a man for}} taking care of his own integrity. It is his clear duty. And least of all can you condemn an artist pursuing, however humbly and imperfectly, a {{creative}} aim.

60|$|Now, in {{real life}} things don't happen quite like this. What the quarrel {{in real life}} suffers from is want of system. There is no order, no settled plan.

The man, turning things over in the morning while shaving, makes up his mind to have this matter out and have done with it. He knows exactly what he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He repeats it to himself at intervals during the day. He will first say This, and then he will go on to That; while he is about it he will perhaps mention the Other. He reckons it will take him a quarter of an hour. Which will just give him time to dress for dinner.|$|E
6000|$|Goldsmith, {{with all}} his modesty, could not be ignorant of his proper merit; and must have felt annoyed at times at being undervalued and elbowed aside by light-minded or dull men, in their blind and {{exclusive}} homage to the literary autocrat.

[...] "Sir, you are for making a monarchy what should be a republic." [...] On another occasion, when he was conversing in company with great vivacity, and apparently {{to the satisfaction of}} those around him, an honest Swiss, who sat near, one George Michael Moser, keeper of the Royal Academy, perceiving Dr. Johnson rolling himself as if about to speak, exclaimed, [...] "Stay, stay!
