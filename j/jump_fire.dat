5|$|The regular {{gameplay}} {{features a}} third-person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can <b>jump,</b> <b>fire</b> the arm cannon, and {{turn into a}} morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement {{is not limited to}} a two-dimensional plane. When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches into a first-person perspective, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.|$|E

5000|$|Ninja Gaiden for the Master System was {{critically}} acclaimed upon release. Sega Force reviewed {{the game in}} its August 1992 issue {{and gave it a}} score of 90%. The main reviewer Mat Yeo states that Ryu [...] "can <b>jump,</b> <b>fire,</b> use extra weapons and perform a handy trick to reach high ledges. Stand under the ledge, press jump and up to flip Ryu onto it." [...] He stated that he was [...] "well impressed with this game. I loved Ninja Gaiden on the Game Gear and this is a thousand times better!" [...] He concluded that, with [...] "loads of levels, tough villains and a challenging mission to complete, it should satisfy even those who’re sick to death of platform games." [...] Another reviewer Chris Knight stated that the game is [...] "great to look at, the music and in-game effects are nicely atmospheric, and above all, the controls work a treat." ...|$|E

50|$|Mega Man Zero adopts the action-platforming {{gameplay}} {{prescribed by}} its predecessors {{in the original}} Mega Man and Mega Man X series. The player, as the protagonist Zero, is tasked with completing several side-scrolling stages, destroying enemies, completing objectives and battling bosses. The player can run, <b>jump,</b> <b>fire</b> the player character's primary weapon, or use a secondary weapon if it is available. As in the Mega Man X games, the player can dash along the ground, cling to and scale walls, or perform {{a combination of these}} abilities. Unlike previous titles in the franchise where separate stages are selectable from a menu, Mega Man Zero is presented as a single, interconnected overworld. The Resistance base acts as a hub with almost every area in the game freely explorable from it. The player is given a choice of missions to undertake for each section of the map. Completing one mission may unlock others. The player has only three lives to successfully complete a mission before receiving a game over. However, it is possible to fail non-critical missions by escaping the stage, using up both continues, or giving up the mission after dying. Doing so marks the mission as a failure, making it unavailable for the game's remainder.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elementary {{analysis on the}} difference and similarity between upslope fire and <b>jump</b> <b>fire,</b> {{by a series of}} experiments performed in laboratory. The rate of spread (ROS), fire line angle (separation angle of the two fire lines), angular velocity of fire line, flame residence time and non-dimensional radiant heat transfer for the two kinds of phenomena are investigated. For upslope fire, it is found that ROS remains almost steady for line ignition, while it increases with time for point ignition. For upslope fires with line ignition, the fire line angle decreases with time from the initial 180 o to a steady small value, while for point ignition, the initially generated fire line angle remains steady. The angular velocity of fire line does not depend on slope angle in an upslope fire with line ignition. For <b>jump</b> <b>fire,</b> the ROS first increases sharply and then decreases gradually, and it depends on slope angle more significantly than the initial fire line angle. The fire line angle increases with time, and the angular velocity of fire line varies with slope angle. For upslope fires with line ignition, the flame residence time increases with slope angle, while it remains almost constant for upslope tests with point ignition. For <b>jump</b> <b>fire,</b> under one specific initial fire line angle, the overall mean residence time increases with increasing slope angle. Non-dimensional heat radiation for fuel preheating is calculated which effectively explains the ROS development in upslope fire with line ignition and <b>jump</b> <b>fire...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{merging of}} two linear forest fire fronts {{intersecting}} {{at a small}} angle creates an acceleratin fire that is designated as “jump fire”, given the very high value of the rate of spread that it can reach {{in a relatively short}} time. The analysis of the intersection point of the fire lines is of particular relevance to assess <b>jump</b> <b>fire</b> properties. It is found that the displacement velocity of this point increases i a short time, reaching values that are not commonly found in normal fire behavior and allow the inclusion of this type of fire in the category of extreme fire behavior. The distance travelled in the acceleration phase and the maximum velocity reached increase with slope angle. Tests performed with three different fuels in laboratory conditions showed that for a given combination of fuel bed slope and initial angle between fire lines, the non-dimensional values of those two parameters are practically constant...|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{lightness}} the 7.5 cm GebG 36 would <b>jump</b> when <b>fired</b> at low angles as the recoil {{forces would}} force the gun's trail spades {{to act as a}} fulcrum and lever the wheels upwards. In fact Charge 5, the largest propellant increment, was forbidden to be fired at angles under 15° because the gun would <b>jump</b> excessively. <b>Firing</b> at higher angles was perfectly safe as the ground absorbed any residual recoil forces not absorbed by the recoil system.|$|R
50|$|The {{player has}} four-way {{directional}} controls, left, right, {{up and down}} (for climbing ladders) {{and there are also}} separate keys for <b>jump,</b> <b>firing</b> a fireball, picking up objects and using a spell book. Energy can be replenished by finding hearts hidden in caskets, although some caskets contain daemons instead, which drain the player's energy. The game does have a time limit, but extra time is gained by openening doors and solving puzzles, so the player must work out a logical sequence of puzzle-solving such that the clock does not run down to zero.|$|R
50|$|Basic rocket jumps, {{consist of}} three basic {{components:}} <b>jumping,</b> crouching, and <b>firing</b> (at {{or near the}} ground). Crouching is used for rocket jumps because it increases {{the distance of the}} player's jumps. To execute a basic rocket jump, the player must <b>jump,</b> crouch, and <b>fire</b> their rocket launcher towards the ground simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|Geomorphic {{fracture}} is {{a natural}} geologic formation that sometimes forms a deep fissure in the rock {{with the establishment of}} soil and vegetation. The objective of this work was to analyze vegetation within geomorphic fractures under the effect of wildfire passage. The biometric variables evaluated before and after fire passage were: diameter, height, leaf area index, timber volume, grass biomass, number of trees and shrubs and of species. Results (in fractures) were compared to adjacent areas (control). The effect of wildfire passage on vegetation within geomorphic fractures was not significant because fire followed plant biomass bed and when it met the fracture (wetter), it changed from soil surface to canopy surface (<b>jump</b> <b>fire</b> effect), affecting without significance the number of plants or species; so, fracture could be plants refuge against fire passage. We could infer in our experimental model that quality of plant biomass bed could be more significant than quantity, and microclimate variability recruits plants to the refuge (geomorphic fracture) ...|$|E

5000|$|Jump {{injuries}} are infrequent, and smokejumper personnel take deliberate precautions before {{deciding whether to}} <b>jump</b> a particular <b>fire.</b> Multiple factors are analyzed, and then a decision is made {{as to whether it}} is safe to <b>jump</b> the <b>fire</b> or it is unsafe. Bases tend to look for highly motivated individuals who are in superior shape and have the ability to think independently and react to changing environments rapidly [...] Because of their fire experience and physical conditioning, most Hotshots make good smokejumpers.|$|R
