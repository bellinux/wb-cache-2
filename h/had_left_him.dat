5|$|The {{current and}} past highway commissioners were accused of {{incompetence}} and embezzlement and forced to repay money. According to Suetonius, {{in the first year}} of Caligula's reign he squandered 2.7 billion sesterces that Tiberius had amassed. His nephew Nero Caesar both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in so short a time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> with a good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E

His original wish is to {{be self-sufficient}} and alone, but as Abby convinces the other survivors to come together he decides to remain within the group. Greg is shown to be better prepared than most to survive in this post-virus world, having immediately assembled a range of necessities. Before the pandemic kill-off, Greg's wife <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> for a civil servant and had told Greg she was visiting Boston. At that point, she {{and their two children}} vanished. Greg later discovered that his wife possibly knew about the virus before the outbreak and might have escaped it.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, Newall {{remained}} a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; {{his time in}} the Independent Bombing Force <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended against. In this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in short order, and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 April 1937.|$|E
5|$|Sa'd al-Dawla {{was the son}} of Sayf al-Dawla, {{the first}} Emir of Aleppo, and Sakhinah, the sister of Sayf al-Dawla's cousin and court poet, Abu Firas. At the time of his father's death, in February 967, he was only fifteen, and resided at the emirate's Jaziran capital, Mayyafariqin. His {{succession}} to the emirate was unopposed, but the state his father <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> was crumbling: the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II had just conquered Cilicia and was raiding its northern and western provinces, while rebellions of his closest lieutenants had plagued Sayf al-Dawla's last years.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on in the}} 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 {{seconds in}} the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, {{although}} he stated {{that he had no}} record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season. He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> with an Achilles tendon problem.|$|E

5|$|In 1826, Metcalfe {{served on}} a House {{committee}} that investigated allegations that Vice-President John C. Calhoun had improperly benefited from a contract he awarded while serving as Secretary of War in 1822. While Calhoun was cleared of any wrongdoing, his friend, South Carolina Representative George McDuffie, began an exchange of correspondence with Metcalfe regarding the proceedings. The correspondence became heated, and McDuffie challenged Metcalfe to a duel. As {{the recipient of the}} challenge, Metcalfe had the right to choose the terms of the engagement. He chose rifles as the weapon at a distance of 90 feet. McDuffie insisted that wounds from a previous duel <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> incapable of handling a rifle, and proposed pistols as an alternative. Metcalfe replied that he had never handled a pistol in his life. Unable to come to an agreement on the conditions of the duel, both sides eventually dropped the matter entirely.|$|E
5|$|In November, Fowler {{travelled}} to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, {{a specialist}} sports injuries doctor, {{to try and}} resolve a recurring hip problem that <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds. The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Bristol City. However {{he went on to}} suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments. Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem.|$|E
5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E

Trixie and Lou later marry. Nina returns a year later after {{becoming}} an actress in Bollywood. She goes to see Jack and tells him that she wants to be with him. She also visits Lou and gives him some money, as Trixie <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> bankrupt. Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) tells Nina that Jack needs to stay in Australia so he can sort himself out. Nina performs her last concert at Lou's Place, and she tells Jack that she will wait for him. Months later, Jack flies out to Los Angeles to be with Nina.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} seasons, Barcelona were {{in need of}} an overhaul, {{leading to}} the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt. He signed a new contract in July 2008 on an annual salary of €7.8million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> side-lined {{for a total of}} eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential. Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.|$|E

5|$|Custine's son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 {{and died}} 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain {{in one of}} the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young man, he had {{traveled}} widely, and made a long study of the art of war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, ever the politician, predicted that the young Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner's aide-de-camp; following Luckner's dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as chargé de affaires and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> capital of 700,000 livres, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.|$|E
5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers {{was more interested in}} the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able to}} retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E

Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses {{to give it back}} to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>him.</b> David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E
