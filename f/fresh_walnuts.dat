6000|$|After {{the monkeys}} came the barasingh, that big deer {{which is like}} our red deer, but stronger. He wished to rub off the velvet of his horns against the cold stones of Kali's statue, and stamped his feet {{when he saw the}} man at the shrine. But Purun Bhagat never moved, and, little by little, the royal stag edged up and nuzzled his shoulder. Purun Bhagat slid one cool hand along the hot antlers, and the touch soothed the fretted beast, who bowed his head, and Purun Bhagat very softly rubbed and ravelled off the velvet. Afterward, the barasingh brought his doe and fawn--gentle things that mumbled on the holy man's blanket--or would come alone at night, his eyes green in the fire-flicker, to take his share of <b>fresh</b> <b>walnuts.</b> At last, the musk-deer, the shyest and almost the {{smallest}} of the deerlets, came, too, her big rabbity ears erect; even brindled, silent mushick-nabha must needs find out what the light in the shrine meant, and drop out her moose-like nose into Purun Bhagat's lap, coming and going with the shadows of the fire. Purun Bhagat called them all [...] "my brothers," [...] and his low call of [...] "Bhai! Bhai!" [...] would draw them from the forest at noon if they were within ear shot. The Himalayan black bear, moody and suspicious--Sona, who has the V-shaped white mark under his chin--passed that way more than once; and since the Bhagat showed no fear, Sona showed no anger, but watched him, and came closer, and begged a share of the caresses, and a dole of bread or wild berries. Often, in the still dawns, when the Bhagat would climb to the very crest of the pass to watch the red day walking along the peaks of the snows, he would find Sona shuffling and grunting at his heels, thrusting, a curious fore-paw under fallen trunks, and bringing it away with a WHOOF of impatience; or his early steps would wake Sona where he lay curled up, and the great brute, rising erect, would think to fight, till he heard the Bhagat's voice and knew his best friend.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the effects of packaging (MAP) and preservation conditions on the packaged <b>fresh</b> <b>walnut</b> kernel quality. The central composite plan was used for evaluating the effect of oxygen (0 – 10 %), carbon dioxide (0 - 10 %), and temperature (4 - 26 °C) on qualitative characteristics of walnut kernels. Also, the response level technique was used to find the optimal conditions for interactive effects of factors, as well as estimating the best conditions of process using least amount of testing. Measured qualitative parameters were: peroxide index, color, decreased weight, mould and yeast counting test, and sensory evaluation. The {{results showed that the}} defined model for peroxide index, color, weight loss, and sensory evaluation is significant (p < 0. 001), so that increase of temperature causes the peroxide value, color variation, and weight loss to increase and it reduces the overall acceptability of walnut kernels. An increase in oxygen percentage caused the color variation level and peroxide value to increase and resulted in lower overall acceptability of the walnuts. An increase in CO 2 percentage caused the peroxide value to decrease, but did not significantly affect other indices (p ≥ 0. 05). Mould and yeast were not found in any samples. Optimal packaging conditions to achieve maximum quality of walnuts include: 1. 46 % oxygen, 10 % carbon dioxide, and temperature of 4 °C...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) is a large, wind-pollinated, monoecious, dichogamous, long lived, {{perennial}} tree cultivated for {{its high}} quality wood and nuts throughout the temperate {{regions of the}} world. Growth model methodology has been widely used in the modeling of plant growth. Mathematical models are important tools to study the plant growth and agricultural systems. These models can be applied for decision-making anddesigning management procedures in horticulture. Through growth analysis, planning for planting systems, fertilization, pruning operations, harvest {{time as well as}} obtaining economical yield can be more accessible. Non-linear models are more difficult to specify and estimate than linear models. This research was aimed to studynon-linear regression models based on data obtained from fruit weight, length and width. Selecting the best models which explain that fruit inherent growth pattern of Persian walnut was a further goal of this study. Materials and Methods: The experimental material comprising 14 Persian walnut genotypes propagated by seed collected from a walnut orchard in Golestan province, Minoudasht region, Iran, at latitude 37 ◦ 04 ’N; longitude 55 ◦ 32 ’E; altitude 1060 m, in a silt loam soil type. These genotypes were selected as a representative sampling of the many walnut genotypes available throughout the Northeastern Iran. The age range of walnut trees was 30 to 50 years. The annual mean temperature at the location is 16. 3 ◦C, with annual mean rainfall of 690 mm. The data used here is the average of <b>walnut</b> <b>fresh</b> fruit and measured withgram/millimeter/day in 2011. According to the data distribution pattern, several equations have been proposed to describesigmoidal growth patterns. Here, we used double-sigmoid and logistic–monomolecular models to evaluate fruit growth based on fruit weight and 4 different regression models in cluding Richards, Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth for evaluation of fruit growth according to length and width(diameter) of fruit. Then to determine the most efficient model, different parameters of evaluation of model fitting were used. The best model was selected based on the highest value of R 2 and the lowest values for RMSE, AIC and BIC. The data were analyzed using SAS software (version 9. 2) and Solver in Microsoft Excel. Results and Discussion Growth model based on fruit weight: According to the actual and estimated growth model based on fruit weight, double sigmoid function and logistic–monomolecular model showed a good prediction of fruit weight changes versus time data (days after full bloom). However, in general according to evaluation criteria, double sigmoid model was the best model to predict walnut fruit weight. Based on total fruit weight, fruit growth occurs at two stages: {{in the beginning of the}} growth phase, there is a slow growth for 30 days and then it is continued with a rapid growth until 60 days after full bloom. Thereafter, growth was again slow. At the beginning of the second phase of growth (70 to 85 days after full bloom), fruit growth increased again and then, walnut fruits started to ripe on the tree in summer, bright green husk (outer pericarp layer) changed to a yellowish color and the growth again decreased (130 days after full bloom). Growth model based on fruit length and width measurements: Based on the actual and estimated growth pattern the Richard model describes the growth of fruit better than other models. The first phase lasted for about 15 days and the second phase of growth was very rapid and it lasted for 35 daysin most of genotypes. Then, fruit length and width did not change significantly until harvesting time. However, due to subtle changes of fruit length and width following fruit rapid growth stage, fruit weight is preferred for describing fruit growth of the Persian walnut. During the first phase of development, increasing size and weight are associated with the formation of new and larger cells and tissues. The second phase includes attainment of final nut form, and it is characterized mainly by chemical changes. These include changes in the shell as the cells become lignified and more important changes in kernel composition. Conclusion: Based on thes tatistical testing and goodness of the fit, the best model between six nonlinear growth models, was double-sigmoid and Richard model swhich can be used to accurately predict fruit growth based on fruit weight, fruit lengt hand width, respectively...|$|R
