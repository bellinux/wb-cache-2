5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks.

5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements.

5|$|Copper <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> in the aerobic {{respiration}} of all eukaryotes.

Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, that God is infinite.

50|$|An {{essential}} part of an organism {{is something that the}} organism cannot continue to be alive or reproduce without. For instance, mitochondria <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to most eukaryotic cells. Genes can also be considered with regards to their essentiality. Essentiality is an important property in the context of pathogens, since drugs acting on specific genes that <b>are</b> not <b>essential</b> <b>are</b> less likely to be an effective treatment than those that are. In contrast, genes that <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> <b>are</b> in general thought to be better drug targets.|$|R

Further, in March 2006, five of the college's sixteen faculty members—Erik Root, Robert Stacey, Kevin Culberson, Todd Bates, and David Noe—resigned in protest, claiming that the President's interpretation of the Biblical Worldview Policy restricted academic freedom.|$|E
