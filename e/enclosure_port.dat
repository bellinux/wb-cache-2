50|$|Vented {{system design}} using {{computer}} modeling has been practiced since about 1985, when researchers Thiele and Small first systematically applied electrical filter theory to the acoustic behavior of loudspeakers in <b>enclosures.</b> While <b>ported</b> loudspeakers had been produced {{for many years}} before computer modeling, achieving optimum performance was challenging, {{as it is a}} complex sum of the properties of the specific driver, the <b>enclosure</b> and <b>port,</b> because of imperfect understanding of the assorted interactions. These enclosures are sensitive to small variations in driver characteristics and require special quality control concern for uniform performance across a production run. Bass ports are widely used in subwoofers for PA systems and sound reinforcement systems, in bass amp speaker cabinets and in keyboard amp speaker cabinets.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sides of}} a long-excursion {{high-power}} driver in a tapped horn <b>enclosure</b> are <b>ported</b> into the horn itself, with one path length long and the other short. These two paths combine in phase at the horn's mouth within the frequency range of interest. This design is especially effective at subwoofer frequencies and offers reductions in enclosure size along with more output.|$|R
5000|$|AI 90, 1987, {{vision system}} based on an Apple Macintosh II repackaged in a rack mount {{industrial}} <b>enclosure,</b> with RAIL <b>ported</b> to Mac OS (MacRAIL). It was announced at the MacWorld Expo in Boston in 1987.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{life raft}} stabilizer for reducing rocking and substantially precluding capsizing is discussed. The stabilizer may be removably {{attached to the}} raft and is defined by flexible side walls which extend a considerable depth downwardly {{to one another in}} the water. The side walls, in conjunction with the floor of the raft, form a ballast enclosure. A weight is placed {{in the bottom of the}} <b>enclosure</b> and water <b>port</b> means are provided in the walls. Placement of the stabilizer in the water allows the weighted bottom to sink, producing submerged deployment thereof and permitting water to enter the <b>enclosure</b> through the <b>port</b> means, thus forming a ballast for the raft...|$|R
5000|$|However, these {{enclosures}} {{are less}} efficient because, {{for the same}} driver, a dipole results in less sound pressure level than a closed or <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and certainly far less than a properly designed horn. This means that the drivers mounted on a dipole enclosure must have large maximum excursions, large square areas, or both. One solution to these problems is to cross over to a closed or <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure</b> that handles the low frequencies. Another solution is to construct the dipole {{by means of a}} bipole with signal processing controlling the polar pattern. This enables switching between different polar patterns [...] or varying the polar pattern and efficiency versus frequency and versus output level.|$|R
50|$|If the {{enclosure}} {{on each side}} of the woofer has a port in it then {{the enclosure}} yields a 6th order band-pass response. These are considerably harder to design and tend to be very sensitive to driver characteristics. As in other reflex <b>enclosures,</b> the <b>ports</b> may generally be replaced by passive radiators if desired.An eighth order bandpass box is another variation which also has a narrow frequency range. They are often used to achieve sound pressure levels in which case a bass tone of a specific frequency would be used versus anything musical. They are complicated to build and must be done quite precisely in order to perform nearly as intended.|$|R
50|$|The DALI Concept 10 is a {{very large}} floor{{standing}} model standing at over 1.3m tall and weighing 35 kg. The box has 3 separate enclosures. It has two 10 inch woofers in a separate <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure,</b> a 6.5 midrange and dome tweeter in a top sealed enclosure. The Concept range makes up of several models Floorstanders, Bookshelf and Centre Channels.It is the successor of the DALI Blue series.|$|R
50|$|When {{speakers}} {{are designed}} for home use or for high-volume live performance settings (e.g., with bass amplifier speaker cabinets and PA system speakers and subwoofers, manufacturers often consider the advantages of porting (increased bass response, lower bass response, improved efficiency) to outweigh the disadvantages (port noise, resonance issues). The design is popular among consumers and manufacturers (speakers cabinets can be smaller and lighter, for more or less equivalent performance) but the increase in bass output requires close matching of driver, the <b>enclosure,</b> and <b>port.</b> Poorly matched reflex designs can have unfortunate characteristics or drawbacks, making them unsuitable for settings requiring high accuracy and neutrality of sound, e.g. studio monitor speakers for use by audio engineers in monitoring facilities, recording studios etc.|$|R
50|$|Consequent to the above, {{practical}} Transmission Line loudspeakers are {{not true}} Transmission Lines, as there is generally output from the vent at the lowest frequencies. They {{can be thought of}} as a waveguide in which the structure shifts the phase of the driver's rear output by at least 90Â°, thereby reinforcing the frequencies near the driver's Fs. Transmission lines tend to be larger than <b>ported</b> <b>enclosures</b> of approximately comparable performance, due to the size and length of the guide required (typically 1/4 the longest wavelength of interest).|$|R
50|$|This design falls between {{acoustic}} {{suspension and}} bass reflex enclosures. It {{can be thought}} of as either a leaky sealed box or a ported box with large amounts of port damping. By setting up a port, and then blocking it precisely with sufficiently tightly packed fiber filling, it's possible to adjust the damping in the port as desired. The result is control of the resonance behavior of the system which improves low-frequency reproduction, according to some designers. Dynaco was a primary producer of these enclosures for many years, using designs developed by a Scandinavian driver maker. The design remains uncommon among commercial designs currently available. A reason for this may be that adding damping material is a needlessly inefficient method of increasing damping; the same alignment can be achieved by simply choosing a loudspeaker driver with the appropriate parameters and precisely tuning the <b>enclosure</b> and <b>port</b> for the desired response.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known Vega Laboratory speakers were {{hand made}} and contained Jensen branded woofers, sealed mid-ranges and horn tweeters in a <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure</b> with a Vega Labs-built crossover. [...] Earliest known models have no serial number or model {{numbers on the}} crossovers plates and these {{are believed to be}} production prototypes of what would become C-V's popular 12" [...] 3-way speaker systems. In the early 1970s Cerwin-Vega began marketing their [...] "Residential" [...] line of speakers with the Model 24 and Model 26. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Cerwin-Vega released models A-10, A-123, R-10 (10-inch, 2-way system), R-12 (12-inch, 2-way system), R-123 (12-inch, 3-way system), 12TR (12-inch Tower Reflecting horn), and 15T tower speakers with 12" [...] and 15" [...] downward firing woofers, and the model S-1 bookshelf speakers. The S-1 speaker system was the crowning achievement for Cerwin-Vega. By utilizing a [...] "Sixth Order Butterworth Vent Tuning" [...] and integrating the system with Cerwin-Vega's DB-10B Bass Turbocharger (included with the S-1 speakers), the low frequency range of the S-1 was increased beyond the capabilities of larger enclosures. Cerwin-Vega also delivered various models of efficient semi horn (DHORM) speakers (including the A-10, A-123 and S-1). They featured 10" [...] or 12" [...] woofers and often twin mid-range drivers in a <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure.</b> They were touted to deliver up to 126 decibels of sound pressure.|$|R
5000|$|In some respects, {{the ideal}} {{mounting}} for a low-frequency loudspeaker driver {{would be a}} rigid flat panel of infinite size with infinite space behind it. This would entirely prevent the rear sound waves from interfering (i.e., comb filter cancellations) with the sound waves from the front. An [...] "open baffle" [...] loudspeaker is an approximation of this, since the driver is mounted on a panel, with dimensions comparable to the lowest wavelength to be reproduced. In either case, the driver would need a relatively stiff suspension to provide the restoring force {{which might have been}} provided at low frequencies by a smaller sealed or <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure,</b> so few drivers are suitable for this kind of mounting.|$|R
40|$|Time {{reversal}} {{methods are}} widely used to achieve wave focusing in acoustics and electromagnetics. A typical time reversal experiment requires that a transmitter be initially present at the target focusing point, which limits the application of this technique. In this paper, we propose a method to focus waves at an arbitary location inside a complex enclosure using a numerically calculated wave excitation signal. We use a semi-classical ray algorithm to calculate the signal that would be received at a transceiver port resulting from the injection of a short pulse at the desired target location. The time-reversed version of this signal is then injected into the transceiver port and an approximate reconstruction of the short pulse is created at the target. The quaility of the pulse reconstruction is quantified in three different ways and the values of these metrics are predicted by the statistics of the scattering-parameter $|S_{ 21 }|^ 2 $ between the transceiver and target points in the enclosure. We experimentally demonstrate the method using a flat microwave billiard and quantify the reconstruction quality {{as a function of}} <b>enclosure</b> loss, <b>port</b> coupling and other considerations. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|A passive {{radiator}} speaker uses a second [...] "passive" [...] driver, or drone, to produce similar low-frequency extension, or efficiency increase, or enclosure size reduction, similar to <b>ported</b> <b>enclosures.</b> The passive driver is not wired to an amplifier; instead, it moves {{in response to}} changing enclosure pressures. In theory, such designs are variations of the bass reflex type, but with the advantage of avoiding a relatively small port or tube through which air moves, sometimes noisily. Tuning adjustments for a {{passive radiator}} are usually accomplished more quickly than with a bass reflex design since such corrections {{can be as simple}} as mass adjustments to the drone. The disadvantages are that a passive radiator requires precision construction quite like a driver, thus increasing costs, and has excursion limitations.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCombined {{heat and}} {{moisture}} transport in an <b>enclosure</b> with free <b>ports</b> {{has been investigated}} numerically. Enclosed moist air interacts with the surrounding air through these free-vented ports. The governing conservation equations were solved numerically using a control volume-based finite difference technique. Appropriate velocity boundary conditions at each ports are imposed to achieve overall mass conservation across this system. Air, heat and moisture transport structures are visualized respectively by streamlines, heatlines and masslines. Effects of buoyancy ratio, thermal Rayleigh number on convective heat/moisture transfer rate and flow rate across each free-vented port are discussed. Particularly, Numerical results demonstrate that the convective heat and moisture transport patterns and transport rates on horizontal ports greatly depend on properties of porous medium, while the air exchange rate on vertical port is almost unaffected by the buoyancy ratios for most situations...|$|R
50|$|Many others {{continued}} to develop {{various aspects of}} loudspeaker enclosure design in the 1960s and early 1970s. From 1968 to 1972 J. E. Benson published three articles in an Australian journal that thoroughly analyzed sealed, vented and passive radiator designs, all using the same basic model, which included the effects of <b>enclosure,</b> leakage and <b>port</b> losses. Beginning June 1972, Richard H. Small published a series of very influential articles in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society restating and extending Thiele's work. These articles were also originally published in Australia, where he had attended graduate school, and where his thesis supervisor was J.E. Benson. The work of Benson and Small overlapped considerably, but differed in that Benson did his work using computer programs and Small used analog simulators. Small also analyzed the systems including enclosure losses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} the various speaker parameters, <b>enclosure</b> sizes and <b>port</b> (and duct) {{dimensions}} {{on the performance of}} bass reflex systems was not well understood until the early 1960s. At that time, pioneering analyses by A.N. Thiele [...] and Richard H. Small related these factors in a series of [...] "alignments" [...] (sets of the relevant speaker parameters) that produced useful, predictable responses. These made it possible for speaker manufacturers to design speakers to match various sizes of enclosures, and to match enclosures to given speakers with great predictability. All of this is constrained by the laws of physics, which is covered in detail in Thiele and Small's work. It is not possible to have a small speaker in a small enclosure producing extended bass response at high efficiencies (i.e., requiring only a low-powered amplifier). It's possible to have two of these attributes, but not all; this has been termed Hofmann's Iron Law after J. Anton Hofmann of KLH's summary (with Henry Kloss) of Edgar Villchur work years earlier. The sound pressure produced depends upon the efficiency of the speaker, the mechanical or thermal power handling of the driver, the power input {{and the size of the}} driver.|$|R
5000|$|The low {{frequency}} driver in a resonant speaker enclosure system {{such as a}} ported cabinet or passive radiator cabinet cannot start and stop instantly like it can in a sealed-box cabinet. In order to achieve their bass output, <b>ported</b> speaker <b>enclosures</b> stagger two resonances. One from the driver and boxed air and another from the boxed air and port. This a more complex case than an equivalent sealed box. It causes increased time delay (increased group delay imposed by the twin resonances), both in the commencement of bass output and in its cessation. Therefore, a flat steady-state bass response does not occur {{at the same time}} as the rest of the sonic output. Instead, it starts later (lags) and accumulates over time as a longish resonant [...] "tail". Because of this complex, frequency-dependent loading, <b>ported</b> <b>enclosures</b> generally result in poorer transient response at low frequencies than in well-designed sealed box systems. Another issue is that a large cabinet will require a long port tube to be tuned properly, which means that bass reflex cabinets may be larger than a passive radiator cabinet with similar performance.|$|R
50|$|The Voigt pipe {{is a type}} of {{loudspeaker}} enclosure that embodies a combination of transmission line, <b>ported</b> <b>enclosure</b> and horn characteristics. It is highly regarded by some speaker designers, as evidenced by established manufacturers such as Castle. Due to its relatively high efficiency the design is frequently employed in full-range loudspeaker designs. The concept is that the sound emitted {{from the rear of the}} loudspeaker driver is progressively reflected and absorbed along the length of the tapering tube, almost completely preventing internally reflected sound being retransmitted through the cone of the loudspeaker. The lower part of the pipe acts as a horn while the top can be visualized as an extended compression chamber. The entire pipe can also be seen as a tapered transmission line in inverted form, that is, widening rather than narrowing from top to bottom. The driver is usually positioned close to the middle of the baffle or slightly lower. Its relatively low adoption in commercial speakers can mostly be attributed to the large resulting dimensions of the speaker produced and the expense of manufacturing a rigid tapering tube. The Voigt pipe was designed in 1934 by Paul G. A. H. Voigt and is also referred to as a tapered quarter-wave pipe (TQWP) or tapered quarter-wave tube (TQWT).|$|R
