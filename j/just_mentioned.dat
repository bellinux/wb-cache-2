5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was <b>just</b> <b>mentioned),</b> Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E

The slots were at right angles to the direction of movement. Each plate, by itself, was like a Scotch yoke, known to steam engine enthusiasts.|$|E

25|$|To {{the west}} a {{generally}} grassy shoulder runs for about 2km {{down into the}} valley of the How Beck and to the A591 road. This shoulder is sharply defined by the valleys of Stanah Gill to its north and Sticks Gill (West) and Fisherplace Gill to its south. It slopes gently at first to around the 450m contour and then more steeply into the valley over a number of rocky crags. The bridleway to Sticks Pass rises over this shoulder. This ridge is drained by two gills <b>just</b> <b>mentioned,</b> which are now captured by a water leat and diverted into Thirlmere Reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the western}} stream Kalundu {{tradition}} was ancestral to Shona ceramic wares, the closest relationships of the ancestral Shona language {{according to many}} linguists were with a southern division of eastern Bantu – such languages as the southeastern languages (Nguni, Sotho-Tswana, Tsonga), Nyasa and Makwa. While {{it may well be}} the case that the people of the western stream spoke a language belonging to a wider Eastern Bantu division, it is a puzzle which remains to be resolved that they spoke a language most closely related to the languages <b>just</b> <b>mentioned,</b> all of which are today spoken in southeastern Africa.|$|E

25|$|The {{canonical}} visitation of the Diocese of Rome is in {{the hands}} of a commission of cardinals. The president of the commission is the vicar, and its members by virtue of their office are prefects of the Congregation of the Council and of Religious Orders. The secretary of this official board is the commissary <b>just</b> <b>mentioned.</b> The first appointee as secretary and commissary was the former vicegerent (vicesgerens). The archives and compendiums of abstracts of the former Congregation of the Apostolic Visitation, which has been suppressed since 1908, belong to the new commission. Every five years, the next falling in 1916, a canonical visitation of Rome is to be held without any express papal command being issued before the visitation. Six paragraphs (12–17) regulate the details of the procedure to be observed in the visitation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the death}} of Bishop da Incarnacão on 22 November 1752, Fre. Teodoro de Santa Maria, O.S.A., was {{presented}} for the see and confirmed by the Holy See. He belonged to the priory at Saint Thomas, but hesitated to receive episcopal consecration. Two Italian Barnabites destined for the Apostolic vicariate of Burma came with letters of commendation to the bishop-elect, who welcomed and speeded them to their destination. At last Fre. Teodoro, the bishop-elect, renounced the see {{into the hands of}} Fre. Bernardo de São Caetano, O.S.A., who was then consecrated bishop. Bishop Bernardo in turn consecrated one of the two Barnabites <b>just</b> <b>mentioned,</b> Dom Percotto, Bishop and Apostolic Vicar of Burma, in 1768. But Bishop Percotto did not reach the field of his labours, as on his voyage back to Burma the vessel foundered.|$|E
25|$|The {{time when}} the Boian culture {{developed}} into the Gumelniţa culture {{is referred to as}} a transitional period, during which there are commonalities found {{on both sides of the}} chronological divide between the two cultures; as such, Boian Phase IV and Gumelniţa Phase A1 may be considered as a single, uninterrupted, transitional phase. As a result, there are frequent references to this by scholars, who use the term Boian-Gumelniţa culture to describe this specific period. Sometimes, though, this term is mis-used by some to include both the entire Boian culture and Gumelniţa culture periods, not just the transitional period overlapping the two cultures. Since each culture is distinct from the other during its main phases, they should each be considered and named separately, with the exception (as <b>just</b> <b>mentioned)</b> of the transitional phases of their development.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Norman {{invasion}} York had jurisdiction over Worcester, Lichfield, and Lincoln, as well as the dioceses in the Northern Isles and Scotland. But the first three sees <b>just</b> <b>mentioned</b> were taken from York in 1072. In 1154 the suffragan sees of the Isle of Man and Orkney were transferred to the Norwegian archbishop of Nidaros (today's Trondheim), and in 1188 all the Scottish dioceses except Whithorn were released from subjection to York, so that only the dioceses of Whithorn, Durham, and Carlisle remained to the Archbishops as suffragan sees. Of these, Durham was practically independent, for the palatine bishops of that see were little short of sovereigns in their own jurisdiction. Sodor and Man were returned to York during the fourteenth century, to compensate for the loss of Whithorn to the Scottish Church.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} question is the existence of automorphisms in recursion-theoretic structures. One of these structures {{is that one of}} recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, A is below B if and only if the set difference B'A is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be automorphic to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure <b>just</b> <b>mentioned,</b> then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. Soare (1974) showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are automorphic. So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.|$|E

500|$|Although {{originally}} only {{intended as}} a one-off, Woodentop impressed ITV {{to the extent that}} a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one post-watershed episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was [...] "Funny Ol' Business – Cops & Robbers". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from [...] "Woodentop" [...] to [...] "The Bill". In its first four years the series was broadcast between July onwards each year, with a 12-week summer break from May until the next July.

Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show.

You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E
