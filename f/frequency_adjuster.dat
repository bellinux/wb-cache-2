A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integral multiple of the strobing frequency will also appear stationary.|$|R

A magnetron discharge voltage is generated by 200 - 2000 V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises supplying an electrical {{energy in the form}} of pulses to a magnetron, changing the strength of an electric field maintaining a magnetron discharge with a first frequency, changing the strength of a magnetic field penetrating through the magnetron with a second <b>frequency,</b> <b>adjusting</b> the second <b>frequency</b> to 1 - 100 Hz, adjusting the maximum strength of the magnetic field to 5 -times higher than the average strength of the magnetic field, and <b>adjusting</b> the first <b>frequency</b> to 100 -times higher than the second frequency. A magnetron discharge voltage is generated by 200 - 2000 V. The first frequency is increased to such an extent until during a rising edge of the magnetic field strength, a further electrical pulse is generated later after the ignition of a plasma when the value of the physical parameter characterizing the intensity of the plasma is dropped to 2 % of its maximum value obtained during the previous electrical pulse. The magnetic field is periodically pulsed, in which a magnetic coil is subjected with a pulsed electric voltage, where the pulse-in-time is adjusted to 5 - 500 mu s in the electric pulses. USE - Method for generating plasma using magnetron useful during magnetron sputtering, plasma etching or magnetron-plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition-processes.
