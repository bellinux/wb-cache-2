Of the 29captive {{specimens}} in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, while most are past their reproductive years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego.

5|$|Populations of slow loris species, {{such as the}} Bengal and Sunda slow loris, are not faring well in zoos. In 2011, the International Species Information System (ISIS) {{had only}} 11 and 53specimens (respectively) on file from {{reporting}} zoos worldwide. In North American zoos, for instance, several of the 29captive specimens in 2008 were hybrids that could not breed while most were past their reproductive years, and the last captive birth was in 2001 at the San Diego Zoo. Only three Javan slow lorises were kept in zoos in 2011 according to ISIS. Pygmy slow lorises are <b>doing</b> <b>better,</b> with 100specimens reported from zoos worldwide in 2011.

25|$|In 2009, 33 {{million people}} in the United States were second-generation immigrants, {{representing}} 11% of the national population. There are significant differences in income and education levels between the second generation immigrant population and the first generation immigrant population in the United States. Second-generation immigrants are <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> overall and are assimilating more successfully into U.S. society.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} {{that come from}} being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and do better than their predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{following}} CABG {{depends on}} a variety of factors, and successful grafts typically last 8–15 years. In general, CABG improves the chances of survival of patients who are at high risk (generally triple or higher bypass), though statistically after about five years the difference in survival rate between those who have had surgery and those treated by drug therapy diminishes. Age at the time of CABG is critical to the prognosis, younger patients with no complicating diseases <b>doing</b> <b>better,</b> while older patients can usually be expected to suffer further blockage of the coronary arteries.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom is a {{developed}} country with social welfare infrastructure, thus discussions surrounding poverty {{tend to be}} of relative poverty rather than absolute poverty. According to the OECD, the UK is in {{the lower half of}} {{developed country}} rankings for poverty rates, <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> than Italy and the US but less well than France, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Nordic countries. Eurostat figures show that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty has fallen to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social transfers were taken into account).|$|E
25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers {{to individuals who}} are <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, {{it is not a}} trait or something that some children simply possess. There {{is no such thing as}} an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience is the product of a large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other children do not).|$|E
25|$|Puntland has {{the lowest}} rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, {{compared}} to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts believe {{this is because of}} higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty {{does not appear to be}} driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. Puntland is <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.|$|E

500|$|The Bond novels also {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West. In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating [...] "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action". Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". Although Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, he did not focus on it strongly. Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> than he".|$|E
500|$|The Silver Age {{began with}} the {{publication}} of DC Comics' Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956), which introduced the modern version of the Flash. At the time, only three superheroesSuperman, Batman, and Wonder Womanwere still published under their own titles. According to DC comics writer Will Jacobs, Superman was available in [...] "great quantity, but little quality." [...] Batman was <b>doing</b> <b>better,</b> but his comics were [...] "lackluster" [...] in comparison to his earlier [...] "atmospheric adventures" [...] of the 1940s, and Wonder Woman, having lost her original writer and artist, was no longer [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] or [...] "interesting." [...] Jacobs describes the arrival of Showcase #4 on the newsstands as [...] "begging to be bought," [...] the cover featured an undulating film strip depicting the Flash running so fast that he had escaped from the frame. Editor Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox, and artist Carmine Infantino were some of the people behind the Flash's revitalization. Robert Kanigher wrote the first stories of the revived Flash, and John Broome was the writer of many of the earliest stories.|$|E
500|$|Leiter is Bond's saviour in Casino Royale, {{providing}} {{him with}} 32 million francs when Bond has been cleaned out by SMERSH paymaster Le Chiffre, calling it [...] "Marshall Aid". Media historian James Chapman notes that Bond's relationship with Leiter represented the Special Relationship between Britain and America, although the American Leiter {{is in the}} subordinate position to the British Bond. Academic Jeremy Black agrees, although {{points out that the}} Bond and Leiter relationship suggested [...] "a far smoother working of the Anglo-American alliance than was in fact the case." [...] Academic and writer Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, considered that this view of Leiter was partly because of Fleming's writing, noting that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> than he". Bond scholars Bennett and Woollacott note that although the two men share adventures, it is Bond who leads, not Leiter. Leiter's role is to [...] "suppl Bond with technical support and hardware, add... muscle where needed and money".|$|E
