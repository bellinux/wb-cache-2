500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score. [...] He {{convinced}} coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{with some}} alacrity, and his face, {{which was a}} little flushed, bore the marks of resolution.|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{stared down}} at the shoes, and walked slowly toward the door, where he turned.|$|E
60|$|But Wright was crazed by fury. He {{tugged at}} his hip, his face corded with purple welts, malignant, murderous, while <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|He was {{reflecting}} {{on these things}} when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room, when there came {{a knock at the}} door. It was Mammy Easter, in bright turban and apron,--was hospitality and comfort in the flesh.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} Mat did when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lodgings, was <b>to</b> fill and light his pipe. He {{then sat down}} on his bear-skins, and dragged the box close to him which he had brought from Dibbledean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh Lord!"

6000|$|This {{gave the}} {{vice-consul}} another pause. At {{the end of}} it <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "Is there anything I can do for you, Miss Claxon?" ...|$|E

60|$|A little after, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> very {{sore and}} shaken, the poorer by a purse which {{contained}} exactly one penny postage-stamp, by a cambric handkerchief, {{and by the}} all-important envelope.|$|E

60|$|Deane {{looked at}} his visitor {{for a moment in}} an astonishment which triumphed over the natural impassivity of his expression. Then a little flush rose in his cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and held out his hand.|$|E
60|$|Captain Cephas {{having said}} that it was the same to him, Captain Eli put on his cap and buttoned up his pea-jacket, declaring that the sooner <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house the better, as she might be {{thinking}} {{that she would have to}} move out of it now that things were different.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> as Tom spoke, looking {{anywhere}} but at me, and came forward slowly. He was loyal to no one, was Philip, {{not even to}} his father. When he was got within three paces he halted.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{went out}} of the room, reached the doorway of that other room and looked in. Mr. Bentley sat there; and the woman, whose tears had ceased to flow, was looking up into his face.|$|E

60|$|Thirty feet away, {{across the}} yard, Hodder saw the gleaming window {{from which the}} music came. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> Another verse began, {{with more of the}} brazen {{emphasis}} of the concert-hall singer than ever.
