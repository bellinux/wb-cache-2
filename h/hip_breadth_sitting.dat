40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the existing design of the classroom desk used in the basic education stage in public schools in the city of Benghazi. This article reports results of the second phase of the study which covers the fourth and the fifth grades. Anthropometric data were gathered for a total of 120 students (children of age 9 to 11 years old, half males) from four schools. Several body dimensions were measured for each student (popliteal height, popliteal-buttock length, shoulder height sitting, knee height, elbow height sitting, shoulder to elbow length, and <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>sitting).</b> The evaluation procedure involves the utilization of several equations relating body dimensions to desk dimensions. Each equation computes an acceptable range for each desk dimension based on the associated body dimension. Each desk dimension is compared to the range computed for the related body dimension for each student and percentages of matches/mismatches are determined accordingly. Results of the evaluation revealed considerable percentages of mismatches between the desk dimensions and students anthropometry...|$|E
40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{analytic study}} aimed to investigate ergonomic hazards {{in the workplace}} for musculoskeletal pain among university office workers. There were 142 full-time office staff from Khon Kaen University. Demographic characteristics and musculoskeletal pain were evaluated from a structured questionnaire. Ergonomic workstations, i. e. size of table, seat, work area and illuminations were measured at the workstations and anthropometric parameters were determined. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis which were percentage, mean, and standard deviation. Inferential statistics were chi-square test and the student t-test at 95 % confidence interval. The results showed that 81. 7 % of office workers were female, the mean age was 38. 0 ± 10. 0 years, the average work experience was 12. 3 ± 10. 8 years. One-month prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was 69. 0 %. The onset of symptoms was during working hours and the majorly reported the cause as prolonged sitting in the same posture at work (73. 3 %). From measurements, 55. 8 % of all workstations had insufficient illumination being lower than the minimum standard requirement (400 lux). Most workstations (75. 6 %) had significantly inappropriate height (above elbow height of workers) at p < 0. 001. From questionnaires, the seat height {{was significantly associated with}} musculoskeletal pain (p = 0. 034). Moreover, anthropometric characteristics of musculoskeletal pain cases (i. e. buttock-popliteal length, <b>hip</b> <b>breadth,</b> <b>sitting</b> elbow height) were significantly different from healthy office workers (p < 0. 05). The findings suggest that ergonomic workstations need to be improved appropriately for individual workers and improvements in working conditions following standard requirements should be considered...|$|E

40|$|Background: Anthropometry {{plays an}} {{important}} role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e. g. the obesity epidemic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections. Aim and Objectives: This study analyzed the variation in anthropometric dimensions and body composition parameters of working women employees of different geographical zones. Material and Methods: The study was undertaken on nine hundred forty (940) women employees of Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) working in seventeen different laboratories and belonged to different states of India. The age range of studied women was between 20 - 60 years. Fourteen body dimensions namely stature, popliteal height, knee height, buttock to popliteal length, <b>hip</b> <b>breadth,</b> waist breadth, shoulder breadth, forearm length, arm length, eye height (sitting), sitting shoulder height, hand length, hand breadth and elbow width were measured in cm using Martin anthropometers and Martin's sliding caliper.

Incorrect sitting postures and {{inappropriate}} school furniture can result in abnormalities in the vertebral column, back pain, neck pain, Fatigue and discomfort. Hence, this study was aimed to examine the match between students’ body dimensions and existing benches and desks dimensions in Hamadan female primary schools.. Material and Method: In this study, 624 students of Hamadan female primary schools were investigated and some of their anthropometric dimensions including shoulder height, elbow height, knee height, popliteal height, popliteal-buttock length and <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> were measured. In this sense, a chair (with adjustable height, depth and elbow support) and a caliper with movable jaw were used for measurement of anthropometric dimensions. The measurements were performed in a way that thighs were in full contact with the seat, there was a right angle between the thighs and legs, the feet were in full contact with the movable pedal, the trunk was straight and the back and hips were in full contact with the backrest. Following, the match of the dimensions of existing benches and desks with the appropriate dimensions (based on the students’ anthropometric dimensions) were examined..

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} body {{proportions}} {{of men and}} women from the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource (CAESAR) project, completed in 2002, and discusses proportions that have implications for protective apparel. CAESAR was an attempt to characterize the body size and shape of the adult population of NATO countries. Four countries were surveyed: the United States of America and Canada (North America), The Netherlands, and Italy. North America was selected because it had the largest population in NATO and the most diversity. The Netherlands was selected because it had the tallest population in NATO. Italy was selected because its population was amongst the shortest. Men and women were sampled in approximately equal numbers. Stepwise Discriminant Analyses were done using the 97 onedimensional measurements collected in CAESAR. The results indicate an unprecedented separation of male and female body shapes. All three regions had at least 98. 5 % accuracy in predicting gender with seven or fewer measurements. Some important body proportion {{differences between men and women}} will impact the fit and effectiveness of many types of protective apparel such as: flight suits, anti-g suits, cold-water immersion suits, chem. -bio protective suits, etc. While women are smaller than men on average for many body measurements, women are larger than men in some important aspects. For example, women are significantly larger than men in seated <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> in all three populations (26 mm larger on average) while at the same time significantly smaller than men for shoulder breadth (54 mm smaller on average).

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} three studies {{completed}} {{in the area of}} marine safety. The first study focused on the compatibility between the anthropometric characteristics of persons employed in the offshore oil industry in Newfoundland and liferaft and lifeboat evacuations systems employed in the offshore. Findings from this study suggest that manufacturers should consider shoulder <b>breadth,</b> rather than <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> measurements as a better criterion for determining seat design and lifesaving appliance occupancy capacities. Furthermore, the typical morphological features of a typical person employed in the Newfoundland offshore are considerably larger than the standards used in the type approval process. This study concludes that testing standards should be reconsidered. The second study assessed the requirements for measuring forces and accelerations acting on humans engaged in marine evacuation systems such as chutes and slides. While no subjects reported pain or injury due to these tasks, the upper limits of loading recorded might have the potential to injure a younger, older or less-fit person. The study concludes that manufacturers should be aware of human tolerance limits when developing evacuations systems. The third study consisted of the measurement of egress times for injured or physically challenged users of marine evacuation systems. Data from the study reported it takes on average 89. 3 s and a maximum of 129. 8 s for a mannequin loaded stretcher to descend through a slide and be placed into its final position in the raft. Throughout the trials, mannequins experienced head accelerations of approximately 2 Gs. There was a general trend that heavier stretchers seemed to better secure/restrain the mannequin and resulted in smaller accelerations during the descent.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of {{a seat in}} reducing vibration depends {{on the characteristics of}} the vibration, the dynamic characteristics of the seat, and the dynamic characteristics of the person sitting on the seat. However, it is not known whether seat cushions influence the dynamic response of the human body, whether the human body influences the dynamic response of seat cushions, or the relative importance of human body nonlinearity and seat nonlinearity in causing nonlinearity in measures of seat transmissibility. This study was designed to investigate the nonlinearity of the coupled seat and human body systems and to compare the apparent mass of the human body supported on rigid and foam seats. A frequency domain model was used to identify the dynamic parameters of seat foams and investigate their dependence on the subject-sitting weight and <b>hip</b> <b>breadth.</b> With 15 subjects, the force and acceleration at the seat base and acceleration at the subject interface were measured during random vertical vibration excitation (0. 25 – 25 Hz) at each of five vibration magnitudes, (0. 25 – 1. 6 ms? 2 r. m. s.) with four seating conditions (rigid flat seat and three foam cushions). The measurements are presented in terms of the subject’s apparent mass on the rigid and foam seat surfaces, and the transmissibility and dynamic stiffness of each of the foam cushions. Both the human body and the foams showed nonlinear softening behaviour, which resulted in nonlinear cushion transmissibility. The apparent masses of subjects sitting on the rigid seat and on foam cushions were similar, but with an apparent increase in damping when sitting on the foams. The foam dynamic stiffness showed complex correlations with characteristics of the human body, which differed between foams. The nonlinearities in cushion transmissibilities, expressed in terms of changes in resonance frequencies and moduli, were more dependent on human body nonlinearity than on cushion nonlinearity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the morpho-functional {{characteristics}} of male jiu-jitsu practitioners against a sample of strength-trained university students. Methods. The all-male research sample included 49 jiu-jitsu competitors and 30 university students actively involved in strength training. Measures of body mass and height, lower extremity length, sitting height, arm span, trunk width, skeletal breadths, circumferences and skinfold thicknesses of the trunk and extremities were collected. Body tissue composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Somatotype was classified according to the anthropometric method of Heath and Carter. Participants also performed three motor tests composed of the standing long jump, flexed arm hang, and sit-ups and two dynamometer tests measuring handgrip and back muscle strength. Differences between the measured characteristics in both samples were analyzed using Student’s t test. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to the determine the relationships between the morphological characteristics and the results of the motor tests. Results. The jiu-jitsu sample was slightly smaller than the strength-training students. In contrast, body mass was almost identical in both groups. The remaining length, height, and skinfold characteristics also did not differ significantly between the groups. Only <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> was significantly larger in the jiu-jitsu sample. No between-group differences were noted in the levels of endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy. The composite somatotype of the jiu-jitsu athletes (2. 1 - 5. 8 - 2. 0) was very similar to that of the strength-trained students (2. 1 - 5. 9 - 2. 4). Statistically significant differences were observed in the tests assessing muscle strength. Handgrip and back muscle strength was greater in the strength-training students, whereas the jiu-jitsu athletes performed better in all three motor tests. Conclusions. The minor morphological differences between the jiu-jitsu and strength-training groups may be due to the different sporting level of the participants. Whereas the intense weight training regime of the strength-training students allowed them to achieve higher results in the dynamometer tests, the more multidimensional aspect of jiu-jitsu training was reflected in achieving better results in the motor tests...|$|R

The pupils with age range from 5 to 14 years (mean = 9. 8 years, SD = 2. 9 years) were grouped into three age groups of 5 - 8 years, 9 - 12 years and 13 - 14 years. From the data obtained; 5 th, 10 th, 50 th, 75 th, 90 th and 95 th percentiles were computed. In addition, 2 -Tail Paired samples T-Test was conducted for the measurements of {{the male and female}} pupils for the three- age groups at 0. 05 level of significance. Based on the anthropometric data obtained, this paper proposes furniture design dimensions for seat height (32. 0 cm, 37. 3 cm and 40. 3 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively). It proposes seat depth (33. 0 cm, 38. 0 cm and 41. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively) and seat width (30. 0 cm, 31. 0 cm and 31. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively). Moreover, it proposes backrest height (upper) (39. 0 cm, 43. 0 cm and 44. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively) and arm rest (12. 0 cm, 13. 0 cm and 15. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively).

40|$|Effective digital human model (DHM) {{simulation}} of automotive driver packaging ergonomics, safety and comfort depends on accurate modelling of occupant posture, which is {{strongly related to}} the mechanical interaction between human body soft tissue and flexible seat components. This paper presents a finite-element study simulating the deflection of seat cushion foam and supportive seat structures, as well as human buttock and thigh soft tissue when seated. The three-dimensional data used for modelling thigh and buttock geometry were taken on one 95 th percentile male subject, representing the bivariate percentiles of the combined <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> (seated) and buttock-to-knee length distributions of a selected Australian and US population. A thigh-buttock surface shell based on this data was generated for the analytic model. A 6 mm neoprene layer was offset from the shell {{to account for the}} compression of body tissue expected through sitting in a seat. The thigh-buttock model is therefore made of two layers, covering thin to moderate thigh and buttock proportions, but not more fleshy sizes. To replicate the effects of skin and fat, the neoprene rubber layer was modelled as a hyperelastic material with viscoelastic behaviour in a Neo-Hookean material model. Finite element (FE) analysis was performed in ANSYS V 13 WB (Canonsburg, USA). It is hypothesized that the presented FE simulation delivers a valid result, compared to a standard SAE physical test and the real phenomenon of human-seat indentation. The analytical model is based on the CAD assembly of a Ford Territory seat. The optimized seat frame, suspension and foam pad CAD data were transformed and meshed into FE models and indented by the two layer, soft surface human FE model. Converging results with the least computational effort were achieved for a bonded connection between cushion and seat base as well as cushion and suspension, no separation between neoprene and indenter shell and a frictional connection between cushion pad and neoprene. The result is compared to a previous {{simulation of}} an indentation with a hard shell human finite-element model of equal geometry, and to the physical indentation result, which is approached with very high fidelity. We conclude that (a) 	SAE composite buttock form indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated in a FE model of merely similar geometry, but using a two-layer hard/soft structure. (b) 	Human-seat indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated with a simplified human buttock-thigh model for a selected anthropomorphism...|$|R

Median age at menarche (probit analysis) in gymnasts is 15. 6 +/- 2. 1 yr compared with 13. 2 +/- 1. 2 yr in Flemish girls. Anthropometric dimensions increase with age until about 16 yr and then tend to plateau. In contrast to body size, there is little variation in somatotype with age. Compared with adolescent girls, elite gymnasts are considerably shorter and lighter with narrower shoulders and hips, but the differences are more apparent after 17 yr. Elite gymnasts do not differ from nonathletes in relative leg length, but they have proportionally broader shoulders relative to hips.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was a statistics-based {{exploration}} of a typology of the female pelvis. The research sample included 172 females aged from 18 to 69. For measurements, the three dimensional CT images of pelvis were used. A cluster analysis was performed on anteroposterion and transverse diameters of the pelvic inlet and the midplane. The results revealed three clusters representing gynecoid, “narrow”, and intermediate types of female pelvis. The distribution of pelvic types in age groups indicates a tendency for the “narrow” pelvis to be presented more frequently in the group of younger females. Variability and typology of the female pelvis is a traditional topic in anthropological studies [3, 4, 13, 17]. The best known classification of the female pelvis was suggested by Caldwell and Moloy in 1933 [3] and it was based on the pelvic inlet shape. In the frame of this classification, four main pelvic types were suggested: gynecoid, android, anthropoid, and platypelloid. The development of this classification resulted in the identification of the mixed types and subtypes based on the width of the pelvic outlet [3]. As a result, more than twenty subtypes were suggested that complicated their analytical implication. In addition, the critics of this classification addressed the subjective impression in the judgments of pelvic shapes without a well established statistical base [19]. A tendency of increase in cesarean section is observed in the last decades [2, 5, 9, 15]. In Latvia, the number of cesarean section delivery is growing from 3. 9 % in 1980 to 23. 7 % in 2010 [18]. A narrow pelvis is one of the factors increasing the risk for cesarean section [12]. On the one hand, there is a solution for the narrow pelvis problem from the obstetric perspective. On the other hand, a more detailed analysis is needed from the anthropological perspective because of possible evolutionary trends in the human body in general and in the pelvic shape in particular. The {{aim of this}} study was a statistics-based exploration of a typology of the female pelvis. A well recognized anthropological tendency of the last century is the secular trend in growth. Previous studies demonstrate an increase in the mean height about 1 – 2 cm per decade in different European countries [6, 8]. An investigation of external body parameters of Latvian women also demonstrated significant changes in the period of 70 years. The women’s height increased for 6 cm, shoulder breadth increased for 0. 6 cm, and the <b>hip</b> <b>breadth</b> increased for 2. 9 cm [8]. Based on the relationship between the lesser pelvic parameters and height observed in previous studies [7, 11, 13], it is possible to expect that parameters of the lesser pelvis also changed during the last 6 – 7 decades. It {{should be noted that the}} female pelvic cavity has a cylindrical shape with the narrowest place in the midplane between two ischial spines (the bispinous diameter). The obstetric importance of the pelvic inlet and the midplane was emphasized in anthropological studies [3, 4, 16, 17]. In a typical female pelvis, a longer diameter of the inlet (the transverse diameter) and a longer diameter ofthe midplane (the anteroposterior diameter) are placed perpendicularly. Therefore, a fetal head rotates from a transverse position in the pelvic inlet to a sagittal position in the midplane. A narrowing of the pelvic cavity in the midplane causes this rotation. Stalberg at al. [12] demonstrated that a narrow pelvic midplane is an important reason for the emergency cesarean section. In addition, an inadequate proportion of the pelvic inlet also causes cesarean section [1]. Therefore, both the pelvic inlet and the midplane are highly important from the anthropological perspective and need to be included in a statistics-based exploration of the female pelvic typology. Changing body parameters allow to expect age differences in a distribution of pelvic types between younger and older females. As a result, two research questions were posed for the presentstudy: 1. What female pelvic types could be detected on the basis of the measures of the inlet and the midplane of the lesser pelvis? 2. How does the distribution of female pelvic types among age groups differ...|$|R
40|$|Classification in Paralympic Athletics aims to {{minimise}} {{the impact}} of impairment {{on the outcome of}} competition so that athletes compete against those who experience a similar degree of difficulty in performing an activity. This will ensure that success in Paralympic competition is determined by the same factors as non-disabled athletics – talent, motivation, and training. To achieve an evidence-based system of classification requires the development of valid, reliable methods to assess impairment and activity limitation, and the quantification of how much impairment impacts athletic performance. The overall aim of this thesis is to contribute towards the development of an evidence-based system of classification for Paralympic Athletics through the development and evaluation of methods to assess muscle strength and a test battery of supplementary activity limitation tests for running. The focus of chapters two, three, four and five is strength assessment. Chapter 2 reviews the relevant scientific literature, providing a definition of strength and an overview of neurological, morphological, psychological and assessment characteristics which affect strength assessment and the mechanisms by which strength can be impaired and improved. Requirements for methods of assessing strength impairment for the purposes of classifying athletes are reviewed and it is concluded that multi-joint isometric tests are the most appropriate. Chapter 3 provides a detailed description of equipment and protocols for 10 strength tests – five upper body strength tests, two trunk strength tests and three lower body tests – that are consistent with the criteria proposed in Chapter 2. The tests feature a purpose-built isometric strength testing rig comprising a rigid frame, and a fully adjustable, wheelchair accessible seat which permits anthropometrically standardised positioning relative to an S-type load cell. Study 1 is presented in Chapter 4. The purpose of Study 1 was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the novel muscle strength tests in non-disabled participants and determine if body size {{was a significant predictor of}} strength in these tests. Sixty-three males and fifty-five females attended a one hour testing session in which anthropometric measures and strength tests were performed. Seventeen participants returned for a second session within 10 days to allow analysis of reliability. Normal performance ranges were developed to allow results of athletes with a disability to be meaningfully interpreted in future studies. Analysis demonstrated that reliability was acceptable in all tests. The results also showed that no single anthropometric measure was predictive of strength performance; however individual anthropometric measures were identified for each test of strength. Multiple regression indicated that more than 10 % of the variance in three upper body, and one lower body strength test for males and two upper body strength tests for females could be explained by anthropometric measures. This will require the measurement of chest depth, shoulder <b>breadth,</b> <b>sitting</b> height and femur breadth in males, and humerus length, humerus breadth and forearm length in females, for future use of these tests in classification. Study 2 is presented in Chapter 5. The purpose of this study was evaluating the relationship between strength and wheelchair racing performance in thirteen international-level athletes with a spinal cord injury. Participants completed four upper body strength tests. Performance was evaluated on a wheelchair ergometer and on the track. Participants were designated as ‘full trunk strength’ or ‘not full trunk strength’ based on manual muscle testing scores. Analysis showed the contribution of trunk strength to performance was not significantly greater in athletes with full trunk strength as opposed to those without full trunk strength. It was also demonstrated that the relationship between trunk strength and performance was higher in the conditions of increased resistance seen on the wheelchair ergometer as compared to the track. The focus of Chapter 6 is not strength evaluation but evaluation of athletic performance. While an evaluation of the relationship between impairment and performance will allow {{the impact of}} impairment on performance to be determined, issues of training and non-compliance must be considered in classification. The aim of Study 3 was to identify a battery of tests that are predictive of running performance. Sixty-seven non-disabled participants completed a performance test and five alternative activity limitation tests (standing Broad Jump, 4 Bounds, 10 m Skip, Running in Place and Split Jumps). Nine participants returned within 14 days to allow for evaluation of reliability. Reliability was high for all tests. Pearson’s correlations with 30 m Sprint were moderate to strong for Standing Broad Jump, 4 Bounds and 10 m Skip, but weaker for Split Jumps and Running in Place. Multiple regression indicated that Standing Broad Jump, 4 Bounds and 10 m Skip explained 75 % of variance in running performance. Normal performance ranges for the test battery were provided. This thesis has contributed significantly towards the development of an evidence-based system of classification in Paralympic athletics. A review of literature determined multi-joint, isometric strength tests to be suitable for classification. Following the development and description of these protocols, an evaluation of the psychometric properties of the strength test battery was performed in Study 1. The second study provided an evaluation of the relationship between trunk strength impairment and performance in wheelchair racing. This will provide a necessary method and stimulus for research that should, in future, determine the impact of strength impairment on all Paralympic activities. The supplementary activity limitation test battery developed for running in study three was valid and reliable and provides a method for the development of test batteries for other fundamental activities in Paralympic athletics...|$|R

The survey consisted of three visits per person, each encompassing a 24 -hour dietary recall, body measurements and questionnaires. The body measurements included weight, height, waist and <b>hip</b> circumference, elbow <b>breadth</b> and body-fat using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Other measurements taken were of blood pressure and blood glucose. By comparison, the Niuean population have a higher percentage energy contribution from fat and protein but a lower contribution from total carbohydrates than the NZ population. These differences in energy contributions may attribute to some extent to the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Niuean population. Some nutrient intakes were inadequate and are of some concern particularly calcium, iron, and vitamin A. Forty-four percent and {{forty percent of the}} subjects had calcium and iron intakes below two-thirds of the RDI respectively. Alcohol consumption was much more common among the men than the women. Based on the reported volumes consumed 83 % of the men who drank alcohol, drank to intoxicating levels well above the legal limit, during a drinking session. The average weight of the Niuean men was 92 kg; some 13 kg heavier than the average in 1987 and 23 kg heavier than the average in 1953. Likewise with the women whose average weight was 87 kg; 10 kg heavier than the average in 1987 and 25 kg heavier than the average in 1953. The prevalence of obesity and overweight in the Niuean population studied is very high, in both the men and the women.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{morphological}} characteristics of experienced futsal players with professional soccer players. Methods. The research sample included 22 university futsal players and 22 professional soccer players. Parameters including body height and mass, skinfold thicknesses of the trunk and extremities, lower limb length, trunk width, humerus and femur bone breadths, and the circumferences of the chest, hips, thighs, and calves were used to calculate various somatic indices. Somatotyping was performed using the Heath–carter method. Differences in the characteristics between the futsal and soccer players were analyzed using Student’s t test. Intragroup analysis was also performed on futsal players depending on player position and compared with the arithmetic means and standard deviations of all variables of the entire sample. Results. compared with their soccer-playing peers, the futsal players were shorter, weighed less, had shorter lower limbs, narrower hips, and smaller hip circumference and bone breadth values. In contrast, higher levels of body fat and endomorphy were noted in this group. The proportion of mesomorphs and ectomorphs were similar in both groups. Futsal goalkeepers were differentiated by greater subcutaneous adiposity and body mass. Defenders had the slimmest body shape, with relatively narrower shoulders and <b>hips,</b> smaller bone <b>breadths,</b> and lower levels of adiposity. The body build of wingers was slightly larger. Pivoters were characterized by greater body height and larger values for the characteristics measuring the lateral trunk dimensions. Conclusions. The observed morphological differences between futsal and soccer players were mainly in body height and height-associated characteristics. This indicates that no specialized approach in futsal recruitment is currently used. This points to the need to develop a specialized approach in the player recruitment stage, as the tactical and technical constructs of futsal set the game apart from other indoor soccer games, finding that futsal players share a number of morphological similarities with handball players...|$|R
