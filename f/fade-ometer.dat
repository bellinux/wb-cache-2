40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Thirteen fabrics {{containing}} "Rovana" (saran), "Verel" (mod-acrylic), and rayon {{were examined}} for colorfastness to light and laundering, shrinkage, tensile strength, elongation, abrasion-resistance and flammability. The fabrics represented three weaves: plain, twill and leno; and three colors: white, eggshell and turquoise. The fiber contents, {{according to the}} manufacturers, varied from 20 percent "Rovana", 56 percent "Verel" and 24 percent rayon to 49. 3 "Rovana", 30. 5 percent "Verel" and 20. 2 percent rayon. Chemical analysis revealed {{that all of the}} fabrics varied from the manufacturers' stated fiber contents. A <b>Fade-Ometer</b> was used to test for colorfastness to light. Although no fading was visible to the eye, the plain weave fabrics of high "Rovana" content showed the greatest color change according to a Gardner Color Difference Meter. White fabrics and broken twill weave fabrics were modified also. Washing had little effect on the colors. Shrinkage was most pronounced in the filling direction and was due chiefly to laundering. Fabrics fabricated in a broken twill weave of approximately 30 percent "Rovana" exhibited slightly more shrinkage than the four percent allowance recommended by the American Hotel Association. The remaining fabrics shrank only approximately one percent. Fabrics appeared to be most affected by 63. 5 Â°C temperatures in an oven during the first 50 hours according to a heat study which measured shrinkage and tensile strength, but generally the effect was slight. There was considerable variation in tensile strength of the filling yarns but the percentage retained after <b>Fade-Ometer</b> exposure and launderings was good. The "Rovana" warp yarns were slightly less strong but retained more strength. Fabrics of high "Verel" content showed the greatest elongation in the filling direction and fabrics of high "Rovana" in the warp direction. Loss of body was noticed as a result of abrasion, with loose weaves and fabrics of high "Rovana" content being affected the most. All of the fabrics proved to be flame-resistant as they would not support combustion. As a result of this study, these fabrics, particularly the plain weave fabrics containing 30 percent "Rovana", 50 percent "Verel" and 20 percent rayon, are recommended for home and institutional use...|$|E
