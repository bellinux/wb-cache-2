For example, he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer--but he never opens the main compartment without first closing the back door <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> No. 1--he never opens the main compartment without first pulling out the drawer--he never shuts the drawer without first shutting the main compartment--he never opens the back door <b>of</b> <b>cupboard</b> No. 1 while the main compartment is open--and the game of chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now if it were observed that never, in any single instance, did M.

Further, the scale of 1 : 4 is used to fabricate the pilot model. After the fabrication process, it is founded that the designed modeling of foldable is specified to fold the cupboard is totally different compared to pilot model due to lack of resources. Still, folding design for both modeling and pilot modeling can be used as actual folding method because the material selection which is PVC for structure cover are high in strength and have moisture resistant compared to current product. The processes to fabricate this cupboard used cutting, joining, and finishing...|$|R
