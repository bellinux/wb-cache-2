5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an <b>increased</b> <b>risk.</b> The size of the <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are at <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, {{but some of the}} <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> appears to be independent.|$|E

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of venous and arterial blood clots. Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E

Sexual assault is also believed to carry an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, {{and there may be}} a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of liver diseases.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular disease and some also an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E

40|$|The non-expected-utility {{theories}} of decision under risk have favored {{the appearance of}} new notions of <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> like monotone <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> (based {{on the notion of}} comonotonic random variables) or new notions of risk aversion like aversion to monotone <b>increasing</b> <b>risk,</b> in better agreement with these new theories. After a survey of all the possible notions of <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> and of risk aversion and their intrinsic definitions, we show that contrary to expected-utility theory where all the notions of risk aversion have the same characterization (u concave), in the framework of rank-dependent expected utility (one of the most well known of the non-expectedutility models), the characterizations of all these notions of risk aversion are different. Moreover, we show that, even in the expected-utility framework, the new notion of monotone <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> can give better answers to some problems of comparative statics such as in portfolio choice or in partial insurance. This new notion also can suggest more intuitive approaches to inequalities measurement. The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory (1995) 20, 73 – 91. doi: 10. 1007 /BF 01098959...|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
