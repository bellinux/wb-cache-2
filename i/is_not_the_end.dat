25|$|In May 2016 the Baby Animals re-released Baby Animals as Baby Animals 25th Anniversary (or BA25), to {{celebrate}} 25 {{years since the}} original release of their debut. This expanded version includes live songs, unreleased tracks, B-sides and pre-studio demos. Also in that month they provided two gigs with the original line-up performing the debut album in full and the new line-up playing tracks from This <b>Is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>End.</b> In March 2017, it was announced the Baby Animals will perform a national headline tour with The Screaming Jets in June and July 2017.|$|E

25|$|Other objects {{associated}} with Santa Muerte include scales, an hourglass, an owl, and an oil lamp. The scales allude to equity, justice, and impartiality, {{as well as}} divine will. An hourglass indicates the time of life on earth and also the belief that death <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> as the hourglass can be inverted to start over. The hourglass denotes Santa Muerte's relationship with {{time as well as}} with the worlds above and below. It also symbolizes patience. An owl symbolizes her ability to navigate the darkness and her wisdom. The owl is also said to act as a messenger. A lamp symbolizes intelligence and spirit, to light the way through the darkness of ignorance and doubt.|$|E
25|$|The casein kinase 1 (CKI) {{family of}} kinases {{is a highly}} conserved group of {{proteins}} that are found in organisms from Arabidopsis, to Drosophila, to humans. Because dbt {{is a member of}} this family, questions arose about the role of these related genes in other model systems. Within mammals, there are seven CKI isoforms, all with various roles surrounding the phosphorylation of proteins. CKIε was found to be most homologous to dbt, with a similarity of 86%. Along with this genetic similarity, the proteins {{have been found to be}} functionally homologous. Just as phosphorylation by dbt in Drosophila targets PER proteins for proteasome degradation, CKIε phosphorylation reduces the stability of mammalian PER proteins, labeling them for degradation. However, while dbt and CKIε do play similar roles in their respective organisms, studies looking at the effectiveness of CKIε in Drosophila have shown that they are not completely functionally interchangeable. Nonetheless, the functions are extremely similar. Specifically, CKIε has been shown to reduce the half-life of mPER1, one of the three mammalian PER homologs. In addition, nuclear localization of the mPER proteins is related to phosphorylation, adding another essential role to the activity of the CKIε protein. Overall, the genetic similarity of dbt and CKIε <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the story; the roles they play within the circadian clock in their respective systems are almost identical. Both are involved with periodic phosphorylation, regulating the oscillations of the circadian clocks.|$|E

The location was a significant one, between the wealthy West End and poorer areas to the east. The argument that the collection could be accessed by people of all social classes outstripped other concerns, such as the pollution of central London or the failings of Wilkins's building, when the prospect of a move to South Kensington was mooted in the 1850s. According to the Parliamentary Commission of 1857, [...] "The existence of the pictures <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> purpose of the collection, but the means only to give the people an ennobling enjoyment".|$|E

2500|$|The last glacial {{period is}} {{sometimes}} colloquially {{referred to as}} the [...] "last ice age", though this use is incorrect because an ice age is a longer period of cold temperature in which ice sheets cover large parts of the Earth, such as Antarctica.

Thus, {{the end of the last}} glacial period <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the last ice age. The end of the last glacial period was about 11,700 years ago, while the end of the last ice age has not yet come.|$|E

[...] According to a local reporter of Voice of America, the whole district {{was on the verge of}} collapse. ISIL-K began to propagate its victory at Tora Bora on its Radio Khilafat, while urging locals who had fled to return to their homes. According to security analyst and counter-terrorism expert David Otto, however, the area around Tora Bora was so hostile to ISIL-K and the Taliban so entrenched there that the former group would not be able to hold it for long.|$|E

2500|$|Baby Animals are an Australian {{hard rock}} band active from October 1989 to 1996 and {{reformed}} in 2007. The original line-up was Frank Celenza on drums; Suze DeMarchi on lead vocals and guitar; Dave Leslie on guitar and backing vocals; and Eddie Parise on bass guitar and backing vocals. They recorded two studio albums, Baby Animals (September 1991) – which peaked at No.1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and Shaved and Dangerous (August 1993) – which reached No.2. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 the group won three trophies: Album of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Album for Baby Animals and Breakthrough Artist – Single for [...] "Early Warning" [...] (April 1991). Baby Animals was listed in 100 Best Australian Albums (October 2010). The reunited line-up are DeMarchi, Leslie, Dario Bortolin on bass guitar and Mick Skelton on drums and percussion. Their fourth studio album, This <b>Is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>End,</b> was issued in May 2013, which reached the top20.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2010 London Marathon, he set {{his sights}} on beating the {{defending}} champion Samuel Wanjiru. Wanjiru dropped out at 20km, however, and Kebede saw off a challenge from Abel Kirui at the 30km mark. The pacemakers were not quick through the early stages and Kebede had enough energy to sprint for the line, but his time of 2:05:19 was nine seconds short of the record and a second away from Kebede's best. The 2010 Chicago Marathon in October provided a much closer battle with Wanjiru. Kebede closely followed the pacemakers and repeatedly surged ahead of the field. Wanjiru managed to make up ground each time and, running in increasingly high temperatures, Kebede was overtaken by him in the last 400m and he finished in second place with a time of 2:06:43. This result also left him behind Wanjiru {{in the race for the}} World Marathon Majors jackpot, but he was generally positive about the defeat: [...] "I am happy. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> I will run again".|$|E
