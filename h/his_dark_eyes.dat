500|$|As Marko matured, {{he became}} headstrong; Vuka≈°in {{once said that}} he had no control over his son, who went {{wherever}} he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes,</b> his black moustache {{was the size of a}} six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A Damascus sabre swung at his waist, and a spear was slung across his back. Marko's pernach weighed 66okas (...) and hung on the left side of his saddle, balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle's right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry cornel wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Dowson {{shook his}} head. [...] "He's so good-looking, is Charlie," [...] he said, slowly; [...] "that's {{the worst of}} it. Wot with <b>'is</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> and <b>his</b> curly 'air----" ...|$|R
6000|$|But Oscar own'd a hero's soul, [...] <b>His</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eye</b> {{shone through}} beams of truth; [...] Allan had early learn'd controul, [...] And smooth his words had been from youth.|$|R
60|$|Amid the breathless {{silence that}} {{followed}} this act of such great significance, Wingenund advanced toward the knoll with slow, stately step. <b>His</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eye</b> swept the glade with lightning scorn; his glance alone revealed the passion that swayed him.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} hat, and <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> sought mine interrogatively.|$|E
60|$|Lamartine {{looked at}} me with a curious {{expression}} in <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|He nodded, <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed {{upon her}} face but {{displaying}} no expression.|$|E
6000|$|... "And will Major Bellenden {{undertake}} this?" [...] said Claverhouse hastily, {{a joyful}} light glancing from <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eye</b> {{as he turned}} it on the veteran,--"Yet why should I question it? it is {{of a piece with}} the rest of his life.--But have you the means, Major?" ...|$|R
60|$|He raised <b>his</b> <b>dark,</b> gentle <b>eyes</b> to my {{face and}} seemed surprised.|$|R
60|$|Lord Montacute cast <b>his</b> <b>dark,</b> {{intelligent}} <b>eyes</b> {{upon the}} floor, and seemed plunged in thought.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, and {{the same}} odd, superstitious look came into <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Flambeau {{raised a}} grave face, and fixed <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> on his friend.|$|E
60|$|The publican glanced round suddenly. It {{seemed that}} only <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> moved.|$|E
60|$|Ravenswood fixed {{upon her}} <b>his</b> keen <b>dark</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{as if he}} was desirous of {{penetrating}} into her very soul.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} them again, {{and they saw}} that he was very pale, that <b>his</b> great <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> glowed oddly.|$|R
60|$|Moody {{answered}} a little coldly and stiffly. <b>His</b> <b>dark,</b> deeply-set <b>eyes</b> rested on Isabel with an uneasy look.|$|R
60|$|Then {{his head}} fell back, <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, and the Messenger was dead.|$|E
60|$|The captain sighed, and a gleam I did not {{understand}} came into <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Francesco stood up, {{his face}} mighty serious, and <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> full of uneasy thought.|$|E
60|$|Alec fixed {{upon him}} <b>his</b> <b>dark,</b> firm <b>eyes.</b> The man seemed an average sort of person, not without intelligence.|$|R
60|$|Captain Sevier fixed <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> blue <b>eyes</b> on Polly Ann with approbation, and {{he bowed}} to her very gracefully.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{shook hands with}} Jill, {{flashing}} an approving glance at her out of <b>his</b> <b>dark,</b> restless <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin bit his lip, and <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> flashed {{out with}} a sudden fire.|$|E
60|$|A short, dark-skinned man had buttonholed a {{neighbor}} and was speaking vivaciously, <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> snapping.|$|E
60|$|She, seeing <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} her, broke {{off from her}} drying with a laugh.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} basin the man had risen to serenity; at the second he was jovial; at the third, argumentative, at the fourth, the qualities {{signified}} by the shape of his face, the occasional clench of his mouth, and the fiery spark of <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eye,</b> began to tell in his conduct; he was overbearing--even brilliantly quarrelsome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{a secret}} of state, or are you {{permitted}} to say whither so strong a force has so suddenly sailed?" [...] demanded the baronet, glancing <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eye</b> so expressively towards the other as to give him, in the growing obscurity, the appearance of an inquisitor. [...] "I had been told the fleet would wait for orders from London?" ...|$|R
60|$|Capitaine Brunot {{turned to}} me with a gentle smile, and there was a {{wonderful}} look in <b>his</b> <b>dark,</b> kind <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|He smiled, {{and shot}} as evil {{a glance at}} me as could come from <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Nikasti {{shook his}} head slowly. He was very small, and <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> seemed filled with melancholy.|$|E

50|$|Thos (Thomas) Howard, who is Celandine's serious older by {{five years}} brother. He is quick {{tempered}} like <b>his</b> father. <b>Dark</b> <b>eyes</b> and hair.|$|R
60|$|Then {{again he}} stood still, and again faced the Englishman, <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> enquiring <b>eyes</b> seeming {{to probe the}} latter's deepest thoughts.|$|R
60|$|So he {{went down}} to the beach; <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> blue <b>eyes,</b> <b>darker</b> from last night's experience, smiled always with the pride of love. He undressed by his usual altar-stone.|$|R
