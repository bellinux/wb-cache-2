In 1978, after completing his degree and a one-year practise, Collins began pursuing a master's degree in veterinary pathology at Michigan State University. In 1980, he started his Ph.D. in Veterinary Pathology and Pathobiology. During his Ph.D., he was hired by Martin Berglund at South Dakota State University to help with swine <b>diagnostic</b> <b>pathology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Whitney was {{pathologist}} to the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1878 to {{his retirement}} in 1916; from 1901 to 1916, he was the MGH's first Surgical Pathologist. Whitney entered his profession {{at the time when}} the microscope was just beginning to feature prominently in medical teaching and practice and when scientific medicine was beginning to receive signature in the medical curriculum. MGH created a new pathology department in 1896, reflecting the growing importance of this new field. [...] "During his tenure, Whitney saw the movement of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>pathology</b> from the realm of the surgeon to the hand of the specialist pathologist." ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} feature of granulomas {{is whether or not}} they contain necrosis. Necrosis refers to dead cells that, under the microscope, appear as a mass of formless debris with no nuclei present. A related term, [...] "caseation" [...] (literally: turning to cheese) refers to a form of necrosis that, to the unaided eye (i.e., without a microscope), appears cheese-like ("caseous"), and is typically (but not uniquely) a feature of the granulomas of tuberculosis. The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes. There are several exceptions to this general rule, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day <b>diagnostic</b> <b>pathology.</b>|$|E
