5000|$|The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) {{provides}} a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence. The MOU takes into account matters such as military forces training; exercises and military education; exchange of views on EU Common Security and Defence Policy; potential for joint contributions to UN Crisis Management Operations; joint procurement initiatives; pooling and sharing resources; general sharing of reform in defence services; potential for staff exchanges; sharing of information, and joint contribution to Security Sector Reform and capacity building in crisis locations. It envisages cooperation and exchanges involving both civil and military personnel.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Rising immigration rates in Western Europe concur with increasing anti-immigrant attitudes. While assessments of welfare eligibility in the United States demonstrably hinge on how public servants perceive different racial groups as deserving, we know less about ethnically motivated discrimination in the European context. This paper argues that Switzerland is a critical case for studying such developments. It combines social construction theory and the deservingness heuristic to analyze how social constructions of Swiss natives and immigrants influence 90 disability benefits insurance procedures. Findings reveal that immigrants are perceived as less deserving and less powerful than Swiss applicants. Thus, Swiss welfare workers do not allocate welfare benefits independently of an applicant's nationality. Our results raise fundamental questions about the equal treatment of welfare applicants in times of rising immigration and anti-immigrant attitudes. The feed-forward effects of social constructions imply longer-term consequences for <b>good</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and society that require scholarly attention...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} perception that conducting business on the Internet has a higher risk than in the traditional face-to-face environment. This is due, in part, to security concerns and {{to the need for}} an extra level of trust incurred when paying for goods or services before receiving them. For the majority of consumers, the benefits of immediate access and search capabilities, as well as 24 -hour access to businesses on a global scale, outweigh many of these security and trust concerns. Nonetheless, a healthy skepticism of some Web sites, and to deals offered, is essential because for a few people the Internet provides an easy means of concealing illegal and malicious activities. While there is a common perception that the security of Internet-based transactions is weak, the reality is otherwise. Current security techniques are much stronger than techniques used when conducting transactions via fax or over the telephone. Nonetheless, although the perception of vulnerability is stronger than the reality, digital threats do need to be taken seriously. If an Internet organization is to survive and prosper, it must be fully aware of the threats and attacks (both internal and external) that can be used against it. Both businesses and government agencies operating electronically need to be vigilant against information theft, espionage and liability. They need to establish as many deterrents, defenses, and security measures as necessary, to protect their systems and data, and to understand the principles behind these to counter new threats. Further, the digital business needs to establish an ongoing maintenance program, and <b>good</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>practices,</b> to ensure security measures are kept up to date.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{problems}} with the <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and procedures in the IMF. It argues that currently the IMF lacks <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and procedures that are consistent with the requirements of good governance. There are 2 requirements for such <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> and procedures. The first is clearly articulated and publicly available standards that guide IMF staff in their work and that other stakeholders can utilize in measuring the performance of IMF staff. These standards should set out both the substantive and procedural requirements applicable to the operations of the IMF. The second is a mechanism through which IMF staff and management can be held accountable for their failure to comply with the applicable procedures. The paper concludes with recommendations on designing a formal and comprehensive set of operational policies and procedures for the IMG and a call for the IMF to establish and ombudsman to oversee compliance with these operational policies and procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{attain a}} {{competitive}} advantage and remain in the competitive market, organizations {{should focus on the}} employee job performance significantly. Achieving the Job performance of the employees has been a critical issue in both private and public sector organizations. Hence it is needed to investigate how the practices of the public banks in Sri Lanka, affect the job performance of their employees. Thus the objective of this research was to investigate the impact of <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> on job performance of the public banks in Sri Lanka. The independent variable was <b>administrative</b> <b>practices,</b> with two sub variables named Reward Management and Decision Making and the dependent variable was job performance. The reliability of the instruments were tested against the survey data. This study was engaged in hypothesis testing and it was corelational. This research was conducted in the natural environment where work proceeds normally, with less interference of the researchers (noncontrived). Data was collected from each individual: employees of the public banks, and the study was cross sectional. The analysis was based on the information collected using a self administered questionnaire from 92 Managerial, Executive and Non Executive employees doing a variety of jobs in the Public Banks in Colombo District. Data used for analysis were totally based on primary data which was collected using a questionnaire developed by the researcher. The analysis was done by simple regression models using the software SPSS 15. 0. According to the results, there is an impact on <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> on job performance, but it is not significant. Based on that it can be concluded employee‘s job performance have been impacted by <b>administrative</b> <b>practices,</b> and the job performance can be improved by developing the <b>administrative</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the opinions of administrators regarding <b>administrative</b> <b>practices</b> associated with declining enrollment. Options chosen by three types of administrators in school districts experiencing a decline in enrollment were compared to those chosen by administrators in school districts not experiencing a decline in enrollment. The design of this investigation was ex post facto in nature. A survey study included 1, 000 randomly sampled administrators from suburban school systems in five states located in the Great Lakes area. The three types of administrators included in the study were junior high school principals, senior high school principals, and superintendents. Three hypotheses were developed and tested by three dependent variables represented by options associated with Instructional Practices, Personnel <b>Practices,</b> and <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices.</b> The primary independent variables were Enrollment Status and Administrative Position. Relevant demographic variables such as Age, Number of Years of Educational Administrative Experience, and Recency of Graduate Work also were utilized in testing the hypotheses. Means were calculated for the scores on the three dependent variables for the three types of administrators. Both two-way and three-way factorial analyses were utilized to test the null hypotheses for significant main effect differences and interactions. The principal findings of the study indicated that administrators held similar opinions regarding Instructional Practices options and Personnel Practices options. However, there were significant main effect differences among administrators regarding <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices</b> options. Administrators seemed more willing to implement cutbacks represented in <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices.</b> This finding was the same both for the administrators en toto and for those sorted by Enrollment Status. Superintendents apparently were more willing to make cutbacks in <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices</b> than the two types of principals. Number of Years of Educational Administrative Experience had an impact upon the choices selected by administrators when testing for Enrollment Status, but only on the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Practices</b> options. Significant interactions were evident within those schools experiencing no decline in enrollment. Within school districts not experiencing a decline in enrollment, administrators with 6 - 10 Years of Educational Administrative Experience were more willing to implement cutbacks than were others...|$|R
