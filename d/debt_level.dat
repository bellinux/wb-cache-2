5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the <b>debt</b> <b>level</b> would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the <b>debt</b> <b>level).</b> Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low <b>debt</b> <b>level</b> among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s <b>debt</b> <b>level</b> to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the capital structure in companies acquired by Private Equity {{companies in the}} period 1997 to 2007 in Norway. The purpose of the analysis is to see whether debt ratios in the companies that have been acquired by PE companies increase after the year they were acquired compared to the {{two years before the}} acquisition. Secondly, the thesis analyses whether the capital structure, specifically the <b>debt</b> <b>levels</b> in companies that have been acquired by PE companies could be explained by other company or market characteristics than what is commonly said to explain <b>debt</b> <b>levels</b> in companies. Finally, the thesis tests whether there is a relationship between the debt ratios and the General Partner commitment as percentage of average personal wealth. The results show that the differences between debt ratios in the years after the acquisition and the years before the acquisition are not statistically significantly different from zero, and thus one cannot infer that the companies have larger debt ratios after the acquisition than before the acquisition. Secondly, the analysis of the sample shows that size measured by sales revenue and profitability measured by EBITDA both are positively related to <b>debt</b> <b>levels,</b> implying that larger companies and companies that are more profitable have larger <b>debt</b> <b>levels.</b> Further, the analysis show that there is a negative relationship between asset tangibility and <b>debt</b> <b>levels,</b> which implies that companies with high asset tangibility have lower <b>debt</b> <b>levels.</b> The analysis showed also that there is a positive relationship between investment year and <b>debt</b> <b>levels,</b> which could be interpreted that <b>debt</b> <b>levels</b> have been increasing since 1997 and until 2007. Finally, the analysis showed that there is a negative relationship between General Partner commitments as percentage of average wealth per partner and General Partner commitments as percentage of average wealth per professional in the PE company, which implies that in this model, the <b>debt</b> <b>levels</b> decrease when General Partner commitment percentages increases. Based on this, one can infer that General Partners who invest a larger portion of their personal wealth in the fund, take on less risk in the buyout process by having lower <b>debt</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

The Congressional Budget Office projected two weeks prior to Obama's first inauguration that the deficit in FY 2009 would be $1.2 trillion and that the debt increase over the following decade would be $3.1 trillion assuming the expiration of the Bush tax cuts as scheduled in 2010, or around $6.0 trillion if the Bush tax cuts were extended at all income levels.

25|$|The sooner {{austerity}} {{steps are}} taken (e.g., raising revenues or reducing spending {{or a combination}} of both), the smaller those changes can be to maintain or reduce the <b>debt</b> <b>level</b> projected in 2039. For example, under the baseline scenario, stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP at 74% (its current level) would require non-interest spending cuts and/or tax hikes of 1.2% of GDP annually if implemented in 2015, or 1.5% of GDP annually if begun in 2020. To bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its 40-year average of 39%, the austerity measures required would be 2.6% GDP if begun in 2015 and 3.2% GDP if begun in 2020. Over the 1974 to 2013 period, federal spending averaged 20.5% GDP and revenue 17.4% GDP. For scale, a 2% GDP reduction in spending would be approximately a 10% spending cut.|$|E

This amplifying effect of net foreign liabilities is larger in the Eurozone than in standalone advanced economies.

This version of the package was approved by OTA on August 18, 1994.

Reasons for opposition to the package were varied, including concerns over OTA's <b>debt</b> <b>level,</b> toll increases necessary to fund the package, the state of the bond market, a federal investigation examining previous OTA bond sales, lack of details given about the package, the size of the package, and the proposed method by which the bonds would be sold.|$|E
