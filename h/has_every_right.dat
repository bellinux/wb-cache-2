Notwithstanding, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{has vowed to}} continue to press the United States on this matter.

2500|$|British Foreign Secretary William Hague said: [...] "I unreservedly condemn today's {{attack from}} Gaza {{on a bus}} {{carrying}} school children in southern Israel. The initial reports we have received suggest the bus was deliberately targeted and that a 16-year-old boy has been critically injured. This is a despicable and cowardly act that stands {{in stark contrast to}} people’s desire for peaceful reform across the region. Violence will never deliver peace. I reiterate that Hamas must halt these strikes immediately, and rein in other militant factions in Gaza. This attack further highlights Israel's legitimate security concerns.

2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 13% of 15 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.6/10. [...] Contemporary reviews were generally negative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "stale through and through, derived from countless cop-buddy formula thrillers, drenched in violence and devoid {{of so much}} as a whiff of real life." [...] Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This story turns out to be much more mundane than its outrageously clever premise." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the film's imaginative weapons and humor make it an entertaining crowd-pleaser but criticized its cynical violence and lack of moral consciousness. [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post compared it to Hardware and said its influences are more subtle, though it suffers from using too much humor. [...] Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote that the film [...] "isn't as bad as it <b>has</b> <b>every</b> <b>right</b> to be" [...] and [...] "provides some fun for fans of the genre". Lou Cedrone of The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Apart from the gore, I Come in Peace is an amusing mixture of action, science-fiction and comedy." [...] Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News said that it is a better than usual rip-off of The Terminator with some original ideas. [...] Time Out London wrote, [...] "With an upbeat script and a healthy sense of humour, this is an unashamedly ridiculous affair with moderate ambitions and matching success." ...|$|E
