The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the removal of humic compounds using Al+ 3 and Fe+ 3 compounds from Shahrchay river water. in Urmia city. Methods: This study was done experimental. Experiments perform in jar test batch reactor in different values of pH, Al+ 3 and Fe+ 3. Also THMs was measured under optimal removal conditions Results: The optimal dosages of ferric chloride, alum and PACl for removal of <b>humic</b> <b>compound</b> obtained, 10, 30 and 20 mg/L, respectively. The highest removal efficiency was related ferric chloride with 89 %, and removal efficiency for PACl and alum were 88 % and 81 %. But SUVA (specific ultraviolet absorbance) index decreased less than USEPA permissible limits (less than L/mg m 2) only with ferric chloride. Conclusion: Ferric chloride can be used for removal of humic acid in water of Urmia Shaharchi river to decreased SUVA index in permission ranges. But the use of aluminum salts may lead to THM formation.

In order to identify the particularities of plant response to humic compounds, the polypeptide spectrum of soybean proteins extracted from seeds of two varieties with different drought resistant was analysed. The comparative analysis of protein spectra of extracted proteins from beans of the control plants highlighted the presence of common polypeptides to both studied sorts, {{and the presence of}} specific polypeptides for each genotype with a varying amount share appreciated through colorant intensity and band dimension. Protein spectra included polypeptide bands with molecular mass comprised between 106 and 20 kDa. Notable qualitative differences between polypeptide pattern of genotype with medium resistance to drought (Horboveanca) and those resistant (S 4 - 04) were detected at the polypeptide level with Mr 104, 60, 43 kDa, present in resistant genotype and absent in medium resistant.

This study was aimed to test the effect of <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> extracted from rice-straw compost and CaCO 3 combination on aluminium activity and phosphate (available P) on an Ultisol (Typic Paleudult) collected from Kentrong Banten. A laboratory study was conducted by series consentration of CaCO 3 (0, 500, 1. 000, 2. 000, dan 3. 000 ppm) in 8 grams of acidic soil. The acidic soil had previously been subjected to continuously addition of <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> and none.

The quadratic model involving dosage, contact time and temperature is best fitted to predict the efficiency of coconut copra in removing humic substances from peat swamp runoff. Among these factors, dosage exhibits relatively greater influence. The optimal conditions necessary to attain maximum removal efficiency (88.19  %) are dosage (4.56  g modified coconut copra per 100  mL peat swamp runoff), temperature (56.8  °C/ 329 °K) and contact time (42.9  min). The experimental response acquired (86.54  %) based on the modelled optimum conditions is in good agreement with the predicted response.

40|$|In PhD thesis, it was {{proved that}} the {{toxicity}} of olive mill wastewater during the aerobic biological degradation {{could be attributed to}} the presence of phenolic compounds (TPC) in the wastewater. It was also {{proved that the}} Fenton oxidation process (Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2) was capable of breaking down TPC in chemical compounds that were more biodegradable. The oxidation of TPC followed pseudo-first order kinetics and it was influenced by the initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and by the reaction temperature under constant pH. The TPC oxidation reaction was very rapid and was completed in 30 minutes. The influence of the initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and of the reaction temperature and pH on the infinite concentrations of TPC and TOC and on the maximum organic carbon degradation rate (kmax) was studied in laboratory scale by a 24 factorial experiment. It was proved that TPC reduction was strongly influenced by the hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH while TOC reduction was influenced not only by the parameters mentioned above but by the ferrous sulphate initial concentration as well. The maximum organic carbon degradation rate (kmax) was just influenced by H 2 O 2 and pH. According to the standard optimization processes of a factorial experiment, it was concluded that under the optimum oxidation conditions, the maximum TPC reduction was 92 % (H 2 O 2 : 3, 037 g/l, Fe 2 +: 0, 44 g/l, pH: 0, 86, T: 21, 3 οC), the maximum TOC reduction TOC 54 % (H 2 O 2 : 1. 58 g/l, Fe 2 +: 0, 947 g/l, pH: 3, 22, T: 26, 4 οC), while the maximum organic carbon degradation rate after Fenton oxidation was 9 d- 1 (H 2 O 2 : 3, 2 g/l, Fe 2 +: 0, 06 g/l, pH: 6, 75, T: 15, 7 οC). A semi-industrial scale olive mill wastewater treatment plant was constructed. It included a Fenton oxidation unit followed by a co-composting plant that treated oxidized wastewater with olive stone wooden residues (OSWR). The influence of the initial Fenton’s reagent concentrations (H 2 O 2 and FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and of the pH on the oxidized wastewater consumption and {{on the quality of the}} final product in terms of Germination Index (GI) and <b>humic</b> <b>compound</b> content was studied. From the 36 experiments conducted in semi-industrial scale, it was deduced that the optimum oxidation conditions in ambient temperature were: [Η 2 Ο 2, 60 %] = 1 kg/m 3 wastewater, [FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O] = 4 kg/m 3 wastewater, pH = 3, 5. Under these conditions, the wastewater consumption was 3084 kg wastewater/tn OSWR (in contrast to initial consumption 1084 kg/tn), the maximum organic carbon degradation rate was 0, 0487 d- 1, the germination index was equal to 210 % (in contrast to 37 %) and the <b>humic</b> <b>compound</b> content was 40, 43 % (in contrast to 13, 34 %). Last, a techno-economical study was conducted based on the results mentioned above and on comparison data of utilization of the mature compost.

40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} are pollutants found {{frequently in}} the environment. Whereas lower chlorinated solvents are easily degraded under aerobic conditions, degradation of higher chlorinated solvents is favored under anaerobic conditions. It is known that some compounds can act as redox mediators assisting the electron exchange required for the anaerobic dechlorination reactions to occur. Redox mediators are compounds that can assist the anaerobic dechlorination reactions either abiotically or biologically by accelerating the degradation rates. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the role of different redox mediators on the anaerobic degradation of higher chlorinated solvents such as chloroform (CF), carbon tetrachloride (CT) and perchloroethylene (PCE). The redox mediators studied are vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin CNB 12 -hydroxocobalamin HOB 12), riboflavin (RF) and a model of <b>humic</b> <b>compound</b> anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate (AQDS). The study includes abiotic and biological redox mediated dechlorination. The biological studies involve two varieties of unadapted methanogenic sludge. The results obtained demonstrate that redox mediators greatly enhance the degradation rates of CF and CT when utilized at substoichiometric molar ratios. At the same time, the results also highlight the importance of the role of the microorganisms during the dechlorination process. Vitamin B 12 and riboflavin presented larger impact than AQDS on the degradation rates of CF and CT. Since vitamin B 12 had the highest positive impact on the biodegradation rates of CF and CT, an attempt was done to stimulate its biosynthesis by the methanogenic sludge during the CT dechlorination. The approach used to promote the biosynthesis of vitamin B 12 involved different vitamin B 12 precursors such as porphobilinogen, and some primary substrates such as methanol and 1, 2 -propanediol. The results obtained show that the formation of the corrin ring may be the limiting step during vitamin B 12 biosynthesis. One carbon substrates such as methanol, combined with porphobilinogen had a positive impact on the biodegradation rates of CT. The study suggests that the combination of methanol and vitamin B 12 precursors could be a good alternative to stimulate the vitamin B 12 biosynthesis by methanogens and therefore, the enhancement of the biodegradation rates of chlorinated solvents. This study presents the lowest molar ratio of vitamins that enhanced the dechlorination rates reported so far for biodegradation of chlorinated solvents involving methanogens. Also, this is the first report on the use of riboflavin as a redox mediator during dechlorination processes...|$|E

The thermodynamic data suggested that the sorption reaction is spontaneous and endothermic. The HA appears to be a key-component when the objective of the study is to assess the potential mobility of U in natural systems. It is also suggested that the migration of uranium in soils in the presence of HA can be either accelerated by formation of the <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> or partly retarded by sorption of <b>humic</b> <b>compounds.</b> This study also reveals the susceptibility of U toxicity depending on sorption capacity of soil.|$|R

Literature review sums up the experience with broiler chicken breeding and feeding. Further it deals with meat composition and its characteristics. The last part contains information of <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> and their influence over the live organism and compares the findings about the application of humic preparation into the livestock food portion. Practical part of this thesis researches the influence of humic preparation Humafit over the qualitative and quantitative parameters of the broiler chicken meat. Two groups of chicken were observed, experimental one and control one. Feeding of these two groups was held at the same time, whereas the experimental group was being fed with 200 ml of Humafit per 1000 l of supply water from 10 th to 20 th day of feeding. The research did not prove statistically important differences (p > 0. 05) in chicken corpse weight such as in weight of each parts of the corpses. Differences in the protein content in the breast muscle were also not statisticaly demonstrative such as pH value of the breast and thigh muscle. Total amount of heme pigments in breast muscle of the experimental group was higher and this difference was statistically important (p = 0. 049). The breast muscle of chicken in the control group showed up higher binding capacity for water, this difference was statistically important (p = 0. 041).

40|$|Blackwater {{rivers and}} lakelets {{are a common}} feature of the {{landscape}} in the South Western Cape. Contrastingly, white rivers {{can also be found}} in the region. Key to the colour of blackwaters is the increased presence of dissolved organic carbon. The vegetation of the regions is known to posses' large amounts of polyphenols and potentially low microbial decomposition. Therefore, are the plant-soil dynamics a possible answer to variation in river colour? To answer this, the chemical correlates of rivers in the region, along with the in vitro leaching of the fynbos vegetation compared to other types and the effects of nutrient fertilisation on microbial activity in soil were determined. The results revealed that organic carbon, Fe and pH are significantly correlated with blackwaters. The Fe in the water appears to be bound to <b>humic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Fynbos vegetation is able to produce greater concentrations of polyphenol leachates (315 mg/l humic acid) compared to savanna species (246 mg/ humic acid) over a four-day period. P fertilisations increased the concentrations of humic acids from 30 mg/ 1 to 200 mg/l in some soils through their affinity to bind with <b>humic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The N fertilisations moderately increased the humic acid concentrations and in some cases lowered the concentration by 10 mg/l, indicating that it provided a nutrient source to the microbes for carbon breakdown. The interactions between <b>humic</b> <b>compounds,</b> nutrients and Fe are key to the formation of blackwaters in the region. Attached to this is the limited decomposition that takes place due to nutrient limitations. Therefore, the interactions between the carbon leached from the vegetation and below ground activities are determinants of water colour in the South Western Cape...|$|R

The total carbon in dead organic matter in the forest floor and in the underlying mineral soil has been estimated to be 1450 x 10 " 9 t C, exceeding the amount stored in living vegetation by a factor of two or three (Schlesinger 1977; Meentemeyer et al., 1982; Jenkinson, 1988). Mineralization and humification represent important processes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Schlesinger (1990) estimated that about 0. 7 % of the annual terrestrial net primary production is sequestered in refractory humic substances carbon. Organic matter of forest soils is composed of a mixture of above- and belowground plant residues (primary resources), microbial residues (secondary resources), and <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> (Swift et al., 1979). <b>Humic</b> <b>compounds</b> are formed concomitantly during the microbial decomposition of primary and secondary resources. The conceptual view of soil organic matter in the present study is that of a continuum ranging from fresh plant litter to humic substances, the final products of humification. A complete separation of plant remains and <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> is not possible, {{due to the fact that}} organic matter at all stages of degradation and humification is present simultaneously in natural soils, albeit at different amounts. The way in which the objective of this research will be addressed is the study of the chemical structural changes during humification of major plant components, namely lignin and aliphatic biomacromolecules. This is achieved by the analysis of bulk samples in comparison with different fractions. The fractionation procedure is chosen according to the suitability for the compound class under investigation. The data obtained in this way reveal that previous hypotheses on the humification processes in soils are unrealistic.

40|$|Assays {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the consumption of dissolved oxygen resulting from mineralisation processes in resources usually found in aquatic systems. They were also aimed at estimating the oxygen uptake rate of each investigated process. Experiments were conducted using substrates from 3 different places. A fixed amount of substrate was added to 5 litres of water from Lagoa do Infernão that was previously filtered with glass wool. After adding the substrates the bottles were aired {{and the amount of}} dissolved oxygen and the temperature were monitored for 55 days. The occurrence of anaerobic processes was avoided by reoxygenating the bottles. The experimental results were fitted to a first order kinetics model, from which the consumption of dissolved oxygen owing to mineralisation processes was obtained. The amount of oxygen uptake from the mineralisation processes appeared in the following decreasing order: Wolffia sp., Cabomba sp., Lemna sp., DOM (Dissolved Organic Matter), Salvinia sp., Scirpus cubensis, stem, Eichhornia azurea, sediment and <b>humic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The deoxygenation rates (day- 1) were: 0. 267 (<b>humic</b> <b>compounds),</b> 0. 230 (Lemna sp.), 0. 199 (E. azurea), 0. 166 (S. cubensis), 0. 132 (sediment), 0. 126 (DOM), 0. 093 (Cabomba sp.), 0. 091 (stem), 0. 079 (Salvinia sp. and Wolffia sp.). From these results, 2 groups of resources could be identified: the first one consists of detritus with higher amounts of labile (ready to use) compounds, which show a higher global oxygen uptake during the mineralisation process; the second one consists mainly of resources that show refracting characteristics. However, when the consumption rates are analysed it is noted that the mineralised parts of the refracting substrates can be easier to process than the labile fractions of the less refracting resources...|$|R
40|$|The type of {{soil and}} humus has to be {{considered}} as primordial {{for the evaluation of}} the Cs availability and for its transfer dynamics. Previous studies on the radiocesium distribution through a forest soil profile indicate that the intermediate layer, OAh (organic and mineral particles intimately mixed) accumulates Cs in a more efficient way than the deeper mineral layer. Our study on the physico-chemical parameters influencing Cs retention shows however, that <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> do not particularly influence the Cs retention. On the contrary, the K interaction with mineral particles induces a clear increase in the Cs fixation. This observation suggests that K inducing collapse is responsible for a higher Cs retention. In the OAh layer, an original collapsed state of the mica structure would benefit the Cs fixation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe UVB {{photolysis}} of l-tyrosine yields {{species with}} fluorescence and absorption spectra {{that are very}} similar to those of humic substances. By potentiometric measurements, chemical modeling and the application of NMR, mass spectrometry and laser flash photolysis, it was possible to get insights into the structural and chemical properties of the compounds derived by the l-tyrosine phototransformation. The photolytic process follows aromatic-ring hydroxylation and dimerization. The latter is presumably linked with the photoinduced generation of tyrosyl (phenoxy-type) radicals, which have a marked tendency to dimerize and possibly oligomerize. Interestingly, photoinduced transformation gives compounds with protogenic and complexation capabilities {{similar to those of the}} humic substances that occur naturally in surface waters. This finding substantiates a new and potentially important abiotic (photolytic) pathway for the formation of <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> in surface-water environments...|$|R
40|$|Multicopper oxidases (MCO) {{catalyze}} {{the biological}} oxidation of various aromatic substrates {{and have been}} identified in plants, insects, bacteria, and wood rotting fungi. In nature, they are involved in biodegradation of biopolymers such as lignin and <b>humic</b> <b>compounds,</b> but have also been tested for various industrial applications. In fungi, MCOs have been shown to play important roles during their life cycles, such as in fruiting body formation, pigment formation and pathogenicity. Coprophilous fungi, which grow on the dung of herbivores, appear to encode an unexpectedly high number of enzymes capable of at least partly degrading lignin. This study compared the MCO-coding capacity of the coprophilous filamentous ascomycetes Podospora anserina and Sordaria macrospora with closely related non-coprophilous members of the order Sordariales. An increase of MCO genes in coprophilic members of the Sordariales most probably occurred by gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer events...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our work}} {{was to find a}} method with which to reduce the phenol content and the high ion {{concentration}} of thermal water used to heat greenhouses. Membrane separation techniques and ozone treatment were investigated. The most powerful membrane separation method was reverse osmosis which eliminated > 90 % of all compounds. Another effective method was nanofiltration, which demonstrated almost 10 times greater permeability values than those for reverse osmosis, and a relatively high (40 %) purification efficiency. Ultrafiltration resulted in only slight decrease in concentrations measured. Ozone alone degraded phenolic and <b>humic</b> <b>compounds,</b> but only a slow decrease in the chemical oxygen demand was observed. The effect of preozonation on nanofiltration was also investigated. It was found that (in accordance with earlier experience [1]) normalized water permeability was decreased whereas the purification efficiency of nanofiltration was increased by ozonation...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to improve {{knowledge}} of the long-term fate of cadmium supplied to arable soils by sewage sludge. Emphasis was placed on measured and modelled changes in the solubility and mobility of cadmium, resulting from long-term turnover of both sludge-derived and inherent organic matter of the soil. Measurements were conducted in a long-term sludge supplied field experiment, situated at Ultuna (60 °N, 17 °E), started in 1956. Furthermore, batch studies on soil samples and modelling exercises in WHAM were performed in order to study the speciation of cadmium in the soil-solution system. A comprehensive model -the SLAM model- was developed to increase {{the understanding of the}} influence of soil and sludge adsorption characteristics on cadmium solubility and bioavailability, and the migration rate of cadmium in soil profiles. The long-term sludge supplies had increased the solubility of cadmium, measured in crop cadmium concentration, as an effect of enhanced acidification and increased Cd concentration in the soil. A low Cd migration was measured, attributed to non-equilibrium Cd concentration in percolating water, a high cadmium sorption capacity in the subsoil and root driven Cd circulation in the soil profile. No increased Cd sorption capacity was measured in the sludge supplied soil, despite the almost doubled soil organic matter content. This might be partly attributed to the higher iron oxide and hydroxide concentration measured in the sludge, forming more stable complexes with soil <b>humic</b> <b>compounds</b> compared to cadmium complexes with soil <b>humic</b> <b>compounds.</b> A Monte-Carlo analysis of the SLAM model suggested that the major parameters affecting leaching and crop uptake of cadmium were the cadmium loading and the partitioning coefficient for sludge-derived inorganic material and parameters controlling the effect of pH on sorption. Long-term scenario simulations in SLAM identified critical factors influencing plant cadmium uptake: the cadmium concentration in the sludge, the adsorption capacity of the sludge in relation to the adsorption capacity of native soil and the proportion of the sludge adsorption capacity contributed by the inorganic fraction...|$|R
