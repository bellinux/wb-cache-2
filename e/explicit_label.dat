40|$|This thesis uses visual imagery tasks (mental {{rotation}} and mental subtraction) to examine verbal interference and verbal facilitation in visual memory. It demonstrates how task demands can mediate the verbal interference and verbal facilitation effects in visual imagery. Using the mental rotation paradigm, this thesis places a focus upon {{the method of}} stimulus presentation during the learning phase and the test. It demonstrates how a presentation method that emphasizes serial order (the temporal presentation method) can elicit positive effects of covert spontaneous naming during both encoding and retrieval. In contrast, a presentation method that emphasizes spatial information does not show a significant role for covert spontaneous naming during encoding or retrieval. Further, under temporal presentation conditions, <b>explicit</b> <b>labelling</b> during encoding (via the use of either self-generated or experimenter-generated labels) is found to show an interfering effect compared to covert spontaneous naming. Using experimenter-generated labels, {{it is found that}} re-presenting the <b>explicit</b> verbal <b>labels</b> as cues at retrieval removes the interfering effects of <b>explicit</b> <b>labelling</b> during encoding and enhances performance. In addition, reducing exposure to <b>explicit</b> verbal <b>labels</b> during encoding is found to be a possible method for removing the negative effect of <b>explicit</b> verbal <b>labels</b> during encoding. Finally, the positive effect of covert spontaneous naming and the negative effect of <b>explicit</b> <b>labelling</b> are replicated using a different mental subtraction paradigm. Overall, the findings indicate that task demands determine the role of the verbal code in visual imagery. Hence, there is no unified theory to account for the role of the verbal code in visual memory, but different theories can be applied under different conditions...|$|R

One essential aspect of executive functioning is cognitive flexibility, the ability to update behavior and thought based {{on the needs of}} a constantly changing environment. This study investigated the role of language in the development of cognitive flexibility, which has shown contradictory effects in prior work. For example, labels impaired 3 -year-olds’ cognitive flexibility as measured in an instructed cardsorting task (Yerys 2 ̆ 6 Munakata, 2006), but improved 4 -year-olds’ cognitive flexibility as measured in an internally-driven card-sorting task (Jacques, Zelazo, Lourenco, 2 ̆ 6 Sutherland, 2007).

These results suggest that <b>explicit</b> <b>labels</b> may impair cognitive flexibility in 3 -year-olds, regardless of task, suggesting that age determines whether labels will help or hurt children’s cognitive flexibility.

40|$|Abstract—Flow-sensitive {{analysis}} for information-flow control (IFC) allows data structures to have mutable security labels, i. e., labels {{that can change}} {{over the course of}} the computation. This feature is often used to boost the permissiveness of the IFC monitor, by rejecting fewer programs, and to reduce the burden of <b>explicit</b> <b>label</b> annotations. However, when added naively, in a purely dynamic setting, mutable labels can expose a high bandwidth covert channel. In this work, we present an extension for LIO—a language-based floating-label system— that safely handles flow-sensitive references. The key insight to safely manipulating the label of a reference is to not only consider the label on the data stored in the reference, i. e., the reference label, but also the label on the reference label itself. Taking this into consideration, we provide an upgrade primitive that can be used to change the label of a reference in a safe manner. To eliminate the burden of determining when a reference should be upgraded, we additionally provide a mechanism for automatic upgrades. Our approach naturally extends to a concurrent setting, not previously considered by dynamic flow-sensitive systems. For both our sequential and concurrent calculi, we prove non-interference by embedding the flow-sensitive system into the flow-insensitive LIO calculus, a surprising result on its own. I...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a language-based, dynamic information flow control (IFC) system called LIO. Our system presents a new design point for IFC, {{influenced by the}} challenge of implementing IFC as a Haskell library, {{as opposed to the}} more typical approach of modifying the language runtime system. In particular, we take a coarse-grained, floating-label approach, previously used by IFC Operating Systems, and associate a single, mutable label - the current label - with all the data in a computation's context. This label is always raised to reflect the reading of sensitive information and it is used to restrict the underlying computation's effects. To preserve the flexibility of fine-grained systems, LIO also provides programmers with a means for associating an <b>explicit</b> <b>label</b> with a piece of data. Interestingly, these labeled values can be used to encapsulate the results of sensitive computations which would otherwise lead to the creeping of the current label. Unlike other language-based systems, LIO also bounds the current label with a current clearance, providing a form of discretionary access control that LIO programs can use to deal with covert channels. Moreover, LIO provides programmers with mutable references and exceptions. The latter, exceptions, are used in LIO to encode and recover from monitor failures, all while preserving data confidentiality and integrity - this addresses a longstanding concern that dynamic IFC is inherently prone to information leakage due to monitor failure...|$|E
