40|$|The preovulatory {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) surge and its {{resulting}} ovulation {{occur at the}} same time every fourth day (proestrus) in rats, mice, and hamsters housed in long day photoperiods. This 4 -day rhythm <b>free-runs</b> in constant light (Alleva et al., 1971; McCormack and Sridaran, 1978), is entrained by the photoperiod (Finkelstein et al., 1978; Moline et al., 1981), and is ablated by destruction of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the master circadian pace...|$|R
40|$|In {{constant}} dim illumination the hamster estrous cycle <b>free-runs</b> with {{a period}} that is a quadruple multiple of the concurrently recorded rhythm of wheel-running activity; both activity and estrous cycles are generated by biological clocks. Maintenance of stable phase angle differences between heat onset and running onset before and after treatment with deuterium oxide suggests that a common circadian system generates periodicities in estrus and activity. An organization of the estrous cycle is proposed in which the stimulus for the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone is generated by a circadian system that includes the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Various possible interactions of estradiol and photoperiod with the neurogenic stimulus for the luteinizing hormone surge are described and implications {{of different types of}} circadian organization of the estrous cycle for theories of sexual differentiation are considered...|$|R
40|$|Circadian rhythms in stomatal {{aperture}} and in stomatal conductance {{have been}} observed previously. Here we investigate circadian rhythms in apertures that persist in functionally isolated guard cells in epidermal peels of Vicia faba, and we compare these rhythms with rhythms in stomatal conductance in attached leaves. Functionally isolated guard cells kept in constant light display a rhythmic change in aperture superimposed on a continuous opening trend. The rhythm <b>free-runs</b> with {{a period of about}} 22 hours and is temperature compensated between 20 and 30 °C. Functionally isolated guard cell pairs are therefore capable of sustaining a true circadian rhythm without interaction with mesophyll cells. Stomatal conductance in whole leaves displays a more robust rhythm, also temperature-compensated, and with a period similar to that observed for the rhythm in stomatal aperture in epidermal peels. When analyzed individually, some stomata in epidermal peels showed a robust rhythm for several days while others showed little rhythmicity or damped out rapidly. Rhythmic periods may vary between individual stomata, and this may lead to desynchronization within the population...|$|R
25|$|Below is a {{table of}} the {{difference}} in Riesling juice composition between <b>free-run</b> juice and the juice that comes out from the different sections of a continuous press from the relatively low pressure 1st press section to the more compact, higher pressure 3rd press section.|$|E
25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the <b>free-run</b> juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the <b>free-run</b> juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E

5000|$|In birds, time-place {{learning}} {{has been confirmed}} in garden warblers, [...] starlings, weavers, and pigeons. [...] Garden warblers could learn to visit four rooms inside a large aviary, one during each quarter of a day. It took them only 11 days to learn, with 70% accuracy, to visit the correct room at the correct daily time to get food. The spatio-temporal pattern of visits was then maintained even when food was made available in all rooms at all times. As with circadian rhythms of activity, the spatio-temporal pattern of room visits shifted gradually over several days following a 6-h advance of the day-night cycle, and it ran freely with a non-24 h periodicity for up to 6 days when the birds were placed under constant 24-h dim light and constant food availability. Starlings can show similar patterns, with <b>free-runs</b> up to 11 days in constant dim light. The insectivorous weaver bird Ploceus bicolor can also learn to associate four feeding rooms with four feeding times, and it maintains the correct spatio-temporal pattern even {{when one of the}} rooms is blocked on test days (the bird then waits for the next feeding time and visits the appropriate room for that time); however, room blocking disrupts the spatio-temporal pattern in the granivorous weaver bird Euplectes hordaceus, which suggests that time-place learning may be stronger in species for which food in nature is more likely to vary spatio-temporally (as is the case for insects, as opposed to grain). Finally, pigeons can learn to peck one key to get food in the morning, and another key in the afternoon, and they maintain this pattern for four days in constant light.|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} making wine in ancient Rome began {{immediately}} after the harvest with treading the grapes (often by foot), {{in a manner similar}} to the French pigeage. The juice thus expressed was the most highly prized and kept separate from what would later come from pressing the grape. This <b>free-run</b> juice was also believed to have the most beneficial medicinal properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} these {{differences}} will be magnified or minimized based on the initial condition of the fruit after harvest (with moldy, damaged, sun-burnt or botryized grapes producing stark differences between <b>free-run</b> and pressed juice), the type of press used, the amount of pressure involved and the overall amount of movement that the grapes are subject to that could impact how much the skins and seeds are scoured and torn.|$|E
25|$|Tradition in Pomerol {{has been}} to {{separate}} the <b>free-run</b> wine and blend back in a proportion of the vin de presse as needed depending on the vintage. The rest of the press wine would often {{be used in the}} estate's second wine or sold to négociants. The timing of the blending (such as during or after fermentation) will vary by estate with some houses such as Château Pétrus adding the vin de presse during fermentation in order to allow the wine components to mature together and, theoretically, reduce the harshness of the typically more tannic and phenolic press wine.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>free-run</b> and pressed juice is that pressed juice often has lower acidity levels, higher potassium and pH level, more phenolic compounds such as tannins and more suspended solids such as natural gum and proteins. Some of these attributes can be positive {{influences on the}} wine with the increased phenolics offering more body, aroma characteristics (such as the varietal aromas from terpenes) and aging potential. Other attributes may have more negative influence such as increased astringency and bitterness, precursor for browning pigments in white wine, mouthfeel and balance issues (as well as potential microbial instability) from the increased pH and the enhance need for fining agents {{to assist in the}} clarification and stabilization of the wine with the increase in suspended solids.|$|E
25|$|Usually the pressed juice {{will require}} some {{additional}} treatment, {{which can be}} done separately to the pressed juice alone or to the entire batch of wine if the pressed juice is blended with the <b>free-run.</b> These treatments may include acid adjustments to lower pH, extended settling periods for clarification and additional racking to remove the extra suspended solids {{and the use of}} fining agents to remove extra solids or excess tannins. Grape pulp contains a lot of pectins that create colloid coagulation with these solids that will make the wine difficult to stabilize. Some winemakers will use pectolytic enzymes during the maceration process to help break down the cell walls to allow the release of more juice freely. These enzymes are also used with white wines to assist in clarification. The type of pressing used and the amount of suspended solids plays a particular role in filtering decisions as a high amount of suspended solids (particularly natural gums) can clog and damage expensive filters.|$|E
2500|$|For {{as long as}} presses {{have been}} used, winemakers {{have been aware of}} the {{different}} color, body and aroma characteristics of wine made from the [...] "free-run" [...] juice compared to pressed juice. <b>Free-run</b> is the juice that has been extracted through the process of crushing, the natural break down of the grape cell walls during maceration and fermentation and by the own weight of the grape berries as they are loaded {{on top of each other}} in a press. Even among press juice there are compositional difference between the various [...] "fractions" [...] of juice produced from initial pressing through subsequent (and usually harsher) pressing. Often winemakers will keep <b>free-run</b> and pressed juice separated for most of the winemaking process including malolactic fermentation and barrel aging with the options to later blend between them to make the most complete, balanced wine, bottle separately under different labels and price tiers or to discard/sell off the pressed fractions to another producer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{timing of}} {{pressing}} {{and the methods}} used will influence other decisions in the winemaking process. In white wine making, pressing usually happens immediately after harvest and crushing. Here, the biggest decision will be how much pressure to apply and how much pressed juice the winemakers wants {{in addition to the}} <b>free-run</b> juice. Some grape varieties, such as Sémillon and Aurore have very [...] "liquidy" [...] pulps that releases juice easily without needing much pressure that could risk tearing the skins. Other varieties, such as Catawba, have much tougher pulps that will require more pressing.|$|E
2500|$|Under the whole-cluster method, {{the first}} press {{fraction}} {{is essentially the}} [...] "free-run" [...] fraction since the grapes berries are only first being broken and releasing juice as the press cycle begins. However, like with the pressing of crushed grapes {{the composition of the}} juice changes with each subsequent pressing and these fractions are often kept separate. Unlike crushed grape pressing, where usually the <b>free-run</b> juice is most prized, in whole-cluster pressing the second fraction is often most valued for its balance of phenolic content and aging potential.|$|E
2500|$|While Tavel rosé can be {{made using}} the saignee and skin-contact method, the {{tradition}} {{in the region is}} to do a type of co-ferment with both red and white grapes that combines elements of both methods. The grapes are loaded, whole clusters, into a tank all together where under the gravity of their own weight the grapes are gently pressed and the juice trickles down to the bottom. There the juice receives its period of brief skin contact with the crushed red skins on the bottom before the lightly colored <b>free-run</b> juice is then drained off, like a saignee, and the wine then fermented as normal. This method produces what Karen MacNeil describes as [...] "rugged wines with robust, spicy berry flavor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The grapes are harvested, either {{manually}} or by machine, {{when they}} are fully ripe. Sometimes grapes that have been harvested manually are sorted, either on the vines or at a sorting table on the wine-maker's premises, to ensure that rotten or insufficiently ripe grapes are removed. Grapes that have been harvested manually are usually crushed, then transferred to a tank. Pre-fermentation cold maceration is sometimes carried out. Alcoholic fermentation can then begin, normally after the addition of yeast. The next stage is the extraction of polyphenols (tannins and anthocyanins) and other chemical constituents of the grapes. In the past this {{was carried out by}} a process called pigeage, which involved repeatedly pushing the floating cap of grape solids back down into the fermenting juice. Now, however, extraction is normally brought about by a series of remontages. This involves pumping the juice {{from the bottom of the}} tank, then pouring it over the cap of grape solids to wash out the grapes' distinctive constituents. The temperature for alcoholic fermentation can be varied, but the normal average temperature at the height of fermentation is between 28 and 35 degrees Celsius. If the naturally generated temperature is too low, chaptalization may be carried out. This practice is subject to external regulations. Once alcoholic fermentation has finished, the liquid is removed from the tank and separated into <b>free-run</b> wine and press wine. Malolactic fermentation may take place next, but is dependent on temperature. The wine is drawn off and stored in barrels or vats to be matured. [...] The maturing process takes several months (6 to 24 months), after which the wine is fined, filtered and bottled.|$|E

50|$|Pressing is {{the act of}} {{applying}} pressure to grapes or pomace in order to separate juice or wine from grapes and grape skins. Pressing {{is not always a}} necessary act in winemaking; if grapes are crushed there is a considerable amount of juice immediately liberated (called <b>free-run</b> juice) {{that can be used for}} vinification. Typically this <b>free-run</b> juice is of a higher quality than the press juice. However, most wineries do use presses in order to increase their production (gallons) per ton, as pressed juice can represent between 15%-30% of the total juice volume from the grape.|$|E

50|$|The red wines of Domaine Louis Latour {{are still}} vinified and aged at the {{historical}} Winery Corton Grancey.

This is called <b>free-run</b> wine. All grape skins and pips are then removed manually and pressed gently by top of the range pneumatic pressing machines.
