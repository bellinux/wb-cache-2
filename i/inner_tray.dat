2500|$|Despite hardships {{and legal}} {{entanglements}} over album rights, Anthrax continued. In 2001 Rob Caggiano joined the band on lead guitar. During the 2001 anthrax {{attacks in the}} United States the band changed its website, providing information about the disease after people began searching [...] "anthrax.com" [...] on internet search engines. Amid a potential PR nightmare, Anthrax issued a press release on October 10, 2001 joking that the band's name would be changed to [...] "something more friendly, like 'Basket Full of Puppies'." [...] Anthrax dispelled any name-change rumors derived from the press release at the November 2001 New York Steel 9/11 benefit concert, when they took the stage in boiler suits with a different word on each one which ultimately read [...] "We're not changing our name". Bello has stated they did so after receiving support {{from members of the}} NYPD and NYFD, who believed that changing the name of the band would send the wrong message. A picture of the band in the suits is on the <b>inner</b> <b>tray</b> card of We've Come for You All.|$|E

50|$|The album {{has been}} issued as a double album with Short Cuts, a sampler {{compilation}} {{of music from}} other Argo Records albums by Graham Fitkin (2 tracks), Gavin Bryars, Michael Torke, Chris Fitkin, Michael Nyman (2 tracks), Henryk GÃ³recki, Aaron Jay Kernis, Kevin Volans, Stanley Myers, David Byrne, Michael Gordon, Robert Moran, Mark Anthony Turnage, Richard Harris, and Paul Schoenfield. The booklet is double sized rather than having a separate booket, and the track listing is on the <b>inner</b> liner <b>tray.</b> The album is easier {{to find in the}} single version. Short Cuts is produced by Andrew Cornall, with art direction by David Smart and design by Russell Warren-Fischer, consisting of 1/4 page grey squares behind the work deescriptions. Several sales sites have listed Short Cuts sampler separately, but none have yet shown a separate album cover.|$|R
2500|$|The B-type wing was {{structurally}} an A type {{modified to}} carry one 20mm Hispano cannon per wing, which replaced the two inner [...]303 machine guns. The retractable underwing landing lamp was repositioned. The cannon {{was installed in}} the innermost machine gun bay, next to the wheelwell, while the second gun was deleted altogether. The area where the <b>inner</b> guns ammunition <b>trays</b> had been located, outboard of the cannon bay, was converted into a compartment to accommodate the 60-round drum magazine for the cannon. The upper and lower wing skins now incorporated blisters to clear the large ammunition drum (the underwing blisters came in two different shapes). The remaining outer pairs of [...]303's were not changed at all. Only one armament suite could be fitted to a Spitfire with the B-type wing: Two 20mm Hispano Mk II cannon, each with a 60-round drum, and four [...]303 caliber Browning machine guns in the outer positions, with 350 rpg. Alloy-covered ailerons were standardised on this wing type.|$|R

5000|$|Cabin trunks, {{which are}} {{sometimes}} called [...] "true" [...] steamer trunks, were today's equivalent of carry-on luggage. They were low-profiled and {{small enough to}} fit under the berths of trains or in the cabin of a steamer, hence their name. Most were built with flat-tops and had <b>inner</b> <b>tray</b> compartments to store the owner's valuables deemed too precious to keep stowed away in the main luggage train or berth.|$|E
50|$|When MacNaghten {{was told}} of the empty cash box, he chose to examine it. He noticed that on the {{underside}} of the box's <b>inner</b> <b>tray,</b> there was a greasy smudge which appeared to be a fingerprint. As a member of the Belper Committee which had recommended the use of fingerprints as a method for identification five years before, he wondered if this might be a case to test out this new technique. He used his handkerchief to carefully pick up the cash box, had it wrapped in paper and took it into the fledgling Fingerprinting Bureau at Scotland Yard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} not {{released}} in the United States until 1998 when Cleopatra Records issued all Numa Records-era Numan albums with altered artworks and additional bonus tracks. The Berserker reissue featured four bonus tracks, including extended mixes of the title track and [...] "My Dying Machine". The artwork used a different typeface from the original and the colours were slightly more purple-tinted than on the original. The rear artwork uses a unique composite from the original Numa CD (first issue). The booklet contains the lyrics together with live photos (also on the <b>inner</b> <b>tray)</b> taken in the Edinburgh Playhouse in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|Daydream Nations title {{came from}} a lyric in the song [...] "Hyperstation". Sonic Youth had also {{considered}} the title [...] "Tonight's the Day", from a lyric in [...] "Candle", which made reference to Neil Young's 1975 album Tonight's the Night. The cover for Daydream Nation features the 1983 Gerhard Richter painting Kerze ("Candle"). The back cover art is a similar Richter painting from 1982. The vinyl version's four sides and the compact disc <b>inner</b> <b>tray</b> contain four symbols representing the {{four members of the}} band, presumably in a homage to - and a parody of - the symbols used for the band on the fourth Led Zeppelin album. The symbols are infinity, female, upper case omega and a drawing of a demon/angel holding drumsticks.|$|E
