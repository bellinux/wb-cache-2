This close approach allowed for greater <b>image</b> <b>resolution,</b> though the flyby's short duration meant that most observations of Jupiter's moons, rings, magnetic field, and radiation environment were made in the 48-hour period bracketing the approach, even though Voyager1 continued photographing the planet until April. It was soon followed by Voyager2, which made its closest approach on July 9, 1979, 576,000km away from the planet's cloud tops. The probe discovered Jupiter's ring, observed intricate vortices in its atmosphere, observed active volcanoes on Io, a process analogous to plate tectonics on Ganymede, and numerous craters on Callisto.|$|E

A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air.

40|$|In this paper, {{trade-off}} between {{effect of}} registration error {{and number of}} images used {{in the process of}} super <b>resolution</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction is studied. Super <b>Resolution</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction is three phase process, of which registration is of at most importance. Super <b>resolution</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction uses set of low <b>resolution</b> <b>images</b> to reconstruct high <b>resolution</b> <b>image</b> during registration. The study demonstrates the effects of registration error and benefit of more number of low <b>resolution</b> <b>images</b> on the quality of reconstructed image. Study reveals that the registration error degrades the reconstructed image and without better registration methodology, a better super resolution method is still not of any use. It is noticed that without further improvement in the registration technique, not much improvement can be achieved by increasing number of input low <b>resolution</b> <b>images.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|Generally, the <b>image</b> <b>resolution</b> of an SEM {{is lower}} than that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the {{electrons}} do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet microscopes {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the <b>image</b> <b>resolution</b> beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes. This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} A-scan {{ultrasound}} biometry {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact applanation biometry. This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe indenting the cornea and shallowing the anterior chamber. Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion A-scan biometry, which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the anterior chamber is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between applanation and immersion axial length measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion biometry {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact applanation biometry in several studies. The main limitation with the A-scan ultrasound is the poor <b>image</b> <b>resolution</b> due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|E

40|$|High <b>Resolution</b> <b>images</b> can be reconstructed {{from several}} blurred, noisy and aliased low <b>resolution</b> <b>images</b> using a {{computational}} process know as super resolution reconstruction. Multi-frame super resolution reconstruction {{is the process}} of combining several low <b>resolution</b> <b>images</b> into a single higher <b>resolution</b> <b>image.</b> Super <b>resolution</b> reconstruction consists of registration, restoration and interpolation phases, once the low <b>resolution</b> <b>image</b> are registered with respect to a reference frame then restoration is performed to remove the blur and noise from the images, finally the images are interpolated using bilinear interpolation. Image super-resolution creates an enhanced high <b>resolution</b> <b>image</b> using multiple low-resolution images of the same scene. A typical image formation model introduces major three parameters i. e. blurring, aliasing, and added noise. Super-resolution is designed to jointly reduce or remove all these three parameters.

Giants was also ported to the [...] (PS2), a process overseen by Interplay's division, Digital Mayhem, who posted updates of their progress on IGN. Their greatest challenge for the PS2 port was converting and storing the special effects of the Windows version onto the lesser storage space of the PS2. LightWave 3D was used by the team to convert the graphic resources. Although they had to reduce the <b>image</b> <b>resolution,</b> Digital Mayhem increased the number of polygons that composed the player character models, making them smoother and more detailed in shape. Due to the limited capabilities of the PS2 as compared to the Windows platform and the addition of a save feature, the team focused on enhancing the action gameplay, streamlining the interfaces, and tweaking the Reaper ski races, level designs, and game balance. They redesigned the controls for the PS2's controller, and after finding the analog sticks less easy to aim with than a mouse, implemented a feature to help the player's aim. Digital Mayhem originally intended to retain the multiplayer mode, but discarded it, believing the PS2 environment could not generate the same multiplayer atmosphere as the Windows platform. Interplay released the PS2 port on December 21, 2001. They also announced plans for an Xbox port but nothing resulted from this.|$|E
