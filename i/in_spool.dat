30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the validity of the Reynolds equation <b>in</b> <b>spool</b> valve analysis under cavitation. This study is carried out for a laminar and isothermal flow between a sleeve and spool with grooves. The pressure and lateral force obtained from the Reynolds equation and the Navier-Stokes equation are compared with variations of aspect ratio, cross sectional area, and number of grooves. The cavitation phenomenon is considered by using a cavitation model in the Navier-Stokes equation and the Reynolds cavitation boundary condition in the Reynolds equation. A large difference of more than 20 % is found between the equations for a lateral force of spool valve with many grooves. It was found that the Reynolds equation is not suitable for calculation of a lateral force of the spool valve with multiple-grooves of which the width and depth are even larger than the clearance under cavitation.|$|E

30|$|With {{more and}} more {{prefabricated}} materials and assemblies, the construction material supply chain becomes increasingly complicated and uncertain. Material delay is commonly encountered <b>in</b> <b>spool</b> fabrication shops serving the needs of multiple industrial construction projects. Therefore, this paper proposes an application framework for implementing material-supply driven project planning and control {{in order to improve}} the schedule performance of spool fabrication projects subject to time-dependent material supply information collected in material management systems. The application framework consists of four major components, which are (1) data sources, containing detailed design drawings, contract information, resources availability and time-dependent material supply patterns; (2) extracted information serving as constraints for optimizing spool fabrication schedules; (3) constraint programming optimization engine; and (4) two forms of output visualization, i.e., the interactive activity Gantt chart and the material supply-demand chart, which guide decision-making processes subject to material delays. Three sample spools from a real oil and gas expansion project in Alberta are selected to build a case study for demonstration and validation of the proposed application framework. In addition to the baseline schedule, two alternative schedules with different priorities in defining scheduling optimization objectives, namely, the shortest fabrication duration and the earliest finish time of the particular spool, are produced, lending effective decision support for practitioners in coping with material delays and making detailed resource-loaded crew-job schedules in a piping fabrication shop which generally serves multiple projects and multiple clients simultaneously.|$|E

For a metering poppet valve which was developed at the University of Missouri (MU valve), the valve can be configured for performance at the cost of stability. It is desirable to achieve both performance and stability using electronic control. Presently, in the MU valve, the pilot poppet motion is damped by the flow of hydraulic fluid through a channel or orifice running through the poppet. In this research, it is proposed that the solenoid be used to provide damping (active damping) to the pilot poppet. The damping input signal to the solenoid is determined {{as a function of the}} pilot poppet velocity. In practice, the velocity is difficult to measure due to the MU valve's configuration and it is estimated according to the self-sensing actuator concept. Theoretical results demonstrated that a valve actuator could be designed with an emphasis on high speed performance while an electronic control system is used to damp unwanted oscillations. For flow control, several researchers have used feedback linearization to cancel part of a hydraulic system's nonlinearities <b>in</b> <b>spool</b> valves. In the case of the metering poppet valve, feedback linearization is an attractive approach since experimental studies have shown that poppet instabilities are caused by nonlinear mechanisms like flow forces. In this work, nonlinearities are cancelled in the input-output relationship of the metering poppet valve. The controller was shown to achieve robust tracking of a reference trajectory...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{collects}} {{some examples}} of CFD application to hydraulic components design, aimed at showing how a complex tool can be used both for the internal flow characterisation and the macroscopic analysis of component behaviour. In its first part, the paper deals with the steady-state characterisation of a commercial 4 / 3 on Zoff distributor, and focuses the attention on CFD strategies used {{in order to obtain}} an accurate description of steady-state axial flow-forces, acting on the spool of the component. The solution of simplified models (axis-symmetric) and the development of an extended and novel non-dimensionalization technique are the key to the use of a limited number of distributor configurations and a minimum number of operational conditions to obtain a full characterisation of the component. The second part of the paper is devoted to hydraulic locking analysis, where CFD is applied to tapered 3 D geometry in order to validate the results of specific design assumptions and to verify the results obtained by a simplified, though two-dimensional, approach to radial forces estimation <b>in</b> <b>spool</b> valves. As a final example, {{the last part of the}} paper is dedicated to particle tracking analysis and collisioni erosion prediction, using a simplified approach based on the hypothesis of uncoupled motion of fluid and particles. In this last case, the CFD computed flow field, is used in arder to allow the solution of the lagrangian equations of motion for solid particles dragged by the fluid according to a given law. The aim of the examples collected is not the solution of the problems dealt with (to this purpose the reader is referred to the bibliography), but rather the identification of areas and methods where the application of a complex and expensive design toollike CFD analysis can reach the breakeven point of a convenient application in the design phase of a hydrauliccomponent...|$|E
40|$|Proportional Solenoid Valves (PSV) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used in the hydraulic industry for many years due to the benefits associated with higher accuracy compared to on/off solenoid valves, and the robustness and cost compared to servo valves. Because the PSV {{plays an important role}} in the performance of a hydraulic system, a technique commonly referred to as Condition Monitoring Scheme (CMS) has been used extensively to monitor the progress of faults in the PSV. But before any CMS can be implemented on a system, it needs to be thoroughly tested for its reliability of fault detection since, a failure of the CMS to detect any potential fault can be economically disastrous, and dangerous in terms of the safety of personnel. The motivation of this research was to develop a fault simulator which could reliably and repeatedly induce user defined faults in the PSV and thereby aid in testing the efficacy of the CMS for monitoring such simulated faults. Industry research has revealed that the most common mode of failure <b>in</b> <b>spool</b> valves is an increase in the friction between the spool and valve, due to wear, contamination and dirt, which renders the valve inoperable. In this research, a non-destructive fault simulator was developed which induced artificial friction faults in the PSV. The PSV consisted of two solenoids on the opposite sides of the valve spool by virtue of which, bi-directional position control could be achieved. The PSV with the spool and one of the solenoids was used as the system in which the faults were simulated, and the second solenoid was used an a fault simulator for inducing the desired friction characteristics in the system. The friction characteristics induced in the valve were similar to those in the classical friction curve, i. e., stiction at low velocities and Coulomb and viscous friction at higher velocities. By employing a closed loop position control scheme, one of the solenoids was used to generate a linearly increasing velocity profile by virtue of which the desired friction characteristics could be induced in different velocity regimes. The other solenoid was used to generate the desired friction force. A closed loop force control strategy, which used the feedback from a force transducer, allowed for the accurate control of the friction characteristics. stiction was induced at low velocities by passing the required current in both the solenoids that resulted in no net force on the valve spool. Due to the absence of any driving force the spool was stalled at the desired location, thus achieving the same effect of stiction at low velocities. The coulomb and viscous friction were induced at higher velocities by employing an algorithm which was a function of the spool velocity. Different magnitudes of static, coulomb and viscous friction were induced to achieve the friction characteristics represented by the classical friction curve. Since the change in force characteristics of the valve results in a corresponding change in the current drawn by the position control solenoid, a rudimentary CMS for monitoring the current characteristics is presented. Based on the experimental results and validation using the CMS it was concluded that the fault simulator was able to accurately produce the desired frictional loading on the valve spool and was able to do so with a high degree of repeatability.
