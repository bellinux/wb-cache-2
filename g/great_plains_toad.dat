Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of the Northern <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> of North America to a landscape favoring agricultural commodity production has negatively impacted wildlife habitats. To offset impacts, conservation programs have been implemented by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies to restore grassland and wetland habitat components. To evaluate effects of these efforts on anuran habitats, we used call survey data and environmental data in ecological niche factor analyses implemented through the program Biomapper to quantify habitat suitability for five anuran species within a 196 km 2 study area. Our amphibian call surveys identified Northern Leopard Frogs (Lithobates pipiens), Wood Frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata), <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>Toads</b> (Anaxyrus cognatus), and Woodhouse’s Toads (Anaxyrus woodhousii) occurring within the study area. Habitat suitability maps developed for each species revealed differing patterns of suitable habitat among species. The most significant findings of our mapping effort were 1) the influence of deep-water overwintering wetlands on suitable habitat for all species encountered except the Boreal Chorus Frog; 2) the lack of overlap between areas of core habitat for both the Northern Leopard Frog and Wood Frog compared to the core habitat for both toad species; and 3) the importance of conservation programs in providing grassland components of Northern Leopard Frog and Wood Frog habitat.

We examined {{the influence of}} agricultural landscape structure on community com-position and relative abundance of the 4 most common amphibians in the Southern High Plains of central USA. Amphibian populations were monitored using pitfall traps and drift fence at 16 playa wetlands 8 playas/year in 1999 and 2000. We quantified landscape structure surrounding each playa via estimating 13 spatial metrics that indexed playa isolation and inter-playa landscape complexity. Multivariate ordination and univariate correlations and regressions indicated that landscape structure was associated with community composition and relative abundance for 2 of the 4 amphibians. Spadefoots Spea multiplicata, S. bombifrons generally were positively associated with decreasing inter-playa distance and increasing inter-playa landscape complexity. <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>toads</b> Bufo cognatus and barred tiger salamanders Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium usually were negatively associated with spadefoots but not influenced by landscape structure.

40|$|Males of most anuran species (frogs and toads) vocalize {{to attract}} mates. However, {{individuals}} of many vocal species may also adopt alternative noncalling "satellite" tactics. Satellite males characteristically remain {{in close proximity}} to calling conspecifics and attempt to intercept incoming females attracted to advertising males. Emerson proposed that alternation between calling and noncalling behavior in anurans is mediated by a reciprocal interaction between circulating levels of corticosterone and androgens that is driven by depletion of energy reserves during vocalization. We tested this hypothesis by examining steroid hormone profiles and the relative body condition of calling and satellite Woodhouse's toads (Bufo woodhousii) and <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>toads</b> (B. cognatus). Consistent with Emerson's hypothesis, callers had significantly higher circulating corticosterone levels and were in better condition than satellites. However, levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone did not differ significantly between satellites and callers, and we found no evidence that high levels of corticosterone had an inhibitory effect on androgen production in either species. These data thus support a relationship between corticosterone levels and depletion of energy reserves during bouts of vocalization but suggest that alternation between calling and satellite behavior may be associated with direct effects of corticosterone on brain vocal control centers. We propose a model that incorporates relationships among energy reserves, androgens, corticosterone, and arginine vasotocin-producing neurons in the telencephalon to explain transitions between calling and satellite tactics in toads.

500|$|Frogs in the {{families}} Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs {{and tend to}} walk rather than jump. When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait.

In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds.
