5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once in a while, the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hearts,</b> which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E

25|$|Queen Aga'po {{explains}} that the women imprisoned in the crystals (Fatality, Karu-Sil, and Kiriazis are specifically named, though other filled crystals are shown in Green Lantern vol. 4 #36) are being rehabilitated. The yellow light of fear is being drained from their rings and replaced with the violet light of love. Queen Aga'po also claims that violet light is filling an emptiness <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> and replacing their capacity for creating fear. The delegate meeting ends poorly for the Oans, as the Zamarons refuse to stop their pursuit of the violet light. Perhaps in response, the Guardians unanimously vote that love between Green Lanterns is forbidden within the Corps.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} at the moment when the earth opened up, Korah's sons were {{suspended}} in the air. When the sons of Korah saw the gaping abyss below {{on one side and the}} fire of Gehinnom on the other, they were unable to open their mouths to confess. But as soon as thoughts of repentance stirred <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hearts,</b> God accepted them. Whatever thoughts one of the sons developed, the others developed as well, so that all three were of one heart. The area around them split apart, but the spot on which each stood was not touched. They stood separately like three pillars. Moses, Aaron, and all the great scholars came to hear the song of the sons of Korah, and from this they learned to sing songs before God.|$|E
25|$|The Song of Dermot and the Earl and Expugnatio Hibernica {{follow the}} same pattern, portraying Derbforgaill’s {{abduction}} in 1152 and Mac Murchada’s banishment in 1166 as occurring at the same time. The Song claims that Derbforgaill {{had fallen in love}} with Diarmait, who in turn only made a pretense of loving her, in an effort to entice her away from Ua Ruairc, as a means of avenging previous wrongs inflicted by Leth Cuinn (the northern half of Ireland) upon Leth Moga (the southern half of Ireland). She subsequently arranged for a rendezvous from which he could carry her back to Laigin unchallenged. Ua Ruairc is then said to have complained to the (unnamed) king of Connacht, who convinced Mac Murchada’s allies to abandon him and force him into exile. In the events as narrated by the Song (and to a degree the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Annals of the Four Masters) Derbforgaill is clearly a dupe, but in Gerald of Wales’s Expugnatio Hibernica she becomes more blameworthy:On an occasion when Ua Ruairc king of Meath had gone off on an expedition to far distant parts, his wife, Ua Máelechlainn's daughter, whom he had left on an island in Meath, was abducted by the aforesaid Diramait, who had long been burning with love for her and took advantage of her husband's absence. No doubt she was abducted because she wanted to be and, since 'woman is always a fickle and inconstant creature', she herself arranged that she should become the kidnapper's prize.Almost all the world's most notable catastrophes have been caused by women, witness Mark Antony and Troy. King Ua Ruairc was stirred to extreme anger on two counts, of which however the disgrace, rather than the loss of his wife, grieved him more deeply, and he vented all the venom of his fury with a view to revenge. And so he called together and mustered his own forces and those of neighbouring peoples, and roused to the same purpose Ruaidrí, prince of Connacht and at that time supreme ruler of all Ireland. The men of Leinster, seeing that their prince was now in a difficult position and surrounded on all sides by his enemies' forces, sought to pay him back, and recalled to mind injustices which they had long concealed and stored deep <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hearts..</b> They made common cause with his enemies, and the men of rank among this people deserted Mac Murchada along with his good fortune... he finally trusted his life to the sea in flight, and so to speak had recourse to this last hope of saving himself.In addition to the classical references to Mark Antony and Troy, the quotation used by Gerald is from Mercury's pushing Aeneis to leave Dido and fulfill his fate by sailing to Italy, in the Aeneid.|$|E

500|$|Horch, who had {{remained}} a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest {{as his own}} in 1923, [...] started to fall out with them for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception they said he had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associated from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as building owner {{and director of the}} cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's [...] "fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed" [...] and of their enduring [...] "loyalty and selfless sacrifice" [...] over that period. She reaffirmed their [...] "flaming devotion" [...] which they continued to hold <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hearts.</b> And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert unilateral control over their affairs had caused them to [...] "contemplate, review and think of matters in a new light." [...] These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately.|$|E
