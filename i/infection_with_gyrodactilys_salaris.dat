40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{blood samples}} of chronic and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi -infected patients {{from the city}} of Reconquista located in the northeast of Argentina where no information was previously obtained about the genotype of infecting parasites. Fourteen samples of congenital and 19 chronical patients were analyzed by hybridization with DNA probes of minicircle hypervariable regions (mHVR). In congenital patients, 50 % had single <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId, 7 % single <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIIe, 29 % mixed <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId/e, and 7 % had mixed <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId/b and 7 % TcIId/b, respectively.

40|$|Interactions among host, {{microbiota}} and viral pathogens {{are complex}} and poorly understood. The goal {{of the present study}} is to assess the changes in the skin microbial community of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in response to experimental <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> salmonid alphavirus (SAV). The salmon skin microbial community was determined using 16 S rDNA pyrosequencing in five different experimental groups: control, 7 days after <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> low-dose SAV, 14 days after <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> low-dose SAV, 7 days after <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> high-dose SAV, and 14 days after <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> high-dose SAV. Both infection treatment and time after infection were strong predictors of the skin microbial community composition. Skin samples from SAV 3 infected fish showed an unbalanced microbiota characterized by a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria such as Oleispira sp. and increased abundances of opportunistic taxa including Flavobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae and Tenacibaculum sp.
