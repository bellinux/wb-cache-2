40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} assess the {{exposure}} of children in outdoor play areas of <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> in Auckland City to traffic-related PM 10 pollution. An estimated 400 premature deaths occur each year in New Zealand due to motor vehicle emissions. In addition to premature deaths, acute and chronic health effects including asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), heart disease and bronchitis, as well as increased hospitalisations and restricted activity days (sick days) are also associated with vehicle emissions. Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory diseases such as asthma can be exacerbated by increases in the concentration of particulates of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM 10) from motor vehicle emissions. Significant positive associations have been found between proximity to heavily travelled roads and increased childhood respiratory disease symptoms including hospitalisations for childhood asthma. In spite of this evidence, many <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> in Auckland are located adjacent to busy roads. Children at these <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> spend much of their time playing in the outdoor areas of these centres with the potential for particulates from motor vehicle emissions to exacerbate symptoms in those children already suffering from respiratory disease and asthma. Very little research has been carried out either in New Zealand or internationally on the air quality of outdoor play areas of <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> in relation to motor vehicle emissions and childhood respiratory disease and asthma. The extent of monitoring is also limited and the amount of exposure data available in New Zealand relatively sparse, particularly in comparison with Europe. Levels of traffic-related PM 10 in the outdoor play areas of <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> were measured in centres located adjacent to busy roads and in centres away from a quiet road or adjacent to a very quiet road for comparison. Two of five <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> located alongside busy roads had PM 10 levels that exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value. While PM 10 levels monitored at the other three centres located alongside busy roads did not exceed the WHO guideline value, results were often only marginally within this guideline value. In contrast, PM 10 levels monitored at two centres located away from a quiet road and one centre located adjacent to a very quiet road were well within the WHO guideline value. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that children attending <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> located alongside busy roads have greater exposure to traffic-related PM 10 pollution than those attending <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> located away from a quiet road or adjacent to a very quiet road. If the link between PM 10 exposure and health effects is causal, as suggested by epidemiological studies, then children attending <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> proximal to busy roads are at a greater risk of respiratory illness than children attending <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> adjacent to quiet roads. Further work is required to confirm the findings in this small sample of air quality around <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> in a larger sample, and possibly to undertake an epidemiological study to confirm the link to health effects. Drawing on the precautionary principle, prudent territorial local authorities should be encouraged to introduce regulations ensuring that any new <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> are located at a specified distance from major roads, and that information for parents, ongoing PM 10 monitoring and processes for issuing PM 10 advisories when limits are exceeded are available in existing <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>centres</b> that are adjacent to busy roads...|$|R

5000|$|In 2013, East Ayrshire Council {{launched}} a consultation {{report on the}} future of the education provision at a number of primary and secondary schools in the Kilmarnock area, including James Hamilton Academy, New Farm Primary School, New Farm <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> <b>Centre</b> and Silverwood Primary School. This report put forward the case for educational provision at the schools coming to an end in term 2016/17 (however, as of January 2017, this has run over time and projected now for 2018 completion), and the named educational establishments merge into one campus. This would lead to the creation of a [...] "superschool", merging James Hamilton Academy and Kilmarnock Academy together, as well as New Farm Primary, New Farm <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> <b>Centre</b> and Silverwood Primary together. In 2016, the decision was made to house these schools on the newly formed William Mcilvanney campus, named after the late William McIlvanney who was born in Kilmarnock and best-selling crime author. The secondary provision will remain as Kilmarnock Academy, whilst the primary provision is renamed as James Hamilton Primary and <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> <b>Centre.</b>|$|E
