50|$|Replaced by a newer {{facility}} called Cajun Field, {{the stadium}} was demolished in 2000 {{to make room}} for Oliver Hall, named after James R. Oliver, who created the Computer Science Department at Louisiana-Lafayette. Oliver Hall houses the University's Computer Science Department. The original dirt track that <b>encircled</b> McNaspy <b>Field</b> partially remains as a reminder of this university landmark.|$|R
50|$|The {{stadium is}} noted for being one-of-a-kind in its design, {{consisting}} of standard bleacher and box seating {{to one side}} and a three-tiered terrace on the opposite side, consisting of 250 paved parking spots allowing spectators to tailgate and watch games from their vehicles. A track also <b>encircles</b> the <b>field,</b> allowing its use for track and field events.|$|R

5000|$|The program's {{first season}} was 1890, {{making it one}} of the earlier {{football}} programs established in the United States. The team's home field is Memorial Stadium, which opened in 1921 and is the seventh-oldest college football stadium in the nation. Until 2014, Memorial Stadium was one of the few football stadiums in Division I that had a track <b>encircling</b> the <b>field.</b> [...] KU's all-time record is 581-620-58, as of the conclusion of the 2016 season.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountains}} form {{a natural}} barrier between the Mediterranean and sub-continental climate in the region. The southern slopes drop down rapidly and <b>encircle</b> the Meglen <b>field</b> while the northern slopes gradually fall down towards the rivers Crna and Boshavica.|$|R
50|$|In 1831, Michael Faraday {{discovered}} {{electromagnetic induction}} {{when he found}} that a changing magnetic <b>field</b> generates an <b>encircling</b> electric <b>field.</b> He described this phenomenon in {{what is known as}} Faraday's law of induction. Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampère's force law. In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.|$|R

50|$|The stadium {{was built}} in the early 1920s by the wealthy owner of the local Thompson's Lumber Company. It was built against a hill in Staten Island's Stapleton {{neighborhood}} and doubled in summer as a home for semi-pro baseball. Inside its stockade fence, about 8,000 uncovered bleacher seats <b>encircled</b> the <b>field.</b> The field's locker rooms consisted of sheds standing just outside the fence. Stapletons owner, Dan Blaine, owned a restaurant which was located next door to the stadium, and after games and practices players and fans would meet up for beers.|$|R
2500|$|The Black Plague between 1346 and 1349 killed {{almost half}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Constantinople. The city was severely depopulated due to the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast <b>fields</b> <b>encircled</b> by the fifth-century Theodosian walls.|$|R
50|$|Hives erected by humans, as {{a defense}} for their crops against elephants, are {{sometimes}} destroyed by elephants. These hives are hung on a single metal wire that <b>encircles</b> the crop <b>field</b> of some farms in African elephant territory.

5000|$|On the February 23, 2017, the Board of Regents granted {{authority}} to the Chancellor to extend UH's contract with IMG Sports. Part of the contract extension calls for IMG to pay $2.5M for additional LED ribbon boards at TDECU Stadium. Athletic Director Hunter Yurachek told the Regents that ribbon boards will now <b>encircle</b> the entire <b>field.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sanford Stadium's hedges have <b>encircled</b> the <b>field</b> {{since the}} stadium's first game against Yale in 1929. The idea to put hedges {{around the field}} came from the Business Manager of the UGA Athletic Department, Charlie Martin. Martin claimed to have {{received}} inspiration for the idea {{during a visit to}} the Rose Bowl, where he saw the hedge of roses in that stadium. Roses were not a suitable choice for the climate in Athens, so privet hedges were used instead. Six other SEC stadiums have copied UGA and now have hedges, making this feature no longer unique to UGA, but Georgia has the only one that completely surrounds the playing field.|$|R
50|$|The school fields {{teams in}} cross country, football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, swimming, wrestling, golf, baseball, softball, tennis, and track and field. The school {{is in the}} 5A {{classification}} of the Oregon School Activities Association and competes in the Intermountain Conference. Known as the Ravens, the school colors are purple, black and silver. The school's 1,400-seat football stadium is located on campus and has an eight-lane track <b>encircling</b> the <b>field.</b> The Ravens varsity football team won the 2013 OSAA 4A state title in only its second year as a public school. There are also two softball and two baseball diamonds, along with a weight room, wrestling room, gymnasium, and eight tennis courts.|$|R
5000|$|The Stars first game, {{played at}} the Pittsburgh Coliseum was rained out. The Stars played many {{independent}} teams {{as well as the}} two Philadelphia teams that made up the NFL. The very next week, the Stars defeated the Pennsylvania Railroad Y.M.C.A. 30-0. In 1902, a regulation football field was 110 yards long with the midpoint falling at the 55-yard line. This size is still used in the Canadian Football League today. Because the Coliseum had been formatted for bicycle racing with a wooden track that completely <b>encircled</b> the <b>field</b> and cut off the ends, the Stars played on an [...] "undersized" [...] 100-yard field.|$|R
50|$|Three discoveries {{challenged}} this {{foundation of}} magnetism, though. First, in 1819, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that an electric current generates a magnetic <b>field</b> <b>encircling</b> it. Then in 1820, André-Marie Ampère showed that parallel wires having currents {{in the same}} direction attract one another. Finally, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart discovered the Biot-Savart law in 1820, which correctly predicts the magnetic field around any current-carrying wire.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle to}} control the ruins of Osgiliath had {{actually}} been fought, on and off, {{for over a century}} since the fall of Ithilien to Mordor. Minas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a fortified wall <b>encircling</b> the Pelennor <b>Fields</b> and meeting up with Osgiliath, where the Causeway Forts were built and garrisoned, though Osgiliath itself remained in ruins. This outwall fell into disrepair as the kingdom declined.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} part of the Battle of France the SF Thionville was {{relatively}} quiet. Both sides kept up shelling and harassing attacks, but there were no major engagements in the sector in May and early June 1940. Elsewhere, the situation was deteriorating fast. To the west, the German 16th Army was advancing up the valley of the Meuse to Verdun, aiming for Metz and Nancy. In the center, the German 1st Army had broken through at the Sarre on 15 June. To the east, the Rhine was crossed on the same day. German armies were moving freely behind French lines with the goal of <b>encircling</b> France's <b>field</b> armies, capturing the cities of Alsace and Lorraine, and cutting off the fixed fortifications.|$|R
50|$|The {{park was}} {{located on a}} small block bounded by Congress, Loomis, Harrison and Throop Streets, with the diamond toward its western end. The {{elongated}} shape of the block lent a bathtub-like shape to the park, with foul lines reportedly as short as 216 feet. The stadium held roughly 10,000 fans. In addition to the diamond, the park held a bicycle track which <b>encircled</b> the playing <b>field,</b> {{at the height of}} the contemporary bicycle craze.|$|R
50|$|The school {{boasts a}} large outdoor greenspace which {{consists}} of five soccer fields, two baseball fields, a football field and two running tracks. The running tracks consist of one paved, 5-lane track that <b>encircles</b> the football <b>field,</b> and a backed dirt trail that hugs the outside perimeter of the school property for endurance running. All of which (minus half of a soccer field) are currently out of bounds to the students during the school day.|$|R
25|$|Once Operation Barbarossa was launched, the 9th Panzer Division, part of XIV Panzer Corps (Germany) of the Army Group South, {{pushed through}} Ukraine on 28 June, heading to Kiev. The {{division}} {{broke through the}} Stalin Line on 7 July, {{took part in the}} encirclement of Uman, and captured Krivoy Rog and Nikopol on 17 August. The 9th Panzer Division then captured the Dnieper River Dam at Zaporizhia on 25 August. From there, it was made the spearhead of Panzer Group Kleist, driving to Kiev from the south while Panzer Group Guderian drove behind the city from the north. The two groups linked up on 15 September, <b>encircling</b> five <b>field</b> armies of the Soviet Army. The division was part of the force that captured 667,000 Soviet prisoners and 900 tanks in the city.|$|R
50|$|The Nicaeans {{eventually}} reconquered Constantinople {{from the}} Latins in 1261. Thereafter {{there was little}} peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the Serbians, the Bulgarians, and, most importantly, the Ottoman Turks. The Black Plague between 1346 and 1349 killed {{almost half of the}} inhabitants of Constantinople. The city was severely depopulated due to the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast <b>fields</b> <b>encircled</b> by the fifth-century Theodosian walls.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} extends {{within an}} area of 212.2 km2, in a confluence of river valleys marked by the Douro, Tâmega and Sousa Rivers, connecting the littoral region and the Transmontana zone. It is a landscape of deep valleys, with intense irrigated zones and pasturelands, with <b>fields</b> <b>encircled</b> by forests of pine and eucalyptus. This inter-fluvial region have granite soils and is rich in water resources, permitting intensive agriculture and extraction industries. The southwest extension of the municipality include a complex of Schist and Greywacke geology, resulting in mountainous, uncultivated and largely forest lands.|$|R
5000|$|Kanimangalam is <b>encircled</b> by paddy <b>field</b> locally {{named as}} [...] "kole land" [...] {{is one of}} the nesting places of migratory birds. This kole land lies one or two meters below sea level and {{traditionally}} cultivate rice. It become a lake during monsoon and it lasts 5 months. After that the whole lake is drained using hundreds of large pump sets from different stations. During the monsoon season the kole land become rich habitat for local fishes like karimeen, pallathi, bral, musu, and lot of varies of fauna and flora.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike many NFL teams, the Cowboys do not retire jersey {{numbers of}} past standouts {{as a matter}} of policy. Instead, the team has a [...] "Ring of Honor", which is on {{permanent}} display <b>encircling</b> the <b>field.</b> Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at AT Stadium in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president. Although the team does not officially retire jersey numbers, some are kept [...] "unofficially inactive", so it is uncommon to find any current players wearing the number of one of the [...] "Ring of Honor" [...] inductees. For instance, the jersey numbers of inductees Aikman (8), Staubach (12), Hayes and Smith (22), Irvin (88), and Lilly (74) were not worn during the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, number 88 was issued to rookie Dez Bryant.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{original}} pattern of settlement, the inhabited areas are located around the waterways, <b>fields</b> <b>encircling</b> especially the largest lakes. The lakes are navigable but the rapids of Kymijoki and Kokemäenjoki restrict navigation to the sea. Similarly, the lakes form three separate navigable areas. Lake Näsijärvi can be navigated for over 100 kilometers north of Tampere, while the lakes Pyhäjärvi, Vanajavesi and Roine have been connected by canals since the 19th century, forming another significant waterway. On the other hand, Lake Päijänne, the second largest lake in Finland, connects Lahti and Päijänne Tavastia to Central Finland and Jyväskylä.|$|R
