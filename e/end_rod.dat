50|$|The T20 solves {{this problem}} by {{incorporating}} a once-through oil injection system known as Posi-Force, which consists of an engine-driven oil pump coupled to the throttle, {{which is designed to}} provide the proper amount of oil needed at the current RPM and throttle opening. The pump draws clean oil from a separate oil tank, and pumps it through hoses into the crankcase, where it is injected into the engine from a nozzle located between the intake manifold and the cylinder. A separate oil injection point is also provided for the main bearing(s) and big <b>end</b> <b>rod</b> bearings of the crankshaft. This dual-point injection made the Posi-Force system far superior to the competitions' single point per cylinder systems.

40|$|Frequency {{dependent}} {{mechanical properties}} of elastic metamaterials with locally resonant microstructures were investigated. Due to the dynamic {{behavior of the}} microstructures, the mechanical properties of these elastic metamaterials, if represented by effective continuous media, would exhibit frequency dependent characteristics. This phenomenon was studied from the energy propagation point of view. Based on the monatomic mass lattice model, two band gap formation mechanisms were proposed. For each representative element, considering the time period when effective mass velocity increases from zero to maximum, if the kinetic energy requirement is beyond the capability of the external work of external spring, the monatomic lattice type band gap would be generated; if the kinetic energy requirement is negative, the two inner masses interaction type of band gap would be generated. This analytical solution was also verified by FE simulation. Following that, the band gap in diatomic mass-in-mass lattice systems was explained based on the proposed two formation mechanisms, and the passing band between the two band gaps generated by the single negative effective mass in diatomic mass-in-mass lattice systems was eliminated based on the analytical derivation and verified by the tone burst wave propagation using FE simulation. Further, the dynamic behavior of rods made of elastic metamaterials with frequency dependent properties was investigated. Based on the frequency dependent mass density and Young’s modulus for the effective continuum, {{it was found that}} the rod natural frequency distribution was changed and no natural resonance frequency in the band gap region of the corresponding metamaterial. Besides, the general wave amplitude transfer function was derived for wave propagation in layered structures, and the final transmitted wave amplitude of the layered metamaterial structure with decreasing density was obtained using Mathematical Induction method. Making use of the frequency dependent properties, the elastic phase-controlling metalayer was also analyzed. It was analytically and numerically demonstrated that, whether a normal incident longitudinal wave can propagate through the interface depends on whether the wave length is larger or shorter than the periodic length of the metalayer element. In addition, since the phase gradients are the same at both sides of metalayer, this type of elastic metalayer may serve as an energy absorption material. Finally, the wave attenuation characteristics of an elastic metamaterial composed of spherical rubber-encased alumina particle inclusions in an epoxy matrix was verified by numerical simulation and coil shaker based vibration test. Moreover, the dynamic behavior of free-free <b>end</b> <b>rod</b> made of the same elastic metamaterial was obtained by piezoelectric patches based vibration tests. It was found that the wave attenuation effect would increase with the number of inner resonators, and the rod natural frequencies would shift ahead when input frequency was close to band gap region. ...|$|E

50|$|In early examples, the <b>rod's</b> <b>ends</b> {{had to be}} {{polished}} {{with great}} precision, such that the <b>ends</b> of the <b>rod</b> were flat to within {{a quarter of a}} wavelength of the output light, and parallel to each other within a few seconds of arc. The finely polished <b>ends</b> of the <b>rod</b> were silvered; one end completely, the other only partially. The rod, with its reflective ends, then acts as a Fabry-Pérot etalon (or a Gires-Tournois etalon). Modern lasers often use rods with antireflection coatings, or with the ends cut and polished at Brewster's angle instead. This eliminates the reflections from the <b>ends</b> of the <b>rod.</b> External dielectric mirrors then are used to form the optical cavity. Curved mirrors are typically used to relax the alignment tolerances and to form a stable resonator, often compensating for thermal lensing of the rod.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular rod buckles helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically buckled rod are investigated. Both end conditions locate the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> on the cylinder axis. The pinned end condition considers the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement. The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and translation, requires the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents radial movement. Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the <b>end,</b> the <b>rod</b> behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|R
