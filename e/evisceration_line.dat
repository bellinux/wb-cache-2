40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a poultry processing plant in South Carolina. The United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service required the plant to request a NIOSH evaluation {{in order to obtain}} an <b>evisceration</b> <b>line</b> speed waiver under the Salmonella Initiative Program. The plant asked NIOSH to identify the potential for increase in musculoskeletal and upper extremities trauma due to the planned <b>evisceration</b> <b>line</b> speed increase. In response to this request, NIOSH investigators evaluated ergonomic hazards, nerve damage in employees' hands and wrists (known as carpal tunnel syndrome), and traumatic injuries during three visits. We assessed repetition and force in 67 job tasks, and collected medical and personnel records, and logs of work-related injuries and illnesses to evaluate musculoskeletal disorders and traumatic injuries. In an August 2012 baseline evaluation, we gave a questionnaire and tested nerve function for Fresh Plant production line employees and live hang contractors. After our baseline evaluation, two evisceration lines were combined into one resulting in a similar number of birds processed by most employees daily. In a June 2013 follow-up evaluation, we interviewed Fresh Plant production line employees and live hang contractors who had participated in August 2012. We noted changes the plant had made after increasing the <b>evisceration</b> <b>line</b> speed and assessed the effect of these plant changes on musculoskeletal disorders and traumatic injuries among employees. The results of our baseline evaluation indicated that 41 % of participants were performing jobs above the ACGIH TLV for hand activity and force and 42 % had evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. The prevalence of hand or wrist symptoms (pain, burning, numbness, or tingling) was similar at baseline and follow-up. Fifty-seven percent of participants reported at least one musculoskeletal symptom (not including hand or wrist symptoms) at both baseline and follow-up evaluations. The Fresh Plant's rate of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses was higher than the poultry processing industry average for 2009 - 2012. The most common work-related injuries by cause, for all years, were "cut/puncture/scrape," "repetitive motion," "fall/slip/trip," "cumulative," and "caught in/under/between. " To address the potential for musculoskeletal disorders and traumatic injuries among employees, NIOSH investigators recommended the employer (1) implement the 2013 OSHA Guidelines for Poultry Processing and recommendations from poultry industry groups, (2) redesign job tasks so that levels of hand activity and force are below the ACGIH TLV, (3) use a job rotation schedule until the redesign is completed, (4) ensure that the knife change out schedule is strictly followed, (5) provide more than one break during the work shift, and (6) enhance reporting, screening, and medical assessment onsite to improve early intervention of musculoskeletal disorders and traumatic injuries. We recommended the employees (1) report symptoms and injuries as soon as they occur to supervisors and onsite medical staff, (2) use only sharp knives and change knives on a regular basis, (3) make sure the standing platforms are adjusted to the correct height, (4) report potential fall/slip/trip hazards to supervisors so they can be quickly addressed, and (5) follow up with onsite medical staff and your personal doctor if you were found to have an abnormal nerve conduction test result.

40|$|ABSTRACT Sub-atmospheric steam at {{ordinary}} scalding temperatures {{was shown}} in laboratory tests to readily loosen feathers on dry birds. The possibility {{that this type of}} pure steam treatment can be used to avoid the conventional scald tank was investigated in a broiler and a turkey processing plant using a batch scale vacuum tank. Steam scalded birds were interspersed with birds on the same picking line used for tank scalded birds. Pure steam at sub-atmospheric pressure readily provided a uniform scald of either dry or damp birds. A steam temperature of 124 °F. (51 °C.) for 2 min loosened the feathers sufficiently to give clean broilers comparable to birds tank scalded at 128 °F. (53 °C.) for 2 min. Little or no abrasion of the outside occurred. Under subscald conditions (134 - 138 °F.) typical subscald broilers, fowl, and turkeys were obtained by a 1 min. treatment. As anticipated, the air sacs of steam scalded birds had very few bacteria compared with the air sacs of tank scalded birds (more than 1, 000 -fold difference). However, after passing through the <b>evisceration</b> <b>line</b> and chiller the total bacterial load on the birds scalded by the two methods was similar. Steam scalded and tank scalded broilers had about the same shelf life at 37 °F. (3 "C.) and about the same degree of tenderness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Total aerobic bacteria, molds/yeasts, E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae {{in the air}} {{during the}} {{commercial}} production and processing of Japanese quail were enumerated at twelve different sites.

40|$|Introduction: Even if a {{small number}} of poultry {{carcasses}} contaminate with pathogenic food bacteria, the chance of spreading the infection in the chillers of poultry slaughterhouse, resulting in contamination of other carcasses also have been observed. In this study, Coliform bacteria, Salmonella and the Psychrophiles in the two different poultry slaughterhouse of Yazd province have been investigated. Methods: Sampling from each line (slaughter and chiller) in two stages (before and after removal from the line) three times (the beginning, middle {{and the end of the}} slaughtering) was carried out. Five Chicken carcasses were randomly selected, numbered and sampled both before entering the line and after exiting the line while rinsed using peptone Water. A total of 120 samples were sent to the laboratory for culturing and microbial counting. Results: Significant differences were detected between chiller and slaughter line. The population of coliforms in the slaughter line was significantly more than the chillers (p< 0. 01). In the case of salmonella the only difference was in the amount of bacteria between two slaughterhouse being significantly lower in slaughter house two (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results showed no significant differences among different treatments in respect to psychrophile bacteria. In general, it can be said that secondary contamination in the slaughter line along with gradual increase in temperature of the chiller can increase bacterial load of both coliforms and salmonella but it will not affect the amount of psychrophile bacteria. Due to some differences between the studied slaughterhouses, microbial load of coliform and salmonella can be acheived by improving the management and installation of appropriate aquipments in the <b>evisceration</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E
