40|$|Redox-sensitive {{detrital}} grains such as pyrite and uraninite in sedimentary successions {{provide one}} of the most conspicuous geological clues to a different composition of the Archean and early Paleoproterozoic atmosphere. Today, these minerals are rapidly chemically weathered within short transport distances. Prior to the rise of oxygen, low O_ 2 concentrations allowed their survival in siliciclastic deposits with <b>grain</b> <b>erosion</b> tied only to physical transport processes. After the rise of oxygen, redox-sensitive detrital grains effectively vanish from the sedimentary record. To get {{a better understanding of the}} timing of this transition, we examined sandstones recorded in a scientific drill core from the South African 2. 415 Ga Koegas Subgroup, a mixed siliciclastic and iron formation–bearing unit deposited on the western deltaic margin of the Kaapvaal craton in early Paleoproterozoic time. We observed detrital pyrite and uraninite grains throughout all investigated sandstone beds in the section, indicating the rise of oxygen is younger than 2. 415 Ga. To better understand how observations of detrital pyrite and uraninite in sedimentary rocks can quantitatively constrain Earth surface redox conditions, we constructed a model of <b>grain</b> <b>erosion</b> from chemical weathering and physical abrasion to place an upper limit on ancient environmental O_ 2 concentrations. Even conservative model calculations for deltaic depositional systems with sufficient transport distances (approximately hundreds of kilometers) show that redox-sensitive detrital grains are remarkably sensitive to environmental O_ 2 concentrations, and they constrain the Archean and early Paleoproterozoic atmosphere to have < 3. 2 × 10 ^(– 5) atm of molecular O_ 2. These levels are lower than previously hypothesized for redox-sensitive detrital grains, but they are consistent with estimates made from other redox proxy data, including the anomalous fractionation of sulfur isotopes. The binary loss of detrital pyrite and uraninite from the sedimentary record coincident with the rise of oxygen indicates that atmospheric O_ 2 concentrations rose substantially at this time and were never again sufficiently low (< 0. 01 atm) to enable survival and preservation of these grains in short transport systems...|$|R
40|$|A new {{extended}} {{technique for}} 3 D modelling of normal grain growth in low carbon steels {{is presented in}} this paper.

The distortion of the grain size distribution is also calculated. In the remnant of SN 1979 c, the population of the grains of radius 0. 1 micron, for example, will be diminished substantially in both the ejecta and the CSM, while in the remnant of SN 1980 k, it will be affected considerably only in the ejecta.

40|$|We {{have applied}} the SRIM {{computer}} code {{to study the}} sputtering of some likely astrophysical grain materials, and we have shown that selective embedding of metallic projectiles offers a partial explanation of gas-phase depletions. We show that supernova shockwaves sweep a significantly larger mass of interstellar gas per unit time than the shockwaves generated by outflows in star-forming regions. We apply our sputtering model to the bombardment levels expected in a supernova shock, and show that net embedding may dominate over net sputtering, leading to grain growth under some circumstances, particularly when the bombarding gas is enriched with metals from the supernova progenitor star.

The set of equations determined for 316 steel wasused in a computer model modified from the one developed by Leduc (1980) for simulation of hot rolling loads and microstructural evolution. Partially recrystallized microstructure was generated in a laboratory hot rolling mill and was reasonably simulated by the use of the computer programme. Non-isothermal plane strain compression tests were carried out for direct simulation of laboratory hot rolling results. Comparison between experimental hot rolling and plane strain compression data has shown reasonable levels of agreement in the microstructural simulations undertaken in the present work. The mean plane strain strengths from non-isothermal plane strain compression tests were higher than the ones from hot rolling.

40|$|The grain growth, thermal stability, and {{recrystallization}} {{behavior of}} a cryomilled Ti alloy with a grain size of about 21. 2 nm were examined using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Isochronal heat treatments at different temperatures were applied to study the thermal stability and recrystallization behavior of this alloy system. The average grain size increased from 20 to 80 nm in the temperature range of 200 degrees C to 350 degrees C, and then significantly decreased to 15 nm during annealing at 400 degrees C to 450 degrees C. This phenomenon was rationalized {{on the basis of}} a recrystallization mechanism. When the annealing temperature increased from 450 degrees C to 720 degrees C, the grain size increased slightly from 15. 2 to 27. 5 nm.

40|$|Following our {{previous}} work, we investigate through hydrodynamic simulations {{the destruction of}} newly-formed dust grains by sputtering in the reverse shocks of supernova remnants. Using an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition. We vary the relative velocity between the reverse shock and ejecta clump to explore the effects of shock-heating and cloud compression. Because supernova ejecta will be metal-enriched, we consider gas metallicities from Z/Z = 1 to 100 and their influence on cooling properties of the cloud and the thermal sputtering rates of embedded dust grains. We post-process the simulation output to calculate grain sputtering {{for a variety of}} species and size distributions. In the metallicity regime considered in this paper, the balance between increased radiative cooling and increased <b>grain</b> <b>erosion</b> depends on the impact velocity of the reverse shock. For slow shocks (vshock ≤ 3000 km s− 1), the amount of dust destruction is comparable across metallicities, or in some cases is decreased with increased metallicity. For higher shock velocities (vshock ≥ 5000 km s− 1), an increase in metallicity from Z/Z = 10 to 100 can lead to an additional 24 % destruction of the initial dust mass. While the total dust destruction varies widely across grain species and simulation parameters, our most extreme cases result in complete destruction for some grain species and only 44 % dust mass survival for the most robust species. These survival rates are important in understanding how early supernovae contribute to the observed dust masses in high-redshift galaxies.

40|$|Grain-size sorting in subaqueous grain {{flows of}} a {{continuous}} range of grain sizes is studied experimentally with three mixtures.

Nineteen grades of WC-Co alloys were studied. These alloys had been previously characterised according to microstructural and mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that control glacier dynamics and fast ice stream flow are still poorly understood, {{largely due to}} the inaccessibility of the subglacial environment. One of the ways to improve on current investigations is to broaden the methods used to monitor the subglacial environment. An autonomous multi-sensor wireless probe was developed for use within an Environmental Sensor Network at Briksdalsbreen, Norway. Probes were deployed at the base of boreholes, measuring temperature, pressure, resistance (a proxy for conductivity), case strain, and tilt, six times a day. The probes used radio_communications to [...] transfer data to a base station at the glacier surface. The data was then sent to a reference station, which uploaded it onto the internet on a daily basis. In excess of a year's worth of data was obtained from several probes, deployed between 2004 - 2006. Readings of case strain and tilt indicated when the probes had become incorporated into the deforming bed. A reduction in sensor activity was displayed as the glacier changed from a summer to a winter regime. In the following spring, the sensors showed an increase in activity, particularly in water pressure. An Emergent Spring Event was recorded in February, followed by the actual Spring Event. This marked a transition to summer conditions within the glacier's hydrological system. Sliding was the dominant mechanism ofbasal motion during this time. In the summer, the probes began to rotate as the dominant form of basal motion transferred from sliding to till deformation. The movement of the probes was in keeping with the Taylor (1923) mechanism of clast rotation. Sedimentological analyses under the scanning electron microscope presented a relatively simple model for <b>grain</b> <b>erosion</b> within the deforming bed. Erosion occurs within a continuum whereby processes of both fracture and abrasion combine, generating intermediate grain forms. The style of deformation experienced is controlled {{by the nature of the}} bedrock and the overall strain imposed on the till. At Briksdalsbreen there was good evidence for erosion, but little evidence for the production of a significant silt component. This investigation demonstrates the potential for the use ofESNs within glacial environments. The probes provide a successful means by which the properties of and processes operating within the subglacial environment can be assessed over broad temporal and spatial scales. For the first time, activity was recorded within the subglacial environment much earlier than previously expected (January) and the spring event within unconnected regions of the bed was monitored and characterised. The records produced highlighted the complexity of hydro-mechanical interactions and the need for further study to constrain these processes. The probes also provided the first natural records of in situ clast rotation from within the deforming bed. This movement may have implications for models of clast rotation, the identification and classification of sediments, and models of grain interactions on the micro-scale.

40|$|The {{wavelength}} {{at which}} a dune pattern emerges from a flat sand bed {{is controlled by the}} sediment transport saturation length, which is the length needed for the sand flux to adapt to a change of wind strength. The influence of the wind shear velocity on this saturation length and on the subsequent dune initial wavelength has remained controversial. In this letter, we present direct measurements of the saturation length performed in a wind tunnel experiment. In complement, initial dune wavelengths are measured under different wind conditions – in particular after storms. Using the linear stability analysis of dune formation, it is then possible to deduce the saturation length from field data. Both direct and indirect measurements agree that the saturation length is almost independent of the wind strength.

Much of this area has been degraded by erosion but is still used for <b>grain</b> production. <b>Erosion</b> has caused variable topsoil depth within fields {{which in turn has}} resulted in greater within-field variability of crop yield, magnified the drought-prone nature of these soils, and lowered the overall soil productivity and ecosystem function. In recent years, pressure on these sensitive soils has risen due to higher demand for grain production, in part for ethanol and biodiesel. In some areas, highly erodible fields which were historically managed as CRP and pasture are being turned into grain crop acres. Thus as new and fluctuating feed and bioenergy markets develop, land management practices will also shift, resulting in changes in soil and water quality of watersheds. This presentation will explore the likely environmental implications of different types of bioenergy production on the soil resource. Further, the positive benefits of potential changes in land use will be in explored. For example, one alternative for sensitive soils is production of perennial grass as a feedstock for coal co-burning plants and for potential future use in cellulosic ethanol production. Perennial grass yields are likely to be less variable than grain yields, both year-to-year and within fields, primarily because of greater resistance to drought. Grass production systems also provide environmental services not obtained from annual grain crops. We will also discuss our work on developing ways to target the most appropriate places in the landscape for grain or perennial production so as to enhance ecosystem services and improve soil and water quality...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} erosion rates by in-situ 10 Be {{concentrations}} in granites of Miocene high-elevation paleosurfaces in Corsica indicates maximum erosion rates between 8 and 24 mm/kyear. The regional distribution of measured erosion rates {{indicates that the}} local climatic conditions, namely precipitation, the petrographic composition of granites, {{and the degree of}} brittle deformation govern erosion rates. Chemical erosion dominates even at elevations around 2, 000 m in presently subalpine climate conditions. Field evidence indicates that erosion operates by continuous dissolution and/or disintegration to <b>grains</b> (grusification). The <b>erosion</b> rates are relatively high with respect to the preservation of inferred Early Miocene landscapes. We infer temporal burial in the Middle Miocene and significantly lower erosion rates in the Neogene until ∼ 3 Ma to explain the preservation of paleosurfaces, in line with fission track data. Valley incision rates that are a magnitude higher than erosion rates on summit surfaces result in relief enhancement and long-term isostatic surface uplift. On the other hand, widening and deepening of valleys by cyclic glaciation progressively destroys the summit surface relics...|$|R
