5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority.

5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Each human player {{controls}} one hero, {{a powerful}} unit with unique abilities. In DotA, players {{on each side}} choose one of 112 heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes.

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to see how}} to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{attachment}} theory {{had significant}} policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, {{and those in}} poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> for {{scholars}} {{to piece together}} the exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{determine}} how far previous reigns had broken Roman Catholic devotion, with its belief in the saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those that drew public financial support—had been shaken.
