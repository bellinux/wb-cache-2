5|$|Stela 9 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> slate {{monument}} {{dated to}} 662. Its text describes {{the birth of}} king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' and gives him his full royal title.|$|E
5|$|Close to {{the source}} of the river the {{underlying}} geology <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of Fuller's earth clay over Yeovil Sands. The resulting light soil made the area important for the production of flax and for market gardening in the past.|$|E
5|$|Petunia Dursley, {{the sister}} of Harry's mother Lily, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. She regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.|$|E

5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of duodenum <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery. It {{is also known}} as the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{outer surface}} of the Sun is called the photosphere. Above this layer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> region known as the chromosphere. This is {{surrounded}} by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona.|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around the melting pit <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E
5000|$|Spaghettoni <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thicker {{spaghetti}} {{which takes}} {{more time to}} cook. Spaghettini <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thinner</b> form which takes less time to cook. Capellini <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very <b>thin</b> form of spaghetti (it may be called [...] "angel hair spaghetti" [...] in English) which cooks very quickly.|$|R

5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
5|$|The Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews {{have become}} popular in Israel {{and can be}} bought frozen in supermarkets. Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked {{overnight}} at a very low heat. It is traditionally served with a crushed or grated tomato dip, hard boiled eggs and skhug. Malawach <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called injera from millet flour.|$|E

5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the epicuticle, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> and waxy water {{resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E
5|$|The wind-wind {{collision}} cone {{separates the}} winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that {{are unlikely to be}} produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000K and 41,000K.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{peridium}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies {{about a third}} to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> polar membrane made of {{two layers of}} lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E

5|$|The typical contact {{call of the}} {{goldcrest}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin,</b> high-pitched zee {{given at}} intervals of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough {{than that of the}} firecrest. The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee. The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
