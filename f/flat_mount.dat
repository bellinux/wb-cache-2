40|$|The {{zebrafish}} embryo is now {{commonly used}} for basic and biomedical research {{to investigate the}} genetic control of developmental processes and to model congenital abnormalities. During {{the first day of}} life, the zebrafish embryo progresses through many developmental stages including fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, segmentation, and the organogenesis of structures such as the kidney, heart, and central nervous system. The anatomy of a young zebrafish embryo presents several challenges for the visualization and analysis of the tissues involved in many of these events because the embryo develops in association with a round yolk mass. Thus, for accurate analysis and imaging of experimental phenotypes in fixed embryonic specimens between the tailbud and 20 somite stage (10 and 19 hours post fertilization (hpf), respectively), such as those stained using whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH), it is often desirable to remove the embryo from the yolk ball and to position it flat on a glass slide.

Therefore, successful and efficient <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> preparation is greatly facilitated through the visual demonstration of the dissection technique, and also helped by using reagents that assist in optimal tissu...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is {{the leading}} cause of {{blindness}} in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of vasostatin (VS), an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, on CNV. Methods: Anti-angiogenic activity of VS was evaluated in vitro by migration and tube formation assays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). CNV lesions were induced in Brown Norway rats by fundus argon laser photocoagulation. Beginning one day after CNV induction, rats were treated with eye drops containing 1 μg/ml VS in PBS buffer for three times daily for 20 days. The extent of CNV was examined by <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> analysis on day 24 or by fundus fluorescein angiography (FAG) on days 21, 28, 35, and 42, respectively. CNV lesions and choroidal vascularity were evaluated by histological analysis. The spatial distribution of topically applied VS in rat eyes was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Results: VS inhibited migration and tube formation in HUVECs. <b>Flat</b> <b>mount</b> analysis revealed that, after laser-induced photocoagulation, topical VS application for 20 days significantly reduced CNV lesions. Moreover, serial FAG analysis indicated that a 20 day VS treatment significantly reduced CNV lesions on all subsequent days.

40|$|The retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is a key site of pathogenesis for many retina diseases. The formation of drusen in the retina is characteristic of retinal degeneration. We investigate morphological changes in the RPE {{in the presence of}} soft drusen using an integrated experimental and modeling approach. We collect RPE <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> images from donated human eyes and develop 1) statistical tools to quantify the images and 2) a cell-based model to simulate the morphology evolution. We compare three different mechanisms of RPE repair evolution, cell apoptosis, cell fusion, and expansion, and Simulations of our RPE morphogenesis model quantitatively reproduce deformations of human RPE morphology due to drusen, suggesting that a purse-string mechanism is sufficient to explain how RPE heals cell loss caused by drusen-damage. We found that drusen beneath tissue promote cell death in a number that far exceeds the cell numbers covering the drusen. Tissue deformations are studied using area distributions, Voronoi domains and a texture tensor. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|In the {{vertebrate}} retina, horizontal cells {{generate the}} inhibitory surround of bipolar cells, an essential step in contrast enhancement. For the last decades, the mechanism {{involved in this}} inhibitory synaptic pathway {{has been a major}} controversy in retinal research. One hypothesis suggests that connexin hemichannels mediate this negative feedback signal; another suggests that feedback is mediated by protons. Mutant zebrafish were generated that lack connexin 55. 5 hemichannels in horizontal cells. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made from isolated horizontal cells and cones in <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> retinas. Light-induced feedback from horizontal cells to cones was reduced in mutants. A reduction of feedback was also found when horizontal cells were pharmacologically hyperpolarized but was absent when they were pharmacologically depolarized. Hemichannel currents in isolated horizontal cells showed a similar behavior. The hyperpolarization-induced hemichannel current was strongly reduced in the mutants while the depolarization-induced hemichannel current was not. Intracellular recordings were made from horizontal cells. Consistent with impaired feedback in the mutant, spectral opponent responses in horizontal cells were diminished in these animals.

40|$|Aim: To {{demonstrate}} that interference microscopy of <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> internal limiting membrane specimens clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface. Methods: ILM specimens harvested during vitrectomy were fixed in glutaraldehyde 0. 05 % and paraformaldehyde 2 % for 24 h (pH 7. 4). In addition to interference microscopy, immunocytochemistry using antibodies against glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (NF) was performed. After washing in phosphatebuffered saline 0. 1 M, the specimens were flat-mounted on glass slides without sectioning, embedding {{or any other}} technique of conventional light microscopy. A cover slide and 49, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) medium were added to stain the cell nuclei. Results: Interference microscopy clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the ILM. DAPI stained the cell nuclei. Areas of cellular proliferation can be easily distinguished from ILM areas without cells. Immunocytochemistry can be performed without changing the protocols used in conventional microscopy. Conclusion: Interference microscopy of <b>flat</b> <b>mounted</b> ILM specimens gives {{new insights into the}} distribution of cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface and allows for determination of the cell density at the ILM.

40|$|Backgrounds. Age-related macular {{degeneration}} {{is closely related}} to lipid oxidation, while relationship between OX-LDL and choroidal neovascularization is unclear. Recently, cylindromatosis is proved to regulate angiogenesis. However, its role in CNV progression remained unclear. Salvianolic acid A is widely used in vascular diseases. We investigated the relationship between OX-LDL and CNV and explore antineovascularization mechanism of Sal A. Methods. C 57 BL 6 /J mice were randomized into four groups and injected with PBS or OX-LDL, together with Sal A for one week. CNV was induced by laser; CNV severity was analyzed by fundus fluorescein angiography, H&E staining, and choroid <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> after 1 week. In in vitro experiments, ARPE- 19 and HUVECs were cultured with OX-LDL (with or without Sal A) for 48 hours. Angiogenic proteins, cell junction integrity, and tube formation were measured. CYLD siRNA and specific inhibitors were used to explore mechanisms of CYLD in promoting OX-LDL-induced CNV progression. Results. OX-LDL promoted laser-induced CNV volume by increasing VEGF, PDGF, and CYLD levels. Sal A antagonized OX-LDL effects and restrained CNV progression by decreasing VEGF/PDGF/CYLD, increasing antiangiostatin levels, and promoting P 62 -CYLD-TRAF 6 interaction. Conclusions. We demonstrated oxidation damage exacerbates CNV progression, and Sal A could be a clinical therapeutic reagent to exudative AMD...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{vascular}} permeability is an inciting {{event in}} many vascular complications including diabetic retinopathy. We have previously reported that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) {{is able to}} inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced angiogenesis through a novel c-secretase-dependent pathway. In this study, we asked whether inhibition of VEGF-induced permeability by PEDF is also c-secretase-mediated and to dissect the potential mechanisms involved. Vascular permeability was assessed in vitro by measuring transendothelial resistance and paracellular permeability to dextran and in vivo by following leakage of intravenous FITC-labelled albumin into the retina in {{the presence or absence}} of VEGF and PEDF in varying combinations. Experiments were undertaken in {{the presence or absence of}} a c-secretase inhibitor. To assess junctional integrity immunohistochemistry for the adherens junction (AJ) proteins, VE-cadherin and b-catenin, and the tight junction (TJ) protein, claudin- 5 was undertaken using cultured cells and <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> retinas. Protein expression and the association between AJ proteins, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and c-secretase constituents were determined by immunoprecipitation and Western Blot analysis. In selected experiments the effect of hypoxia on junctional integrity was also assessed. PEDF inhibition of VEGF-induced permeability, both in cultured microvascular endothelial cell monolayers and in vivo in the mouse retinal vasculature, is mediated by c-secretase. PEDF acted by a) preventing dissociation of AJ and TJ proteins and b) regulating both the association of VEGF receptors with AJ proteins and th...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} firstly specific proteomic changes within the retina in the course of an animal glaucoma model and to identify secondly new approaches for neuroprotective, therapeutic options in glaucoma by addressing those specific changes. Intraocular pressure was elevated through cauterization of episcleral veins in adult Sprague Dawley rats. Molecular and morphological changes were surveyed using mass spectrometry, optical coherence tomography as well as immunohistochemical cross section- and <b>flat</b> <b>mount</b> stainings. By quantifying more than 1500 retinal proteins, it was found that the HspB 5 protein and numerous beta-crystallins showed a uniform and unique shifting expression pattern as a result of different periods of elevated IOP exposure. Crystallins showed a significant downregulation (p< 0. 05) after 3 weeks of elevated IOP and an upregulation after 7 weeks. Counteracting those typical changes, an intravitreal injection of β-crystallin B 2 at the time of IOP elevation was found to reduce retinal ganglion cell loss (p< 0. 05), decrease of the retinal nerve fiber layer (p< 0. 05) and impairment of the optic nerve. Ultimately, proteomic data revealed that β-crystallin B 2 might influence calcium-depended cell signaling pathways with severe effect on apoptosis and gene regulation.
