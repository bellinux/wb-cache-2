The FLP protein was thermolabile (denatured at elevated temperatures) and therefore was not useful in the mammalian model due to elevated body temperatures of these model systems. However, due to patents and restrictions {{on the use of}} Cre-Lox recombination, great interest was taken to produce a more thermostable FLP-FRT cassette. Some of the first results were produced by Buchholz et al. (1997) by utilizing cycling mutagenesis in Escherichia coli [...] In their research, the authors transfected E. coli cells with two plasmids: one coding for randomly mutated FLP proteins downstream of an arabinose promoter and another containing a lacZ gene promoter within a FRT cassette. The <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> on arabinose plates at 37 °C and 40 °C, and if recombination occurred, the lacZ expression would be attenuated, and the colonies would appear white. White colonies were selected from each generation and grown on a new arabinose plates at same previous temperatures for eight generations. After recombination was confirmed by western-blotting and the mutated FLP genes were sequenced, this eighth generation FLP protein (FLPe) was transfected into mammalian cell culture, and recombination in mammalian cells was confirmed.

Methods and Results: Chicken slurry containing ca 1 : 99 ratio ciprofloxacin resistant : susceptible E. coli (10 different resistant strains examined) was treated for 24 h with each of the disinfectants and examined for survival of resistant : susceptible strains. Ciprofloxacin-sensitive (n = 5) and - resistant (n = 5) <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> with sublethal concentrations of the disinfectants and then plated to agar containing ciprofloxacin or overlaid with cyclohexane. Escherichia coli (n = 389) isolated from farms were tested for cyclohexane tolerance. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against representative isolates and mutants. The disinfectants did not select for the ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli in poultry slurry but following growth with each of the three disinfectants, higher numbers (Pless than or equal to 0 (.) 023) of cyclohexane-tolerant E. coli were isolated and these had a MAR phenotype. Of the 389 farm E. coli tested, only one was cyclohexane tolerant. Conclusions: It is possible that in a farm environment, E. coli could be exposed to similar concentrations of the disinfectants that are selected for MAR type organisms under these laboratory conditions.

The reduction of Pchlide involves a light-induced hydride transfer reaction from the pro-S face of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to the C' 7 position, coupled to the addition of a proton to the C' 8 position forming Chlide. The reaction catalysed by POR is a key step in chlorophyll biosynthesis and is essential in the development of chloroplasts. To achieve the maximum yield of Thermosynechococcus POR, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>were</b> <b>grown</b> at 37 degC to an optical density of 1. 7 before being induced with 0. 1 mM IPTG and grown for a further two hours at 25 degC. Purification of the over-expressed protein was done using a nickel affinity chromatography column followed by a cation exchange chromatography column. Purified protein could then be concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell concentrator to a maximum concentration of 0. 3 mM. The NMR conditions were optimised, and experiments conducted at 45 degC with a sample in sodium phosphate buffer pH 5. 5, containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and Roche complete protease provided the best quality HSQC spectrum, along with stabilising the protein for an indefinite period of time. Full deuteration of the protein did not yield the spectral improvements expected, and as a result the assignment spectra were acquired at 600 MHz using a l 3 C 15 N labelled sample. A partial assignment of POR identified that, compared {{to the rest of the}} protein, the 33 -residue loop insertion unique to POR is significantly more mobile and moves on a timescale similar to that associated with substrate binding and product release. Mutagenesis of the loop, whilst not affecting substrate binding, has profound effects on the enzyme activity, implicating the loop to be involved in some way with enzyme activity. Incubation of the enzyme with Pchlide and NADP+ results in the aggregation of the enzyme and the formation of a complex, which has been shown by EM and AUC to consist of approximately 10 units. This is analogous to the light harvesting Pchlide POR complex identified to exist in plants and proves that in vitro such complexes exist in other organisms other than monocotyledonous plants.

40|$|Pathogenic <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> have {{adhesive}} properties which are mirrored {{by an increase}} in their surface hydrophobicity. <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> isolated from patients with ulcerative colitis possess a mannose resistant adhesin similar to that found in pathogenic <b>E</b> <b>coli.</b> In this study 42 <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> isolates from patients with colitis have been compared with 15 from controls to assess hydrophobicity and cellular adherence. The salting out method and the buccal epithelial cell technique <b>were</b> used respectively. <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> isolated from colitics are significantly more hydrophobic than control <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> (p less than 0. 001). The salting out score correlates negatively with the buccal epithelial cell adhesion index. When <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> at 18 degrees C both properties are temporarily reduced suggesting that they are related to each other. The salting out method clearly differentiates between <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> isolated from colitics and controls, and offers a simple method of detecting adhesive <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> in inflammatory bowel disease...|$|R
40|$|Fumarate reductase of Escherichia <b>coli</b> has <b>been</b> {{shown to}} be a membrane-bound enzyme {{composed}} of a 69, 000 -dalton catalytic-flavin-containing subunit and a 27, 000 -dalton nonheme-iron-containing subunit. Using gene cloning and amplification techniques, we have observed two additional polypeptides encoded by the frd operon, with apparent molecular weights of 15, 000 and 14, 000, which <b>are</b> expressed when <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> anaerobically on glycerol plus fumarate. Expression of these two small polypeptides is necessary for the two large subunits to associate with the membrane. The four subunits remain associated in Triton X- 100 extracts of the membrane, and a holoenzyme form of fumarate reductase containing one copy of each of the four polypeptides has been isolated. Unlike the well-characterized two-subunit form, the holoenzyme is not dependent on anions for activity and is not labile at alkaline pH. In these respects, it more closely resembles the membrane-bound activity...|$|R
30|$|The β-tri(Asp)s {{with all}} {{possible}} combinations of l- and d-Asp units were designed, and the synthetic tri(Asp)s and di(Asp)s were purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories. All {{of the other}} chemicals used were of biochemical grade or the highest purity, and were used without further purification. Escherichia coli JM 109 (Takara) and BL 21 (DE 3) (Novagen) were used as the cloning and expression hosts, respectively. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> <b>was</b> <b>grown</b> in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth (1 % Bacto trypton, 0.5 % Bacto yeast extract, and 0.5 % NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 100  µg/mL ampicillin. pET- 15 b (Novagen) {{was used as the}} expression vector for His-tagged PahZ 1 KP- 2. All of the DNA-modifying enzymes for genetic engineering were purchased from Takara and Toyobo. The enzymes were used in accordance with the supplier’s instructions.
