The plateau lies south of the Adamawa Plateau and southeast of the Cameroon Range. It slopes south and west until giving way to the Cameroon coastal plain in the southwest and the Congo River basin in the southeast. The plateau is characterised by hills and valleys in the southwest and a more gentle peneplain in the southwest. Isolated massifs occur, especially in the southwest. Metamorphic rocks make up the plain's basement. The soils are <b>ferrallitic</b> and lateritic, with colouration ranging from red or brown in the interior to yellow on the coast. The soils are subjected to silica leeching, so they are not productive without fertiliser.|$|E
50|$|Ferrallitisation is {{the process}} in which rock is changed into a soil {{consisting}} of clay (kaolinite) and sesquioxides, {{in the form of}} hydrated oxides of iron and aluminium. In humid tropical areas, with consistently high temperatures and rainfall for all or most of the year, chemical weathering rapidly breaks down the rock. This at first produces clays which later also break down to form silica. The silica is removed by leaching and the sesquioxides of iron and aluminium remain, giving the characteristic red colour of many tropical soils. Ferrallitisation is the reverse of podsolisation, where silica remains and the iron and aluminum are removed. In tropical rain forests with rain throughout the year, <b>ferrallitic</b> soils develop. In savanna areas, with altering dry and wet climates, ferruginous soils occur.|$|E

The principles and the systems of soil classification commonly followed are dealt with. Particular relevance is given to the soil classification system specific for the inter tropical region. The <b>ferrallitic</b> environment of Angola is characterized taking into account both the data given in the Reports of the several issues of the Carta de Solos de Angola so far published, and the new data meanwhile obtained namely the pedoclimatic. A detailed discussion is made of the Oxi sols order and its relations with the <b>Ferrallitic</b> Soils considering that this is the "Soil Taxonomy" order which presents the most affinities to the latter. 130 profiles of <b>Ferrallitic</b> Soils from Angola were studied. They represent variable stages of <b>ferrallitic</b> weathering upon very different lithologic formations and under diverse bio climatic conditions. Special studies were carried out on these profiles leading to a more complete and convenient characterization in order to allow dealing with the problem of their correlation on a more secure basis with this in view, different particle-size analytical methods were tried on samples showing incomplete dispersion and the chosen method was applied to sample under such conditions.

40|$|The {{study of}} a toposequence on the {{northern}} side of Tenerife has revealed a close relationship between {{the distribution of the}} oldest soils and the different ecological zones (of climate and vegetation). This sequence is made up successively from top to bottom of : ferralitic soils in a perhumid zone, fersiallitic soils in a sub-tropical climatic zone with two very contrasting seasons, and vertisols in the lower zone of the slope with a semi-desertic climate. In {{the first part of the}} study the morphological, physical and chemical properties of the soils are presented. The <b>ferrallitic</b> soils are complex, often being rejuvenated by volcanic ashes which have formed either a superficial disatured andosol, or a brown andic soil, or both successively; certain characteristics allow them to be included with the <b>ferrallitic</b> soils or even with the Oxisols. The fersiallitic soils are red, moderately disatured, slightly leached and show a smail degree of rejuvenation of superficial extent; yhey are similar to tropical fersiallitic soils and sometimes to the Alfisols. The dark coloured vertisols are typical; they have an accumulation of calcium carbonate and a beginning of alkalinization in depth. The evolution of the different characteristics in the sequence is very marked. The second part of the study deals with the mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics. Here, the passage from <b>ferrallitic</b> soils with hallosyte and iron and aluminium oxy-hydroxides, for instance gibbsite, to a mixture of hallosyte and 2 :I clays (montmorillonite, I-V, illite), and hematite in the fersiallitic soils, to finish exclusively with ferrferous montmorillonite in the vertisols is shown. In the same direction, the content of aluminium, iron and readily soluble silica decreases rapidly. The micromorphology shows the following evolution : from a microporous weathering structure with gibbsitans in the <b>ferrallitic</b> soils, it passes to a clavery illuviation structure in some fersiallitic soils, and finally to a structure of stress-cutans with multiple orientations in the vertisols, and even a structure of saline accumulation with calcitanes. Posteriorly, a summary of the typological and pedogenetic characteristics for each type of soils is made, which leads on to their respective classification (French and American systems). Finally after having summarized the evolution of the characteristics of the soils in the sequence, the problem of the relationship betwee the pedogenesis of the aged soils and the actual climatic zonality, is briefly discussed.

40|$|Wettability of soil {{affects a}} wide variety of {{processes}} including infiltration, preferential flow and surface runoff. Wettability of surface is usually expressed in terms of contact angle (CA) measurement. If the CA between liquid and solid surface is less than 90 °, the surface is called hydrophilic, otherwise the surface is called hydrophobic. If the CA of water droplet on hydrophilic surface is in a range of 0 - 30 ° this surface is called superhydrophilic. In case of superhydrophobic surfaces the CA exceeds 150 ° that means that these surfaces are extremely difficult to wet. CA of wetting of mineral soil particles depends on the overlying organic and iron compounds. The object of study is a sample of the humus-accumulative horizon of typical chernozem (Kursk, Russia) and two samples (horizons A 1, B 2) of red <b>ferrallitic</b> soils (Fr. Norfolk, NE Oceania). The soil samples were analyzed for organic carbon, forms of non-silicate iron and hydrophobic-hydrophilic composition of humic substances. CA of wetting was determined in the intact samples and after removal of organic matter (H 2 O 2 treatment), amorphous and crystallized forms of iron. Static contact angles were determined with the sessile drop method using a digital goniometer (Drop Shape Analysis System, DSA 100, Krüss GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The contact angle was calculated by the Young–Laplace method (fitting of Young–Laplace equation to the drop shape). The measurements were repeated 10 - 15 times for every sample. Oxidation of organic matter (H 2 O 2 treatment) causes an increase in the values of CA of wetting (in chernozem from 9. 3 to 28, 0 - 29. 5 º, in <b>ferrallitic</b> soil from 18. 0 − 27. 3 to 22. 4 − 33. 4 º). CA remained constant for chernozem and slightly decreased in the case of <b>ferrallitic</b> soil, when the removal of amorphous and crystallized forms of iron was performed on samples pretreated with H 2 O 2. CA increase occurs after successive removal of nonsilicate forms of iron from soil samples of chernozem (9. 3 − 17, 9 − 29. 5 º) and <b>ferrallitic</b> soils (27. 3 − 30. 6 − 33, 4 and 18. 0 − 29. 0 − 29. 2 º). Relative hydrophobicity of the soil solid phase surface after treatment by Mehra and Jackson (1957) occurs in parallel to the carbon content reduction. Loss of carbon in the samples after the extraction of iron is related to the solubility of the hydrophilic components of humic substances. These results indicate that the main factor, which determines the wettability of soil solid phase, is the organic substance...|$|E

On Reunion, a volcanic tropical island in the Indian Ocean, we undertook a comprehensive overview of the old existing soil studies.

At elevations below 350 m asl (above sea level), without any new pedological information, we updated Brown ferruginous soils, Reddish-brown <b>ferrallitic</b> soils, and Fersialitic soils into Haplic Nitisols (Humic, Eutric). The acquisition of new data showed that this update was incorrect because not all the diagnostic criteria of the Nitic horizons were met. The correct diagnostic horizons were a Mollic horizon when the thickness was 25 cm or more, or a Cambic horizon. Leptic Phaeozems and Leptic Cambisols were then the correct Reference Soil Group (RSG). At elevations from 350 to 900 m asl, without any new information, Brown and Reddish-brown <b>ferrallitic</b> soils, Andic <b>ferrallitic</b> soils, and Brown and Andic brown soils were updated into Haplic Nitisols (Humic, Dystric) and Andic Umbrisols (Humic).

Over 900 m asl, Pozols were correctly updated, as were the Andosols except from 900 to 1050 m asl where not all the Andic properties were met. Without any new information, incorrect updates were observed for both the determination of RSG and the qualifiers. Despite the field descriptions, the lack of any analytical determinations on the old soil studies was a source of updating errors for the more developed soils formerly qualified as <b>ferrallitic.</b> In order to update limits for Andic properties and Andosols, the systematic use of analytical determinations has to be considered for updating old soil maps, as the diagnostic criteria are more restrictive than in the past.

Consequently the density of population {{in the mountains of}} Rwanda and Burundi has reached an exceptional level (150 to 800 inhabitants/km 2) that leads to delicate problems of soil protection against runoff and various types of erosion on steep cultivated hillslopes. Previous measurements on runoff plots have shown that sheet and rill erosion risks have reached 300 to 700 t/ha/year on 20 to 60 % slopes with regional rainfall erosivity (R(USA) = 250 to 700), very resistant <b>ferrallitic</b> soils (K= 0. 01 to 0. 20) and traditional farming systems (C= 0. 8 to 0. 3).

The problem is now to produce enough biomass to mulch the whole surface with the help of agroforestry. A new strategy (GCES = land husbandry) was suggested to meet the major farmer problems : what should be done to increase the soil productivity rapidly and protect the rural environment ? A part of the answer is to be found in the efficient management of water, organic matter and soil fertility restoration (Roose et al., 1988).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{distribution}} of Fe 3 +-kaolinite, Al-goethite and Al-hematite and their contents of Fe and AI in bauxites and ferricretes {{are controlled by}} water activity, dissolved silica activity, temperature and particle size. The proposed model, based on ideal solid-solution equilibria in the Fe 203 -AlzO 3 -SiOz-H 20 system, takes into account water and silica activities. By using the same considerations as those previously developed for the Fe 203 -AIzO 3 -H 20 system, the model calculates the amounts of coexisting phases, A 1 or Fe substitution ratios in goethite, hematite or kaolinite, and the stability field distributions of the minerals under various conditions. Thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and element distributions within the mineral constituents are shown to be dependent onthe parameters cited above. The model yields results compatible with natural observations on lateritic profiles. Laterites include bauxites, ferricretes, mottle clays, lithomarges and saprolites, and are formed in humid tropical weathering conditions. In most lateritic profiles, kaolinite, goethites, hematites and quartz are the dominant minerals (McFarlane, 1976, 1983; Nahon, 1976; Leprun, 1979; Muller et al., 1981) while gibbsite and boehmite are also present in bauxites, latosols, oxisols and several kinds of <b>ferrallitic</b> soils (Loughnan & Bayliss, 1961...|$|E

40|$|Organic matter {{management}} in the Tropical soils. Organic matter is the key of fertilization in tropical conditions and is {{closely associated with the}} cultural systems by/te dominant kinds of transfer : internal or external, vertical or horizontal. Although very complex by nature, organic material in the soils can be reduced to few transformation stages, accelerated in humid tropics compared with temperated environment, more particularly the mineralization of humus. Among the problems inherent to tropical <b>ferrallitic</b> soils, low cation adsorption capacity of the clay and low phosphorus availability to plant associated to high exchangeable and toxic aluminium content in strong acidity conditions constitute their main fertility constraints. So that reducing of exchangeable aluminium is the basis of the fertilizer effect of organic matter that can be compared with liming. This reducing is related to the formation of aluminium complexes with short chain di- and tri-carboxylic acids, characteristics of the freshly decomposed material rather than the humus. These data seem support the idea of the advantage of incorporating organic matter in soil before the humification in warm-humid tropics, according to many traditional cultural practices.

Another class of soils (“fersiallitic” soils, typified by rubefaction and significant occurrence of 2 / 1 clays) is principally developed on a lower topographic level (300 - 400 m a. s. l.) connected to the low “Sertaneja” surface shaped into the crystalline basement. If lithology appears as a discriminating factor to explain some aspects of the laterite and soil distribution (between sedimentary cover and crystalline rocks), it is insufficient to explain the differences observed within the crystalline basement in a region of homogenous semi-arid climate. So it is necessary to develop a model that accounts adequately for these observations. This can be achieved by considering a morphotectonic model that combines the effects of tectonics, erosion and climatic change. The uplift history, which also controls patterns and rates of regolith stripping, seems to be a key to understanding the regional geography of weathering and soils in a context of increased aridity during the Cenozoic...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{previous}} studies investigating the use of soil and forage chemistry as indicators of cattle mineral status have been somewhat equivocal, possibly due to the limited range of trace element concentrations in the areas investigated. This paper describes {{an investigation of the}} relationship between trace element concentrations in stream sediments, soils, forage (grass and leaves) and cattle blood (serum) in northeast Zimbabwe in order to identify which, if any, of the sample media provide a reliable guide to cattle mineral status. Soil, forage and cattle serum were collected from an area characterized by a wide range of Zn in stream sediments. The area was subdivided into three regions of relatively low, medium and high Zn concentration on the basis of stream sediment data and variations in the chemistry of cattle serum, forage, soil and stream sediment samples were examined. Significant correlations exist between element concentrations in stream sediments, soils and forage but there are no significant correlations with cattle serum. Although this lack of direct correlation may, in part, be due to a range of biological factors, it is suggested that high concentrations of Fe in soil and forage inhibit (i) the availability of P to plants and (ii) the absorption of Cu and Zn in cattle. This may have wide ranging implications due to the predominance of <b>ferrallitic</b> soils in many countries in tropical regions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the studies in non-nickeliferous weathering crusts initiated more than six decades ago in Eastern Cuba. This overview is based on a detailed literature review and a descriptive-critical discussion on these studies with the main objective of highlighting their achievements and failures. These investigations were motivated by the existence of large mineral deposits associated with different types of weathering crusts in this region and were mainly focused on finding bauxites. However, prospects could not be delineated because the alumina contents in these geological objects were below those required to classify them as bauxites. This limited the evaluation of the possibilities of assimilating these crusts in such industries as the ceramic, construction and refractory, among others, which can contribute significantly to the sustainable local development. Generally, in all these investigations there is an absence of solid mineralogical and geochemical criteria for the characterization and classification of different aluminium-rich weathering crusts. The SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 - Fe 2 O 3 contents in the region show that most of the weathering crusts as ferrosialitic. There are possibilities of finding sialitic, <b>ferrallitic</b> and allitic types in Cayo Guam, Centeno, Quesigua, Puriales de Caujeri, Quemado del Negro and Cantarrana. In overview, the level of study of the non-nickeliferous weathering crusts widely developed on gabbros, volcanic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks in Eastern Cuba is relatively low. Further investigations including detailed profile sampling, chemical and mineralogical analyses in TÃ©neme, Centeno, Cayo Guam, Quemado del Negro and Cantarrana are proposed which, in our opinion, are perspectives for allitic deposits...|$|E
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of kaolinite, montmorillonite, ferralitic {{soil of the}} humid subtropics (Norfolk island, southwest of Oceania), alluvial clay soil of arid subtropics (Konya province, Turkey) and carbonate loess loam of Russian forest-steppe zone were determined. A parallel plate rheometer MCR- 302 (Anton Paar, Austria) was used in order to conduct amplitude sweep test. Rheological properties allow to assess quantitatively structural bonds and estimate structural resistance to a mechanical impact. Measurements were carried out on samples previously pounded and capillary humidified during 24 hours. In the amplitude sweep method an analyzed sample was placed between two plates. The upper plate makes oscillating motions with gradually extending amplitude. Software of the device allows to receive several rheological parameters such as elastic modulus (G’, Pa), viscosity modulus (G", Pa), linear viscoelasticity range (G’>>G”), and point of destruction of structure at which the elastic modulus becomes equal to the viscosity modulus (G’=G”- crossover). It was found {{out that in the}} elastic behavior at G '>> G " strength of structural links of kaolinite, alluvial clay soil and loess loam constituted one order of 105 Pa. Montmorillonit had a minimum strength- 104 Pa and <b>ferrallitic</b> soil of Norfolk island [has]- a maximum one- 106 Pa. At the same time montmorillonite and ferralitic soil were characterized by the greatest plasticity. Destruction of their structure (G ' = G") took place only in the cases when strain was reaching 11 - 12 %. Destraction of the kaolinite structure happened at 5 % of deformation and of the alluvial clay soil and loess loam- at 4. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the nature and}} distribution of the sandveldt soils of the Central Province of Zambia. It {{is based on the}} results of detailed, semi-detailed and reconnaissance soil surveys carried out in the Province between 1972 and 1974. Sandveldt soils are light textured, developed over felsic and intermediate rocks and support Brachystegia-Julbernardia-Isoberlinia (Miombo) woodland. They are characteristically yellowish brown where well drained, structure less, and have low C. E. C. Base saturation is very variable and soil reaction is in the range strong to slightly acid. Regoliths are deeply weathered and relatively few weather- able minerals remain in most profiles. Sandveldt soils are Weathered <b>Ferrallitic</b> Soils of generally low agricultural potential. They are estimated to cover 505, 000 ha, 41 % of Central Province. The thesis is divided into five parts :- Part One explains the background leading to the requirement for soil survey work, {{describes the}} survey programme under-taken and methods employed, and reviews the previous work done in the area. Part Two describes in detail the climate, geology, geomorphology and vegetation of the area and explains their pedological significance. Part Three gives an account of the general features of sandveldt soils and their pattern of distribution. Six soil series comprised in a widespread catena are described in detail. A number of associated soils and landtypes are also described. The modal characteristics, genesis and classification of the various soils are discussed. The results of infiltration studies and physical investigations are described. Part Four is an agricultural evaluation of sandveldt soils and includes assessments of land use capability, management and productively, and crop suitability. Part Five comprises conclusions and summary recommendations...|$|E

Soil samples were analyzed in terms of denitrifier density (quantitative PCR of narG/napA/nirK/nirS/nosZ genes), potential activity (nitrate reductase activity, Denitrification Enzyme Assay ±C 2 H 2, DEA). The denitrifier activities (nitrate reductase and DEA±C 2 H 2) were significantly increased by direct seeding in both years, whereas fertilization modalities and crop rotation had no impact at all. No significant reduction of N 2 O (DEA without C 2 H 2) was noticed. A general trend in 2005 and 2006 indicated that all gene densities (narG/nirK/nirS/nosZ genes) were significantly increased in plots under direct seeding except for plots with high fertilization levels.

Overall, crop and mulch types as well as fertilization intensity appear to have far less impacted densities and activities of denitrifiers than direct seeding.

40|$|The use of compostested {{municipal}} refuse on {{agricultural land}} requires {{prior knowledge of}} the interactions among compost, soil, and plants. Research into the availability of N in highly matured municipal refuse compost is particularly important considering the current concern about groundwater contamination by NO$- N. A greehouse pot bioassay was conducted to determine the percentage of short-term apparent bioavailable N of a highly matured refuse compost and its relative efficiency in supplying inorganic N to the soil-plant system in comparison with NH$NO$. Municipal refuse (after 165 days of composting) was applied at rates equivalent to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 t ha ' to a <b>ferrallitic</b> soil from Tenerife Island (Andeptic Paludult). NH$NO$ was applied at rates equivalent to the total N content of the compost treatments. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was grown in 3 -kg pots and the tops were harvested at regular intervals after seedling emergence. The compost increased dry matter yield, soil mineral N, and plant N uptake proportional to the applied rate. These increases {{were significantly higher than}} the control at an application rate of 20 t ha '. After 6 months the apparent bioavailable N ranged from 16 to 21 %. The relative efficiency was 43 % after 30 days. This suggets that large inputs of inorganic N into soil can be obtained with high rates of this kind of compost, with a potential for NO$-N contamination. However, applied at moderate rates in our bioassay (< 50 t ha'), compost showed a low N-supplying capacity to ryegrass, i. e. {{a small fraction of the}} mineralized compost N was used by plants in the course of time. This was ascribed to a partial biological innobilization. This pattern of N availability in highly matured municipal refuse compost, positive net mineralization but partial immobilization, is similar to the pattern of N availability in biologically active soils and is therefore extremely interesting for the conservation of N in agro-ecosystems.
