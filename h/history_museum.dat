40|$|Photographic collections, {{which form}} an {{important}} part of collections in <b>history</b> <b>museums,</b> are a precious resource for exhibition and research, and of great interest to the general public. <b>History</b> <b>museums,</b> however, face unprecedented challenges today in caring for these and other collections, in light of changing audiences, the high cost of collections care, and fiscal constraints introduced by a difficult economy. In this thesis, the use of photographic collections as a source of revenue for fundraising purposes in <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> is examined. A review of literature concerning photographic collections in <b>history</b> <b>museums,</b> basic principles of fundraising and development, and the difficulties that <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> face in today???s economic climate was conducted. The rationale for and the results of a national survey of accredited <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> with photographic collections were then outlined. Results of the survey showed that there are problems in photographic collections care in <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> due to a distinct lack of staff time and budget constraints, which are all directly affected by funding issues, as well as a lack of utilizing the photographic collection for creative fundraising methods. In the end, this thesis concluded that all <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> can easily develop practical methods for utilizing their photographic collections that have the potential to provide additional financial support for their care...|$|R

50|$|A {{major concern}} at living <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> {{is the idea}} of {{authenticity}}. Living historians define authenticity as perfect simulation between a living history activity and the piece of the past it is meant to re-create. A major difference between living <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> and other historical interpretation is that at living history sites, the interpretation is usually given in the first-person present, versus the third-person past narratives given at other sites. Living <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> seek to convey to visitors the experience of {{what it felt like to}} live in the past. Critics of living <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> argue that replication of past states of mind is impossible, and therefore living history is inherently inaccurate.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> have {{increasingly}} included items of contemporary history in their collections and exhibits. However, {{issues such as}} the subjective definition of the word ???contemporary??? and varied opinions on how long a museum should wait before exhibiting such items, have kept a definitive set of best practices from being developed. In this thesis, the issue of contemporary collecting in <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> is examined. After a review of relevant literature, three <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> involved in contemporary collecting are analyzed. Common concerns and practices are highlighted, finding the existence of an informal 10 -year rule between collecting a popular object and displaying it, and that museums involved in contemporary collecting do not possess collections plans that address how to go about acquiring recent items. Several recommendations are made in order to make contemporary collecting and exhibiting a more common, respected, and formal practice in <b>history</b> <b>museums...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} remain {{relevant}} in today's society, museums are increasingly utilizing the Internet by creating online collections databases. However, the museum field has not reached {{a consensus on}} how these databases should be built. <b>History</b> <b>museums</b> often face the greatest challenge in creating online databases because of {{the wide variety of}} their holdings, minimal budgets, and small staff. This thesis analyzes the methods by which collections managers at <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> are creating and maintaining online collections databases. A review of the published literature is conducted, followed by three case studies of <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> in Northern California, including interviews with collections managers. A practical resource for <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> that are creating or updating their online databases is then presented. This study concludes that the field is still far from reaching a consensus on building online databases, but now a strong support community exists, providing knowledge and expertise for database creators...|$|R
