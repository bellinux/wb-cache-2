Though his numbers were not quite as <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E

At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E

25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many {{began to wonder}} if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right.

Their best-known monument is the Amiriya Madrasa in Rada' District, which was built in 1504.

He worked mostly in stone, using limestone, fieldstone, and boulders he found throughout Northern Michigan. The homes are {{commonly referred to as}} gnome homes, mushroom houses, or Hobbit houses. His door, window, roof and fireplace designs were very distinct because of his use of curved lines. Young's goal was to show that a small stone house could be as <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> a castle. Young also helped make Charlevoix the busy, summer resort town that it is today.|$|E
