30|$|Configuration of <b>event</b> {{reputation}} threshold <b>and</b> <b>event</b> {{confidence threshold}} in an ERS {{are dependent on}} the sensor capability of a vehicle and the type characteristics of a traffic event. In general, there are some design criteria and guidelines to help vehicle manufacturers or drivers determine these two thresholds. For example, when instant notification of event occurrence {{is more important than}} <b>event</b> reliability <b>and</b> <b>event</b> continuity in situations such as emergency braking <b>event</b> <b>and</b> speed decrease <b>event,</b> both thresholds should be set to a lower value. On the contrary, if <b>event</b> reliability <b>and</b> <b>event</b> continuity are more important than instant notification of event occurrence in situations such as vehicle accident <b>event</b> <b>and</b> traffic jam <b>event,</b> both thresholds should be set to a higher value. Therefore, we suggest that different pairs of <b>event</b> reputation threshold <b>and</b> <b>event</b> confidence threshold should be preconfigured in an ERS based on various <b>event</b> types <b>and</b> sensor capability of vehicle.|$|R
