The species is sometimes seen in primary rainforest, although at a curiously low density {{compared with that of}} other monkey species. We conducted a 24 -month field study in the tropical rainforest of Taı ̈ National Park, Ivory Coast, and found that putty-nosed monkeys require an ecological niche almost identical to that of the <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Cercopithecus <b>diana</b> diana. Moreover, the niche breadth of putty-nosed monkeys was significantly decreased in the presence of <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys,</b> suggesting that feeding competition with <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> kept putty-nosed monkeys from successfully colonizing a rainforest habitat. However, contrary to the interspecies competition hypothesis, groups of both species almost completely overlapped in home ranges and formed near-permanent mixed-species associations, rather than avoiding each other.

40|$|According to most accounts, alarm {{calling in}} {{non-human}} primates is a biologically hardwired behaviour with signallers having {{little control over}} the acoustic structure of their calls. In this study, we compared the alarm calling behaviour of two adjacent populations of <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> at Taï forest (Ivory Coast) and Tiwai Island (Sierra Leone), which differ significantly in predation pressure. At Taï, monkeys regularly interact with two major predators, crowned eagles and leopards, while at Tiwai, monkeys are only hunted by crowned eagles. We monitored the alarm call responses of adult male <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> to acoustic predator models. We found no site-specific differences {{in the types of}} calls given to eagles, leopards and general disturbances, but there were consistent differences in how callers assembled calls into sequences. At Tiwai, males responded to leopards and general disturbances in the same way, while at Taï, males discriminated by giving call sequences that differed in the number of component calls. Responses to eagles were identical at both sites. We concluded that <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> are predisposed to use their repertoire in context-specific ways, but that ontogenetic experience determines how individual calls are assembled into meaningful sequences...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that most primates live in monospecific or polyspecific groups because group living provides protection against predation, but hard evidence is scarce.

Red colobus, but not <b>diana</b> <b>monkeys,</b> are frequently killed by cooperatively hunting chimpanzees. Association rates peaked during the chimpanzees' hunting season, {{as a result}} of changes in the behaviour of the red colobus.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} behavioural features of many forest primates are the loud calls given by the adult males. Early observational studies repeatedly postulated that these calls function in intragroup spacing or intergroup avoidance. More recent field experiments with <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Cercopithecus <b>diana)</b> of Ta Forest, Ivory Coast, have clearly shown that loud male calls function as predator alarm calls because calls reliably (1) label different predator classes and (2) convey semantic information about the predator type present. Here, I test the alarm call hypothesis another primate, the Campbell’s monkey (C. campbelli). Like <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys,</b> male Campbell’s monkeys produce conspicuous loud calls to crowned hawk eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus), two of their main predators. Playback experiments showed that monkeys responded to the predator category represented by the different playback stimuli, regardless of whether they consisted of (1) vocalisations of the actual predators (crowned hawk eagle shrieks or leopard growls), (2) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by other male Campbell’s monkeys or (3) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by sympatric male <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys.</b> These experiments provide further evidence that non-human primates have evolved the cognitive capacity to produce and respond to referential labels for external events...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{semantic}} communication {{has received}} considerable {{theoretical and empirical}} attention because of its relevance to human language. Advances {{have been made by}} studies of alarm- call behaviour in nonhumans. In monkeys, for example, there is evidence that recipients have a fairly sophisticated understanding of a call’s meaning; that is, the predator type usually associated with a certain alarm call. Little is known, however, about the mental mechanisms that drive call production in nonhuman primates. In some nonprimate species, it has been found that signallers do not respond to a predator’s physical features but instead seem to respond to its relative threat or direction of attack. In these species, therefore, alarm calls do not denote different predator categories but simply reflect different types or levels of danger. Because different predator categories typically impose different types and degrees of threat it is entirely possible that nonhuman primates also respond to threat rather than a predator’s category. This study examined how wild <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Cercopithecus <b>diana,</b> of the Taï forest, Ivory Coast, label predation events. By altering playback stimuli and the position of a concealed speaker, I investigated whether <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> respond with acoustically different alarm calls depending on a predator’s (1) distance (close versus far), (2) elevation (above versus below), or (3) category (eagle versus leopard). Analysis of male and female alarm-call behaviour showed that <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> consistently responded to predator category regardless of immediate threat or direction of attack.

Male <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> produce loud and acoustically distinct alarm calls to leopards and eagles that propagate over long distances, much beyond the immediate group. Calling is often contagious, with neighbouring males responding to each other’s calls, indicating that harem males communicate both to local group members and distant competitors. Here, we tested whether male <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> responding to each other’s alarm calls discriminated familiar from unfamiliar callers in two populations in Taï Forest (Ivory Coast) and on Tiwai Island (Sierra Leone). At both sites, we found specific acoustic markers in male alarm call responses that discriminated familiar from unfamiliar callers, but response patterns were site-specific. On Tiwai Island, males responded to familiar males’ eagle alarms with ‘standard’ eagle alarm calls, whereas unfamiliar males triggered acoustically atypical eagle alarms. The opposite was found in Taï Forest where males responded to unfamiliar males’ eagle alarm calls with ‘standard’ eagle alarms, and with atypical eagle alarms to familiar males’ calls. Moreover, only Taï, but not Tiwai, males also marked familiarity with the caller in their leopard-induced alarms. We concluded that male <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> encode not only predator type but also signaller familiarity in their alarm calls, although in population-specific ways. We explain these inter-site differences in vocal behaviour in terms of differences in predation pressure and population density.

40|$|Some animal vocalizations {{have been}} {{described}} as referential, or semantic, because individuals respond to them as if these calls designate some external object or event. <b>Diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Cercopithecus <b>diana)</b> of Tai forest, Cote d 2 ̆ 7 Ivoire, possess acoustically different alarm calls for different categories of predators and respond to these calls as if the corresponding predator were present. Little is known, however, about the mental mechanisms and evolutionary function of such apparently semantic alarm calls. Data are generally consistent with a more parsimonious explanation which views semantic signals as an epi-phenomenon because callers could simply respond to the relative threat of a predator, as opposed to its biological category, while recipients could respond to the acoustic features of an alarm call, as opposed to its meaning. Field playback experiments on wild groups of <b>diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> were conducted to investigate the proximate mechanisms that drive the behavior of both callers and call recipients. Results show that as callers <b>diana</b> <b>monkeys</b> do not respond to relative threat but consistently label the categorical features of a predator while as recipients they do not directly respond to a call 2 ̆ 7 s acoustic features but attend to its associated meaning. Results are discussed with respect to their relevance to human language. In terms of their evolutionary function, it is unclear whether semantic signals have evolved to warn conspecific group members about the presence of predators or whether these calls primarily function to decrease the hunting success of the attacking predator. Field playback experiments on five other monkey species together with the behavior of a radio-tracked wild leopard suggest that predator deterrence has been a powerful factor in the evolution of alarm call behavior in nonhuman primates, suggesting that semanticity could be an incidental outcome of this evolutionary process. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCompared to humans, {{non-human}} primates {{have very}} little control over their vocal production.
