The results of continuum elastic theory agree well with numerical simulations on finite lattices even for relatively small systems. Isolated dislocations on a cylinder act like grain boundaries. With colloidal crystals in mind, we show that saddle points are created by a Peach-Koehler force on the dislocations in the circumferential direction, causing dislocation pairs to unbind. The thermal nucleation rate of dislocation unbinding is calculated, for an arbitrary mobility tensor and <b>external</b> <b>stress,</b> including {{the case of a}} twist-induced Peach-Koehler force along the cylinder axis.

The energy function {{is derived from the}} Gibbs potential in terms of the <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> and internal <b>energy.</b> The resulting Gibbs distribution, over a configuration space of microscopic interactions, can mimic experimentally observed macroscopic behavioral phenomena that depend on the externally applied stress. A simulation algorithm {{that can be used to}} approximate samples from the Gibbs distribution is given and it is used to gain several insights about the model. The model has two parameters for the internal energy of the material in the absence of <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> and a third parameter for a constant externally applied stress. An approximating differential equation for the expected proportion of the material in the solid phase is derived by a spatio-temporal rescaling of the toroidal square lattice upon which the Gibbs random field model is defined. The asymptotic dynamics of this tri-parametric family of differential equation matches with those of the rescaled simulations from the Gibbs field model and can account for the macroscopic behaviors, including solid-fluid phase transitions in the presence of constant as well as varying <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> and the associated hysteresis...|$|R

Theoretical arguments suggest the need to examine the impact stress originating outside the relationship (<b>external</b> <b>stress)</b> can have on relational well-being. <b>External</b> <b>stress</b> can spillover into the relationship causing internal stress, making stress a dyadic versus individualistic phenomenon. Using data from 131 couples, we examined whether internal stress may mediate the association between <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> and relationship satisfaction and how dyadic coping may moderate this relationship within one year. Dyadic coping was found to decrease the impact of chronic <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> on chronic internal stress, particularly in women. Women who reported higher dyadic coping skills had a higher relationship satisfaction which influenced also their partner’s relationship satisfaction positively.

40|$|Since {{crystals}} {{are made}} of periodic structures in space, determining their three independent period vectors in theory (starting from any values) is a basic physics problem. For the general situation where crystals are under constant <b>external</b> <b>stress,</b> we derived dynamical equations of the period vectors {{in the framework of}} Newtonian dynamics, for pair potentials recently (doi:/ 10. 1139 /cjp- 2014 - 0518).

40|$|I conduct two {{experiments}} {{to examine the}} effects of different types of stress on individuals' willingness to cooperate. The experience of stress is characterized by the primary cognitive appraisal of threat. It activates the emotion of anxiety and induces stress coping behaviors. I posit that because different types of stress differ in terms of the secondary dimension of cognitive appraisal, the responsibility of possible failure, they lead to different stress coping behaviors in collaborative contexts. Based on the attribution of threat, I classify stress into two types, ego and <b>external</b> <b>stress.</b> Under ego stress, the possible failure is attributed to one's capabilities. Ego stressors, such as lack of skill, cause individuals to worry about their capabilities, posing a threat to goal achievement. I argue that ego stress motivates an individual to seek affiliations for joint protection. I provide experimental evidence that ego stress increases cooperation. Under <b>external</b> <b>stress,</b> on the other hand, the possible failure is attributed to factors in the environment.

30|$|We {{investigated}} interval modulation of SSEs by {{two types}} of earthquake loading: effects of nucleation and <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> perturbation. We confirmed that SSE recurrence intervals tend to be shorter owing to a nucleation process of a nearby large earthquake, based on the numerical modeling with the frictional system. The decreasing rate of the SSE intervals depends on magnitude of the elastic interaction. One important point is {{the distance between the}} SSE and earthquake areas. When the distance between the SSE and earthquake areas is nearly zero with the same size of the SSE and earthquake areas, the short-term further decrease in the SSE recurrence intervals occurs just before the earthquake occurrence. Only the short-term decrease can be as significant as the fluctuation of the SSE recurrence intervals by <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> perturbation. The effect of the <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> perturbation on the SSE recurrence intervals continues until the occurrence of the adjacent earthquake.|$|R

40|$|Much {{research}} and many field trials {{have shown that}} the permeability of coal seams varies inversely with the effective stress acting on coal. It was later theorized by Gray (1992) that desorption-induced matrix shrinkage may counter-act the effect of <b>external</b> <b>stresses,</b> allowing permeability to increase, depending on the relative strength of the two phenomenon. This paper explores the geomechanical theory of reservoir stiffness and the arch-bridging effect, and uses operating coal mine evidence, to support the development of the important principle of a “constant volume” boundary condition applying to most deep CBM reservoirs, as opposed to a constant <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> condition. This principle allows for an initial <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> state to exist in a coal seam, and shows how the acting stress state is dynamic and generally trends lower with matrix shrinkage, allowing permeability to increase as depletion of the CBM reservoir proceeds. Laboratory data on measured permeability under both constant <b>external</b> <b>stress</b> conditions and constant volume conditions shows the importance of this principle; permeability increases of between 100 % and 1200 % can be experienced, depending on the stage of depletion and thus desorption. Field performance from producing CBM reservoirs will be referenced to confirm the reality and significance of permeability enhancement due to matrix shrinkage in the context of constant volume behaving deep CBM reservoirs...|$|R
