50|$|There {{are certain}} aspects of tasks that induce greater <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> persistence: a performer's {{interest}} in the task {{and the level of}} difficulty of the task.

40|$|The {{influences}} of course <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> outside (family, job, social) activities on grades earned {{in a college}} course were examined for 230 urban college students. Multiple measurements of hours of work, social and family activities, <b>and</b> course <b>effort</b> were collected over a semester. Path modeling revealed that cumulative GPA <b>and</b> course <b>effort</b> had significant <b>and</b> independent predictive paths with grades. Outside activities did not directly influence course grade. Job activities, however, negatively influenced course grade indirectly through reduced course <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> mediated the influence GPA exerted on course grade.

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{takes issue with}} the {{recurrent}} reliance on job satisfaction to explain job-related <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> performance.   The disappointing findings in this tradition are explained by lack of compatibility between job satisfaction–-a very broad attitude–-and the more specific <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> performance criteria.   Moreover, attempts to apply the expectancy-value model of attitude to explore the determinants of <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> performance suffer from reliance on unrepresentative sets of beliefs about the likely consequences of these behaviors.   The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991, 2012), {{with its emphasis on}} the proximal antecedents of job <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> performance, is offered as an alternative.   According to the theory, intentions to exert <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> to attain a certain performance level are determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of control in relation to these behaviors; and these variables, in turn, are a function of readily accessible beliefs about the likely outcomes of <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> performance, about the normative expectations of important others, and about factors that facilitate or hinder effective performance...|$|R

Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E

40|$|How do {{children}} consider helpfulness, specifically <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> utility, {{when evaluating}} potential informants? We tested preschoolers on three conditions, {{asking them to}} choose between a character high in both <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> utility and a character who acted with either 1) low <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> high utility, 2) high <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> low utility, or 3) low <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> no utility (removed from social contexts). The opposing characters provided conflicting information when labeling novel objects, and participants were asked which label they endorsed. They {{were then asked to}} choose which character was the more helpful, which worked harder, and which was nicer. We found trends toward endorsing words from the helpful over no social context character. Participants chose the helpful character as more helpful and hardworking compared to the low utility character, and as working harder compared to the no social context character. These trends indicate that children focus on utility and social contribution over effort when evaluating the helpfulness of a potential informant...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationships among four distinct types of social goals, <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> disruptive behavior in urban physical education. Social responsibility, affiliation, recognition, status goals, along with <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> disruptive behavior in physical education were reported by high school physical education students (N = 314) from three urban schools. Findings from correlation and structural equa- tion modeling analyses revealed that social responsibility goals had a positive relationship with <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> an inverse relationship with disruptive behavior. Social status goals demonstrated a positive relationship with disruptive behavior and no relationship with effort. Social recognition goal results were mixed, as they had positive relationships to both <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> disruptive behavior while social affiliation goals were unrelated to effort or disruptive behavior. Application of these results suggests that physical educators {{who are able to}} identify the diverse social motives that underlie students’ goals can maximize learning opportunities by increasing student <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> minimizing disruptive behavior...|$|R

The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million alone for police, fire and medical services.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that sexual aggressors of women are {{characterized}} by early- and late-onset antisocial trajectories. However, these studies have not examined the role of mating <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> its role on sexual offending in adulthood. This study examined differences {{in the level of}} mating <b>effort</b> of early- <b>and</b> late-onset offenders and the association between mating <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> sexual offending in adulthood. Factor analysis identified two latent constructs of sexuality: mating <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> high sexual drive. Early-onset offenders exhibited significantly higher levels of mating <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> sexual drive. Furthermore, high mating <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> high sexual drive were more strongly associated with an earlier onset and a higher frequency of sexual crimes in adulthood than group membership. This study provided empirical evidence that a developmental taxonomy of early and late onset distinguishes the sexual activity and sexual criminal activity of adult sexual aggressors. The findings are discussed in light of a developmental taxonomy of sexual aggressors of women. Arts, Education & Law Group, Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and GovernanceFull Tex...|$|R

While <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> exertion are slightly different constructs, these terms are often used interchangeably within the literature. The development of perceptions of both <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> exertion is a complicated process involving numerous neural processes occurring in various regions within the brain. It is widely accepted that perceptions of effort are highly dependent on efferent copies of central drive which are sent from motor to sensory regions of the brain. Additionally, {{it has been suggested}} that perceptions of <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> exertion are integrated based on the balance between corollary discharge and actual afferent feedback; however, the involvement of peripheral afferent sensory feedback in the development of such perceptions has been debated.
