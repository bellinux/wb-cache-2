Readers of O'Neil's awards website, The Envelope, included Pompeo in their 2009 nominations for Best Drama Actress in the site's Gold Derby TV Awards. Entertainment Weekly launched the EWwy Awards in 2008, to honor actors who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> Emmy nominations. Pompeo was nominated in the Best Actress in a Drama Series category, and placed fourth, with 19percent of readers' votes.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|And Still I Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1978. It was published {{during one of}} the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written three autobiographies and published two other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> serious critical attention.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E

25|$|A list of {{some notable}} reports of Marian apparitions that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> a {{documented}} church approval, but have also not been explicitly disapproved, is provided below. Apparitions {{discussed in this}} section <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> an official approval from either the Roman Catholic Church or the Coptic Orthodox Church, or in a few cases, received an approval from a local authority that was later called into question. In some cases, a bishop has authorized or the church has otherwise permitted devotions based on a reported apparition, without issuing any statement approving the apparition itself as being of supernatural origin. This list is selective {{in view of the}} large numbers of individuals who have reported alleged past and present Marian apparitions.|$|E

25|$|Newer {{proposals}} for quality models such as Squale and Quamoco propagate a direct {{integration of the}} definition of quality attributes and measurement. By breaking down quality attributes or even defining additional layers, the complex, abstract quality attributes (such as reliability or maintainability) become more manageable and measurable. Those quality models have been applied in industrial contexts but <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> widespread adoption.|$|E
25|$|Cole also censures the George W. Bush {{administration}} for not pushing for democratization in Pakistan. Such a development would not threaten U.S. interests, he writes, since whenever elections have been held, Taliban-like movements <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> much support from voters. On the contrary, {{the danger is}} that U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis. Cole is also on the Editorial Board of Pakistaniaat.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the rainy}} season, Salcedo did not land in Leyte, {{which was the}} usual landing place. Instead, he was brought up North, to Cape Engaño. He reached Manila in September 1663. In a letter written by Salcedo to his friend Francisco Yzquierdo in 1664, Salcedo {{mentioned}} {{the situation of the}} Philippines. In the letter, Salcedo stated that the treasury only had 35,000 pesos.

25|$|Following the accident, the MMA {{temporarily}} ceased {{operations on}} its lines between Lac-Mégantic and Jackman, Maine, effectively severing rail transport on its lines between Maine and Quebec, though rail traffic continued outside the affected area. In Quebec, MMA continued operation from Farnham with a skeleton staff after the derailment, having laid off 19 of its 75 workers without notice on July 19 {{and an additional}} five on July 30; these workers <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> severance and vacation pay owed.

See the Third party tools section below for a third-party software utility that provides comprehensive support for MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux.

25|$|Misdeal: A misdeal is a deal {{in which}} all players <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> {{the same number of}} cards or a player has dealt out of turn. A misdeal may be {{discovered}} immediately by counting the cards after they are dealt, or it may be discovered during play of a hand. If a single card is misdealt and discovered before players in question have seen their cards the player that is short a card can pull a card at random from the player with an extra card. Otherwise a hand is misdealt, the hand is considered void and the hand must be redealt by the same dealer (unless the reason for the redeal is the hand was dealt out of turn).|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the Obama {{administration}} {{announced its}} intention to re-establish relations with Cuba. In January 2015, the Administration lightened restrictions on U.S. citizen travel to Cuba. While restrictions on travel for missionary work and education have been loosened, visits for tourism remain banned. President Obama and President Raúl Castro of Cuba met on April 11, 2015, {{which was the first}} meeting between distinct leaders of the two countries in over fifty years. In May 2015, several American companies reported they had been granted licenses to establish ferry travel between Florida and Cuba, with a U.S. Department of Treasury spokeswoman confirming they had begun issuing licenses. So far the general ban on travel to Cuba remains in effect for Americans, so the ferry service will not be accessible to Americans who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> special approval for travel to Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Outbreaks of canine {{distemper}} continue to occur throughout the United States and elsewhere, and {{are caused by}} many factors. These factors include the overpopulation of dogs and the irresponsibility of pet owners. The overpopulation of dogs is a national problem that {{organizations such as the}} Humane Society and ASPCA face every day. This problem is even greater within areas such as Arizona, owing to the vast amount of rural land. An unaccountable number of strays that lack vaccinations reside in these areas and are therefore more susceptible to diseases such as {{canine distemper}}. These strays act as a host for the virus, spreading it throughout the surrounding area, including urban areas. Puppies and dogs that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> their shots can then be infected if in a place where many dogs interact, such as a dog park.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines on {{prenatal}} {{care in the}} United States state that, if an urgent need for tetanus protection occurs during pregnancy, Td vaccine should be administered. If no urgent need arises and the woman has previously received tetanus vaccine, Td vaccination should be delayed until the postpartum period. All postpartum women who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> Td or Tdap vaccine {{in the last two}} years are recommended to receive Tdap prior to discharge after delivery. It is recommended for pregnant women who have never received tetanus vaccine (i.e., have never received DTP, DTaP or DT as child or Td or TT as adult) to receive a series of three Td vaccinations starting during pregnancy to ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus. In such cases, administration of Tdap is recommended after 20 weeks' gestation, and in earlier pregnancy a single dose of Tdap can be substituted for one dose of Td, and then the series completed with Td.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some technical and maintenance crew at SICEC has been barred entry to their workplace for months. The reason was due to they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> their passes from the organisers. An anonymous worker told the press that their passes had several problems on it. They were issued temporary passes earlier in September, but they have since expired. They were not let in without proper credentials. The workers who do not have passes have been given a day off from work, whereas the rest who had passes worked double {{to get ready for the}} meetings. An industry source stated that about 200 to 300 workers faced the same problem with their passes. The managing director from Showtec Corporation told the press around twenty of his crew were sent home as no pass have been issued to them, despite most of them submitted their forms a few months ago. A full strength of sixty is required to run the meetings. He added that a number of the passes did not come with an “S” at the bottom left hand corner of the card, which is a security feature for the person to be allowed into the Programme of Seminars which brings all the ministers and high-level delegates from 184 countries.|$|E
