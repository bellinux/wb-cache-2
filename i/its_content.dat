5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or <b>its</b> <b>content.</b> Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Latin {{writers were}} {{immersed}} in the Greek literary tradition, and adapted its forms and much of <b>its</b> <b>content,</b> but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks.

The poetry of Juvenal offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.|$|E
