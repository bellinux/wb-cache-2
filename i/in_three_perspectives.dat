Since this problem is NPhard, we seek a method for quickly finding sufficiently good solutions. To this end, we take evolutionary approaches based on a Genetic Algorithm. In this paper, we extend the evolutionary algorithm that we previously proposed <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>perspectives.</b> First, whereas the previous algorithm {{can be applied to}} only acyclic networks, we devise a modified evaluation method that works also with networks with cycles. Second, we introduce a new set of GA components that in our experiments outperforms the one used in the previous algorithm. Third, we present a new framework of the evolutionary approach, where fitness evaluation and population management are done in a decentralized manner with a limited amount of coordination. The new framework enables a network coding protocol where the resources used for coding are optimized in the setup phase as the proposed evolutionary algorithm being loaded and run at each node of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by carrying out simulations on a number of different sets of network topologies. I...|$|E

A second concern has the same recombination distribution for both sexes, but contrasting selection regimes between sexes. It is then established that, with respect to discerning the relevance of the H-W equilibrium, there is an equivalent monoecious selection regime which is an appropriate "weighted combination" of the male and female selection forms. Finally, in the case where the selection and recombination structures are both sex dependent, a hierarchy of comparisons is elaborated, seeking to unravel the nature of selection-recombination interaction for monoecious versus diocecious systems...|$|E

This interaction permits the supervisor to maintain the system in a stable state. We have incorporated these hierarchical levels into MASC, a Multiple Agent Supervisory Control system. MASC provides the human supervisor with a three dimensional graphical human-machine interface. Our current test bed is the University of Pennsylvania 2 ̆ 7 s General Robotics and Active Sensory Perception (GRASP) Laboratory 2 ̆ 7 s multiagent system.

40|$|The {{research}} on the grid size suitability is important to provide improvement in accuracies of gridded population distribution. It contributes to reveal the actual spatial distribution of population. However, currently {{little research has been}} done in this area. Many well-modeled gridded population dataset are basically built at a single grid scale. If the grid cell size is not appropriate, it will result in spatial information loss or data redundancy. Therefore, in order to capture the desired spatial variation of population within the area of interest, it is necessary to conduct {{research on}} grid size suitability. This study summarized three expressed levels to analyze grid size suitability, which include location expressed level, numeric information expressed level, and spatial relationship expressed level. This study elaborated the reasons for choosing the five indexes to explore expression suitability. These five indexes are consistency measure, shape index rate, standard deviation of population density, patches diversity index, and the average local variance. The suitable grid size was determined by constructing grid size-indicator value curves and suitable grid size scheme. Results revealed that the three expressed levels on 10 m grid scale are satisfying. And the population distribution raster data with 10 m grid size provide excellent accuracy without loss. The 10 m grid size is recommended as the appropriate scale for generating a high-quality gridded population distribution in our study area. Based on this preliminary study, it indicates the five indexes are coordinated with each other and reasonable and effective to assess grid size suitability. We also suggest choosing these five indexes <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>perspectives</b> of expressed level to carry out the research on grid size suitability of gridded population distribution...|$|E

Investigating how TMS is applied in China’s logistics market and making comparison of TMS between a multinational company and a Chinese local company is the main contribution of the paper.     After conducting cases study and interview on a foreign multinational logistics enterprise United Parcel Service and a Chinese local small logistics Jiangsu Universal Logistics Company, this paper has a relatively high reliability and validity.

An Analysis of the Negotiations <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>Perspectives.</b> In this study, I {{present and}} discuss {{different}} schools of negotiation theory, {{with a view}} to testing them out on a specific empirical case: the Oslo channel. The study is divided into five chapters: an introduction, a theoretical approach, a background sketch of the empirical case, an analysis of the negotiations and a conclusion. In traditional negotiation theory, here summarised in three different approaches - the structural, the process oriented and the behaviour oriented approach - the last approach is usually not emphasised in political science. However, I try to show that the factors pertaining to this approach {{have a significant impact on}} a negotiation process. The purpose of my study has been to elevate the estimation of these factors to the level of the structural and process oriented ones, and examine the interaction and mutual dependency between all of the factors. My main questions are: What influence did the different factors have on the outcome of the Oslo negotiations? Did the interaction and the dynamics between the parties have a particular influence on the outcome of these negotiations? In my study, different negotiation theoretical approaches are elaborated. I have then extracted the most important factors from each approach and categorised them into three perspectives. In addition, these perspectives are made more suitable for an analysis of practical negotiations by the introduction of some new elements. This is done on the assumption that traditional negotiation theory is too abstract to explain all aspects of the outcome of practical negotiations. When analysing a negotiation process through the lenses of only one of these approaches, one obtains a limited picture of which factors lead to the success or failure of the negotiation. Consequently, the three new perspectives, which I have labelled the exogenous, the procedural and the psycho-dynamic perspective, are introduced to facilitate the analysis of the interaction between the factors influencing a negotiation process. The perspectives are ultimately applied in the analysis of the Oslo negotiations...|$|E

We demonstrate that after applying a polynomial embedding {{to the point}} correspondences, they become related by the so-called multibody trilinear constraint and its associated multibody trifocal tensor, which are natural generalizations of the trilinear constraint and the trifocal tensor to multiple motions. We derive a rank constraint on the embedded correspondences from which one can estimate the number of independent motions, as well as linearly solve for the multibody trifocal tensor. We then show how to compute the epipolar lines associated with each image point from the common root {{of a set of}} univariate polynomials and the epipoles by solving a pair of plane clustering problems using Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA). The individual trifocal tensors are then obtained from the second-order derivatives of the multibody trilinear constraint.
