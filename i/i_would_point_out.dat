On that front enemy is served by broad–gauge railway with good lateral {{communications}} and apparently ideal ground for defence. Broad–gauge railway would put him on level with me as regards numbers that could be maintained. I should require 16 or 18 divisions besides my mounted corps to ensure success against Damascus–Beirut line if strongly held, but this is probably more than my railway could support. My estimate is made on the supposition enemy will make use of his broad-gauge railway to its full capacity. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Aleppo is 350miles distant and my single line of railway advances {{about half a mile}} a day. Railhead of my double line is at Bir el Mazar, but the doubling of railway has had to be stopped during my present advance. For my immediate plans see my telegram No. E.A. 598 14 December, and I think it advisable before advancing much further north to clear Turkish forces on Medina railway."

6000|$|Finally, {{as regards}} {{drawings}} of this kind, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that there is}} absolutely no limit at all to the amount of [...] "passably picturesque" [...] costumes which can be either revived or invented for us; but that unless a costume is founded on principles and exemplified laws, it never can be of any real value to us in the reform of dress. This particular drawing of Mr. Huyshe's, for instance, proves absolutely nothing, except that our grandfathers did not understand the proper laws of dress. There is not a single rule of right costume which is not violated in it, for it gives us stiffness, tightness and discomfort instead of comfort, freedom and ease.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the whole}} {{strength}} of our collective intelligence will be directed first to {{reducing the amount of}} such irksome work by labour-saving machinery, by ingenuity of management, and by the systematic avoidance of giving trouble as a duty, and then to so distributing the residuum of it that it will become the whole life of no class whatever in our population. I have already quoted the idea of Professor William James of a universal conscription for such irksome labour, and while he would have instituted that mainly for its immense moral effect upon the community, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that, combined with a nationalisation of transport, mining, and so forth, it is also a way to a partial solution of this difficulty of [...] "mere toil." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{have seen}} the artistic spirit working, first in the {{delightful}} and technical sphere of language, the sphere of expression as opposed to subject, then controlling {{the imagination of the}} poet in dealing with his subject. And now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to you its operation in the choice of subject. The recognition of a separate realm for the artist, a consciousness of the absolute difference between the world of art and the world of real fact, between classic grace and absolute reality, forms not merely the essential element of any aesthetic charm but is the characteristic of all great imaginative work and of all great eras of artistic creation - of the age of Phidias as of the age of Michael Angelo, of the age of Sophocles as of the age of Goethe.|$|E
60|$|The {{walk back}} from the summer-house through the wood is very lovely; {{but it would be}} a disappointing walk to {{visitors}} who had been prevented by a flood in the river from coming up the channel, for it indicates plainly how requisite it is that the river should be seen from below and not from above. The best view of the larger fall itself is that seen from the wood. And here again <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that any male visitor should walk the channel of the river up and down. The descent is too slippery and difficult for bipeds laden with petticoats. We found a small hotel open at Trenton, at which we got a comfortable dinner, and then in the evening were driven back to Utica.|$|E
6000|$|In {{concluding}} {{this brief}} {{sketch of a}} great subject, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> its bearing upon {{the future of the}} human race. If my conclusions are just, it must inevitably follow that the higher--the more intellectual and moral--must displace the lower and more degraded races; and the power of [...] "natural selection," [...] still acting on his mental organization, must ever lead to the more perfect adaptation of man's higher faculties to the conditions of surrounding nature, and to the exigencies of the social state. While his external form will probably ever remain unchanged, except in the development of that perfect beauty which results from a healthy and well organized body, refined and ennobled by the highest intellectual faculties and sympathetic emotions, his mental constitution may continue to advance and improve, till the world is again inhabited by a single nearly homogeneous race, no individual of which will be inferior to the noblest specimens of existing humanity.|$|E

30|$|With {{regard to}} several of the {{recently}} published critical case studies on participatory TA procedures, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the procedures studied there are often precisely those—to consider their institutional setting—that were not situated {{in the context of}} policy consultation conducted by an institution working with a public mandate. The procedures studied were, on the contrary, rather free floating, conducted on unclear assignments, and performed by “participation entrepreneurs” (Bogner 2010).|$|R
60|$|It is all so simple, and, {{when you}} come to think of it, really not expensive. Age, apparently, makes no difference. A woman is as old as she looks. In future, I take it, there will be no ladies over five-and-twenty. Wrinkles! Why any lady should still persist in wearing them is a mystery to me. With a {{moderate}} amount of care any middle-class woman could save enough out of the housekeeping money in a month to get rid of every one of them. Grey hair! Well, of course, if you cling to grey hair, there is no more to be said.

We are, we declare, fighting for a complete change in international methods, and we are bound {{to stick to the}} logical consequences of that. We have placed ourselves on the side of democratic revolution against autocratic monarchy, and we cannot afford to go on shilly-shallying with that choice. We cannot in these days of black or white play the part of lukewarm friends to freedom. I will not remind the reader here of the horrible vacillations and inconsistencies of policy in Greece that have prolonged the war and cost us wealth and lives beyond measure, but President Wilson himself has reminded us pungently enough and sufficiently enough of the follies and disingenuousness of our early treatment of the Russian Revolution. What I want to point out here is the supreme importance of a clear lead in this matter now in order that we should state our War Aims effectively.|$|E
