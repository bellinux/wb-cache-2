5|$|Although the Eskaya {{had been}} known to {{people living in the}} {{vicinity}} of Bohol’s southeast highlands prior to World War II, {{it was only in the}} early 1980s that they came to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies. Local journalists and researchers have since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> broad consensus on the subject.|$|E
5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no.</b> Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E

5|$|Waptia fieldensis is {{the only}} species {{accepted}} under the genus Waptia. It is classified under the family Waptiidae (established by Walcott in 1912), the order Waptiida (established by Leif Størmer in 1944), and (tentatively) the clade Crustaceomorpha. Early restorations of Waptia fieldensis by Charles R. Knight in 1940 erroneously depicted it as a primitive shrimp, but modern paleontologists now consider it among the Burgess Shale arthropods that are of unknown and uncertain taxonomic placement. Some authors have suggested {{that it may be}} allied to crustaceans, but like many Cambrian crustaceomorphs, the mouthparts were not preserved, making it impossible to reliably classify them within the crustacean crown group. Others propose that it may be only distantly related to crustaceans, being at least a member of a stem group of crustaceans, or even of all arthropods. Despite being one of the first species recovered and being the third most abundant fossils of the Burgess Shale, there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> in-depth work on the morphology of Waptia fieldensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E

25|$|The {{rings of}} Saturn {{are the most}} {{extensive}} planetary ring system of any planet in the Solar System. They consist of countless small particles, ranging from μm to m in size, that orbit about Saturn. The ring particles are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. There <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> consensus as to their mechanism of formation; some features of the rings suggest a relatively recent origin, but theoretical models indicate {{they are likely to}} have formed early in the Solar System's history.|$|E
25|$|The {{other team}} then scrimmages {{the ball at}} the opponent's 35-yard line and has the same {{opportunity}} to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> winner, {{during the regular season}} the game ends as a tie. In a playoff game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.|$|E

Hence, it still {{remains to be seen}} if the courts in Singapore will adopt the four requirements that were laid down in E v. Home Secretary. One view is that there is little reason for the courts to reject these requirements, given that Fong Thin Choo cited Tameside with approval, and E v. Home Secretary was based upon this case.|$|E

25|$|Three {{championship}} {{titles are}} disputed in UAAP football, {{one for each}} division, namely the men's, women's and juniors. The tournament is a double round robin elimination. A Team that sweeps both rounds automatically wins the championship. Otherwise, the number one and two ranked teams meet in the Finals round with the former having a twice-to-beat advantage over the number two team. Games in the Finals go into extra time if the score is a draw {{at the end of}} Regulation Time. The extra time consists of two 15-minute periods. If there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> winner after the extra time, then the game will go to a penalty shootout (free kick) to decide the winner.|$|E
25|$|Females show a {{stronger}} McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli. Another aspect regarding gender {{is the issue}} of male faces and voices as stimuli in comparison to female faces and voices as stimuli. Although, there is no difference in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation. If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> difference in strength of the McGurk effect. Knowing that the voice you hear is different from the face you see – even if different genders – doesn’t eliminate the McGurk effect.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medicines}} such as aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen {{among others}} {{can be taken to}} help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use ultrasound and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a corticosteroid medicine into the space under the acromion. However, recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>no</b> improvement after 6 to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.|$|E
