40|$|The {{specific}} {{removal of}} molecules from various media {{is an area}} receiving increasing attention. Affnity membranes, i. e. membranes containing ligands, which can specifically capture target molecules, can meet this demand. One important area, in which the use of affinity membranes will be beneficial, is blood filtration, specifically haemodialysis treatments. The specific removal of toxins can reduce treatment time and/or frequency and therefore increase patients' quality of {{life as well as}} reduce costs for the health care sector. The presented research investigates the feasibility of combining a new class of nonantibody binding proteins (AdhironTM binders), which can be specifically designed to capture target molecules, with electrospun nanofibrous polysulphone (PSu) membranes to create an affinity membrane for the specific removal of target molecules. Adhiron binders against a model target protein (modified green fluorescent protein (mGFP)) were successfully produced and characterised. Suitable parameters for the electrospinning of PSu into smooth bead-free fibres were identified. Two different approaches for the functionalisation of PSu fibres were evaluated: incorporation of the Adhiron binders within the fibre and attachment of the binders to the functionalised PSu fibre surfaces. With the latter approach functionalisation was achieved by means of attaching Adhiron binders to surface functionalised fibres, on which the Adhiron binders were immobilised via a biotin-streptavidin bridge.

(Chemistry) This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>functionalising</b> the {{silicone}} <b>membrane</b> by {{filling it with}} synthesised γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles {{for the purpose of}} using it as a passive sampling device for monitoring microcystins and cylindrospermopsin in aquatic environments. The identity and purity of the synthesised nanoparticles was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface zeta potential analyser and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET).

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{application}} of membrane technology to molecular separation processes has stimulated interest and showed great potential {{in a number of}} industrial fields. A new membrane market is arising in the chemical industry where many in-process separation problems can be tackled elegantly by sufficiently stable membranes. Since the 1990 s progress has also been made in the development of solvent resistant nanofiltration membranes, opening the possibility to tackle several separation problems in non-aqueous solvents. Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) offers great perspectives towards wide application in the process industry as it provides a facile, energy-efficient and scalable alternative to conventional separation processes such as distillation, liquid-liquid extraction or chromatographic purification. It has been proven that OSN has an enormous potential in many solvent intensive pharmaceutical and fine-chemical processes, where it can be used for the recovery, concentration and purification of valuable target molecules, {{as well as for the}} purification and recycling of spent solvents. Here, ceramic nanofiltration membranes with their broad solvent resistance and high temperature stability, have the potential to take a significant market share. The state-of-the-art nanoporous ceramic membranes for OSN are transition metal oxide membranes, containing a large amount of surface OH-groups, making them strongly hydrophilic. By exchanging these hydroxyl groups by a more apolar group (such as alkyl, perfluoroalkyl, [...] .), the surface becomes more hydrophobic, increasing non-polar solvent fluxes. Recently, VITO and UA have developed a new versatile grafting method (modification with Grignard reagents) capable of attaching a direct, non-hydrolysable bond between the membrane surface and the functional group. This results in novel membranes with a wide range of surface functionalities. The approach used in this thesis is to investigate the properties, performance and potential of these grafted membranes in organic solvent nanofiltration. The properties of the Grignard modified membranes were examined by physico – chemical characterisation (contact angle measurements, micro-ATR/FTIR-spectroscopy) in addition to performance characterisation (flux and retention measurements). All observations for modified membranes are consistent with the assumed partial replacement of the OH-groups on the membrane surface and the consequent amphiphilic character of the modified membrane surface. Moreover, the solvent filtration performance and application potential of such Grignard <b>functionalised</b> <b>membranes</b> was further evaluated and explored. To this purpose, the retention behavior of a variety of 5 different model solvent/solute mixtures was determined for a variety of grafted and ungrafted membranes. The varying retention behaviour was evaluated by considering the changing affinity of solvents and solutes for the modified and unmodified membrane surfaces. To support this interpretation, a sorption test was used to quantify the solute-membrane affinity. A long-term test was performed in order to check the stability of grafted groups on the surface of the membrane. Further experimental work was directed to understand how to tune solvent-membrane-solute interactions in a controlled way in order to enhance OSN performance. This was achieved by performing an extensive retention study on two type of Grignard <b>functionalised</b> <b>membranes,</b> choosing three PEG molecules and polystyrene as solutes, all with almost the same size but different polarities, in a wide range of solvents including water, ethanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexane and methyl cyclohexane. To unravel the transport mechanism properly, the pressure effect of flux and retentions was thoroughly investigated. The retention results showed in general a very different behaviour in different ranges of polarity: at low solvent polarity, retentions are relatively low, varying with pressure and solvent polarity; at high solvent polarity, retentions are relatively high, and independent of pressure and solvent polarity. The Spiegler-Kedem theory, taking into account both diffusion and convection transport mechanisms, was used as a basis for a fundamental explanation of the results and explaining the competing contribution of diffusion and convection in solute transport. Finally, this study demonstrates the importance of all solvent-membrane-solute interactions in the OSN transport, but also shows how they can be manipulated to enhance the membrane performance.

40|$|The {{development}} of optical sensors for in-situ, real-time and low-cost monitoring of heavy metal ions is a tremendously and fast growing area of research. This work presents several novel sensing strategies for developing optical chemical sensors {{that can be}} used as early warning devices for heavy metal pollution in water. The optical sensors that are comprised of metal chelating reagent, together with an ion carrier immobilised within polymeric thin films, i. e. hybrid sol-gel thin films, PVC <b>membranes,</b> ORMSOLs, and <b>functionalised</b> cellulose <b>membranes.</b> The developed test strips based on 2 -(5 -bromo- 2 - 2 pyridydylazo) - 5 -diethylaminophenol (Br-PADAP) immobilised on hybrid nafion/sol-gel membranes are capable of selectively monitoring Ni 2 + in water samples.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of amine-functionalised anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) {{for use in}} the all-vanadium redox flow battery has been studied. A selection of radiation-grafted aminated <b>membranes</b> <b>functionalised</b> with dimethylamine, trimethylamine or diazabicyclo(2, 2, 2) octane were extensively tested. The success of each grafting process was confirmed by Raman and infrared spectroscopies, titrimetry and ionic conductivity measurements.

The results highlight the importance of balancing ionic conductivity with vanadium cation permeability and indicate that amine-based functional groups may not be suitably stable for the membranes to remain true AEMs when in use in the all-vanadium redox flow battery. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the optimum conditions for functionalisation of polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, as such modified membranes have been already viewed as very promising “new generation” low-fouling materials [1]. Anti-fouling composite membranes were prepared via photo-initiated “grafting-from” of the hydrophilic monomer poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) on commercial PES UF membranes with wide range of nominal molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). A fine adjustment of the sieving properties of the modified membranes was achieved by addition of suited crosslinker monomers in appropriate ratio to the reaction mixture. In this study, two crosslinkers were used: N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAA) and pentaerythritol triallyl ether (PETAE). Systematic variations of UV intensity and UV irradiation dose in combination with different monomer mixtures were performed {{in order to examine}} the effect of UV irradiation and crosslinker type and amount on the fouling and selectivity behaviour of the composite membranes. Therefore, a comprehensive study of the membrane properties via contact angle (CA), zeta potential (ZP), water permeability, selectivity/rejection and microscopic measurements was performed. The results showed that at same UV irradiation dose, increasing the UV irradiation intensity led to increased degree of grafting (DG), higher water permeability but also increased MWCO. By this means, at higher UV intensity, the synthesis of more hydrogel on the membrane surface did not lead to lower membrane cut-off due to the more aggressive conditions at relatively high UV intensity leading to more open membrane structure. The type and amount of the used crosslinkers {{had an impact on the}} membrane performance as well. Crosslinking with MBAA led to lower flux and cut-off values; by increasing the amount of MBAA this effect was amplified. In contrast, the crosslinking with PETAE increased the flux and cut-off. Applying the optimised functionalisation conditions made it possible to prepare membranes with similar water flux and sieving properties to virgin membranes but with better fouling resistance. Furthermore, the fouling behaviour and principles, and the membrane performance of virgin and modified membranes were evaluated during filtration experiments with proteins (myoglobin, bovine serum albumin, γ-globulin, fibrinogen and thyroglobulin), humic substances and polyphenolics as well as during cleaning and long term stability tests. Membrane properties (membrane chemistry, morphology and charge), solution properties (solutes nature, size, concentration and charge) as well as operating parameters (hydrodynamics and operation mode) had an impact on the membrane performance during filtration, since these parameters influence the membrane-solute and solute-solute interactions governing fouling. The modification with hydrogel layer increased the fouling resistance of the membranes. Modified membranes with similar water flux and cut-off to virgin membranes showed higher permeate fluxes and more stable rejection properties during filtration. After several cleaning steps, <b>functionalised</b> <b>membranes</b> showed more stable behaviour and better filtration performance. The obtained results suggested that by adapting the membrane characteristics and operation conditions to the properties of the feed to be filtered, the performance of the desired process can be well controlled by minimising fouling effects.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{route to}} {{copolymers}} comprising a chlorotrifluorinated backbone and imidazole terminated pendant ethylene oxide groups {{has been developed}} {{for use of the}} resultant high molecular weight polymer as a component of proton conducting membranes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The synthesis route makes use of the radical initiated copolymerisation of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) with 2 -chloroethylvinylether (CEVE). The resultant alternating copolymer retains vinyl side groups that are used in a second stage to graft 1 -benzyl- 2 -(hydroxymethyl) imidazole, and the degree of grafting is controlled by the reactant ratios. Deprotection by hydrogenation generates pendant imidazole functions that are grafted through carbon, such as to leave available the -NH and -N- functions for participation in proton transfer. The polymer was subsequently used to form blend membranes with sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (sPEEK), and the ratio -NH/-SO 3 H varied between 1 and 100. Very low amounts of water (5 - 15 wt%) were taken up by the pure (non-blended) imidazole <b>functionalised</b> polymer <b>membrane</b> and even in the blend membranes water uptake remains remarkably low (< 25 wt%) in membranes having an imidazole content ≥ 1 mmolg− 1. The conductivity has been determined under a range of temperatures (25 - 120 ◦C) and relative humidities (25 - 100 % RH). At 120 ◦C, the conductivity follows the trend of the content of grafted imidazole. Further, the dependence of conductivity on RH becomes significantly less marked as the grafted imidazole content increases, i. e. as the ratio NH/SO 3 H increases...|$|R

In this study, chitosan membranes were modified by pyromellitic dianhydride in order to introduce carboxyl groups and facilitate adsorption of the highly basic photosensitiser − 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis (1 -met​hyl- 4 -pyridinio) porphyrin tetra p-toluene sulfonate (TMPyP). The physico-chemical properties of these modified membranes were investigated by microscopy, absorption spectroscopy and Midland surface blotting approaches. The chitosan membrane-TMPyP composite showed photodynamic inactivation of bacteriophage MS 2 and E. coli BL 21. For photodynamic inactivation under stationary conditions, complete inactivation of MS 2 was observed after 90 min illumination at a light intensity of 32 mW cm− 2 (which equates to around 3 % of bright mid-day time sunlight under clear sky conditions in sub-Saharan Africa). For a flowing system, complete inactivation of MS 2 was observed for sample flowing at 0. 33 ml/min and passed over the surface of the modified membranes while being illuminated. Reduction of approximately 3 log PFU/ml were observed for samples passed just once over the membranes under the same conditions. With E. coli, under the same stationary conditions, a reduction of 3 log CFU/ml was observed. Each TMPyP <b>functionalised</b> chitosan <b>membrane</b> was used at least three times for the photodynamic inactivation of both MS 2 and E. coli BL 21 without any detectable loss of inactivation capacity.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} biofouling on thin film composite membranes such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, a myriad of different surface modification strategies has been published. The use of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) has emerged as being particularly promising. Nevertheless, the stability of these surface modifications is still poorly understood, particularly under permeate flux conditions. Leaching or elution of Ag-NPs from the membrane surface can not only affect the antimicrobial characteristics of the membrane, but could also potentially present an environmental liability when applied in industrial-scale systems. This study sought to investigate the dynamics of silver elution and the bactericidal effect of an Ag-NP <b>functionalised</b> NF 270 <b>membrane.</b> Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy was used {{to show that the}} bulk of leached silver occurred at the start of experimental runs, and was found to be independent of salt or permeate conditions used.

40|$|Membrane based {{separation}} of specific constituents from a complex mixture is a wellestablished technology. Numerous filtration membranes {{have been developed}} for separations based on size, charge and hydrophobicity. Alternatively, synthetic membranes have been modified using various materials (e. g. charged polymers), to induce stimuli responsiveness and achieve specific separation goals. However, controlling finer separations based on more complex properties has been a challenge. Further improvements in separations could be made with a universal membrane {{that could be used for}} a wide range of applications. This thesis describes the development of a novel stimuli-responsive membrane whose pores and surface are functionalised with self-assembling peptides (SAPs). SAPs are molecules that spontaneously organize into ordered structures through non-covalent interactions, in response to external stimuli. The use of reversible SAPs to control membrane permeability could possibly result in a more effective separation process, whereby a condition such as pH could be used to enable or block passage of certain solutes through the membrane. To progress towards achieving this goal, the following sub-objectives were addressed, i) to identify a suitable reversible SAP and examine the effect of conjugating it with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer spacer on self-assembly, ii) to <b>functionalise</b> a <b>membrane</b> surface and subsequently tether the SAP via the spacer molecule, whilst retaining the self-assembling behaviour on the membrane surface. Initially, peptide P 11 - 4 (QQRFEWEFEQQ) was chosen as the candidate for membrane tethering, because it can spontaneously switch molecular conformation from random coil at high pH to β sheet at low pH. P 11 - 4 was conjugated to a 2 kDa N-hydroxy succinimideactivated PEG via N-terminal amine coupling to form P 11 - 4 -PEG- 2 K and the conjugation was validated using MALDI-tof spectrometry. However, P 11 - 4 -PEG- 2 K did not retain self-assembly of the peptide P 11 - 4 but instead retained its random coil structure at pH < 3, in contrast to the behaviour of native P 11 - 4, which formed β sheets at similar pH. P 11 - 4 -PEG- 2 K retained its random coil conformation across various pH conditions (pH 2. 5, 7 and 11) and incubation periods (2 min- 20 days). Additional investigations on the effect of unreacted free PEG on P 11 - 4 self-assembly indicated that the presence of free PEG in solution did not hinder self-assembly. Further, conjugation carried out in 3 mM sodium phosphate buffer and water also resulted in P 11 - 4 -PEG- 2 K that lost its ability to form β sheets at pH 2. 5. Thus, P 11 - 4 -PEG- 2 K was deemed unsuitable for membrane modification and an alternative peptide EL- 5 F (ELELELELELF), with pH responsiveness, was used for further investigations on bioconjugate self-assembly in solution and upon being tethered to a membrane surface. For the first time, rapid and reversible pH-regulated self-assembly of EL- 5 F and its conjugates with 2 and 5 kDa PEG (EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K and EL- 5 F-PEG- 5 K) was demonstrated. Circular dichroism indicated the formation of β sheet structures at pH < 5. 9, 5. 8 and 5. 4 and disassembly to random coils above those pH values for EL- 5 F, EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K and EL- 5 FPEG- 5 K, respectively. β sheets were confirmed by the thioflavin T assay and transmission electron microscopy revealed the existence of extended fibrillar structures below the above pH values. pH-induced secondary structure conversion in both directions was reproducible for over fifteen cycles, even at salt concentrations of up to 200 mM NaCl, and the amounts of  sheet formed were quantitatively related to pH below the transition points. Self-supporting hydrogelation after self-assembly was observed at concentrations as low as 0. 2 wt%, which is 15 -fold lower than previously reported concentrations with PEGylated SAPs. Subsequent work, involving tethering of EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K to an Anodisc alumina membrane surface and/or pores and investigations on the effect of reversible self-assembly on the permeability of the membrane was carried out. COOH groups were immobilised on the membrane surface to prepare it for the coupling of EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K, using multilayer deposition of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). EL- 5 FPEG- 2 K was then successfully amine-coupled to the COOH groups on the surface and this was confirmed using ATR-FTIR. Subsequent flux tests indicated no pH-dependant variation in buffer flux properties of the EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K modified membrane. However, MWCO experiments using 72 and 29 kDa PEGs indicated reversible self-assembly of membrane tethered EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K, upon changes in pH, thereby affecting macromolecule permeation. Furthermore, investigations on the reversible, pH-regulated self-assembly of peptide EL- 5 F and conjugate EL- 5 F-PEG- 2 K tethered to polystyrene nanoparticle (NP) surfaces, showed size transitions and aggregation of NPs upon changes in pH, indicating retention of peptide and bioconjugate self-assembly after surface tethering. The results provide a tentative but consistent proof-of-concept, giving the first steps towards the development of a novel switchable SAP-based, stimuli-responsive membrane. Further investigations suggested to validate reversible peptide self-assembly on the membrane surface, are expected to pave the way towards achieving finely controlled membrane separations...|$|R
