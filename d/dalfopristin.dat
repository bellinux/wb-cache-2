40|$|International audienceWe {{compared}} the in vitro activity of <b>dalfopristin</b> and quinupristin combined with five intravenous antibiotics in a 3 -dimensional model. We tested six strains of Staphylococcus aureus selected with different patterns {{of resistance to}} methicillin and erythromycin. <b>Dalfopristin</b> and quinupristin displayed a very synergistic activity against all the strains with a mean 16 - or 32 -fold decrease of inhibitory concentrations in combination. That synergy was even better against erythromycin-resistant strains. In combination with tigecycline or fosfomycin, the antibacterial activity could be consistently enhanced with the same decrease of inhibitory concentrations. A synergy was also observed, less regularly and at a lower level, with rifampin, gentamicin or vancomycin. Combinations of <b>dalfopristin</b> and quinupristin with tigecycline or fosfomycin could be very interesting in clinical practice because the inhibitory effect could be achieved with very low concentrations of each component, even when erythromycin-resistant strains are concerned...|$|E
40|$|RP 59500 {{is a new}} {{injectable}} streptogramin {{composed of}} two synergistic components (quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin)</b> which are active against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens.

RP 59500 had low MICs for the four test organisms {{as well as for}} 24 additional isolates (the MIC at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited was or = 6 h for quinupristin), since successful treatment was restored by artificially prolonging the <b>dalfopristin</b> levels for 6 h. Thus, RP 59500 is a promising alternative to vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, provided that pharmacokinetic parameters are adjusted to afford prolonged levels of both of its constituents in serum.

The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of synercid, quinupristin, and <b>dalfopristin</b> were 1. 6, 2. 7, and 6. 3 μg/ml, respectively. Thus, synercid was markedly more active than its components. Treatment of acutely infected mice with 100 or 200 mg of synercid per kg of body weight per day administered intraperitoneally for 10 days resulted in survival of 50 % (P = 0. 0002) and 100 % (P < 0. 0001) of infected mice, respectively, whereas all control mice died by day 18. In contrast, treatment with 200 mg of either quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin</b> per kg per day alone resulted in only 20 % survival; treatment with 50 mg of either drug per kg per day resulted only in the prolongation of time to death.

In vitro time-kill curve studies showed no difference between Q-D and rifampin, at a concentration of four times the MIC, against the three strains. Rabbits with aortic endocarditis were treated 4 days with Q-D, rifampin, or their combination. In vivo, the combination was highly bactericidal and synergistic against strains susceptible to quinupristin (HM 1054 and RP 13) and sterilized 94 % of the animals. In contrast, the combination was neither synergistic nor bactericidal against the quinupristin-resistant strain (HM 1054 R) and did not prevent the emergence of mutants resistant to rifampin. We conclude that the in vivo synergistic and bactericidal activity of the combination of Q-D and rifampin against S. aureus is predicted {{by the absence of}} resistance to quinupristin but not by in vitro combination studies...|$|E

Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by microbroth dilution. Clonal relatedness among the isolates was investigated via SmaI-macrorestriction analysis by PFGE, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and plasmid profiling. Presence of virulence and resistance determinants was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Selected resistance genes were localized by Southern hybridizations.

The pharmacokinetic profiles of single intravenous doses of this combination streptogramin antibiotic of 7. 5 mg/kg of body weight were characterized for eight noninfected patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Comparison was made to pharmacokinetic profiles determined for eight healthy volunteers matched by age, sex, and race. Drug was measured in dialysate up to 6 h following the dose. Plasma and dialysate were assayed for parent compounds and metabolites. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between groups. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups for maximal concentrations in plasma, times to maximal concentration, areas under the curve, distribution volumes, rates of total body clearance, or half-lives in plasma for quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin.</b> No statistically significant differences were observed in maximal concentrations in plasma, times to maximal concentration, areas under the curve, or half-lives for cysteine, the glutathione conjugates of quinupristin, or the pristinamycin IIA metabolite of <b>dalfopristin.</b> The measurements in dialysate of the parent and most metabolites were below the expected MICs. Dialysis clearance was insignificant. Quinupristin-dalfopristin was well tolerated in both groups, causing only mild adverse events that resolved prior to discharge from the study.

40|$|The {{influence}} of inducible cross-resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) type antibiotics (inducible MLS(B) phenotype) on {{the activity of}} quinupristin-dalfopristin was investigated against Enterococcus faecium in vitro and in rabbits with experimental endocarditis. In vitro, quinupristin-dalfopristin displayed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against a MLS(B) -susceptible strain similar to those against two strains with the inducible MLS(B) phenotype. In addition, induction of the two MLS(B) -resistant strains with quinupristin (0. 016 to 1 microg/ml) or quinupristin-dalfopristin (0. 08 to 0. 25 microg/ml) increased the MICs of quinupristin from 8 microg/ml to 32 to > 128 microg/ml, but did not modify the MIC of <b>dalfopristin</b> (2 microg/ml) or quinupristin-dalfopristin (0. 5 microg/ml). In a rabbit endocarditis model, quinupristin-dalfopristin was as active as amoxicillin against the MLS(B) -susceptible E. faecium strain. In contrast, the activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was significantly decreased in animals infected with {{either of the two}} inducible MLS(B) -resistant strains (P < 0. 05), although no mutants resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin were detected. Against the clinical strain with the inducible MLS(B) phenotype, quinupristin-dalfopristin was not effective and was less active than amoxicillin (P < 0. 001); however, the activity of the combination of amoxicillin and dalfopristin-quinupristin was superior to that of amoxicillin (P < 0. 01). The different impact of the inducible MLS(B) phenotype in E. faecium on the activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin in vitro and in experimental endocarditis {{may be related to the}} reduced diffusion of <b>dalfopristin</b> compared with that of quinupristin into cardiac vegetations that we previously reported.

40|$|Quinupristin-dalfopristin is a {{streptogramin}} combination active against multiply resistant Enterococcus faecium. Among 45 E. faecium {{isolated from}} patients in various French hospitals, only two strains were intermediate (MIC = 2 μg/ml) and one, E. faecium HM 1032, was resistant (MIC = 16 μg/ml) to quinupristin-dalfopristin, according to British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards approved breakpoints. The latter strain contained the vgb and satA genes responsible for hydrolysis or acetylation of quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin,</b> respectively, and an ermB gene (also previously {{referred to as}} ermAM) encoding a ribosomal methylase. The two intermediate strains had an LSA phenotype characterized by resistance to lincomycin (L), increased MICs (≥ 8 μg/ml) of <b>dalfopristin</b> (streptogramin A [SA]), and susceptibility to erythromycin and quinupristin. This phenotype was also detected in eight other strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. No genes already known and conferring resistance to <b>dalfopristin</b> by acetylation or active efflux were detected in these LSA strains. Nineteen other strains resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to the quinupristin-dalfopristin combination displayed elevated MICs of quinupristin after induction (from 16 to > 128 μg/ml) and contained ermB genes.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} the streptogramin antibiotics quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin</b> was studied in a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate selected under quinupristin-dalfopristin therapy, in four derivatives of S. aureus RN 4220 selected in vitro, and in a mutant selected in a model of rabbit aortic endocarditis. For all strains the MICs of erythromycin, quinupristin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were higher than those for the parental strains but the MICs of <b>dalfopristin</b> and lincomycin were similar. Portions of genes for domains II and V of 23 S rRNA and the genes for ribosomal proteins L 4 and L 22 were amplified and sequenced.

40|$|Objectives Treatment {{of chronic}} or {{recurrent}} Staphylococcus aureus infections may require using antibiotics with activity against intracellular multiresistant organisms. Quinupristin/dalfopristin (3 : 7) has been {{examined in this}} context. Methods Quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin</b> were used separately or mixed. Strains used were: (i) methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA); (ii) one vat(B) MSSA and msr(A/B) MRSA; (iii) erm(A) (+) [MSSA, MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) ]; and (iv) one erm(A/B) (+) cfr(+) MRSA resistant to quinupristin, <b>dalfopristin</b> and their combination. Assessment of activity was determined by: (i) MICs (CLSI method); and (ii) concentration-response curves in broth and after phagocytosis by THP- 1 macrophages, with descriptors of the model (E(min)) and the pharmacodynamic response [maximal relative efficacy (E(max)), relative potency (EC(50)) and apparent static concentration (C(static)) ]. Results erm(A) -positive strains were all susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin (except strain CM 05), with MICs not adversely influenced by acid pH or by the MRSA, VISA or VRSA character of the strain. In concentration-response experiments, quinupristin/dalfopristin showed similar patterns for all strains (except strain CM 05), with a > 3 log(10) cfu decrease in broth and a 1. 3 [erm(A) strain] to 2. 6 [fully susceptible, vat(B) and msr(A/B) strains] log(10) cfu decrease for intracellular bacteria at the maximal extracellular concentration tested (25 mg/L). Maximal extracellular and intracellular activity was obtained for a quinupristin/dalfopristin ratio of 3 : 7. For strain CM 05, quinupristin/dalfopristin was static in all conditions. Conclusions Based on historical comparisons with rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, lipoglycopeptides and other antistaphylococcal drugs with a large accumulation in eukaryotic cells, quinupristin/dalfopristin appears {{to be one of}} the most active antibiotics against intracellular S. aureus studied in this model so far, largely irrespective of its resistance phenotype...|$|E

Analysis of the interactions between antibiotics and the ribosome permits investigation of the specific effect of modifications leading to antimicrobial resistances. Streptogramins are unique among the ribosome-targeting antibiotics because they consist of two components, streptogramins A and B, which act synergistically. Each compound alone exhibits a weak bacteriostatic activity, whereas the combination can act bactericidal. The streptogramins A display a prolonged activity that even persists after removal of the drug.

Results The investigation of the crystal structure of the 50 S ribosomal subunit from Deinococcus radiodurans in complex with the clinically relevant streptogramins quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin</b> reveals their unique inhibitory mechanism. Quinupristin, a streptogramin B compound, binds in the ribosomal exit tunnel in a similar manner and position as the macrolides, suggesting a similar inhibitory mechanism, namely blockage of the ribosomal tunnel. <b>Dalfopristin,</b> the corresponding streptogramin A compound, binds close to quinupristin directly within the peptidyl transferase centre affecting both A- and P-site occupation by tRNA molecules. Conclusions The crystal structure indicates that the synergistic effect derives from direct interaction between both compounds and shared contacts with a single nucleotide, A 2062. Upon binding of the streptogramins, the peptidyl transferase centre undergoes a significant conformational transition, which leads to a stable, non-productive orientation of the universally conserved U 2585.

Results and Conclusion: Seventeen (8. 5 &#x 0025;), 6 (3 &#x 0025;) and 4 (2 &#x 0025;) of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid, respectively. Within the vancomycin-resistant isolates, 6 (35. 2 &#x 0025;), 4 (25 &#x 0025;) and 1 (5. 88 &#x 0025;) showed vanA, vanB and vanC genotype patterns, respectively. Four (23. 5 &#x 0025;) of VRE isolates were resistant to linezolid with minimum inhibitory concentrations between 16 and 32 &#x 00 B 5;g/mL. Two linezolid vancomycin resistant enterococci were E. faecium...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: (i) To {{determine}} the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of ABT- 773, a novel keto-lide, against sensitive and erythromycin-resistant pneumococci; (ii) to subdivide erythromycin-resistant pneumococci into resistance phenotypes, more extensive than the conventional M and MLSB groups, by assessing susceptibilities to, and interactions between, erythromycin (14 -membered macrolide), clindamycin (lincosamide), rokitamycin (16 -membered macrolide), ABT- 773 (ketolide), quinupristin (streptogramin B) and <b>dalfopristin</b> (streptogramin A). Methods: MICs and MBCs of ABT- 773 were determined for 165 strains of pneumococci (113 resistant to erythromycin). Extended phenotypes for the erythromycin-resistant strains were {{described in terms}} of intrinsic susceptibility to, and induction of resistance by, the anti-biotics listed above. Results: Erythromycin-resistant strains could be divided into 10 extended phenotypes (desig-nated II–XI), two of which (II and IX) predominated. ABT- 773 at 0. 12 mg/L inhibited 109 strains (median 0. 03 mg/L). MICs for the other four strains (of phenotypes X and XI) were 0. 25 – 1 mg/L. MICs were only slighter higher when measured on agar in CO 2 than by the NCCLS method (in broth in air). MBCs were usually ≤ 2 × MIC, but for 10 strains (eight of phenotype X, one each o...|$|E
40|$|RP 59500, a {{combination}} of the streptogramins quinupristin and <b>dalfopristin,</b> and sparfloxacin are new antibiotics with good in vitro activities against Enterococcus faecium, which is an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen with resistance to multiple antimicrobials. Since fluoroquinolones and related macrolides have displayed high intracellular concentrations inside host cells, we evaluated the intracellular activities of these agents inside neutrophils against three strains each of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF). At concentrations equal to four times the MIC, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin decreased the number of intracellular VSEF organisms, while both antibiotics were at best bacteriostatic against intracellular VREF strains. At concentrations equal to one-fourth of the MIC, both antibiotics were bacteriostatic against intracellular VSEF strains but were ineffective in inhibiting the growth of VREF strains. Despite their anticipated markedly higher intracellular human neutrophil (PMN) concentrations, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin activities in medium alone were equal to or greater than those inside PMNs against almost all strains. We conclude that the intracellular PMN concentrations of these antibiotics may not be directly related to their intracellular activities in our assay. The reason for the differences in their activities against VSEF versus VREF remains undefined...|$|E
