Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown, resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a <b>decentralized</b> <b>network</b> and has no formal hierarchy.|$|E

2500|$|Enforcement of {{property}} code violations in Rochester had been {{handled by the}} Neighborhood Empowerment Team, or NET. Rather than utilizing a centralized code-enforcement office, ten sectors in Rochester were assigned {{a total of six}} NET offices by the city government. However, there had been complaints about the lack of consistency in the manner and severity of enforcement between NET offices. On July 16, 2008, the city announced that two of the NET offices would be closed and another relocated, due to what it had found to be the high cost and low value of operating the <b>decentralized</b> <b>network.</b> Following the restructuring, the remaining offices were renamed Neighborhood Service Centers, or NSCs. [...] There is now one office per city quadrant which resolve quality of life issues, work with neighborhood groups, and pave the way for appropriate housing and economic development. The majority of code enforcement processes were consolidated into the Bureau of Inspection and Compliance within the Department of Neighborhood and Business Development located centrally in City Hall.|$|E

While this is important it also bears introducing into the discourse that <b>decentralized</b> <b>networks</b> are also dynamic. These dynamics have been observed in nature, social behavior, and are now coded into the algorithms of social media. As art educators utilize social media to support teaching, it is important to consider the dynamics of <b>decentralized</b> <b>networks</b> and how they can influence attention and learning of a collective learner. This paper presents a method for visualizing ideation and attention drawn from an empirical study of social networking with teens in an art classroom.

30|$|Besides {{parallel}} algorithms, {{there are}} two other potential approaches for computation across a distributed network. In the standard—centralized—approach, the data are collected from all nodes and the computation is performed at a fusion center. Another approach is to consider distributed algorithms for fully <b>decentralized</b> <b>networks</b> without any fusion center where all nodes have the same functionality and each of them communicates only with its neighbors. Such an approach is typical for sensor-actuator networks or autonomous swarms of robotic networks [14]. Nevertheless, the investigation of distributed QR factorization algorithms designed for loosely coupled distributed systems with independently operating distributed memory nodes and with possibly unreliable communication links has only started recently [3, 15, 16].

40|$|Abstract—Reputation {{systems are}} {{essential}} to establish trust and to provide incentives for cooperation among users in <b>decentralized</b> <b>networks.</b> In these systems, {{the most widely used}} algorithms for computing reputations are based on random walks. However, in <b>decentralized</b> <b>networks</b> where nodes have only a partial view of the system, random walk-based algorithms can be easily exploited by uncooperative and malicious nodes. Traditionally, a random walk only uses information about the adjacency of nodes, and ignores their structural and temporal properties. Nevertheless, the properties of nodes indicate their reliability, and so, random walks using much richer information about the nodes than simple adjacency may achieve higher robustness against malicious exploitations. In this paper, we introduce the properties of nodes that are indicative of their reliability, and we propose a scheme to integrate these properties into the traditional random walks. Particularly, we consider two common malicious exploitations of random walks in <b>decentralized</b> <b>networks,</b> uncooperative nodes and Sybil attacks, and we show that integrating node properties into random walks results in much more robust reputation systems. Our experimental evaluation in synthetic graphs and graphs derived from realworld networks covering a significant number of users, shows the effectiveness of the resulting biased random walks.
