We present then an application of this lemma to the semantics of Frege Structure and of Type Theory, and compare it to S. Allen's justification of this semantics. 1 A <b>Fix</b> <b>Point</b> Theorem Theorem: Let D be a conditional sup semi-lattice, with a least element ?; such that any directed subset has a least upper bound. Let f : D!D be a monotone map.
