The observation of the discharge, during its elongation, on an <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> channel modelling a polluted HV line insulators shows that the latter emite, from its tip, some branches, which have a weaker luminous intensity. Departing from the modelling of Cheng and Nour, we have developed a survey that permit to determine a critical length of the discharge from which the system elongates using a model derived from Obenaus’s electric circuit This new approach gives better account of the physical phenomena that governs the extension of the body of the discharge. The results indicate that it exists a zone of transition from multi-arc model to single-arc model. This phenomenon could be explained by changing of propagating mechanism. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model of the steady-state current produced by the anodic half cell of a dye-sensitised solar cell (DSC) under both illuminated and non-illuminated conditions. A one-dimensional transport model that describes the transport of charged species via migration and diffusion within the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> pores and the porous semiconductor that constitutes the porous anode of the DSC is given. This model is coupled to an interfacial model, developed previously by the authors, that describes charge transfer across the semiconductor–dye–electrolyte interface by explicitly accounting for each reaction at the interface involving dye molecules, electrolyte species, and semiconductor electrons. An equivalent circuit extension to the anode model (in {{the form of a}} boundary condition) is developed in order to validate some of the simulation results of the anode model with experimental results obtained from a full DSC specifically commissioned for the study. Parameter values associated with the model are obtained from the literature or experimentally from the specifically commissioned cell. A comparison of the numerical simulation results with experimental results shows a favourable correspondence without the need to fit parameter values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this work, we aim {{to resolve}} {{different}} diffusion processes in polypyrrole/cellulose composites {{using a combination of}} impedance spectroscopy and finite element simulations. The computational model involves a coupled system of Ohm's law and Fickian diffusion to model electrode kinetics, non-linear boundary interactions at the electrode interfaces and ion transport inside the porous electrodes, thereby generating the impedance response. Composite electrodes are prepared via chemical polymerization of pyrrole on the surface of a nanocellulose fiber matrix, and the electrochemical properties are investigated experimentally using cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling. It is demonstrated that the onset frequency of the capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) process depends on the counter ion electrolyte diffusion, which is modulated by adding different amounts of sucrose to the aqueous electrolyte solution. Consequently, the electrochemical properties can be controlled by diffusion processes occurring at different length scales, and the critical diffusion processes can be resolved. It is shown that under normal operating conditions, the limiting process for charge transport in the device is diffusion within the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> pores of the composite electrode...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> method on the {{performance}} of the dye-sensitized solar cells is investigated with the segmented cell method, a recent technique which is very simple but effective as {{it can be used to}} examine all the photovoltaic characteristics. The <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> techniques compared were single injection, which is typically used in small laboratory cells, and pumping the electrolyte through the cell several times, which is often used for larger cells and modules. Significant photovoltage and photocurrent variations occur with the repeated pumping of the electrolyte in the cell preparation. Transient and charge extraction measurements confirmed that the differences in open circuit voltage were due to the shifts of the TiO 2 conduction band and time correlated single photon counting confirmed that the reduction of short circuit current was largely due to reduced electron injection correlated with the increasing conduction band edge in the studied cases. This was interpreted as an effect of molecular filtering by the TiO 2 causing an accumulation of electrolyte additives (4 -tert-butylpyridine and benzimidazole) near the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> hole, the concentration of which increased with repeated pumping of the electrolyte. Interestingly, spatial variations were seen not only in the relative TiO 2 conduction band energy but also in the density of trap states. In this contribution it is demonstrated how the changes in the conduction band can be separated from the changes in the density of trap states which is an essential for the correct interpretation of the data.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the intrinsic electrical properties of large surface area materials such as mesoporous nanocrystalline (nc-TiO 2), requires one to avoid sensor-like responses to external agents. Both an appropriate sample configuration and a suitable measurement protocol are mandatory. In this work, both the stack and planar contacts configurations were studied, the latter giving evidence which is potentially useful for space charge limited (SCL) current investigations in order to study the band-gap states (BGSs) properties in nc-TiO 2. Moreover, {{in the absence of}} a suitable measurement protocol, standard dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) electrode films show apparent SCL current behaviour, as a consequence of the surface electrical transport contribution due to the physisorbed water on the hydroxylated metal oxide large surface area. This feature recalls the typical results of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> systems, in which an exponential distribution of trap states is reported; it is not expected to be an intrinsic feature of the nc-TiO 2 trap states distribution. In the absence of adsorbates, no deviation from an ohmic regime is observed in standard electrodes, while in planar configuration samples, the SCL regime is accessible and shows a different BGS signature. The nature of electrical contacts, ohmic in this situation, is also discussed...|$|E

One potential ncMRI method, Lorentz effect imaging (LEI), has shown promise but needs a better theoretical understanding to improve its use. We develop three computational models to simulate the LEI experiments of an <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> phantom subject to a current dipole based on: ion flow, particle drift, and electromagnetohydrodynamics (EMHD). With comparative experimental results, we use the EMHD model {{to better understand the}} Lorentz effect over a range of current strengths. We also quantify the LEI experimental images and assess ways to measure the underlying current strength, which would greatly benefit comparative brain mapping. EMHD is a good predictor of LEI signal loss. We can measure the underlying current strength and polarity in the phantom using LEI images. We can also use trends from the EMHD model results to predict the required current density for signal detection in future LEI experiments. We can also infer the electric field strength, flow velocity, displacement, and pressure from the predicted current magnitude in an LEI experiment. The EMHD model provides information that greatly improves the utility and understanding of LEI. Future study with our EMHD model should be performed using shorter dipole lengths, higher density and lower strength of current sources, and varying current source frequencies to understand LEI in the setting of mapping brain activity.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the molecular filtering effect of TiO 2 has a significant influence on dye solar cell (DSC) performance. As electrolyte is injected to a DSC, some of the electrolyte components adsorb to the surface TiO 2 (here 4 -tert-butylpyridine and 1 -methyl-benzimidazole) and accumulate near the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> hole resulting in varying electrolyte composition and performance across the cell. The spatial performance distribution was investigated with a new method, the segment cell method. Not only is the segmented cell method simple and cheap {{when compared to the}} only other method for examining spatial variation (photocurrent mapping), it also has the major advantage of allowing the spatial variation in all other operating parameters to be assessed. Here the molecular filtering effect was to influence the cell performance in case of all the five studied electrolytes causing up to 35 % losses in efficiency. Raman spectra indicated that the loss in photocurrent in the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> was in correlation with the loss of thiocyanate ligands suggesting that dye regeneration may also be a significant factor in addition to electron injection in some of the cells. There were also shifts in the absorption spectra the photoelectrodes which further supported changes in the thiocyanate ligands. Besides absorption changes, there were additional shifts in the IPCE spectra which may relate to deprotonation of the dye. The efficiency losses were reduced to ∼ 10 % with contemporary electrolyte compositions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

An artificial cement pore water (ACPW) was used instead of NaClO 4 in experiments conducted to examine the potential correlations between the structural features of (P)HCA and their sorption behaviour. The ACPW should mimic the pore water composition characteristically for some types and process stages of nuclear waste solidification. The ACPW contained the following ion concentrations: 114  mmol L− 1 Na+, 180  mmol L− 1 K+ and 2  mmol L− 1 Ca 2 +, {{resulting in a total}} ionic strength of about 300  mmol L− 1 and a pH of 13.3 [25].

Sorption isotherms were recorded for all (P)HCA at initial adsorbate concentrations between 0.01 and 250  mmol L− 1, respectively, subdivided into 10 – 12 concentration levels. Isotherms at pH 4, 7, 9, and 12, respectively, were recorded for GLU dissolved in NaClO 4 solutions. The background electrolyte NaClO 4 was added to provide a moderate and constant ion concentration in solution even at very low GLU concentrations and to avoid extreme changes of the composition and extension of the electrical double layer at the gibbsite surface.

40|$|Most Li ion {{insertion}} batteries {{consist of}} a porous cathode, a separator filled with electrolyte and an anode, which very often also has some porous structure. The solid part especially in the cathode is usually produced by mixing a powder of the actual active particles, in which Li ions will be intercalated, binder and carbon black to enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode. As a result the porous structure of the electrodes is very complex, leading to complex potential, ion and temperature distributions within the electrodes. The intercalation and deintercalation of ions cannot {{be expected to be}} homogeneously distributed over the electrode due to the different transport properties of electrolyte and active particles in the electrode and the complex three-dimensional pore structure of the electrode. The influence of the final microstructure on the distribution of temperature, electric potential and ions within the electrodes is not known in detail, but may influence strongly the onset of degradation mechanisms. For being able to numerically simulate the transport phenomena, the equations and interface conditions for ion, charge and heat transport within the complex structure of the electrodes and through the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> separator are needed. We will present a rigorous derivation of these equations based exclusively on general principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

The principle of electro-osmosis through a cation selective membrane {{is used to}} develop a differential pressure {{which is used to}} deflect a pump membrane. In an electro-osmotic cell, there are <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> chambers on either side of an ion specific membrane. Hydrated cations migrate in an applied electric field, effectively pulling water molecules to the cathodic chamber. In such a setup, the polarity of the current can be periodically reversed causing the chambers to alternately fill and discharge. Since the chemical reactions are reversible, an operating window can be defined so that the electrodes do not degrade and gas bubbles do not form. Using data from the characterization of an ion specific membrane such as Nafion, design parameters were developed {{that could be used to}} build and operate a micropump using standard MEMS based fabrication and packaging technology. The design is compatible with a silicon substrate which could contain fluidic channels and chambers.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work on {{the development}} of a number of scanned electrochemical probe microscopies. Such techniques have widespread applications, from materials science to the life sciences. Advances in flexible instrumentation, coupled with the theoretical description of electrochemical systems, are central themes which allowed for the fruitful investigation of a variety of experimental systems. Theoretical descriptions of scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) were developed, particularly to investigate the effect of tip-geometry on imaging resolution. This technique has already found a number of applications in the life sciences, but image resolution has not previously been addressed adequately. Images were recorded showing tip-convolution that were in agreement with theoretical predictions. The scanning microcapillary contact method (SMCM) was developed, as a method of assessing spatial heterogeneities in electrode activity on the submicron length-scale. An <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> microcapillary containing a reference/auxiliary electrode was approached to a substrate (working) electrode surface, via piezoelectric positioners. Contact of the electrolyte meniscus with the substrate electrode was sensed by a current flowing. Electrochemical measurements were performed before the microcapillary was retracted and another point on the sample was characterised. Spatial heterogeneities in electrode activity were imaged on a sub-micron length-scale and the activity of basal plane highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was demonstrated. Tip position modulation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM-TPM), where an ultramicroelectrode (UME) is oscillated perpendicularly to a surface and an amperometric current is recorded, was investigated experimentally and theoretically. A model including convective mass-transport was developed that gave an accurate description of the experimental situation. It was demonstrated that SECM-TPM is a potentially powerful approach for the measurement of the permeability of a sample. SECM experiments were performed investigating the growth of Ag particles at a liquid/liquid interface, which was caused through the electrodissolution of a Ag UME in an aqueous phase, and the reduction of the Ag+ ion by an electron donor in the organic phase. A model was created that allowed for the interpretation of data. Cyclic voltammetry investigations of HOPG covered with a Nafion film containing a redox mediator confirmed the activity of basal plane HOPG, as demonstrated by SMCM measurements. Nafion slowed diffusion sufficiently to allow the spatial-decoupling of surface sites with different activity. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of the nanoporous anode within a dyesensitised solar cell (DSC). The main purpose of this work is to investigate interfacial charge transfer and charge transport within the porous anode of the DSC under both illuminated and non-illuminated conditions. Within the porous anode we consider many of the charge transfer reactions associated with the electrolyte species, adsorbed dye molecules and semiconductor electrons at the semiconductor-dye- electrolyte interface. Each reaction at this interface is modelled explicitly via an electrochemical equation, resulting in an interfacial model that consists of a coupled system of non-linear algebraic equations. We develop a general model framework for charge transfer at the semiconductor-dye-electrolyte interface and simplify this framework to produce a model based on the available interfacial kinetic data. We account for the charge transport mechanisms within the porous semiconductor and the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filled</b> pores that constitute the anode of the DSC, through a one- dimensional model developed under steady-state conditions. The governing transport equations account for the diffusion and migration of charge species within the porous anode. The transport model consists of a coupled system of non-linear differential equations, and is coupled to the interfacial model via reaction terms within the mass-flux balance equations. An equivalent circuit model is developed to account for those components of the DSC not explicitly included in the mathematical model of the anode. To obtain solutions for our DSC mathematical model we develop code in FORTRAN for the numerical simulation of the governing equations. We additionally employ regular perturbation analysis to obtain analytic approximations to the solutions of the interfacial charge transfer model. These approximations facilitate a reduction in computation time for the coupled mathematical model with no significant loss of accuracy. To obtain predictions of the current generated by the cell we source kinetic and transport parameter values from the literature and from experimental measurements associated with the DSC commissioned for this study. The model solutions we obtain with these values correspond very favourably with experimental data measured from standard DSC configurations consisting of titanium dioxide porous films with iodide/triiodide redox couples within the electrolyte. The mathematical model within this thesis enables thorough investigation of the interfacial reactions and charge transport within the DSC. We investigate the effects of modified cell configurations on {{the efficiency of the}} cell by varying associated parameter values in our model. We find, given our model and the DSC configuration investigated, that the efficiency of the DSC is improved with increasing electron diffusion, decreasing internal resistances and with decreasing dark current. We conclude that transport within the electrolyte, as described by the model, appears to have no limiting effect on the current predicted by the model until large positive voltages. Additionally, we observe that the ultrafast injection from the excited dye molecules limits the interfacial reactions that affect the DSC current...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{depositing}} electrolyte in dye solar cells (DSCs) is introduced: a nanocellulose hydrogel membrane is screen {{printed on the}} counter electrode and further freeze-dried to form a highly porous nanocellulose aerogel, which acts as an absorbing sponge for the liquid electrolyte. When the nanoporous dye-sensitized TiO 2 photoelectrode film is pressed against the wetted aerogel, it becomes <b>filled</b> with the <b>electrolyte.</b> The electrolyte flows inside the TiO 2 film only about ten micrometers (i. e. the TiO 2 film thickness) whereas in the conventional filling method, where the electrolyte is pumped through the cell, it flows about 1000 -times longer distance, which is known to cause uneven distribution of the electrolyte components due to a molecular filtering effect. Furthermore, with the new method {{there is no need}} for <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> holes which simplifies significantly the sealing of the cells and eliminates one common pathway for leakage. Photovoltaic analysis showed that addition of the nanocellulose aerogel membrane did not have a statistically significant effect on cell efficiency, diffusion in the electrolyte or charge transfer at the counter electrode. There was, however, a clear difference in the short circuit current density and open circuit voltage between the cells filled with the aerogel method and in the reference cells filled with the conventional method, which appeared to be caused by the differences in the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> instead of the nanocellulose itself. Moreover, accelerated aging tests at 1 Sun 40 °C for 1000 h showed that the nanocellulose cells were as stable as the conventional DSCs. The nanocellulose aerogel membranes thus appear inert with respect to both performance and stability of the cells, which is an important criterion for any electrolyte solidifying filler material.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} nickel hydrogen battery cell has been utilized to describe the chemical and physical changes during charge and overcharge in a recirculating stack nickel hydrogen cell. In particular, the movement of gas and electrolyte have been examined {{as a function of}} the amount of electrolyte put into the cell stack during cell activation, and as a function of flooding in regions of the gas screen in this cell design. Additionally, a two-dimensional variation on this model has been utilized to describe the effects of non-uniform loading in the nickel-electrode on the movement of gas and electrolyte within the recirculating stack nickel hydrogen cell. The type of nonuniform loading that has been examined here is that associated with higher than average loading near the surface of the sintered nickel electrode, a condition present to some degree in many nickel electrodes made by electrochemical impregnation methods. The effects of high surface loading were examined primarily under conditions of overcharge, since the movement of gas and electrolyte in the overcharging condition was typically where the greatest effects of non-uniform loading were found. The results indicate that significant changes in the capillary forces between cell components occur as the percentage of free volume in the stack <b>filled</b> by <b>electrolyte</b> becomes very high. These changes create large gradients in gas-filled space and oxygen concentrations near the boundary between the separator and the hydrogen electrode when the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>fill</b> is much greater than about 95 percent of the stack free volume. At lower <b>electrolyte</b> <b>fill</b> levels, these gaseous and electrolyte gradients become less extreme, and shift through the separator towards the nickel electrode. Similarly, flooding of areas in the gas screen cause higher concentrations of oxygen gas to approach the platinum/hydrogen electrode that is opposite the back side of the nickel electrode.

The distribution of the electrolyte among electrodes and matrix in the MCFC is dominated by the pore characteristics and wetting properties of these components. However, data on wetting, especially under load(current passage), are limited. In this study, the behavior of the meniscus at a metal is used to obtain information on wet-ting and electrochemical reactions. Meniscus height and current were measured under varioius atmopsheres. The contact angle was calculated from the meniscus height. The electrolyte distribution in the MCFC was estimated using contact angles thus obtained in oxidant and reducing atmospheres. The results suggest that upon applicatioin of load the elec-trolyte moves from the anode to the cathode and that capillary effects can worsen the performance of a cell, especially if it is in an unbalanced state of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new model}} for porous {{electrodes}} in molten-carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) is presented. The model {{is based on an}} averaging technique commonly used in porous-media problems. Important disadvantages of the existing agglomerate model caused by geometric assumptions and restrictions are eliminated in this new model. Unlike the agglomerate model, the new model is suitable for studying three-dimensional and anisotropic problems and incorporat-ing the degree of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>fill.</b> Different reaction mechanisms can easily be incorporated. The validity of the new model is checked and compared with the agglomerate model by fitting the two models to ac-impedance spectra recorded from porous MCFC cathodes. Infroduction This paper presents a new, three-phase, homogenized model for the porous electrodes of molten-carbonate fuel cells (MCFC). The model is based on the basic mass and current balances that describe on a small scale the elec-trochemical processes which produce current. The equa-tions which describe these balances are then average...|$|R
40|$|The {{polarization}} {{characteristics of}} porous LiCoO=, LiFeO=, and NiO structures when used as molten carbonate fuel cell cathodes are compared. A film agglomerate model, {{which accounts for}} kinetic activation, mass transfer, and both electronic and ionic ohmic resistance, is developed and applied to polarization data obtained for various cathode structures tested in 3 cm ~ lab cells. The model is {{used to evaluate the}} intrinsic atalytic properties of the materials and accounts for the influence of porous microstructure and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling.</b> In molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) technology, the corrosion of the state-of-the-art lithiated NiO cathode {{is one of the major}} life-time limiting factors. To overcome this problem alternative cathode materials are being devel-oped. Obviously, these materials should also have good in-cell performance and a low rate of dissolution i to the car-bonate melt. In this respect, the ceramic oxides LiCoQ and LiFeO 2 are of interest and have been investigated. As reported earlier, there are significant differences i...|$|R
40|$|Dye {{sensitized}} {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) are {{of great interest}} due to their attractive features of high‐ energy conversion ef ciency and low production cost ‐ fi [1]. Recently, DSSCs employing quasi solid polymer‐ electrolytes have been investigated because of their intrinsic advantages such as no solvent leakage and evaporation [2, 3]. To date, however, DSSCs employing polymer based electrolytes have exhibited low cell‐ ef ciency. This is mainly attributed to the inferior mass transfer rates of the redox couples (Ifi ‐ −/I 3 −) in the highly viscous medium and to high electron transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces. Therefore, it is‐ necessary to increase the ion mobility in the polymer medium to improve cell ef ciency. Although many effortsfi have been made through using new polymers, inorganic nano llers and small molecule plasticizers to increase thefi ion conductivity, {{a better understanding of}} polymer based electrolytes is required. For practical use of highly‐ viscous polymer based electrolytes, moreover, the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> process is significantly important to‐ commercialize DSSC. In this presentation, recent researches on the development of long term stable DSSCs and...|$|R

40|$|Scanning ion {{conductance}} microscopy (SICM) {{is currently}} used for high resolution topographic imaging of living cells. Recently, {{it has been}} also employed {{as a tool to}} deliver stimuli to the cells. In this work we have investigated the mechanical interaction occurring between the pipette tip and the sample during SICM operation. For the purpose, we have built a setup combining SICM with atomic force microscopy (AFM), where the AFM cantilever replaces the sample. Our data indicate that, operating in far-scanning mode with current decrease values below 2 %, no force can be detected, provided that the level of the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>filling</b> the pipette is equal to that determined by the capillary tension. A filling level different from this value determines a hydrostatic pressure, a flux through the pipette tip and detectable forces, even in far-scanning mode. The absolute value of these forces depends on the pipette tip size. Therefore, a possible pitfall when using SICM for cell imaging is to imply zero-force working conditions. However the hydrostatic forces can be exploited in order to deliver weak mechanical stimuli and guide neuronal growth cones. Evidences of the effectiveness of this approach are herein given...|$|R
40|$|A common {{phenomenon}} in capillary electrophoresis is electroendosmotic flow (EOF). Although often useful, EOF fluctuations introduce extra variances {{in the overall}} reproducibility of the anal. In order to correct for these fluctuations, an online EOF monitoring method is required. The method presented uses a cond. cell as the ground <b>electrolyte</b> reservoir, <b>filled</b> with dil. running buffer. During the sepn. the EOF will cause a continuous flow of non-dild. buffer into this reservoir. From the resulting continuously rising cond. signal, the EOF can be calcd. and used for, e. g., migration time and peak area correction...|$|R
