5000|$|Pressure {{grouting}} involves injecting a <b>grout</b> <b>material</b> into otherwise inaccessible but interconnected pore or {{void space}} of which neither the configuration or volume are known, {{and is often}} referred to simply as grouting. The grout may be a cementitious, resinous, or solution chemical mixture. The greatest use of pressure grouting is to improve geomaterials (soil and rock). The purpose of grouting can be either to strengthen a formation or to reduce water flow through it. It is also used to correct faults in concrete and masonry structures. Since first usage in the 19th century, grouting has been performed on the foundation of virtually every one of the world’s large dams, {{in order to reduce the}} amount of leakage through the rock, and sometimes to strengthen the foundation to support the weight of the overlying structure, be it of concrete, earth, or rock fill. Although pressure grouting has become an essential ground engineering construction procedure - practiced by specialist contractors and engineers around the world - it must be stressed that, from design to implementation, pressure grouting is an interactive and iterative process, requiring expertise and cooperation across a variety of disciplines. Both experience and expertise are therefore absolutely essential for successful project-realizations.|$|E

40|$|The United Kingdom is {{experiencing}} a period of rapid growth {{in the use of}} ground source heat pump systems. Most installations in the United Kingdom use vertical ‘borehole’ heat-exchanger arrays, the design of which depends on four parameters: formation thermal conductivity, formation heat capacity, heat-exchanger resistance and heat-exchanger <b>grout</b> <b>material</b> heat capacity. Conventionally, two of these parameters (conductivity and resistance) are obtained from a thermal response test carried out on a trial heat exchanger at the site of interest by fitting thermal response data to classical line-source heat conduction theory. This test method gives no information on the heat capacities of the formation and <b>grout</b> <b>material</b> and requires an assumption about the former to enable the heat-exchanger resistance parameter to be extracted. In this work, a new method is developed for extracting all four parameters using a trust-region search algorithm in conjunction with a detailed numerical model of the test heat exchanger. Results give excellent agreement between the fitted-model predictions of heat-exchanger outlet water temperature and measured outlet water temperature for 13 test cases. A further advantage of the method developed here is that it can be used with data sets that contain disturbances and discontinuities.

During the operations, the BHE is exposed by the thermal stresses due to heat loading. In addition if the porous <b>grout</b> <b>material</b> is immerged in water, the freezing-induced ice pressure may damage the grout. In this paper, the freezing impact on BHEs is investigated analytically and experimentally. For the theoretical approach, an analytical solution is developed by using the hollow cylinder model that accounts for both the high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe and the <b>grout</b> <b>material.</b> Firstly, the frozen pore water pressure is incorporated in the generalized Hooke's law equations in 2 D plane stress, and secondly the model is solved for the considered boundary conditions. In order to validate the developed model, the experimental setup is conducted in agreement with the geometry of the considered analytical model and the BHE specimens are prepared with three different grout materials having large difference in the thermal and hydraulic characteristics (i. e. silica-sand based, calcite based and homemade thermally enhanced with graphite). According to the experiments for 50 h of freezing operation, the calcite based grout and the homemade grout, having lower permeability and relatively higher porosity, are fractured. In contrast, the silica-sand based grout having higher permeability did not exhibit any damage. Compared with the theoretical results, the observations from the experiments are consistent. The effective tangential stress induced by the frozen pore water pressure causes the crack development and agrees with the crack patterns. It is concluded that the porosity and the permeability play significant role on the grout failure upon freezing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

During the operations, the monitored temperatures in the sandbox are in good agreement with analytical predictions. This study demonstrates that the homemade admixture prepared with 5 % natural flake graphite can be considered as an appropriate grout for BHEs regarding to its rheological and thermo-physical properties. Thermally-enhanced grouting can be of significant interest in a high thermal conductivity ground (such as saturated sand) because it minimizes the thermal resistance of the BHE. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to perform the experiment, a total of 10 types of grouting mixing ratios were prepared by a combination of different materials such as Ordinary Portland Cement, Micro Cement, Bio <b>Grouting</b> <b>Material</b> and Sodium Silicate. They were cured in the air, and their homogel uniaxial compression strengths were measured on days 1, 3, 7 and 28 Based on the test results, it was confirmed that the uniaxial strength of the specimen made with Bio <b>Grouting</b> <b>Material,</b> Ordinary Portland Cement and Micro Cement was increased by more than 30 % than that of the specimen only used with Ordinary Portland Cement, as a result of hydrogen-released heat reaction between calcium carbonate, the main ingredient of the bio <b>grouting</b> <b>material,</b> and calcium silicate in the cement. This indicates that the use of 30 % bio-grouting material instead of cement in the grouting can be a reasonable mixing ratio to save the use of cement, leading to reduction in CO 2 emission...|$|R
