5|$|In Heian-era Japan, <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> kept {{separate}} households; {{children were}} raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because {{she lived in}} her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in <b>Husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wives</b> (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

25|$|Scenes of Venus and Mars in Roman art often {{ignore the}} adulterous {{implications}} of their union, and {{take pleasure in}} the good-looking couple attended by Cupid or multiple Loves (amores).

25|$|Along with {{property}} and ideology, social lives were also held in common. As an example, most kibbutz dining halls exclusively utilized benches, {{not as an}} issue of cost or convenience, but because benches were construed as another way of expressing communal values. In the beginning, some kibbutzim <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> were discouraged from sitting together, as marriage was an expressed form of exclusivity.|$|E

25|$|Increasingly harsh anti-polygamy {{legislation}} in the US led some Mormons to emigrate to Canada and Mexico. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued a public declaration (the Manifesto) announcing that the LDS Church had discontinued new plural marriages. Anti-Mormon sentiment waned, as did opposition to statehood for Utah. The Smoot Hearings in 1904, which documented that the LDS Church was still practicing polygamy spurred the LDS Church to issue a Second Manifesto again claiming that it had ceased performing new plural marriages. By 1910 the LDS Church excommunicated those who entered into, or performed, new plural marriages. Even so, many plural <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Japanese-Canadian {{women and}} {{children}} faced {{a specific set of}} challenges that greatly affected their way of life and broke down the social and cultural norms that had developed. Whole families were taken from their homes and separated from each other. <b>Husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> were almost always separated when sent to camps and, less commonly, some mothers were separated from their children as well. Japanese-Canadian families typically had a patriarchal structure, meaning the husband was the centre of the family. Since husbands were often separated from their families, wives were left to reconfigure the structure of the family and the long established divisions of labour that were so common in the Japanese-Canadian household.|$|E

As this rapid transition took place, families lost many of their production functions. Instead, family members had to {{work outside the home}} to support their families.

500|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{called the}} island Mokuumeume ("isle of attraction" [...] or [...] "island of strife"), after the {{ceremony}} (ume) held during the Makahiki festival for married couples who were having difficulty conceiving children. In the Hawaiian language the word moku means to cut or sever in two, {{as well as an}} island or inlet. The word ume means to draw, attract or entice and was used to name the ceremony for the common people. Hawaii historian Herb Kawainui Kāne considered ume to be a courtship game. Those selected for ume (never virgins or the unmarried) would sing around a large bonfire while a tribal leader with a maile (wand) chanted, touching individual men and women. Those who were touched would find a secluded part of the island to have sex. <b>Husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> were not paired, and jealousy was discouraged. Children born of these unions were considered children of the husband, not the biological father. By 1830, this activity was forbidden by Christian missionaries.|$|E
500|$|Many prisoners still {{continued}} {{to come from}} the upper classes, particularly in those cases termed [...] "désordres des familles", or disorders of the family. These cases typically involving members of the aristocracy who had, as historian Richard Andrews notes, [...] "rejected parental authority, disgraced the family reputation, manifested mental derangement, squandered capital or violated professional codes." [...] Their families – often their parents, but sometimes <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> taking action against their spouses – could apply for individuals to be detained at one of the royal prisons, resulting in an average imprisonment of between six months and four years. Such a detention could be preferable to facing a scandal or a public trial over their misdemeanours, and the secrecy that surrounded detention at the Bastille allowed personal and family reputations to be quietly protected. The Bastille was considered one of the best prisons for an upper-class prisoner to be detained at, because of the standard of the facilities for the wealthy. In the aftermath of the notorious [...] "Affair of the Diamond Necklace" [...] of 1786, involving the Queen and accusations of fraud, all the eleven suspects were held in the Bastille, significantly increasing the notoriety surrounding the institution.|$|E
