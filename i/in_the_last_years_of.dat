5|$|Another {{proof of}} the close {{cooperation}} between uncle and nephew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Bolesław the Pious' life is in the events that taken place in mid-1278 (probably in August): Bolesław, using the weakeness of the Margraviate of Brandenburg during the fight between Ottokar II and Rudolph I, in only eight days attacked Neumark and advanced until Myślibórz, where his troops defeated Margrave Otto V the Long.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R

5|$|In the 1930s the city's {{transportation}} system {{was marred by}} violent protests.

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E

5|$|Carroll {{supported}} Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in {{an unsuccessful}} {{effort to prevent}} the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following {{the overthrow of the}} Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars. In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad {{had at least one}} parlor car and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola cars for coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a standard gauge gondola fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its existence.|$|E

Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice.

5|$|Eardwulf (fl. 790– c. 830) {{was king}} of Northumbria from 796 to 806, {{when he was}} deposed and went into exile. He {{may have had a}} second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the eighth century was the scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king Æthelred I {{attempted}} to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may have been viewed as a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by Osbald: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.|$|E

Two other books were published posthumously: Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland in 1900, and Witchcraft and Second Sight in the West Highlands the following year.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874–884) {{resulted in the}} sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress.

There were also large groups of bandits, {{in the size of}} small armies, that ravaged the countryside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Tang, who smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled {{ideas with}} some Muslim leaders who sought {{religious}} harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend Badshah Khan {{suggested that they}} should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer. Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, {{but was unable to}} get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> {{the ninth}} century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred.

Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded {{after the turn of the}} century, and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd's chief lieutenant when Æthelred's health collapsed soon afterwards. Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.|$|E

5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of service{{men and women}} were discharged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} {{officials}} in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the mufti and the qadi. The mufti {{was the chief}} scholar among the ulama (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same mufti for many years {{at a time in}} contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its mufti replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the qadi from Palestine's local ulama, but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the qadi of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi. An agha was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.|$|E
