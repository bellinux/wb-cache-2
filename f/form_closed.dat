500|$|Insect {{wings are}} adult outgrowths of the insect {{exoskeleton}} that enable insects to fly. They are {{found on the}} second and third thoracic segments (the mesothorax and metathorax), and the two pairs are {{often referred to as the}} forewings and hindwings, respectively, though a few insects lack hindwings, even rudiments. [...] The wings are strengthened by a number of longitudinal veins, which often have cross-connections that <b>form</b> <b>closed</b> [...] "cells" [...] in the membrane (extreme examples include the dragonflies and lacewings). The patterns resulting from the fusion and cross-connection of the wing veins are often diagnostic for different evolutionary lineages and can be used for identification to the family or even genus level in many orders of insects.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{versions}} of string theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two flavors of heterotic string theory ( [...] and [...] ). The different theories allow {{different types of}} strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries. For example, the type I theory includes both open strings (which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which <b>form</b> <b>closed</b> loops), while types IIA and IIB include only closed strings. Each of these five string theories arises as a special limiting case of M-theory. This theory, like its string theory predecessors, {{is an example of}} a quantum theory of gravity. It describes a force just like the familiar gravitational force subject to the rules of quantum mechanics.|$|E
500|$|Wrinch {{developed}} this suggestion into a full-fledged model of protein structure. [...] The basic cyclol model {{was laid out}} in her first paper (1936). [...] She noted the possibility that polypeptides might cyclize to <b>form</b> <b>closed</b> rings (true) and that these rings might form internal crosslinks through the cyclol reaction (also true, although rare). [...] Assuming that the cyclol form of the peptide bond could be more stable than the amide form, Wrinch concluded that certain cyclic peptides would naturally make the maximal number of cyclol bonds (such as cyclol 6, Figure 2). [...] Such cyclol molecules would have hexagonal symmetry, if the chemical bonds were taken as having the same length, roughly 1.5Å; for comparison, the N-C and C-C bonds have the lengths 1.42Å and 1.54Å, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Aphids {{have little}} {{protection}} from predators and diseases. Some species interact with plant tissues forming a gall, an abnormal swelling of plant tissue. Aphids can live inside the gall, which provides protection from predators and the elements. A number of galling aphid species {{are known to}} produce specialised [...] "soldier" [...] forms, sterile nymphs with defensive features which defend the gall from invasion. For example, Alexander's horned aphids are a type of soldier aphid that has a hard exoskeleton and pincer-like mouthparts. The soldiers of gall forming aphids also carry out the job of cleaning the gall. The honeydew secreted by the aphids is coated in a powdery wax to form [...] "liquid marbles" [...] that the soldiers roll out of the gall through small orifices. Aphids that <b>form</b> <b>closed</b> galls use the plant's vascular system for their plumbing: the inner surfaces of the galls are highly absorbent and wastes are absorbed and carried away by the plant.|$|E

50|$|For example, Gauss's law {{states that}} an {{electric}} field has sources at positive charges, sinks at negative charges, and neither elsewhere, so electric field lines start at positive charges and end at negative charges.

A gravitational field has no sources, it has sinks at masses, and it has neither elsewhere, gravitational field lines come from infinity and end at masses. A magnetic field has no sources or sinks (Gauss's law for magnetism), so its field lines have no start or end: they can only <b>form</b> <b>closed</b> loops, extend to infinity in both directions, or continue indefinitely without ever crossing itself.|$|E
