5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E

5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis. In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> {{albuminuria}} {{are found}} in offspring of mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Whether or not kidney development is affected by maternal smoking is unknown. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to twice-daily cigarette-smoke and nicotine condensate (1 mg/kg) or vehicle at day 10 of pregnancy until delivery. Results: Exposed offspring {{did not differ from}} control offspring with respect to body weight, kidney weight, albuminuria, and creatinine clearance. Both male and female offspring had <b>higher</b> tail-plethysmographic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> lower mean glomerular volume, podocyte, mesangial-cell, and endothelial-cell number, compared to control offspring. Conclusions: The data document that prenatal exposure to cigarette-smoke condensate containing nicotine influences normal kidney development and could predispose to <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> later in life.

5|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} VAD {{is more common in}} men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> other risk factors, and tend to occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Defensive coping (AC) {{responses}} in urban African males {{have been associated}} with vascular responsiveness, partly explaining autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We therefore aimed to assess whether AC responses facilitate <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> early sub-clinical structural vascular disease via alterations in frequency- and time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) responses. Methods:We included 355 African and Caucasian men and women without pre-existing atrial fibrillation, aged 45 9 years. Significant interaction on main effects (coping ethnicity gender) for left carotid intima media thickness far wall (L-CIMTf) and cross sectional wall area values necessitated selection of AC responders above mean via the Coping Strategy Indicator. We collected B-mode ultrasound L-CIMTf, ambulatory BP andeHRV data. Overnight fasting blood was obtained. Results: Overall, Africans and AC Africans, mostly men, revealed a poorer lifestyle profile, higher prevalence of hypertensive status, disturbed sympathovagal balance and depressed HRV temporal and geometric patterns compared to the Caucasians (P 0. 05). Moderately depressed non-linear and timedomain HRV (SDNN < 100 ms) was prevalent in 28 % of Africans compared to 11 % of Caucasians. A similar trend was shown for the AC African participants (32 %) compared to Caucasians (16 %). Only depressed HRV time-domain (SDNN: adj. R 2 ¼ 0. 34; b ¼ 0. 24; p ¼ 0. 08) and vagal-impaired heart rate responses (RMSSD: adj. R 2 ¼ 0. 28; b ¼ 0. 28; p < 0. 05) were associated with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> early structural vascular changes in AC African men. Conclusion: Defensive coping facilitated autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> sub-clinical structural vascular disease in an African male cohort.

5000|$|Dopamine β-hydroxylase inhibitors like {{disulfiram}} (Antabuse), {{which can}} be used in the treatment of addiction to cocaine and similar dopaminergic drugs as a deterrent drug. The excess dopamine resulting from inhibition of the dopamine β-hydroxylase enzyme increases unpleasant symptoms such as anxiety, <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> restlessness. Disulfiram is not an anticraving agent, because it does not decrease craving for drugs. Instead, positive punishment from its unpleasant effects deters drug consumption.|$|R

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (<b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure),</b> <b>and</b> excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
