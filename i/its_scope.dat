5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and <b>its</b> <b>scope</b> was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and <b>its</b> <b>scope</b> extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E

5|$|As a {{successful}} artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies {{with the doctor}} Marcantonio della Torre. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of <b>its</b> <b>scope</b> and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. The project was left incomplete {{at the time of}} Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's Treatise on painting, published in France in 1632. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded <b>its</b> <b>scope.</b> From producing the hymnbooks Hymns Ancient and Modern (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to jokes that Chadwick was an ecclesiastical Rupert Murdoch. He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient and Modern, and Hymns Ancient and Modern New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E

50|$|ASM {{has been}} in existence, under various names, since 1913, when {{it began as a}} local club in Detroit called the Steel Treaters Club. During World War I, the Steel Treaters Club became the Steel Treating Research Society, with groups in Detroit, Chicago, and Cleveland. After World War I, the Chicago group seceded and formed the American Steel Treaters Society. In 1920 the local {{chapters}} were reunified into the new American Society for Steel Treating (ASST). The society expanded <b>its</b> technical <b>scope</b> beyond steel during the 1920s. In 1933 it became the American Society for Metals (ASM). Gradually the society expanded <b>its</b> geographic <b>scope</b> beyond the U.S. and <b>its</b> technical <b>scope</b> beyond metals to include other materials. It became known as ASM International in 1986. , ASM claims 29,000 members worldwide.|$|R
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting <b>its</b> <b>scope.</b> In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro was {{conceived}} in April 2013 for {{a video game}} development competition, with a prototype version being released freely for web browsers. During the game's conception phase, the developers imposed a set of constraints to limit <b>its</b> <b>scope</b> and ensure the project could reach a finished state. Production of the game continued following the event and an in-development version was released commercially on Linux, OS X, and Windows in August 2014. Mini Metro received its full release on PC platforms in November 2015, and on Android and iOS platforms in October 2016. The game received a positive reception from critics, with praise directed towards its intuitive interface, simple gameplay, and minimalist approach.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyli {{became a}} {{commonly}} used {{name at the}} turn of the century. Paleontologists included both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group. Cope's Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta fell out of use. In 1919, British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae. Embolomerous forms in the Carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms in the Permian, and finally into stereospondyls in the Triassic. More importantly, Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups. The name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed. Swedish paleontologist Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group, narrowing <b>its</b> <b>scope</b> to rhachitomes and stereospondyls. His classification of labyrinthodonts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae.|$|E

5|$|The Green Book was {{published}} locally in New York, but its popularity {{was such that}} from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the United States Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. <b>Its</b> <b>scope</b> expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities {{in most of the}} United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which– unusual for the oil industry at the time– were franchised to African Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{convenient}} {{location of}} these caves near Mumbai, the Western curiosity for the historic Indian culture, {{and the difficulty}} in reaching sites in infrastructure poor Indian subcontinent, made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within <b>its</b> <b>scope.</b> This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded <b>its</b> <b>scope</b> to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, {{and working with the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E
