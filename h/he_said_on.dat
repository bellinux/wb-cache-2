500|$|The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long-planned; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had {{approached}} series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{for a film}} based on the show, but he refused {{for more than a}} year.

[...] <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>on</b> a break from season-four post-production, [...] "To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think This had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure.

500|$|Many {{state legislators}} also seemed unsure {{about whether to}} support the Stanley plan. A press poll of the state House Appropriations Committee showed an 8-to-7 split against the plan, with two members undecided. Support for Stanley's plan came almost {{exclusively}} from the Southside and counties around it, the Tidewater counties, and portions of Southwest Virginia. Much {{of the lack of}} support focused on whether the plan would actually pass court muster as well as halt desegregation. [...] Delegate James McIlhany Thomson, an ardent segregationist, said he believed the Stanley plan would not pass without a pupil assignment program. But on August 24, Garland Gray (whose own position had moved rightward) abandoned support for the pupil assignment plan because it permitted limited integration.

He also said homosexual MPs should sit [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments. At a political rally in 2000, he described gay people as [...] "sick" [...] and said, [...] "I believe those people need medical treatment". During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995, President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions. In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his [...] "anti-gay remarks". A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa's anti-gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker.|$|E
