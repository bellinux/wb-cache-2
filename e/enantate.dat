40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} some estradiol derivatives on the thermal and struc-tural properties of binary mixtures of cholesteryl <b>enantate</b> and cholesteryl myristate. The characterization of the mesophases was made by polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. A considerable shift of the phase transition temperature I!Ch, {{as well as the}} temperature of formation of the SmA phase was observed. Besides phase sequences and phase transition tem-peratures the measurements enabled the determination of some molecular para-meters of the mixtures: the thickness of smectic layers and the longitudinal spacing distance in the cholesteric phase (d) and the average distance between the long axes of neighboring molecules (D) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Different {{nociceptive}} and inflammatory {{responses to}} noxious stimuli in {{male and female}} animals imply that sex hormones may affect on inflammatory factors, induction and intensity of the inflammation. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the effect of testosterone administration on carrageenone induced inflammation in gonadectomized male rats. Materials & methods: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n= 8). 1 -The control rats without receiving any drug or surgical operation. 2 -The sham – operated animals with surgical stress. 3 -The gonadectomized rats, receiving 0. 5 ml vehicle (olive oil) i. p. 4 -The gonadectomized rats, receiving testosterone <b>enantate</b> (6 mg/ 100 gr body weight in 0. 5 ml vehicle i. p.). At the sixth day of gonadectomy operation, inflammation was induced by injection of 1 % carrageenone in the right hind paw of rats. Edematous paw volume as an index of inflammation was determined by immersing it into the mercury container. Weight of paw in the mercury was measured and then the paw volume was calculated in relation to specific gravity of mercury (13. 6 gm/ml). Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS software using ANOVA. Results: The results showed that edematous paw volume significantly was reduced in testosterone <b>enantate</b> administrated gonadectomized rats compared to the control group (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: It can be concluded that high dose of testosterone causes attenuation of inflammatory response. The testosterone anti-inflammatory effect is probably due to inhibition of inflammatory factors (Interleukins) production or decrease in receptors of inflammatory factors.

40|$|Contraceptive progestogens have {{a series}} of effects on the {{endometrium}} that depend on the existence of oestrogen priming and therefore on the time of administration, the route through which the hormone is released to the body (systemic or locally in utero) and the available daily dose. The effects of a contraceptive progestogen can be divided into two main categories: changes in the endometrial structure and vascularization and alterations of the menstrual bleeding pattern. Whereas orally administered progestogens usually cause endometrial decidualization and an important stromal reaction, the i. m., or local, intrauterine delivery is more apt to cause atrophia. Finally, all progestogens, when given alone at contraceptive doses (and irrespective of their mechanism of action), cause some disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. This is maximal with injectable, long-acting progestogens, such as depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone <b>enantate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine if endogenous kinins are involved in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and renal function in conscious rats given deoxycorticosterone <b>enantate</b> (DOC, 25 mg kg − 1, s. c., weekly) or vehicle for two weeks. The bradykinin B 2 -receptor antagonist, d-Arg[Hyp 3,Thi 5,d-Tic 7,Oic 8]-bradykinin (Hoe 140), at a dose of 300 μg kg − 1, s. c., blocked the hypotensive effect of 300 ng kg − 1 bradykinin i. a., but it did not alter the blood pressure lowering action of 300 ng kg − 1 acetylcholine or prostaglandin E 2. Inhibition of the response to bradykinin persisted up to 6 h after the administration of Hoe 140. Administration of 300 μg kg − 1 Hoe 140 s. c. four times a day did not alter mean blood pressure, renal blood flow, or renal function in rats given DOC-vehicle. However, it decreased urinary volume by 70...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the involvement of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons on salt intake control in the rat, following capsaicin neonatal treatment. Capsaicin did not affect salt appetite induced by intramuscular injection of deoxycorticosterone <b>enantate,</b> or by intracranial injection of renin. Moreover, it did not alter salt preference of rats given access {{to a variety of}} NaCl concentrations, or the need-free salt intake of multidepleted male rats. On the other hand, in response to furosemide-induced sodium depletion, the salt intake of capsaicin-treated rats was lower than that of controls. However, furosemide-induced Na+ excretion of capsaicin-treated rats proved to be lower than that of controls, thus suggesting that difference in salt intake might be secondary to lower sensitivity of capsaicin-treated rats to the natriuretic action of furosemide. Salt intake is known to be influenced by sensory information from the oral cavity, from the liver and from the intravascular compartment. The absence of effect of capsaicin neonatal treatment suggests that sensory fibers relevant to salt intake control may not be capsaicin sensitive. On the other hand, our findings indicate that capsaicin treatment alte...|$|E
40|$|Justification and Objectives: The {{reasons for}} the choice of {{contraceptive}} methods in Lomé were in-sufficiently documented. The current study aimed to identify preferential contraceptive methods in women in Lomé and the {{reasons for the}} choices. Materials and Methods: Prospective study con-ducted on 734 clients recruited in five family planning centers in the municipality of Lomé over a period of 3 months (30 th September to 30 th December 2005). Data were collected by direct inter-view and processed by Excel and Epi info 7 software. Results: Contraceptive methods preferred in descending order were: Medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (51. 6 %), Norethisterone <b>enantate</b> injection (17. 3 %), inert Intra Uterine Device (12. 0 %), Progestogen implants (11. 0 %), combined oral pills (8. 03 %) and spermicide jelly (0. 1 %). The main reasons for choices were the method’s re-versibility (32. 56 %) and its long acting property; especially in illiterate women (p < 10 − 10). Friends and medical staff counted for the choice in 9. 26 %. In 76. 87 % of cases, the husbands were reported to agree with the chosen methods.

40|$|An overactivation of a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionate (AMPA) /kainate receptors {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathophysiology}} of oligodendrocyte damage in demyelinating disorders of the CNS. We decided to {{examine the effect of}} testosterone on excitotoxic death of oligodendrocytes because a gender difference exists in the incidence and disease course of multiple sclerosis. Short-term pure cultures of oligodendrocytes (4 days in vitro) were exposed to a brief pulse with kainate or AMPA + cyclothiazide for the induction of excitotoxicity. Exposure to testosterone <b>enantate</b> was slightly toxic per se and amplified both AMPA and kainate toxicity. Testosterone treatment induced all gene targets of p 53, and amplified the induction of these genes induced by kainate. The effect of testosterone was mediated by the activation of androgen receptors and was resistant to the aromatase inhibitors, DL-aminoglutethimide and 4 -hydroxyandrost- 4 -ene- 3, 17 -dione. Testosterone treatment also potentiated the stimulation of 45 Ca 2 + influx induced by AMPA + cyclothiazide or kainate without changing the expression of the glutamate receptor (GluR) 1, - 2 / 3, and - 4 subunits of AMPA receptors or the GluR 6 / 7 subunits of kainate receptors. We conclude that testosterone amplifies excitotoxic damage of oligodendrocytes acting at an early step of the death cascade triggered by AMPA/kainate receptors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Nociception and {{behavioral}} responses to noxious stimuli {{are different in}} males and females. It seems that these differences are due {{to the effects of}} sex hormones on the pain mechanisms. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of testosterone administration on nociception by formalin test in gonadectomized rats. Material & Methods: In this study 32 male wistar rats were divided into four groups (n= 8) the control rats without receiving any drug or surgical operation, the sham – operated animals with surgical stress, the gonadectomized rats receiving 0. 5 ml vehicle (olive oil) i. p., and the gonadectomized rats receiving testosterone <b>enantate</b> (6 mg/ 100 gr body weight in 0. 5 ml vehicle i. p.). On the sixth day after gonadectomy operation, formalin test was done in all rats. Pain scores in formalin test were statistically analyzed by SPSS and ANOVA. Results: The results showed that testosterone caused an increase in pain score in acute phase of formalin test in gonadectomized rats compared with sham-operated group (p< 0. 001). However, pain score in chronic phase was significantly reduced in testosterone received rats (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: It can be concluded that testosterone increases nociception in acute phase of formalin test in gonadectomized rats. On the other hand, testosterone relieved pain during chronic phase. Anti-nociceptive effects of testosterone in chronic phase may be through central nervous system by interacting with endogenous pain modulatory system...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} indirect molecular biomarkers of anabolic treatments in veal calves, an animal experiment was performed using two combinations of growth promoters (consisting of boldenone undecylenate and estradiol benzoate, and of testosterone <b>enantate</b> and estradiol benzoate). We selected a set of 12 genes that {{are known to be}} androgen responsive in other mammalian species. The expression profile of this set of genes was analysed on prostate samples of veal calves using a real-time RTPCR approach. For each selected gene the corresponding bovine sequence was obtained and a gene specific real-time assay was optimised and validated. The amplification was shown to be highly specific, linear and efficient. High reproducibility (< 1 %) and low-test variability (< 2. 5 %) were also been achieved. Messenger RNA levels were quantified in prostate samples, non-parametric analysis of variance showed significant up-regulation of three genes (MAF, ESR 1 and AR) and significant down-regulation of four genes (HMGCS 1, HPGD, DBI, and LIM) in treated samples when compared with untreated controls. To assess the possibility of identifying hormone-treated animals by molecular means we performed a discriminant analysis that was effective in classifying treated and non-treated samples with an accuracy of 93 %. Our results indicate that identification of treatment with steroid hormones in veal calves by means of gene expression analysis is a feasible approach and could be improved increasing both the number of genes and the number of controls analysed...|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 1 – 11 A {{multicentre}} phase III {{clinical trial}} has been undertaken to compare norethisterone <b>enantate</b> (NET-EN) given by two different treatment regimens and depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). After 18 months of observation, preliminary findings are reported for 1, 589 women who received DMPA 150 mg every 90 days; 790 women who received NET-EN 200 mg every 60 days; and 796 women who received NET-EN, 200 mg every 60 days for 6 months, then 200 mg every 84 days. The overall discontinuation rates per 100 women were similar {{for all three}} treatment groups over the 18 months observation (61. 8 – 63. 5 per 100 women). The discontinuation rates for bleeding problems and for personal reasons were also similar for all three treatment groups. However, terminations due to amenorrhoea were significantly higher among DMPA users (12. 1 and 17. 4 per 100 women at 12 and 18 months) as compared with both NET-EN groups (6. 8 – 8. 2 per 100 women at 12 months and 10. 4 – 10. 9 per 100 women at 18 months). The only significant difference in pregnancy rates observed between the three groups was a higher rate at 18 months among NET-EN (84 days) users (1. 6 per 100 women), as compared with DMPA users (0. 2 per 100 women). There was no overall {{significant difference between the}} two NET-EN groups, although between the 6 and 18 month's follow-up when the two NET-EN regimens diverged, the NET-EN (84 days) users' pregnancy rate rose significantly, wherease in the NET-EN (60 days) group the pregnancy rate did not change. There was a significantly higher weight gain in those subjects using NET-EN at 60 -day intervals compared with those using it at 84 -day intervals...|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 1 – 20 Final {{results are}} {{presented}} from a two-year WHO multinational comparative trial of three regimens: depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) given at 90 -day intervals, norethisterone <b>enantate</b> (NET-EN) given at 60 -day intervals for the entire study period (NET-EN (60 -day)), and NET-EN given at 60 -day intervals {{for six months and}} thereafter at 84 -day intervals (NET-EN (84 -day)). 1587 DMPA subjects were observed for 20, 550 woman-months, 789 NET-EN (60 -day) subjects were observed for 10, 361 woman-months, and 796 NET-EN (84 -day) subjects were observed for 10, 331 woman-months. This clinical trial represents the largest clinical trial undertaken on injectable contraceptives. After two years, the pregnancy rate with NET-EN (84 -day) was 1. 4 (± 0. 6 S. E.) per 100 women, as compared with the two-year rates of 0. 4 (± 0. 3 S. E.) per 100 women observed with DMPA and 0. 4 (± 0. 2 S. E.) with NET-EN (60 -day). Both discontinuation rates for amenorrhea and the prevalence of amenorrhea lasting more than 90 days were significantly higher with DMPA than with either NET-EN regimen. Terminations for bleeding problems were similar with the three treatments, despite a better cyclic pattern {{for the first six months}} with the NET-EN regimens. The three treatments were comparable with respect to discontinuation rates for other medical or personal reasons, and for all reasons combined. For family planning programs, NET-EN (60 -day) has the advantage of low pregnancy rates compared to NET-EN (84 -day), and a schedule of administration that does not change. Both NET-EN regimens produce less amenorrhea than DMPA. However, the NET-EN (60 -day) regimen has the logistic and economic disadvantage of requiring more frequent injections. All three injectable regimens compare favourably with oral contraceptives in terms of pregnancy and total continuation rates observed in clinical trial settings...|$|E
