5|$|The game {{opens in}} Paris, {{a day before}} the {{original}} game's start, with journalist Nicole Collard receiving a request {{to go to the}} Palais Royale, to interview a famous media tycoon and potential candidate for President of France, Pierre Carchon. A mime hangs around outside Carchon's home, but Nico ignores him and goes on inside the house. She meets Carchon's wife, Imelda, as well as Carchon, who reveals that he knew Nico's father, Thierry Collard, very well. Soon, there is a noise in the drawing room; Carchon investigates only to be shot. Nico rushes to the scene to see the mime over Pierre's corpse. She is knocked to the ground before she can do anything and wakes up to find Imelda <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> police.|$|E
5|$|Audrey and David begin feuding {{over the}} rights to the salon and Lewis notices that the arguing is taking its toll on Audrey's health. He {{suggests}} they go to Wales for a few days instead. When Audrey serves David with an injunction to try and reclaim her business, an argument breaks out and Audrey suffers a heart attack. Lewis comforts Audrey until the ambulance arrives and stays with her at the hospital. Lewis and Audrey go on holiday. On her return, Audrey reveals to her family that Lewis disappeared from the Eurostar on the way home. Lewis later turns up at the salon to see Audrey and explains that he disappeared because he saw Penny Thornley (Susan Hanson), a woman he once conned. Lewis asks Audrey to run away with him and she agrees. While they are packing, Audrey's family and Penny arrive. Penny reveals that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> police, but Audrey stops her and gives her the money Lewis took. When Nick refuses to give Lewis his job back, Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) hires him to work at The Rovers Return.|$|E
25|$|The Ronnie Johns Half Hour {{was created}} after representatives from Channel 10 saw a {{performance}} of The Third Degree's stage show, and were impressed by the cast and characters. They offered the group the chance to film a pilot. Originally, the cast was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> show The 3rd Degree, after {{the name of their}} performance group. Channel 10, however, liked the idea of Ronnie Johns being the host, so they asked if the show could be renamed after him. In response, The 3rd Degree came up with a title that they felt was ridiculously long, The Ronnie Johns Good Times Campfire Jamboree Half Hour Show (Now on Television). The network shortened it to The Ronnie Johns Half Hour. Despite this, the writers, cast and prop designers try to sneak in The 3rd Degree's logo as much as possible in sketches. For example, football jerseys will have The 3rd Degree as their sponsor.|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to [...] {{had nothing}} to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>The</b> Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now. They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Material for a {{follow-up}} to Pretty. Odd. dates back to at least April 2008, just {{one month after the}} release of the record. Former guitarist and primary songwriter Ryan Ross told NME the band had [...] "nine or ten new songs going right now," [...] which picked up in the same direction of Pretty. Odd. [...] "It was pretty much the same with the last record," [...] bassist Jon Walker said. [...] "We haven't stopped writing songs since we stopped recording Pretty. Odd., because {{we have a lot to}} write about [...] It's sounding 'pretty awesome,' which is probably what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> next record," [...] Ross joked. [...] "We've got quite a few new ideas and songs we've been working on, and we're hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year." [...] The article explained that Walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music. In June 2009, singer Brendon Urie revealed the band had been writing for [...] "roughly half a year now" [...] at Ross' Topanga Canyon, California home, and continued to take the band [...] "further down the sun-dappled, retro-pop path [...] began exploring on Pretty. Odd.": [...] "We've always been a pop band. We've always been fans of pop music, whether it's The Beatles – which is, like, the beginning of pop music – we've always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music." [...] Spencer Smith, drummer, added, [...] "We moved to California since the last record, so that's inspiration. We started surfing, too, so maybe we'll get a little Beach Boys vibe on this one."

60|$|The Vicar <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Angel, {{found him}} dressed and leaning {{out of his}} window. It was a glorious morning, still dewy, and the rising {{sunlight}} slanting round {{the corner of the}} house, struck warm and yellow upon the hillside. The birds were astir in the hedges and shrubbery. Up the hillside--for it was late in August--a plough drove slowly. The Angel's chin rested upon his hands and he did not turn as the Vicar came up to him.|$|E

60|$|We {{were now}} drawing near the hotel, and I felt a certain glow of {{pleasure}} in its gay {{effect on the}} pretty knoll where it stood. In its artless and accidental architecture it was not unlike one of our immense coastwise steamboats. The twilight had thickened to dusk, and the edifice was brilliantly lighted with electrics, story above story, which streamed into the gloom around like the lights of saloon and state-room. The corner of wood making into the meadow hid the station; {{there was no other}} building in sight; the hotel seemed riding at anchor on the swell of a placid sea. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Altrurian's attention to this fanciful resemblance when I remembered that he had not been in our country long enough to have seen a Fall River boat, and I made toward the house without wasting the comparison upon him. But I treasured it up in my own mind, intending some day to make a literary use of it.|$|E
