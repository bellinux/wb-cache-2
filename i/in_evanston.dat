5|$|McGovern {{switched}} from Wesleyan Methodism to less fundamentalist regular Methodism. Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary <b>in</b> <b>Evanston,</b> Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by {{the minutiae of}} his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University <b>in</b> <b>Evanston,</b> where he also worked as a teaching assistant. The relatively small history program there was {{among the best in}} the country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian's {{teams at}} Miami {{consistently}} {{did well in}} the Mid-American Conference, posting a 7–3 record in 1951 and improving to 8–1 the following year. Miami's Redskins (now known as RedHawks) were conference champions in 1954 and in 1955, when they went undefeated. Parseghian's success, which included two wins over larger Big Ten Conference schools, raised his profile nationally as a head coaching prospect. In late 1955, he was hired to coach at Northwestern University <b>in</b> <b>Evanston,</b> Illinois, one of the Big Ten schools Miami had beaten. Parseghian compiled a 39–6–1 record in five seasons at Miami.|$|E
5|$|The First Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905. That {{first race}} began <b>in</b> <b>Evanston</b> and {{finished}} {{in front of}} a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park race track. In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks. With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.|$|E

5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several {{years went by}} without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) <b>in</b> <b>Evanston,</b> Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Rock Springs was stabilized {{as early as}} September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly Finnish immigrants {{who were members of}} the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established <b>in</b> <b>Evanston,</b> and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|Wyoming's {{territorial}} Governor Francis E. Warren visited Rock Springs on September 3, 1885, the {{day after}} the riot, to make a personal assessment. After his trip to Rock Springs, Warren traveled to Evanston, where he sent telegrams to U.S. President Grover Cleveland appealing for federal troops. Back in Rock Springs, the riot had calmed, but the situation was still unstable. Two companies of the United States Army's 7th Infantry arrived on September 5, 1885. One company, under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was stationed <b>in</b> <b>Evanston,</b> Wyoming; the other, under a Colonel Chipman, was stationed in Rock Springs. At Camp Murray, Utah Territory, Colonel Alexander McDowell McCook was ordered to augment the garrison sent to Wyoming with six more companies.|$|E

25|$|Evanston's growth {{occurred}} {{largely because}} of its accessibility from Chicago by rail.
