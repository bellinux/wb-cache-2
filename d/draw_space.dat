40|$|In our approach, {{we propose}} {{to process the}} mean {{arterial}} pressure recordings like a signal but yet do analysis like an image in order to differentiate recordings from patients using pressors to treat their acute hypotension and from patients with no such conditions. Mean arterial pressure values recorded over time is numerical representations over time and hence signal processing techniques {{can be used to}} on such recordings for filtering purposes. Onset of hypotension in a pre-recorded reading, characterized by exhibiting 90 % low mean arterial pressures values anytime within a 30 minutes window, is similar to images exhibiting certain percentage of colours within its <b>draw</b> <b>space.</b> Hence, it can be pattern-matched similarly in image processing using histograms. By combining the 2 methods together, we are able to differentiate the 2 groups of patients for the first event of the Physionet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2009. 1...|$|E

40|$|The work {{activity}} of {{small groups of}} three to four people was videotaped and analyzed {{in order to understand}} collaborative work and to guide the development of tools to support it. The software tools we currently have are often based on a single user model. Even those that are based on multiple user models define structures of interaction that restrict fluid collaboration. We need observe how people collaborate then build software that facilitates collaboration based on those observations, giving the users the toolsi that are “naturally” defined in face-to-face interaction. In this experiment small groups of people were observed in a collaborative design task using a shared <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> Specific features of collaborative {{work activity}} that raise design implications for collaborative technology: 1. collaborators use hand gestures to uniquely communicate significant information 2. the process of creating and using drawings conveys much information not contained in the resulting drawings 3. the <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> is an important resource for the group in mediating their collaboration 4. there is a fluent mix of activity in the <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> 5. the spatial orientation among the collaborators and the <b>drawing</b> <b>space</b> has a role in structuring their activit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{designing}} and generating illustrations that portray a given scene with a single non-intersecting line. In this approach, users partition an image into regions, assigning a type or style to each of them. Next, a grid is generated over the <b>drawing</b> <b>space,</b> based on the parameters specified for each region. The illustration is then obtained {{in the form of a}} path that covers most areas of the grid. Contrary to previous works, our approach allows users to control the overall flow of the line throughout any given region, by providing the means to define tensor fields per region which directly influence the line orientation. We also extend this work for generating continuous line paintings, a similar style consisting of a single line that varies in color and thickness while covering the entire <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> This is achieved by transforming drawings obtained with the above mentioned approach through a Voronoi-based strategy...|$|R

Because of this reason, the meeting series in the gallery is titled ‘Chess games’, emphasizing the seemingly ‘gaming’ process occurred in the <b>drawing</b> <b>space,</b> where master protagonists of contemporary architecture play together.|$|R

He is notably one of the greatest printmakers of his time, where it is through this medium in which he demonstrated his mastering of etchings of imagined spaces. It was suggested that the <b>drawn</b> <b>spaces</b> would lose their magic and meaning if they were to be physically built in real life, as they would lose their unique forms of detail and intricacy, which is only achieved through drawings. The particular series of etchings 'Prisons (Carceri d'invenzione) or 'Imaginary Prisons,' depict his famous fictitious and atmospheric etchings of Rome's ancient remains, and his dreams of antiquity that often surpassed reality.|$|R

As these fileformats store the structure and attributes of scenes in a directed acyclic graph, the techniques for drawing rooted trees are suitable but require much <b>drawing</b> <b>space.</b> Therefore we devised a smart, interactive drawing, which uses a detailed view of the current point of interest and an iconic view of subgraphs besides the current point of interest. This interactive method balances detail and overview much better than classic techniques to cope with limited space like fisheye views. Concerning implementation it is easy to implement with a small LOC count (in Java). ...|$|R
