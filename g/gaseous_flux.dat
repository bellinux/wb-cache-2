Argon is the most common shielding gas, often used with some adds of other gases that can be inert, as helium, or active, as CO 2, O 2 or H 2. In this work the effects of mixtures with different composition have been considered for the arc welding of austenitic steels.

40|$|Peatlands play an {{important}} role in the global carbon cycle. With rising levels of CO 2 and CH 4 in the atmosphere, a greater understanding of the controls on the flux of these gases from peatlands is important. In recent years, many peatlands have undergone restoration in attempts to reverse the damage caused by drainage. Therefore, the long-term effects of restoration on CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes are poorly understood. Peatland management strategies need to take the long-term responses of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> into account, and several hypotheses on these responses have been developed, despite the lack of data in this area. Thorne and Hatfield Moors, two lowland raised bogs in Eastern England were subjected to drainage and peat extraction over several centuries. Restoration has occurred in stages on these peatlands (1997, 2003 - 2005, 2008), and there is also an area where restoration has not yet occurred, providing an excellent space-for-time substitution. Data showed that CH 4 fluxes were significantly larger at the two older sites in comparison to the younger site. Net ecosystem exchange and values of global warming potential were all positive (release to the atmosphere), and on average were larger at the two older sites in comparison with the unrestored site. Diurnal variations in <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> were also explored. Methane fluxes were significantly larger at night-time from areas dominated by Eriophorum spp., which suggests that CH 4 fluxes measured during the daytime could be underestimations. Carbon dioxide fluxes measured at night-time were larger than any of the daytime measurements of ecosystem respiration, where night-time conditions were simulated using a shroud to block the light. Therefore, ecosystem respiration measurements taken during the daytime could be underestimations. Sphagnum cuspidatum samples showed no evidence of a symbiosis with methanotrophs. Neither drought nor submergence of the Sphagnum sub-samples had any significant effect on rates of methanotrophy. However, drought had a significant effect on rates of methanogenesis, with higher rates from sub-samples that had been allowed to dry out...|$|R

The cathodic performance was improved over uniform electrodes at intermediate {{and high levels of}} polarization when the Nafion content in the GDE was higher toward the catalyst layer/membrane interface and lower toward the catalyst layer/carbon paper interface since this maximizes proton transport in the GDE in the region of greatest ion flux and maximizes porosity in the region of greatest <b>gaseous</b> <b>flux,</b> respectively.

40|$|Abstract Brazing {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} in the field of joining of metal components. To improve the wetting of brazing material and work-piece surface, it is often required to fall back on the use of flux. The application of these substances requires accuracy and is often connected with considerable expenditure and it is, just as the removal of flux residues, often an additional working step which has to be carried out manually. Within the framework of a DFG research project it has been investigated to which degree gaseous substances as addition to the shielding gas may replace conventional flux in TIG arc brazing. To this end, investigations have been carried out using different combinations of base and filler materials. Mainly monosilane as a <b>gaseous</b> <b>flux</b> substitute has been added in low concentrations to the shielding gas volume flow. The resulting brazed joints have been quantified with regard to their geometry, their fusion conditions and their chemical compositions.

The paper studies suprathermal rotation caused by H$_{ 2 }$ formation and the alignment that takes place due to crossover events. Gaseous bombardment {{in the course of}} a crossover as well as both gaseous friction and poisoning of active sites are shown to produce alignment. The first type of alignment happens due to the angular momentum deposited by a corpuscular flux with a grain, the second is caused by the change of the mean time back to crossover due to the interaction with a <b>gaseous</b> <b>flux.</b> We show that the two processes act as to decrease the grain cross section in respect to the flux and we find the Rayleigh reduction factor for the joint action of the two processes as well as the range of applicability of each of the processes. Our study indicates that mechanical alignment can be more widely spread than it is generally accepted. Comment: 39 pages, uuencoded Postcript, Accepted to Ap...|$|E

The results presented are from the application of the model to a membrane reactor that is introduced in an IGCC plant, to control carbon dioxide emissions. The performance of this reactor equipped with highly selective membranes is studied in detail. The thermal phenomena that take place in the interior of the membrane reactor have a considerable influence on the operation of the reactor thus the assumption of isothermal operation is not valid. The omission of thermal dispersion results on the underestimation of the system operation and the total <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> that permeate through the membrane.

PCB congener pattern was used to illustrate the spatial differences, as shown by principal component analysis (PCA). The relationship to different soil parameters was studied. PCB concentrations in soil showed a large variation between sampling-areas with median concentrations ranging between 2. 3 and 332 ng g(- 1) (dw). Highest {{concentrations were}} found at two sites with sandy soils, one with extremely high organic carbon content. Both sites were located {{on the west coast}} of southern Sweden. Soils with similar soil textures (i. e. sandy silt moraine) did not show any significant differences in PCB concentrations. PCB congener composition was shown to differ between sites, with congener patterns almost site-specific. PCB in air and precipitation was measured and the transfer of chemicals between the soil and air compartments was estimated. Soil-air fugacity quotient calculations showed that the PCBs in the soil consistently had a higher fugacity than the PCBs in the air, with a median quotient value of 2. 7. The <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> between soil and air were estimated using standard modelling equations and a net soil-air flux estimated by subtracting bulk deposition from <b>gaseous</b> soil-air <b>fluxes.</b> It was shown that inclusion of vertical sorbed phase transport of PCBs in the soil had a large effect on the direction of the net soil-air exchange fluxes...|$|R

Average mercury fluxes from aquatic landscapes ranged from 0. 0 to 5. 0 ng m⁻² h⁻¹ with total mercury concentration in water ranging from 0. 3 to 6. 5 ng L⁻¹.

Enrichments for neutrophilic, putatively lithotrophic Fe-oxidizing bacteria were successful on roots from all four species; acidophilic Fe-oxidizing bacteria were enriched only on roots from plants whose root systems were exposed to soil solutions with a pH of < 4.

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are ubiquitous contaminants characterized by semi-volatility, low water solubility, high lipophilicity and inherent toxicity. A {{combination of these}} properties results in long-rang transport, bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food webs. Elimination of the production, use and emissions of these POPs has been ongoing since the 1970 s. However, the levels of some POPs are still unacceptably high {{in some parts of}} the environment and due to their high persistence levels only decline very slowly over a long period of time. This is especially true for POPs in the Baltic Sea due to long water residence time of approximately 40 years. Numerous studies have been carried out to explore the behavior and fate of the POPs in Baltic regions using analytical methods or modeling approaches. Air-soil exchange plays an important role in controlling the environmental fate of POPs in surface media. Air is a transport medium, which spreads chemicals far away from sources. Soils have received an input of POPs from the atmosphere over a long time period. These chemicals have accumulated in soil solids and, as primary emissions are released, can potentially be rereleased to other environmental media. Therefore, soil could become a significant "secondary" source of some POPs to the air. In this study, the aim was to determine if volatilization and/or resuspension are potential sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs/Fs) ("dioxins") to Baltic air. Sources of these compounds to Baltic air are particularly interesting because levels of dioxins in fatty fish in the Baltic exceed the levels that are considered fit for human consumption in the European Union guideline. The fugacity quotient approach has been previously shown to be a useful method for exploring the equilibrium status of two connected environmental compartments. Fugacity quotients between the atmosphere and soil are calculated for seventeenth toxic 2, 3, 7, 8,-substituted dioxin congeners. A multimedia mass balance model designed for the Baltic Sea region (POPCYCLING-Baltic) is also employed to study the long-term exchange between air and soil. Estimated fugacity ratios from model simulations are compared with calculated fugacity quotients. Moreover, sensitive analysis is undertaken in order to evaluate the relative effect of background concentration, resuspension and bioturbation transport to the transfer flux from soil to air. Master’s Thesis 2011 II Fugacities of dioxins in soil are additionally measured directly using equilibrium passive sampling devices. Among available passive samplers, polyoxymethylene 17 μm (POM- 17) are chosen to absorb freely dissolved PCDD/Fs molecules in soil. Total soil concentrations are measured to provide input data for the POPCYCLING-Baltic multimedia fate and transport model. Estimated fugacities of dioxins will be compared with directly "measured" fugacities in soil. The predictive ability of the model is assesses by comparing estimated and "measured" fugacity. Calculated fugacity quotients showed that lower chlorinated dibenzofuran are close to equilibrium between soil and air while other congeners show disequilibrium. Estimated soil/air fugacity ratios are higher than one but soil still accumulates dioxins because transport process is very slow and non-equilibrium can be maintained for a long period of time. Due to the seasonal variation in concentration, volatilization is higher in summer than in winter. Therefore, net <b>gaseous</b> <b>flux</b> between soil and air can be observed in summer. Sensitivity analysis revealed that volatilization flux is proportional to background soil concentration. High background soil concentration results in high volatilization fluxes and vice versa. The simulation showed that the contribution of resuspension flux to air pollution levels is relatively small in comparison to the influence of variation in background soil concentration. If relatively high and unrealistic resuspension velocities are used as inputs in the model, resuspension is a significant source to the atmosphere. In contrast to background soil concentration and resuspension, bioturbation has no effect on volatilization flux even though high bioturbation rates are used as model inputs. In conclusion, except for light congeners, soil is still a sink of PCDD/Fs present in Baltic air. However, the increase in soil/air fugacity ratios suggest an increasing important of soil-to-air transport in the near future. Equilibrium passive samplers using POM strips are considered as a very simple, reproducible, and inexpensive partitioning method. However, the largest disadvantage of using passive samplers for dioxins is the long time to reach equilibrium. It takes 6 months for PCDD/Fs to obtain equilibrium between soil and POM strips, which exceeded the time for doing a 45 credit thesis. The analytical phase of the experiment is still on-going, and thus it was not possible to include the experimental results in this study. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gaseous</b> {{exchange}} <b>fluxes</b> of {{organochlorine pesticides}} (OCPs) across the air-water interface {{of the coastal}} East China Sea were determined {{in order to assess}} whether the contaminated plume of the Yangtze River could be an important regional source of OCPs to the atmosphere. Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordane compounds (CHLs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) were the most frequently detected OCPs in air and water. Air-water exchange was mainly characterized by net volatilization for all measured OCPs. The net <b>gaseous</b> exchange <b>flux</b> ranged 10 - 240 ng/(m(2). day) for gamma-HCH, 60 - 370 ng/(m(2). day) for trans-CHL, 97 - 410 ng/(m(2). day) for cis-CHL, and similar to 0 (e. g., equilibrium) to 490 ng/(m(2). day) for p,p'-DDE. We found that the plume of the large contaminated river can serve as a significant regional secondary atmospheric source of legacy contaminants released in the catchment. In particular, the sediment plume represented the relevant source of DDT compounds (especially p,p'-DDE) sustaining net degassing when clean air masses from the open ocean reached the plume area. In contrast, a mass balance showed that, for HCHs, contaminated river discharge (water and sediment) plumes were capable of sustaining volatilization throughout the year. These results demonstrate the inconsistencies in the fate of HCHs and DDTs in this large estuarine system with declining primary sources. <b>Gaseous</b> exchange <b>fluxes</b> of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) across the air-water interface of the coastal East China Sea were determined in order to assess whether the contaminated plume of the Yangtze River could be an important regional source of OCPs to the atmosphere.

40|$|Nonpoint source {{pollution}} from agriculture and urbanization is increasing globally {{at the same}} time climate extremes have increased in frequency and intensity. We review 3 ̆e 200 studies of hydrologic and <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> and show how the interaction between land use and climate variability alters magnitude and frequency of carbon, nutrient, and greenhouse gas pulses in watersheds. Agricultural and urban watersheds respond similarly to climate variability due to headwater alteration and loss of ecosystem services to buffer runoff and temperature changes. Organic carbon concentrations/exports increase and organic carbon quality changes with runoff. Nitrogen and phosphorus exports increase during floods (sometimes by an order of magnitude) and decrease during droughts. Relationships between annual runoff and nitrogen and phosphorus exports differ across land use. CH 4 and N 2 O pulses in riparian zones/floodplains predominantly increase with: flooding, warming, low oxygen, nutrient enrichment, and organic carbon. CH 4, N 2 O, and CO 2 pulses in streams/rivers increase due to similar factors but effects of floods are less known compared to base flow/droughts. Emerging questions include: (1) What factors influence lag times of contaminant pulses in response to extreme events? (2) What drives resistance/resilience to hydrologic and gaseous pulses? We conclude with eight recommendations for managing watershed pulses in response to interactive effects of land use and climate change...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} flow over forested hills have been {{motivated}} {{by a number of}} important applications including understanding CO 22 and other <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> over forests in complex terrain, predicting wind damage to trees, and modelling wind energy potential at forested sites. Current modelling studies have focussed almost exclusively on highly idealized, and usually fully forested, hills. Here, we present model results for a site on the Isle of Arran, Scotland with complex terrain and heterogeneous forest canopy. The model uses an explicit representation of the canopy and a 1. 5 -order turbulence closure for flow within and above the canopy. The validity of the closure scheme is assessed using turbulence data from a field experiment before comparing predictions of the full model with field observations. For near-neutral stability, the results compare well with the observations, showing that such a relatively simple canopy model can accurately reproduce the flow patterns observed over complex terrain and realistic, variable forest cover, {{while at the same time}} remaining computationally feasible for real case studies. The model allows closer examination of the flow separation observed over complex forested terrain. Comparisons with model simulations using a roughness length parametrization show significant differences, particularly with respect to flow separation, highlighting the need to explicitly model the forest canopy if detailed predictions of near-surface flow around forests are required...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological fluxes in lowland peatlands can be {{challenging}} to measure but they drive poorly understood aquatic carbon fluxes which may form {{an important part of}} the overall carbon budget for peatlands. In this study we examined 11 lowland peatland sites across some of the most important fen and raised bog complexes in England and Wales including agricultural peatlands, mining sites and restoration sites. These were intensively monitored between January 2013 and December 2015. The monitoring included continual hydrological measurements and regular sampling for dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. These data were used to calculate the amount of water flowing out of each site and the total aquatic carbon loss. In addition, the hydrological data were used to provide contextual data to explain carbon flux variations between sites and help explain and model variations in <b>gaseous</b> carbon <b>fluxes.</b> The hydrology of all these lowland peat sites is typically complex with most having been drained, which when combined with their relatively flat gradients results in most having no clear single outlet. In addition the drainage networks are often used to not only drain water during periods of excess rainfall but also to maintain raised water tables during summer months when rainfall totals are low. As a result, aquatic losses were determined using a mixture of water mass balance approaches (e. g. using flux tower evapotranspiration data) and groundwater flow monitoring. The hydrology of the 11 sites was found to vary considerably, even between co-located sites, however as might be expected given the west-east rainfall gradient observed in the UK, discharge was typically highest at the Anglesey Fens sites (western Wales) and lowest at the East Anglian Fens sites (eastern England). One influence on the observed differences in discharge was the impact of vegetation type on evapotranspiration rates, with sites with high ET having some of the lowest discharge. Compared to <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluxes,</b> aquatic carbon fluxes made a smaller but significant contribution to overall rates of carbon loss, with the ‘reactive’ aquatic C flux accounting for 2 - 26 % of NEE. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) made the largest contribution. Concentrations of DOC were generally high, with all sites having mean concentrations greater than 20 mg L- 1. DOC fluxes ranged from just 4 g C m- 2 yr- 1 up to 67 g C m- 2 yr- 1 being more variable than concentrations due to the wide variation in discharge from the different sites. Fluxes were highest from the raised bog sites and lowest from the fen site...|$|R

All sites exhibit a consistent pattern of supersaturation throughout the year, which is broadly related to hydrological and temperature changes between spring snowmelt and autumn freezing. Both measurements and estimates of CO 2 and CH 4 evasion from open {{water to the}} atmosphere suggest that parts of the catchment (including beaver dams) are significant degassing hot spots. We present data showing how vertical <b>gaseous</b> carbon <b>fluxes</b> compare with lateral carbon fluxes and make an initial estimate of the importance to the overall carbon budget of CO 2 and CH 4 evasion to the atmosphere from water surfaces at Mer Bleue.

Three plants have been selected as study objects and a total of six measurement campaigns have been performed, one intercalibration campaign and five flux evaluation campaigns, in both winter and summer. The measurements were carried out using the Swedish optical parametric oscillator-(OPO) based mobile lidar system developed at Lund Institute of Technology. The study shows large differences in the mercury emissions measured in winter or summer and at the different plants. The average values for the campaigns ranged from 6 g h(- 1) in the winter campaign at the Swedish plant to 54 g h(- 1) in the summer campaign at the Italian plant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High {{latitude}} wetlands play {{an important}} role for the surface-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4), but fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) in these ecosystems have to date not been extensively studied. This is despite BVOC representing a measurable proportion of the total <b>gaseous</b> C <b>fluxes</b> at northern locations and {{in the face of the}} high temperature sensitivity of these systems that requires a much improved process understanding to interpret and project possible changes in response to climate warming. We measured emission of isoprene and photosynthetic gas exchange over two growing seasons (2005 – 2006) in a subarctic wetland in northern Sweden with the objective to identify the physiological and environmental controls of these fluxes on the leaf scale. The sedge species Eriophorum angustifolium and Carex rostrata were both emitters of isoprene. Springtime emissions were first detected after an accumulated diurnal mean temperature above 0 ◦C of about 100 degree days. Maximum measured growing season standardized (basal) emissio...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to measure the mass flux in the far field of a nozzle plume in a high vacuum with emphasis on the back flow region. The measurements presented in this report provide fairly accurate data for off-axis angles as large as 140 deg (i. e., the back flow region). The tests utilized five different nozzles. Parameters such as expansion ratio, throat diameter, nozzle lip shape, and plenum (chamber) pressure were varied. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases were passed through, and mass flux measurements were taken using quartz crystal microbalances {{in as many as}} nine different locations relative to the test nozzle. The tests resulted in a large matrix of data that were correlated and compared to existing prediction theories. Several conclusions with respect to the effect of nozzle and gas parameters on the amount of back flow mass flux are offered, and it was demonstrated that <b>gaseous</b> mass <b>fluxes,</b> which are not predictable by present theories, are encountered in the region behind the nozzle exit plane...|$|R
40|$|Coastal wetland areas {{occupy a}} small {{percentage}} of the terrestrial environment yet are extremely productive regions which support rapid rates of below ground bacterial activity. Wetlands appear to be significant as biogenic sources of gaseous sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen. These gases are important as tracers of man's activities, and they influence atmospheric chemistry. The interactions among wetland biogeochemical processes regulate the anaerobic production of reduced gases and influence the fate of these volatiles. Therefore, spatial and temporal variations in hydrology, salinity, temperature, and speciation and growth of vegetation affect the type and magnitude of gas emissions thus hindering predictive estimates of gas flux. The research is divided into two major parts, the first is the biogeochemical characterization of a selected tidal wetland area in terms of factors likely to regulate sulfide flux; the second is a direct measurement of <b>gaseous</b> sulfur <b>flux</b> as related to changes in these biogeochemical conditions. Variant factors affecting sulfide flux include the wetlands' tidal range, seasonal salinity, and other hydrological conditions, grass species and plant growth, soil composition, and microbial activity...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of organic}} soils by {{agriculture}} involves drainage and tillage, {{and the resulting}} increase in C and N turnover can significantly affect their greenhouse gas balance. This study estimated annual fluxes of CH 4 and N 2 O, and ecosystem respiration (R eco), from eight organic soils managed by agriculture. The sites were located in three regions representing different landscape types and climatic conditions, and three land use categories (arable crops, AR, grass in rotation, RG, and permanent grass, PG) were covered. The normal management at each site was followed, except that no N inputs occurred during the monitoring period from August 2008 to October 2009. The stratified sampling strategy further included six sampling points in three blocks at each site. Environmental variables (precipitation, PAR, air and soil temperature, soil moisture, groundwater level) were monitored continuously and during sampling campaigns, where also groundwater samples were taken for analysis. <b>Gaseous</b> <b>fluxes</b> were monitored on a three-weekly basis, giving 51, 49 and 38 field campaigns for land use categories AR, PG and RG, respectively. Climatic conditions in each region during monitoring were representative based on 20 -yr averages. Peat layers were shallow, typically 0. 5 to 1 m, and with a pH of 4 – 5. At six sites annual emissions of N 2 O were in the range 3 to 24 kg N 2 O-N ha − 1, but at two arable sites (spring barley, potato) net emissions of 38 and 61 kg N 2 O-N ha − 1 were recorded. Both were characterized by fluctuating groundwater with elevated SO 4 2 − concentrations. Annual fluxes of CH 4 were generally small, as expected, ranging from – 2 to 4 kg CH 4 ha − 1. However, two permanent grasslands had tussocks of Juncus effusus (soft rush) in sampling points that were consistent sources of CH 4 throughout the year. Emission factors for organic soils in rotation and permanent grass, respectively, were estimated to be 0. 011 and 0. 47 g m − 2 for CH 4, and 2. 5 and 0. 5 g m − 2 for N 2 O. This first documentation of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from managed organic soils in Denmark confirms the levels and wide ranges of emissions previously reported for this region. However, the factorial approach also identified links between gaseous emissions and site-specific conditions with respect to soil, groundwater and vegetation which point to areas of future research that may account {{for part of the}} variability and hence lead to improved emission factors or models...|$|R

They are then {{compared to other}} atmospheric depositional mechanisms on a global scale. Additional features not treated in traditional studies are addressed such as contaminant adsorption onto raindrops and enhancement of dry <b>gaseous</b> diffusive <b>fluxes</b> due to rain-induced turbulence. Wet deposition estimates show a high spatial and seasonal variability, with maxima located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in low-temperature regions. Seasonal variability reflects the northward shift of ITCZ in July. Average wet deposition fluxes estimated for the Atlantic Ocean {{in this study are}} 110 and 45 ng m- 2 yr- 1 for ΣPCB and ΣPCDD/Fs, respectively. Furthermore, the total wet deposition to the Atlantic results in 4100 kg yr- 1 (ΣPCB) and 2500 kg yr- 1 (ΣPCDD/Fs). Model validation shows good agreement with available coastal data measurements of wet deposition fluxes. When compared to other atmospheric depositional mechanisms and during precipitation events, wet deposition is found to be dominant. However, when raining events and non-raining time periods are integrated, air−water diffusive exchange fluxes acquire an important role, which can be dominant in some regions and for some POPs...|$|R
40|$|Salt marshes are ecologically {{sensitive}} ecosystems where mercury (Hg) methylation and biomagnification can occur. Understanding {{the mechanisms}} controlling <b>gaseous</b> Hg <b>flux</b> from salt marshes {{is important to}} predict the retention of Hg in coastal wetlands and project the impact of environmental change on the global Hg cycle. We monitored Hg flux from a remote salt marsh over 9 days which included three cloudless days and a 4 mm rainfall event. We observed a cyclical diel relationship between Hg flux and solar radiation. When measurements at the same irradiance intensity are considered, Hg flux was greater in the evening when the sediment was warm than {{in the morning when}} the sediment was cool. This is evidence to suggest that both solar radiation and sediment temperature directly influence the rate of Hg(II) photoreduction in salt marshes. Hg flux could be predicted from solar radiation and sediment temperature in sub-datasets collected during cloudless days (R 2 = 0. 99), and before (R 2 = 0. 97) and after (R 2 = 0. 95) the rainfall event, but the combined dataset could not account for the lower Hg flux observed after the rainfall event that is in contrast to greater Hg flux from soils after rainfall events...|$|R
