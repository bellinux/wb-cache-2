40|$|We {{evaluated}} the nutritional quality of dry food <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>dogs,</b> checking whether the label information was {{in agreement with}} the law and with the analyses, and also whether the suggested intake reached the nutritional requirements of adult dogs. Eighteen samples of commercial feed, eight of the economical type and 10 of the premium type, were purchased and analyzed. Regarding the product descriptions, only 12. 5 and 10 % (moisture), 87. 5 and 70 % (CP), 25 and 20 % (AHEE), 0 and 0 % (MM), 12. 5 and 40 % (Ca) and 0 and 20 % (P) of the economical and premium foods, respectively, were in conformity according to the label.

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test was used to analyse 40 dog–owner pairs in order to assess whether owners can represent a secure base for their dogs. The Wilcoxon test revealed significant differences between owner and stranger for protest at separation (whining), contact maintenance effect (proximity, attention seeking and physical contact) and secure base effect (exploration, individual play and social play). The results suggest that dogs behave similarly to children towards the mothers and to chimpanzees towards human caretakers in the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test: owners are the preferred recipient of affiliative behaviours and, in their absence, dogs show behaviours indicative of distress. After reunion with the owner, dogs show an increase in social behaviours towards him/her. Dogs did not show fear of the stranger, and it was regarded as a normal behaviour <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> well-socialized <b>dogs.</b> Until now whether owners represented a secure base for their dogs was debated, due to controversial results.

Only 28 % of dogs and 9 % of cats were microchipped, and a substantial proportion (37 %) had problems with their data, including being registered to a previous owner or organisation (47 %), all phone numbers incorrect/disconnected (29 %), and the microchip not registered (14 %). A higher proportion of owners could be contacted when the microchip had no problems, compared to those with problems (dogs, 93 % vs. 70 %; cats, 75 % vs. 41 %). The proportion of animals reclaimed declined significantly between microchipped animals with no data problems, microchipped animals with data problems and non-microchipped animals— 87 %, 69 %, and 37 %, respectively, for dogs and 61 %, 33 %, and 5 %, respectively, for cats.

40|$|Temperament {{tests have}} been created by a range of {{organizations}} and individuals {{in order to assess}} useful, predictable behavioral tendencies in working dogs and, increasingly, in companion dogs. For the latter group, such tests may help to select suitable pets from rescue centers or to identify those already in the population that are, or are likely to be, unsuitable as pets (e. g., those with behavior problems involving aggression). Unfortunately, many of these tests seem to have been developed without a systematic scientific approach. Perhaps as a result there are few reports of these tests in the scientific literature and even fewer that fully report their reliability and specific aspects of validity. This pattern is unfortunate, because the outcome of tests for companion dogs may have the potential to affect their welfare and survival. This paper attempts to encourage a more scientific approach to the development, conduct, and evaluation of temperament tests <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> companion <b>dogs.</b> Five key measures of the quality of a temperament test (purpose, standardization, reliability, validity, and practicality) are identified and explained in detail.

Methods: Data for 5391 dogs and 5581 cats surrendered to one Queensland shelter between January 2006 and December 2009 were analysed.

40|$|The {{hematological}} parameters {{red blood}} cells (RBC) and total white blood cells (WBC) counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and RBC indexes (median corpuscular volume and median corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) were determined and T CD 5 + lymphocytes and CD 4 + and CD 8 + subpopulations of the umbilical cord blood (UCB) of dogs were quantified by the cytofluorimetric technique. Nine adult Beagles, from two do five-year old, were used as control. The umbilical cord blood (UCB) was collected from 20 neonate dogs. The method for the UCB collection was adequate to obtain sufficient quantity of blood for the accomplishment of the hematological analyses and lymphocyte quantification.

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on nutritional status of dogs {{is evidenced by}} the recent development of product lines designed to provide maximum canine nutrition without associated obesity. However, specific weight standards, such as those available for humans, have not been determined for dogs. Consequently, ideal weights <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> are based largely on subjective evaluation. The lack of objective standards is unfortunate because it hinders owners, practitioners, and researchers in making sound judgments about the nutritional status of a dog. In the study reported here, correlations were made between weight and the easily determined parameters of length, circumference and height in a population of adult mongrel dogs. Statistical analyses of data provided information used in the compilation of a table of normalized weights for dogs within the range included in the study. The length, circumference, and weight of 63 (29 female, 34 male) unconditioned mongrel dogs were measured. Combined totals were used to plot regression lines for length:weight, circumference:weight, and height:weight. Correlation coefficients for the lines were 0. 85, 0. 76, and 0. 41 respectively, and standard errors for the lines were 2. 25, 3. 20, and 3. 95 respectively.

Thesis discusses possibilities of feeding dogs and methods of the food classification. Part of this work was preferential test of the first choice. Two complete granulated dog foods <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> were chosen for the test. The first food contained high amount of animal ingredients (65 %), whereas the second food contained much lower amount of animal ingredients (12 %). There were 84 dogs included in the test.

Results were in favor of the second food, particularly 61, 9 % of the dogs chose the food with lower amount of animal ingredients. The first food (with higher amount of animal ingredients) was preferred only by 38, 1 % of the dogs. The first food is better for dogs, as its nutritional composition better meets the needs of dogs. Because of the high amount of animal ingredients in the first food, the first food should be more attractive for dogs, but the dogs prefer the second food. A possible explanation could be plausible presence of additives increasing the attractiveness of the second food...|$|E

The second assessment was conducted with standard feed, using 21 experimental plots distributed in three treatments (standard diet referred to as control and control with the addition of 375 ppm of Yucca schidigera and 1. 0 % zeolite). The additives did not affect the acceptability of feed and fecal characteristics in both assessments (P> 0. 05).

40|$|A survey {{given to}} animal shelters across the US {{reported}} food bowl guarding {{as one of}} the most common reasons for euthanasia and only 34 % attempted to modify this guarding behavior. This study identified 96 dogs that guarded their food bowl during an assessment, and then placed them into a home on a modification program. Food guarding behavior was identified as stiffening, gulping, growling, freezing, and/or biting a fake hand during the SAFER® food bowl assessment. Dogs that exhibited guarding behavior over toys were excluded. Follow-up was done at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months post adoption to measure all guarding behavior in the home. Six adopters reported at least one incident involving guarding in the first three weeks, of which only one was around the food bowl. By three months, those adopters reported no guarding behavior except one new occurrence of a dog guarding a rawhide was reported in the third month. For dog identified with food guarding, the return rate to the shelter was 5 % and 9 % <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>dogs</b> not identified with guarding behavior.
