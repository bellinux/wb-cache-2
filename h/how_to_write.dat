5|$|Atheis was Mihardja's first novel; {{what few}} {{literary}} works {{he had written}} beforehand were mostly short stories and dramas, both those intended for the radio and the stage. He never formally studied writing, instead learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> fiction from his experiences reading existing works, including those of André Gide, Leo Tolstoy, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His writing style was heavily influenced by that of Gide, particularly as found in The Immoralist (1902). Malay, the language which forms the basis of modern Indonesian, was not Mihardja's native language; his earlier works had all been in Sundanese, and Mihardja had only begun regularly using Indonesian after the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), {{when he became a}} translator.|$|E
5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> antiheroes.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, {{he began}} his comedy career by {{following}} up on a suggestion by David Lawrence (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) {{to go to the}} library and borrow books on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> jokes. The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at comedy clubs {{over the next few years}} in Cleveland and Los Angeles. He first came to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 Star Search. Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey to the couch next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the 14th Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO and made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special, Drew Carey: Human Cartoon, which aired on Showtime and won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.|$|E
5|$|Perry {{completed}} her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15, during {{her freshman year}} of high school, and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Her singing {{caught the attention of}} rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs and play guitar. After signing with Red Hill Records, Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson. She released the album on March 6, 2001, and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour while also embarking on other performances of her own in the United States. Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December. Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In {{order to avoid}} this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

25|$|A {{parallel}} {{phenomenon has}} appeared involving {{the increased use}} of input methods to write Chinese characters and the difficulty of remembering such a large set of characters. The use of word processors allows the user to write using characters that the user does not remember <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> by hand. This resulted in the reappearance in the 1980s in Japan of complex older characters which had been removed from the official lists. The number of characters available for use on a word processor far exceeds the number of characters a person can readily remember <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> by hand. While many have blamed the use of input methods for difficulty remembering <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the characters by hand, widespread use of input methods may be responsible for a reversal in the decline of kanji use in Japan.|$|E
