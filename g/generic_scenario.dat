40|$|By {{analogy with}} recent {{arguments}} concerning the mean velocity profile of wall-bounded turbulent shear flows, {{we suggest that}} there may exist corrections to the 2 / 3 law of Kolmogorov, which are proportional to () ^- 1 at large Re. Such corrections to K 41 {{are the only ones}} permitted if one insists that the functional form of statistical averages at large Re be invariant under a natural redefinition of Re. The family of curves of the observed longitudinal structure function D_LL(r,) for different values of Re is bounded by an envelope. In one <b>generic</b> <b>scenario,</b> close to the envelope, D_LL(r,) is of the form assumed by Kolmogorov, with corrections of O(() ^- 2). In an alternative <b>generic</b> <b>scenario,</b> both the Kolmogorov constant C_K and corrections to Kolmogorov's linear relation for the third order structure function D_LLL (r) are proportional to () ^- 1.
