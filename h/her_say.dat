5|$|Liz becomes furious when Jack {{decides that}} Tracy {{should be the}} number one {{priority}} on The Girlie Show. Jenna fears that Tracy will begin to overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard <b>her</b> <b>say</b> terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having <b>her</b> <b>say</b> on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
25|$|Mel becomes {{involved}} with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Melanie finds the children hard {{to deal with}} at first but grows to love them. Ian and Mel plan to marry but Melanie gets cold feet, realising she doesn't truly love Ian. Ian hears <b>her</b> <b>say</b> this and blackmails her into marrying him by telling her that Lucy has cancer. The pair marry on New Year's Eve 1999, in a double wedding with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed), but at their reception, she discovers a letter, giving Lucy the all-clear, and leaves Ian as the clock strikes midnight and the new millennium begins.|$|E

Her {{individual}} worship {{is mainly}} restricted to heroic Tantrikas, {{and those who}} worship <b>her</b> <b>say</b> only yogis and world renouncers {{have the ability to}} meditate on her using her icon. The lack of worship of Chhinnamasta by lay worshippers is attributed by Kinsley to her ferocious nature and her reputation for being dangerous to approach and worship.|$|E
500|$|The torture {{scene at}} the end of the film did not {{initially}} contain Asami's lines [...] "Kiri-kiri-kiri". Shiina was initially whispering her lines while filming this scene, but after discussion with Miike, the two decided that having <b>her</b> <b>say</b> these lines would make the scene scarier. Ishibashi found that Miike was [...] "having so much fun with that scene", and that Miike was especially excited when Ishibashi's character's feet are cut off. For the special effects where Shiina's character places acupuncture needles into Ishibashi, special effects make-up was used to create a mask layer which was laid upon Ishibashi's eyes, which is then pierced by the needles.|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have <b>her</b> <b>say</b> [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E

500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind myself {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear <b>her</b> <b>say</b> to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] {{was written}} by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Björk: Wow and Flutter, Madonna was {{inspired}} at that time by Björk's second studio album, Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna {{got in touch with}} Björk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Björk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious", with the opening lyrics [...] "Today is the last day, That I'm using words"—the lines being born out of Björk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, [...] "When I was offered to write a song for , I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided to do this to write the things I have always wanted to hear <b>her</b> <b>say</b> that she's never said." ...|$|E
500|$|Liu Xia {{was under}} house-arrest almost {{immediately}} after the announcement, and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband. She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother {{had not been able}} to get through to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats who had tried to visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters heard <b>her</b> <b>say</b> [...] "they are forcing me to leave Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E

500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively. He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put me on a pedestal, like, never mind that it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard <b>her</b> <b>say?</b> That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|As the Pope was, at that time, {{prisoner}} of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, {{as a result}} of the Sack of Rome in May 1527, Knight had some difficulty obtaining access. In the end he had to return with a conditional dispensation, which Wolsey insisted was technically insufficient. Henry now had no choice but to put his great matter into Wolsey's hands, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favour, even going so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England, with a special emissary, Lorenzo Campeggio from the Pope himself to decide the matter. But the Pope never had empowered his deputy to make any decision. The Pope was still a veritable hostage of Charles V, and Charles V was loyal to his aunt, Catherine. The Pope forbade Henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in Rome, not in England. Convinced that Wolsey's loyalties lay with the Pope, not England, Anne, as well as Wolsey's many enemies, ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529. George Cavendish, Wolsey's chamberlain, records that the servants who waited on the king and Anne at dinner in 1529 in Grafton heard <b>her</b> <b>say</b> that the dishonour that Wolsey had brought upon the realm would have cost any other Englishman his head. Henry replied, [...] "Why then I perceive...you are not the Cardinal's friend." [...] Henry finally agreed to Wolsey's arrest on grounds of praemunire. Had it not been for his death from illness in 1530, he might have been executed for treason. A year later in 1531 (fully two years before Henry's marriage to Anne), Queen Catherine was banished from court and her rooms were given to Anne.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, Hasse was out of a job and had no {{immediate}} prospects for one. [...] From 1919 to 1923, she conducted research for the War Labor Policies Board, becoming an [...] "expert in the Council of National Defense" [...] and identified herself as a bibliographer rather than a librarian. She went on to found the School for Business Librarians within the Washington School for Secretaries and became editor of Special Libraries.

She hopes to use her position as Edgar's wife to raise Heathcliff's standing. Heathcliff overhears <b>her</b> <b>say</b> that it would [...] "degrade" [...] {{her to marry him}} (but not how much she loves him), and he runs away and disappears without a trace. Distraught over Heathcliff's departure, Catherine makes herself ill. Nelly and Edgar begin to pander to her every whim to prevent her from becoming ill again.|$|E
2500|$|A week later, to {{alleviate}} this problem, Wolpaw returned with sample dialogue {{made with a}} text-to-speech program, which {{was intended to be}} used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as [...] "funny" [...] and [...] "sinister", so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while trying to think of story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of Portal. While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having <b>her</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Oh my nuts and bolts." [...] While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended her to speak to the player-character like a regular person.|$|E

2500|$|When he was 6 years old, Barrie's next-older brother David (his mother's favourite) {{died two}} days before his 14th {{birthday}} in an ice-skating accident. This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard <b>her</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Is that you?" [...] "I {{thought it was the}} dead boy she was speaking to", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother Margaret Ogilvy (1896) [...] "and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me. Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as Robinson Crusoe, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and The Pilgrim's Progress.|$|E
2500|$|The {{turning point}} in Arthur's career came when she was chosen by Frank Capra to star in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Capra had spotted her in a daily rush from the film Whirlpool in 1934 and {{convinced}} Cohn to have Columbia Studios sign her for his next film as a tough newspaperwoman {{who falls in love}} with a country bumpkin millionaire. Even though several colleagues later recalled that Arthur was troubled by extreme stage fright during production, Mr. Deeds was critically acclaimed and propelled her to international stardom. In 1936 alone, she earned $119,000, more than the President of the United States and baseball player Lou Gehrig. With fame also came media attention, something Arthur greatly disliked. She did not attend any social gatherings, such as formal parties in Hollywood, and acted difficult when having to work with an interviewer. She was named the American Greta Garbo – who was also known for her reclusive life – and magazine Movie Classic wrote of her in 1937: [...] "With Garbo talking right out loud in interviews, receiving the press and even welcoming an occasional chance to say <b>her</b> <b>say</b> in the public prints, the palm for elusiveness among screen stars now goes to Jean Arthur." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, when Samuel {{has become}} an adult, the Philistines attack Eben-Ezer, {{eventually}} capturing the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites and kill Eli's sons, who accompany the Ark to battle as priests. (The Israelites had brought the Ark with them to battle under the premise {{that there was no}} possible way God would allow it to enter enemy hands, an assumption that proved to be incorrect.) Eli, who is nearly blind, is unaware of the event until he asks about all the commotion. Eli, sitting in a chair, is told what has happened by a soldier who has fled the battle. In reaction to the news that the Ark of God has been captured, Eli falls backwards out of the chair and dies from a broken neck, on the 10th day of Iyar. [...] He was a Judge of Israel for a total of 40 years, and dies at the age of 98. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, is pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she hears the news that the Ark of God has been captured and that her father-in-law and husband are dead, she goes into labour and gives birth, but is overcome by labour pains. As she is dying, the women attending <b>her</b> <b>say,</b> Don't despair; you have given birth to a son. But she does not respond or pay any attention. She names the boy Ichabod, saying The Glory has departed from Israel- because of the capture of the Ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.|$|E
