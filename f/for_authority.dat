5|$|Bart's {{character}} traits of rebelliousness and disrespect <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> have {{been compared to}} that of America's founding fathers, and he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{mother was}} unable to {{establish}} a role for herself in the regency government and she returned to France in 1217, marrying Hugh de Lusignan, a powerful Poitevin noble. William Marshal fell ill and died in April 1219. The replacement government was formed around a grouping of three senior ministers: Pandulf, the replacement Papal legate; Peter des Roches; and Hubert de Burgh, a former justiciar. The three were appointed by a great council of the nobility at Oxford, and their government came to depend on these councils <b>for</b> <b>authority.</b> Hubert and des Roches were political rivals, with Hubert supported by a network of English barons, and des Roches backed by nobles from the royal territories in Poitou and Touraine. Hubert moved decisively against des Roches in 1221, accusing him of treason and removing him as the King's guardian; the Bishop left England for the crusades. Pandulf was recalled by Rome the same year, leaving Hubert as the dominant force in Henry's government.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking downwind, Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked against the wind, {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He booted 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in the ankles. He again showed his disrespect <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his boss to be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E

5|$|WMATA's {{bus system}} is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a publicly owned bus system, and requested takeover.|$|E
5|$|Many of the game's non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) are companion characters, {{who appear}} throughout {{the game and}} may volunteer their services. Companions include Alistair, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit; Morrigan, a sultry but cynical dark mage who has little regard <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> or social mores; Leliana, an ex-member of Ferelden's Chantry whose optimistic and virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat; Sten, a proud but stoic warrior of the militaristic Qunari people who often questions human ways; Oghren, a brutal dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by his penchant for violence and loyalty to his friends; Wynne, an Elder Mage of the Circle, a maternal figure to the party and a powerful healer; Zevran, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo; and a loyal Mabari War Hound, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat. In the DLC, Shale, a sarcastic Golem with a mild ornithophobia who was a female dwarf in her prior life, is also available.|$|E

25|$|During the war, the ABC's news bulletins {{attained}} a reputation <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> and independence, and from 1942 onwards, were broadcast three times daily through all national and most commercial transmitters. During {{and after the}} war, the ABC was given statutory powers that reinforced its independence {{from the government and}} enhanced its news-gathering role. From 1946, the ABC was required to broadcast selected parliamentary sessions live, despite the disruption this caused to regular programming.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, popular {{contempt}} for Prohibition {{was a factor}} in the rise of the flapper. With legal saloons and cabarets closed, back alley speakeasies became prolific and popular. This discrepancy between the law-abiding, religion-based temperance movement and the actual ubiquitous consumption of alcohol led to widespread disdain <b>for</b> <b>authority.</b> Flapper independence was also a response to the Gibson girls of the 1890s. Although that pre-war look does not resemble the flapper style, their independence may have led to the flapper wise-cracking tenacity 30 years later.|$|E
25|$|As {{libraries}} {{became more}} attuned {{to the needs of}} researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as OCLC and RLIN in the United States, in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> work.|$|E

50|$|A rapid {{response}} team is {{a network of}} safe homes formed to hide and shield undocumented aliens from deportation by U.S. immigration authorities, along with an effort by the ACLU to provide legal assistance to undocumented immigrants facing deportation by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). It is a counter to the threats of mass deportations made by Donald Trump. While it is relatively easy <b>for</b> <b>authorities</b> to arrest undocumented immigrants in businesses and churches, since by federal law such places {{are considered to be}} public spaces, it is harder <b>for</b> <b>authorities</b> to enter a private home belonging to a legal citizen, since authorities need to obtain a warrant first before entering. The idea is to make it harder <b>for</b> <b>authorities</b> to find and arrest illegal aliens. Rapid response teams {{are more likely to be}} organized and led in sanctuary cities such as Los Angeles and Denver. Los Angeles-based pastor Ada Valiente hopes to establish a network of safe homes across southern California and elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|However Basiliscus {{managed to}} estrange himself {{from most of}} his key collaborators. Patricius, the magister officiorum and lover of Verina, was {{executed}} to prevent her aspirations to elevate him to the throne. As a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution. Theodoric and Armatus were promoted to magister millitum and magister militum praesentialis and were vying <b>for</b> <b>authority.</b> Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E
25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect <b>for</b> <b>authority.</b> Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E
25|$|Fasanella {{served two}} stints in reform schools {{run by the}} Catholic Church for truancy and running away from home. He later said he was sexually abused ("used as a girl") by the priests. These {{experiences}} instilled a deep dislike <b>for</b> <b>authority</b> and reinforced Fasanella's hatred for anything which broke people's spirits. Fasanella later depicted his experience in reform school in a painting titled Lineup at the Protectory 2 (1961). The melancholy image features rows of boys standing at attention, watched over by scowling, ominous-looking priests. Fasanella quit school after the sixth grade.|$|E
