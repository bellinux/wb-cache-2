40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this work to gain {{knowledge}} of the glassy materials used as matrices in composites and to study the homogeneity resulting from the curing process. An attempt is made to link the glass transition quantitatively with the presence of a given material. <b>Expoxy</b> <b>resins</b> containing various amounts of hardener (TGDDM/DDS system) were cured in a muffle furnace at 473 K for seven hours. The glass transition temperature, T sub g versus weight minus percent of hardener in the epoxy resin were measured. A limit was rapidly reached in T sub g at only two percent hardener. Thus, the glass transition of the fully cured epoxy-amine matrix seems not much different from the epoxide-epoxide cure. The T sub g versus cure-time for the epoxide-epoxide reaction was also studied. My 720 was cured by itself in an oil bath at 473 K for different lengths of time. The T sub g was found to increase exponentially with the cure time, and a maximum T sub g of about 450 K was reached after eleven hours. The reaction was found to be inhibited by running the sample under argon...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} blends of a PE-PEO diblock {{copolymer}} (M= 1400) with a bisphenol A-type <b>expoxy</b> <b>resin</b> (ER) is {{studied in the}} full range of composition. Curing of the mixture was done at T = 110 ? C. DSC shows well separated melting peaks for both blocks of the copolymer. The ER rich samples only show the melting of the PE domains. The structure of the copolymer is investigated with SAXS. It shows a lamellar microphase separated structure at room temperature and disorder at high T. In the blends a sequence of structures is found with decreasing fraction of the copolymer. The ER is swelling the PEO domains thus increasing the lamellar period. Heterogeneous structures are found at intermediate compositions. Samples with small fraction of copolymer are characterized as micellar structures. Several models are applied to describe the SAXS results. The lamellar as well as the micellar structures are quantitatively described. The intermediate range is heterogeneous displaying structure on an hierarchy of length scales...|$|R
