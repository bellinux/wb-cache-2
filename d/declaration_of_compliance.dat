Similarly, {{the results of}} experiments conducted on games with conflict of interest trace back to two important primitives of social capital - trust and reciprocity - {{which can be used}} to explain deviations from the Nash equilibrium and which lead to the optimal cooperative outcome. In this paper we attempt to elicit the true motive(s) underlying the behaviour of players in experimental trust and dictator games and suggest that the most informative utilization of surveys in this regard goes beyond the simple comparison of answers to a questionnaire with actual behaviour. Specifically the paper uses descriptive statistics and ordered probit models to analyse whether, and to what extent, answers to a questionnaire about attitudes to trusting and reciprocating predict subjects' behaviour and, by comparing behaviour in Trust and Dictator Game, disentangles the strategic and altruistic motivations. We find no simple or direct correlation between behavioural trust or trustworthiness and attitudinal trust or disposition to reciprocate. However, dividing subjects according to attitudinal trust and trustworthiness, we observe that the link between the questionnaire and experimental sessions is more subtle than the mere correlation between average attitudes and average behaviours. The information conveyed by a survey appears to be much more powerful ex post - once the two motivational components have been separated out...|$|R
40|$|In-house {{control and}} the {{documentation}} of it, {{is the basis for}} the assurance of compliance with the legislation, both in the food area and in the area of FCM. This report is a check list to guide on declarations of compliance, and the target group for the project is industry, trade and private consultants as well as the public food inspection, both in the Nordic countries and in the EU. The Nordic food authorities have elaborated these check lists with the minimum requirements to the documentation needed for compliance with the legal requirements in the in-house documentation in industry and trade. The documentation should be the basis for declarations of compliance. A <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> can either be identical with the documentation or an extract.

40|$|Denmark, Finland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have in 2013 – 2015 {{conducted}} a Nordic project on food contact materials. Food contact materials {{are used in}} all stages of food production and can be a general source of contamination. The food safety authorities {{in most of the}} Nordic countries have had a limited focus on the FCM area with the exception of Denmark and Finland. The aim of the project was therefore to control establishments producing, importing or using plastic food contact materials as well as to increase the knowledge of the inspectors performing these controls. The focus of the inspections was to control the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> (DoC) for plastic food contact materials.

40|$|Metals and alloys {{are widely}} applied as food contact materials, e. g. as process {{equipment}} in the food industry and as household utensils. Therefore, they are a potential source of food contamination. Migration of substances from food contact materials to food must not occur in amounts that endanger human health. Relevant for food contact materials made from metals and alloys are the migration (release) of metals, both the main components and foreseen impurities. In-house control based on a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance,</b> DoC, and supporting documentation at the producers and importers are important prerequisites to limit this contamination and to ensure compliance with the legislation. This is considered a general part of quality assurance, even though the European legislation does not specifically require a DoC for metals and alloys used as food contact materials. This Nordic guideline gives a short overview of toxicology, analytical feasibility, legislation and guideline values for release of metals from food contact materials. Therefore, the guideline will be {{a useful tool for}} industry and official food inspectors...|$|E

25|$|The Standards in Public Office Commission {{was asked}} to {{investigate}} the Taoiseach's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>compliance</b> after the 2002 general election. In mid-January 2008 it emerged in the press, reportedly as leaks from parties to the Mahon tribunal, that Ahern {{would not be in}} a position to present a Tax Clearance Certificate to the Dáil, as required under Ethics' legislation. This certificate is issued by the Revenue Commissioners, to persons who have shown themselves to be tax compliant. To meet legal requirements, this certificate should have been presented to a Dáil committee by 31 January 2008 by all those elected to the Dáil. A caveat allowed that in the absence of this, a certificate stating that the Dáil member was in negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners would suffice. An inability to declare tax compliance by a prominent individual, such as Ahern, would prove highly embarrassing, and could potentially have had more serious repercussions. The Standards in Public Office Act (2001) determines the tax clearance requirements for persons elected to the Oireachtas, and others. The making <b>of</b> a false <b>declaration</b> will be an offence. They will also have to produce a tax clearance certificate.

This paper proposes four possible documentation models of the ship owners’ management system to cover the DMLC II with pros and cons.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the result}} of my participation in the Language Toolkit project, a recent collaboration between the Chamber of Commerce of Forlì and the School of Foreign Languages and Literatures, Interpreting and Translation at the University of Bologna, which aims to make students meet with the companies of our territory, in this case Ipack, based in Mercato Saraceno (FC). My dissertation is a specialized translation work from Italian into English of two documents that were entrusted to me: the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> of Ipack’s products and a summary of the quality manual. They are two high technical texts and, therefore, the translation task required a preliminary phase of research on the topics and on the terminology of this specific domain. 	The dissertation consists of five chapters. The first chapter briefly introduces the company with which I collaborated for my dissertation project and provides an overview of business communication and a brief classification of Ipack’s communication tools. The second chapter covers the background topics, namely food packaging and quality management systems within companies. The third chapter concerns the analysis of the two texts, describing the intra-textual and extra-textual aspects, as well as the morphosyntaxical and lexical features. The fourth chapter is dedicated to the revision work on one of the two texts, the one about quality procedures. In the commentary following my review, I explain the methodology and the strategies that I used and I also provide some extended examples of the main changes applied to the original text, with respect to both content and linguistic features. Finally, the fifth chapter focuses on the translation of the texts followed by a commentary that explains the work methodology, resources and my translation choices, accompanied by practical examples. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to support DG Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) with a {{baseline}} study on non-harmonised Food Contact Materials (FCMs). The study aimed to analyse the existing regulatory frameworks at national or sectorial level to demonstrate compliance with the general safety requirements for materials not harmonised at EU level. It also examined the perceived barrier to trade and burden of the current measures in place. Overall the entire sector of FCM suffers {{to a certain extent}} from the current situation which exhibits a lack of harmonisation of materials listed under the framework regulation and is the object of issues in mutual recognition. There are multiple legislation across Member States, but which are disparate for the different sectors. Measures are not always sufficiently detailed in particular for requirements and quality assurance towards <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and supporting documents, certification where applicable, basis for enforcement and sanctions. In the absence of agreed incentives and requirements, MSs can face hurdles in demonstrating the lack of safety and practical difficulties for enforcement and removal of products in their own markets. With regards to GMP, generic guidance from MSs are also seldom very detailed from an implementation standpoint and rarely material specific. The HSFAA and BTSF actions clearly indicated that GMP was an endemic issue to the sector of FCM, although from the industry side, GMP is tackled by professional associations in the form of guidelines. It is however not clear whether these guidelines are used in practice by the members at national and local level {{all the way down to}} SMEs. Further indicators not existing at this stage would be needed. In terms of material-specific aspects, the main hurdles are access to relevant legislation and disparities in both the nature of substances considered, the types of restrictions and numerical values imposed. These factors constitute an impediment to mutual recognition. Practical implementation and enforcement is impeded by the lack of access or availability of testing methods to test compliance to legislative limits. The study found a gap in quantitative indicators to evaluate in more depth efficiency (including burden and barriers to trade) and for food safety particularly in regards to effectiveness. This investigation was initiated as support to DG SANTE to conduct an (ex-post) evaluation and exploring options The JRC extended the scope of the baseline to make it a base reference for anyone seeking information on requirements and tools on FCMs. JRC.
