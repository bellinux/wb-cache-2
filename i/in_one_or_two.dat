5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days.|$|E
5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} the zones. Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of the zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> takes.|$|E

6000|$|But {{this was}} not to be. These birds came from far <b>in</b> <b>ones</b> <b>or</b> <b>twos</b> to search for their {{favourite}} food, {{and the fact that}} others had been scared away did not cause them to cease from coming. Presently I heard Charles mutter: ...|$|R
50|$|Birds are {{encountered}} <b>in</b> <b>ones</b> <b>or</b> <b>twos,</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> small flocks up to 10 birds. They feed {{quietly in}} dense forest generally in small trees or low branches of large trees, {{and are often}} unnoticed. They eat berries, fruit, seeds and possibly some insects.|$|R
5|$|The Revolutionary War forced William and Mary {{to close}} in 1781, as its {{buildings}} were used as barracks for British, French, and American troops as each nation successively controlled the college and surrounding area. Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia, Harrison notes that the most reliable records of Virginians' military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War, but less reliable sources mention him as a subaltern in the Virginia militia. If he enlisted, Harrison speculates that he served <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene's army in southwest Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment {{that they believe that}} many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E

50|$|The little spiderhunter (Arachnothera longirostra) is {{a species}} of long-billed nectar-feeding bird in the Nectariniidae family found in the moist forests of South and Southeast Asia. Unlike typical sunbirds, males and females are very similar in plumage. They are usually seen <b>in</b> <b>ones</b> <b>or</b> <b>twos</b> and {{frequently}} make a tzeck call and are most often found near flowering plants, where they obtain nectar.|$|R
50|$|Sweet smelling yellow-green flowers form <b>in</b> <b>ones</b> <b>or</b> <b>twos</b> {{on short}} stalks from September to October. The fruit is a purple berry, with a hooked style at the top. 9 to 14 seeds grow within the sticky pulp. The {{globular}} fruit is 5 to 7 mm {{in diameter and}} it matures from March to August. Regeneration is from cuttings or fresh seeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-17 mm. Adults are on wing from June to August <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> possibly <b>two</b> generations per year.|$|R

25|$|Although this follows <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{lines of}} algebra from Gauss's law for gravity, it took Isaac Newton several pages of {{cumbersome}} calculus to derive it directly using his law of gravity; see the article shell theorem for this direct derivation.|$|E
25|$|Six {{mammalian}} CerS {{have been}} described, with each utilizing fatty acyl CoAs of relatively defined chain lengths for N‑acylation of the sphingoid long chain base. Mammals contain six distinct CerS, whereas most other enzymes in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway only occur <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> isoforms.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{are found}} <b>in</b> <b>ones</b> <b>or</b> <b>twos,</b> {{although}} groups {{of up to}} 35 individuals may gather at fruit trees. Their predominantly green plumage makes them hard to spot against foliage. They have been recorded feeding with double-eyed fig parrots, fruit pigeons (Ptilinopus), honeyeaters, and starlings. They consume fruit including figs. Nesting takes place in small hollows high up in large trees, although {{little is known about}} this aspect of their behaviour.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 23-38 mm. Adults are on wing from mid April to mid August, <b>in</b> either <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> generations.|$|R

Biographer Paul Heyer recommends that readers use Innis's introduction as a helpful guide.|$|E
25|$|Orc {{is not an}} English word. It occurs <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> places but {{is usually}} {{translated}} goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds). Orc is the hobbits' form of the name given {{at that time to}} these creatures, and it is not connected at all with orc, ork, applied to sea-animals of dolphin-kind.|$|E
25|$|Adult Echinostoma {{have two}} suckers: an {{anterior}} oral sucker and a ventral sucker. They {{also have a}} characteristic head collar with spines surrounding their oral sucker. The number of collar spines varies between Echinostoma species, but there are usually between 27 and 51. These spines can be arranged <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> circles around the sucker, and their arrangement may be a characteristic feature of an Echinostoma species.|$|E

25|$|Distinct {{from most}} law schools, which {{typically}} reside <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> centralized buildings, Loyola has a separate law school campus. The campus, {{sitting on a}} full city block just west of downtown Los Angeles, {{is made up of}} an open central plaza surrounded by several contemporary buildings designed by Frank Gehry. Its recently renovated library {{is one of the largest}} private law libraries in the western U.S., with a collection of nearly 560,000 volumes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{surgical}} {{option for}} ulcerative colitis that is affecting {{most of the}} large bowel is called the ileo-anal pouch procedure. This is a two- to three-step procedure in which the large bowel is removed, except for the rectal stump and anus, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The next part of the surgery can be done <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> steps and is usually done at six- to twelve-month intervals from each prior surgery.|$|E
25|$|For {{some time}} the FAA and NASA {{developed}} a much improved system, the {{microwave landing system}} (MLS). The entire MLS system for a particular approach was isolated <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> boxes located beside the runway, dramatically reducing the cost of implementation. MLS also offered a number of practical advantages that eased traffic considerations, both for aircraft and radio channels. Unfortunately, MLS would also require every airport and aircraft to upgrade their equipment.|$|E
