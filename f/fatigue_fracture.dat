25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an {{uncontained}} failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a <b>fatigue</b> <b>fracture.</b> This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report where they {{stated that the}} most likely cause to the accident was a <b>fatigue</b> <b>fracture</b> {{in one of the}} second stage planet gears. They had not yet determined what initiated the fracture. AIBN draws similarity to the 2009 Bond Helicopters Eurocopter AS332 crash, also caused by a gearbox fracture. Whereas particles had been detected in the Scottish gearbox's oil prior to the crash, no such indication was present for the Norwegian gearbox. , AIBN continued investigations with no indication of when a conclusion could be made. Also in February 2017, EASA issued a notice for operators to investigate the oil cooler for 16NCD13 alloy from the gearbox.|$|E
30|$|Stress {{fractures}} {{are caused}} by repetitive mechanical stresses and can be largely viewed as either <b>fatigue</b> or insufficiency <b>fractures</b> [6]. Fractures caused by repetitive mechanical stresses in healthy young or middle-aged patients are <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures,</b> and stress fractures caused by low loads due to osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or other diseases in elderly patients {{are referred to as}} insufficiency fractures [7]. Overuse activities can increase the risk of multiple <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> in soldiers or untrained subjects. However, reports on multiple <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> thus far showed causes such as under-nutrition, dyscrinism, long-term rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. The two cases of multiple <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> that these authors investigated most likely resulted from overuse activities in soldiers and untrained subjects, as the authors observed that multiple <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> in three or more areas occurred in two healthy male patients without any under-nutrition, dyscrinism, long-term rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis.|$|R

25|$|On 28 April 2017 the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report {{with an update}} of the investigation progress {{one year after the}} accident. In this report they stated that the accident was a result of a <b>fatigue</b> <b>fracture</b> in one of the eight second stage planet gears in the epicyclic module of the main rotor gearbox and that the crack initiation appeared to be a surface micro-pit. The origin of the micro-pit was considered unknown at the time when the report was published. Also unknown is whether the fracture occurred momentarily or over several flight hours, and whether fracture fragments were spalled for detection by maintenance systems as happened in G-REDL. The issue is related to the airworthiness certificate of the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Since {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the subject by Burrows (1940) many <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> of the lower fibula have been reported. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> of the lower tibia, however, are uncommon.

CASE REPORT A boy of sixteen years complained of pain over the outer side of the right ankle when he attempted to run. He had no discomfort when walking. When he was first seen the symptoms had already been present for five months. The pain was noticed first during a six-mile road run. Running was one of his main recreations and he usually went for a long run once a week. On this particular occasion he developed a pain in the region of the right ankle after running about three miles. He was unable to finish the course and walked home. The ankle became stiff and painful but after a day in bed and the application of strapping to the leg he was able to get about in relative comfort. A week later he resumed his usual activities but the pain recurred whenever he tried to run or even stand on tip-toe. There wa...|$|R
2500|$|On 3 December 2010, the ATSB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report which contained a key finding of a manufacturing flaw: An area of fatigue cracking was found within a stub pipe that feeds oil to the engine HP/IP bearing structure. Bearing lubricating oil leaked from the crack, causing the subsequent engine fire and failure of the IPT disc. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>fracture</b> {{was a result of}} the misalignment of the stub pipe during the counter-boring process. That inaccurate alignment resulted in one side of the same stub pipe becoming too thin to resist fatigue fracturing. This [...] "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire," [...] according to the agency.|$|E

40|$|Simplified <b>fatigue</b> and <b>fracture</b> {{mechanics}} based assessment {{methods are}} widely used by the industry to determine the structural integrity significance of postulated cracks, manufacturing flaws, service-induced cracking or suspected degradation of engineering components under normal and abnormal service loads.

The welded joints are a major component that is often blamed for causing a structure failure or for being {{the point at which}} <b>fatigue</b> or <b>fracture</b> problems initiate and propagate. Various mathematical models/techniques for various classes of welded joints are developed by analytically or by simulation software's {{that can be used in}} <b>fatigue</b> and <b>fracture</b> assessments.

40|$|For many failure cases, {{macroscopic}} {{examination of the}} fracture surface permits discrimination of <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures</b> from overload <b>fractures.</b> For clarifying <b>fatigue</b> <b>fractures,</b> the practical significance of microfractography is limited to {{an investigation of the}} crack initiation areas. Scanning electron microscopy is successfully used in tracing local material abnormalities that act as fatigue crack initiators. The task for the scanning electron microscope, however, is much more substantial in failure analysis of overload fractures, especially for steels. By revealing specific fractographic characteristics, complemented by information about the material and the loading conditions, scanning electron microscopy provides a strong indication of the probable cause of failure. A complete dimple fracture is indicative of acceptable bulk material properties; overloading, by subdimensioning or excessive external loading, has to be verified. The presence of cleavage fracture makes the material properties questionable if external conditions causing embrittlement are absent. Intergranular brittle fracture requires verification of grain-boundary weakening conditions-a sensitized structure, whether or not combined with a local stress state or a specific environment. The role of scanning electron microscopy in failure analysis is illustrated by case histories of the aforementioned fracture types. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996. status: publishe...|$|R
