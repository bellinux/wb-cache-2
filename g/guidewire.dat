25|$|Lumpectomy {{techniques}} are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that {{for patients with}} a single tumor smaller than 4cm, a lumpectomy with negative surgical margins may {{be as effective as}} a mastectomy. Prior to a lumpectomy, a needle-localization of the lesion with placement of a <b>guidewire</b> may be performed, sometimes by an interventional radiologist if the area being removed was detected by mammography or ultrasound, and sometimes by the surgeon if the lesion can be directly palpated.|$|E
25|$|Biliary SEMS {{are used}} to palliatively treat tumours of the {{pancreas}} or bile duct that obstruct the common bile duct. They are inserted {{at the time of}} ERCP, a procedure that uses endoscopy and fluoroscopy to access the common bile duct. The bile duct is cannulated with the assistance of a <b>guidewire</b> and the sphincter of Oddi that is located at its base is typically cut. A wire is kept in the bile duct, and the SEMS is deployed over the wire in a similar fashion as esophageal stents. The location of the SEMS is confirmed by fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal SEMS {{are placed}} after a {{gastroscopy}} is performed {{to identify the}} area of narrowing. The area {{may need to be}} dilated in order to allow the gastroscope to pass. The tumour is usually better seen with the direct vision of endoscopy than on a fluoroscopic image. As a result, radio-opaque markers are usually placed {{on the surface of the}} patient in order to mark the area of narrowing on fluoroscopy. The SEMS is placed through the channel of the endoscope into the esophagus over a <b>guidewire,</b> marked on fluoroscopy, and mechanically deployed (using a device that sits outside of the endoscope) such that it expands when in position. Hypaque or other water-soluble dye may be placed through the passage to ensure patency of the stent on fluoroscopy. Enteric and colonic SEMS are inserted in a similar fashion, but in the duodenum and colon respectively.|$|E
30|$|TBP {{insertion}} {{starts with}} the same conventional steps by inserting the <b>guidewires</b> into the epiphysis and metaphysis, straddling the physis. After fluoroscopic confirmation {{of the position of}} the <b>guidewires,</b> the cannulated drill bit is used to broach the cortex to a depth of 5  mm in the bone. A standard 4.5 -mm cannulated screw from the TBP set is used to tap the screw tract over the <b>guidewires</b> for approximately three-quarters of the planned screw length. After removing the <b>guidewires,</b> the solid screws are then inserted in each hole to follow the tapped tracts.|$|R
40|$|Virtual reality-based {{simulators}} {{are very}} helpful for trainees {{to acquire the}} skills of manipulating catheters and <b>guidewires</b> during the vascular interventional surgeries. In the development of such a simulator, however, {{it is a great}} challenge to realistically model and simulate deformable catheters and <b>guidewires</b> in an interactive manner. We propose a novel method to simulate the motion of catheters or <b>guidewires</b> and their interactions with patients' vascular system. Our method is based on the principle of minimal total potential energy. We formulate the total potential energy in the vascular interventional circumstance by summing up the elastic energy deriving from the bending of the catheters or <b>guidewires,</b> the potential energy due to the deformation of vessel walls, and the work by the external forces. We propose a novel FEM-based approach to simulate the deformation of catheters and <b>guidewires.</b> The motion of catheters or the <b>guidewires</b> and their responses to every input from the interventionalist can be calculated globally. Experiments have been conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that our method can realistically simulate the complex behaviors of catheters and <b>guidewires</b> in an interactive manner...|$|R
30|$|Especially, robots {{may play}} roles in {{minimally}} invasive vascular surgery. One treatment for chronic total occlusion (CTO), i.e., complete blockage of a coronary artery, is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [13 – 17] employing <b>guidewires</b> and catheters. Some <b>guidewires</b> penetrate blood clots while others guide catheters. The <b>guidewires</b> are manually controlled by pushing them back-and-forth or rotating {{them about their}} axes. However, this is time-consuming and highly dependent on operator skill. Thus, to reduce operative time and increase success rates, many groups are seeking robotic solutions.|$|R
2500|$|Door-to-balloon {{is a time}} {{measurement}} in emergency cardiac care (ECC), specifically {{in the treatment of}} ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (or STEMI). The interval starts with the patient's arrival in the emergency department, and ends when a catheter <b>guidewire</b> crosses the culprit lesion in the cardiac cath lab. Because of the adage that [...] "time is muscle", meaning that delays in treating a myocardial infarction increase the likelihood and amount of cardiac muscle damage due to localised hypoxia, ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a door-to-balloon interval of no more than 90 minutes. Currently fewer than half of STEMI patients receive reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention within the guideline-recommended timeframe. It has become a core quality measure for the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (TJC).|$|E

50|$|The desired vessel or cavity is {{punctured}} {{with a sharp}} {{hollow needle}} called a trocar, with ultrasound guidance if necessary.

50|$|Maneuver:Ambesh {{maneuver}} {{not only}} prevents misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the IJV but also provides instant diagnosis of misplaced catheter. Following successful puncture of subclavian vein with a cannula/needle, {{same side of}} IJV is compressed externally by placing a sterile finger in supraclavicular fossa. The <b>guidewire</b> is threaded through the cannula into the subclavian vein keeping the compression on. If the operator notices resistance while inserting the <b>guidewire,</b> it means the <b>guidewire</b> is going north into the IJV. The <b>guidewire</b> is removed gently and re-threaded maintaining the pressure in the supraclavicular fossa. After successful insertion of the <b>guidewire,</b> pressure in fossa is released and the subclavian vein catheter is railroaded over the <b>guidewire</b> up to the desired length. The <b>guidewire</b> is removed and the catheter is now connected to the transducer and the monitor. The CVP waveform pattern {{as well as its}} value is noted. The ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa is compressed again and any change in CVP value and/or its waveform pattern is noted. If the waveform pattern is lost (becomes straight line) and or CVP value increased by more than 2 cm H2O then it is surely a misplaced subclavian vein catheter into the same side IJV. If no change occurs then this catheter is fine and can be used for CVP monitoring and drug administration. The Ambesh maneuver is quite simple, handy, inexpensive, and instant bedside technique that prevents and diagnoses misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the IJV The maneuver is now routinely used and recommended by others to avoid the most common misplacement of subclavian vein catheter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Interventional {{radiology}} is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure where thin instruments, <b>guidewires</b> and catheters or stents are steered through the patient’s vascular system under X-ray imaging for treatment of vascular diseases. The complexity of these procedures makes training in order to master hand-eye coordination, instrument manipulation and procedure protocols for each radiologist mandatory. In this paper, we present a computer-based real-time simulation of interventional radiology procedures, which deploys a very efficient physics-based thread model to simulate the elastic behavior of <b>guidewires</b> and catheters. A fast collision detection scheme provides continuous collision response, which reveals more details of arterial walls than a centerline approach. Furthermore rendering techniques for realistic X-ray effect have been implemented. Our simulation structure is updated at a haptic rate of 500 Hz, thus contributing to physical realism. I...|$|R

50|$|While the <b>guidewire</b> is in place, it now acts as {{the pathway}} to the stenosis.
