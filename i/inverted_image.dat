5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
25|$|In his 1637 book Dioptrique French philosopher, {{mathematician}} and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an eye of {{a recently}} dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the {{eye of a}}n ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> formed on the retina.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and aqueous humor is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a positive meniscus lens.|$|E

25|$|Mirrors with curved {{surfaces}} can be modelled by {{ray tracing}} {{and using the}} law of reflection at each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces, parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus. Other curved surfaces may also focus light, but with aberrations due to the diverging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration. Curved mirrors can form images with magnification greater than or less than one, and the magnification can be negative, indicating that the image is inverted. An upright image formed by reflection in a mirror is always virtual, while an <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> is real and can be projected onto a screen.|$|E
500|$|Shen Kuo {{experimented with}} the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists {{had done in}} the 4th century BC. Although the Iraqi Muslim {{scientist}} Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) {{was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, Shen Kuo was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to the camera obscura, just several decades after Ibn al-Haytham's death. [...] Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and waisted drum. He also discussed focal points and noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that {{he was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), in regard to the <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} the novel's title character, the President, is never named gives him a mythological dimension, rather than the {{personality}} of a specific Guatemalan dictator. Literary scholar Kevin Bauman notes that readers are not let {{into the mind of}} the President; instead his appearance is [...] "continually re-evaluated, re-defined, and, ultimately, re-constructed according to his perception by others, similar to Asturias's own novelistic (re)vision of Estrada Cabrera's regime". According to literary critic Hughes Davies, the President [...] "represents political corruption but his presentation as an evil deity who is worshiped in terms that mockingly echo religious ritual elevates him to a mythical plane" [...] and he is [...] "an <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> of both the Christian and Mayan deities since he is the source only of death". The dictator also has an element of mystery about himit seems that no one knows where he is because he occupies several houses {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Mystery also surrounds the questions of when and how he sleeps. In the novel, rumors abound that he sleeps beside the telephone with a whip in his hand while others claim that he never sleeps at all.|$|E

2500|$|An eye is {{essentially}} a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina. [...] The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> {{is known as a}} camera obscura (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years ago on a sea mollusk, known as a nautilus, during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved to take advantage of it.|$|E

2500|$|Camera obscura (plural camerae obscurae or camera obscuras; from Latin, meaning [...] "dark room": camera [...] "(vaulted) chamber or room," [...] and obscura [...] "darkened, dark"), also {{referred}} to as pinhole image, is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at {{the other side of a}} screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as a reversed and <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{written record}} of the camera obscura {{is to be found}} in Chinese writings called Mozi and dated to the 4th century BCE, traditionally ascribed to and named for Mozi (circa 470 BCE-circa 391 BCE), a Han Chinese philosopher and the founder of Mohist School of Logic. In these writings it is explained how the <b>inverted</b> <b>image</b> in a [...] "collecting-point" [...] or [...] "treasure house" [...] is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collected the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.|$|E

For this, he wore a set of glasses <b>inverting</b> <b>images</b> both upside-down and left-right.
