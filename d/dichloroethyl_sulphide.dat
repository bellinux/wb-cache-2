50|$|From June 1918, {{alongside}} the supporting plants at Chittenden and ROF Rotherwas, {{all three were}} supplied with <b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> by the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, to produce mustard gas shells.|$|E
50|$|All {{components}} were produced elsewhere, with the facility responsible for final production: inserting explosive into shells and fitting detonators. Shell filling began on 11 November 1916, with both Lyddite and Amatol explosives {{being used in}} production. From June 1918, supplied with <b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> by the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, the facility produced mustard gas shells. By the end of WW1, the average output of shells from the facility was 70,000 per week.|$|E
5000|$|National Filling Factory No. 23, Chittening, South Gloucestershire. Operated by Nobel Explosives, shells were {{initially}} filled with chloropicrin. From June 1918, alongside the main plant at Banbury and a secondary plant at Hereford, supplied with <b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> from the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, the three plants produced mustard gas shells. By November 1918, Chittening had produced 85,424 mustard gas shells; {{but at a}} human cost of 1213 cases of associated illness, including two deaths which were later attributed to influenza.|$|E

5000|$|Construction of the {{chemical}} plant began in 1917, but did not finish until 1923, costing £800,000. The plant came into operation from Spring 1918, producing [...] of <b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> using the Despretz-Niemann-Guthrie process per day. The chemical product was than shipped to the main filling factory production site at Banbury, plus secondary sites at Chittening and Hereford. Although the first shells did not arrive in France until September 1918, two months before The Armistice, it was used that same month during {{the breaking of the}} Hindenburg Line within the Hundred Days' Offensive. By November 1918, Chittening had produced 85,424 mustard gas shells.|$|E

The plant came into operation from spring 1918, producing [...] of <b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> using the Despretz-Niemann-Guthrie process; the chemical agent was then placed into shells on site.

5000|$|During {{the later}} part of World War I, it was {{proposed}} to make Avonmouth the UK centre of production of <b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> {{also known as}} mustard gas. However, its production was against the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which explicitly forbade the use of [...] "poison or poisoned weapons" [...] in warfare. Under {{the cover of the}} Official Secrets Act, the Ministry of Munitions under its then Minister Winston Churchill nationalised many small smelting works under the new National Smelting Company (NSC). Before the outbreak of WW1, much of Britain's zinc had originated in Australia, but had been smelted in Germany. The NSC was therefore publicly commissioned to build a new zinc smelting works and sulphuric acid plant at Merebank, Avonmouth.|$|E

50|$|During World War I, the Ministry of Munitions built {{a filling}} factory for {{artillery}} shells on the site, which was farmland commandeered {{by the military}} for its closeness to Avonmouth docks and {{to the site of}} the National Spelter Company's chemical works in St Andrew's Road, Avonmouth, later the National Smelting Company. At Chittening, Nobel Explosives filled shells with chloropicrin, derived industrially from picric acid. In defiance of the Hague Convention on weapons, the German army used mustard gas (<b>dichloroethyl</b> <b>sulphide)</b> against Allied troops on the Eastern and Western Fronts in 1917, and the British minister of munitions, Winston Churchill, ordered supplies to be manufactured in Britain for use in retaliation. Having first used captured German gas in late 1917, and then gas produced at factories in Manchester and Runcorn, from June 1918 three filling factories, at Banbury, ROF Rotherwas at Hereford, and Chittening, were supplied with freshly manufactured mustard gas by the National Smelting Company. By November 1918, with unskilled female labour, Chittening had produced 85,424 mustard gas shells, but at a human cost of 1213 notified cases of associated illness, including at least two deaths which were later attributed to influenza. The story of the women who filled the shells at such great personal risk has been told in the stage play Gas Girls. Rather late in the day, a small hospital and surgery were opened on the site around the time of the Armistice.|$|E
