5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and a herd of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E

5|$|The exact route {{taken by}} Odaenathus from Palmyra to Ctesiphon remains uncertain; it is {{probably}} similar to the route emperor Julian took in 363 during his campaign against Persia. Using this route, Odaenathus would <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Euphrates at Zeugma then moved east to Edessa followed by Carrhae then Nisibis; here, he would have descended south along the Khabur River to the Euphrates valley and marched alongside the river's left bank to Nehardea. After taking the city, he penetrated the Sassanian province of Asōristān and marched along the royal canal Naarmalcha towards the Tigris where the Persian capital stood.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{headed by}} Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, though {{probably not the}} first Europeans to visit the area, are the first recorded to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Portage and travelled along the Chicago River. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days {{near the mouth of}} the river, then moved on to the portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674–75. Joliet and Marquette did not report any Indians living near the Chicago River area at this time, though archaeologists have since discovered numerous Indian village sites elsewhere in the Chicago area. Two of La Salle's men built a stockade at the portage in the winter of 1682/1683.|$|E
5|$|Drama in {{the early}} 20th century thrived, but the country failed to produce a Welsh National Theatre company. After the Second World War the {{substantial}} number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two thirds. The increasing competition from television in the 1950s and 1960s led to a need for greater professionalism in the theatre. As a result, plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton, Rachel Roberts, Donald Houston and Stanley Baker, were establishing themselves as artistic talents. Anthony Hopkins was an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, and has since starred in Hollywood films.John Rhys-Davies is another well known actor, famous for his portrayal of Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the charismatic Arab excavator Sallah in the Indiana Jones films. Other Welsh actors to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic more recently include: Ioan Gruffudd; Rhys Ifans; Matthew Rhys; Michael Sheen; and Catherine Zeta-Jones.|$|E

5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> southern part of the Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{reversed}} their defeat to Sunderland {{previously in}} the season by winning 2–1 on 22 December. Reading had led 1–0 after a 69th-minute goal from Ívar Ingimarsson. Michael Chopra levelled the match by scoring an 82nd-minute penalty. A goal by Stephen Hunt in the 90th minute sparked controversy as it appeared not to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line. Sunderland met Manchester United on Boxing Day at the Stadium of Light, they were beaten 4–0 in a game were Sunderland striker Martyn Waghorn made the step up from the club's Youth system to the first team. Martyn Waghorn promoted to first team from Youth system. Sunderland ended 2007 with a 3–1 home win to Bolton Wanderers on 29 December, Kieran Richardson, Kenwyne Jones and Daryl Murphy were the scorers.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo {{on the far side}} of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov {{on the far side of}} the goal, but it was deemed to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E
