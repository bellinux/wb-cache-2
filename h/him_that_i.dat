5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E

25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

500|$|Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley {{during this}} period in Las Vegas, where she {{was working as a}} showgirl. She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I {{mentioned}} to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E
500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going to do something and that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{her history}} with Colin, the {{character}} happily pursued {{a romantic relationship}} with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Speaking about the relationship, Francis stated: [...] "I would like {{to continue to work}} with him because he is just so good, and Peter is so nice. I did do a couple scenes with <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was really proud of, and they were right before the two of them make love for the first time. There were two scenes where Genevieve bares her soul to him. [...] And through that, the audience hopefully got more insight into who this woman really is." ...|$|E

In his victory speech, Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together. Nixon said: [...] "I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President, congratulating me for winning the election.

500|$|Originally in {{the climax}}, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk about it {{when you get to}} the top!' I had to tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't know." ...|$|E

Pianist Ethan Iverson, a contemporary of Mehldau's, stated that Mehldau was the principal influence on his peers, {{beginning in the late}} 1990s. Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: [...] "He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be arrested for all the stuff I've stolen from him." [...] Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians: [...] "Brad has had a lot of influential records, [...] if you talk to musicians, especially younger musicians, so many of them will name that as a defining record." [...] Marco Benevento and Aaron Parks are among the improvisers who have been affected by the 2002 album.|$|E

[...] The Beast's verse reads, [...] "when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw." [...] According to Laurence E. MacDonald, {{author of the}} book The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History, Benson [...] "shocked many filmgoers with his richly resonant baritone." [...] Finally, Belle sings the song's bridge, which reads, [...] "New and a bit alarming/Who'd have ever thought that this could be?/True, that he's no Prince Charming/But there's something in <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> simply didn't see." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, by the end of [...] "Something There", [...] "the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and hired John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. She also subsequently left the Jackson home in Encino, California and moved into her own apartment around this time. Commenting on the decision, she stated, [...] "I just {{wanted to get out of}} the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to work with him again." [...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him. McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father." [...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting and production duo James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E

Tell John, when you speak to <b>him,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E
