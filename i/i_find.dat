5|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, you don't really think about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can <b>I</b> <b>find</b> a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

5|$|Fear of suffocation—something that I have or fear {{is never}} {{being able to}} enjoy myself,... 'Cause I love my work so much, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time.... I don't go to nightclubs,... You don't see {{pictures}} of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go—and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I {{got to get back to}} work.|$|E
5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something <b>I</b> <b>find</b> strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's songs Mistä löydän ystävän ("Where Do <b>I</b> <b>Find</b> a Friend") and Maanantaitango ("Monday Tango") {{had already}} been {{recorded}} by Katri Helena in 1963 before Vainio's military service. After leaving the army, Vainio befriended composer and music journalist Sauvo Puhtila (known to the Finnish public by the pseudonym Saukki), who told him that Yleisradio {{was in need of}} lyricists. Eager to leave his job as a teacher, Vainio quit and started collaborating with musician Reino Markkula. Their song Sä kuulut päivään jokaiseen ("You Belong in Every Day"), composed by Markkula with lyrics by Vainio, was given to Eino Grön who made it into a hit.|$|E

25|$|Other Voices, Other Rooms was {{an attempt}} to exorcise demons, an unconscious, {{altogether}} intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical.

25|$|I {{am trying}} to resume my pen... Whenever I sit alone, or walk alone, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> myself dreaming about stories, as of old; but these forenoons in the Custom House undo all that the afternoons and evenings have done. I should be happier if I could write.|$|E
25|$|Although Tsar Peter the Great {{introduced}} the Idea of Progress to Russia, by the 19th century, the Tsars {{did not recognize}} “progress” as a legitimate aim of the state, {{to the degree that}} Nicholas II said “How repulsive <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that word” and wished it removed from the Russian language.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> a man prowling {{about my}} house with {{obviously}} felonious purposes. I hasten to get locks and bars, and to barricade my windows.
