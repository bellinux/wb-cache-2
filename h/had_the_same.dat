5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies.

We {{study the}} {{equivalence}} relations on probability measures corresponding respectively to <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Martin-Löf random reals, <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Kolmogorov-Loveland random reals, and <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> computably random reals. In particular, we show that, when {{restricted to the}} class of strongly positive generalized Bernoulli measures, they all coincide with the classical equivalence, which requires that two measures <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> nullsets. ...|$|R

5|$|A Danish {{champion}} {{has been}} found every year since 1913, except for 1915 and 1928. In 1915, the tournament was not played because of World War I.

40|$|We discuss various {{criteria}} of probabilistic load balancing in heterogeneous distributed systems.

50|$|In metadata, {{property}} equivalence is {{the statement}} that two properties <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> property extension or values.

Technically it only implies that <b>the</b> data elements <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> values.|$|R
50|$|Nuclides that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> neutron number but a {{different}} proton number are called isotones. This word {{was formed by}} replacing the p in isotope with n for neutron.
