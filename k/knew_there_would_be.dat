25|$|Svenskhuset (the Swedish House) is {{the oldest}} house on Spitsbergen. The house was erected by the Swedes on Cape Thordsen in Isfjorden, and was {{intended}} to withstand the harsh conditions of the Svalbard winters. A group of Norwegian seal hunters were stuck on the island {{in the autumn of}} 1872. They sought out the Finland-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, who at the time was conducting an expedition in the area, for assistance. Nordenskiöld did not have the resources to accommodate all the hunters, so it was agreed that a number of the men would make their way to Svenskhuset, where they <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> food, coal and equipment. Seventeen men without families were selected, and on 14 October 1872 they set out for Svenskhuset in row boats. The journey was 350 km (220 mi), and it took the crew seven days to get to their destination.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{opted for}} a European cast {{including}} Italian actor Raoul Bova, Ewen Bremner from Scotland, and English actor Colin Salmon. Producer Davis said, [...] "There's a truly international flavor to the cast, and gives the film a lot of character." [...] Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film's heroine Alexa Woods. Sanaa Lathan was selected, and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming. The filmmakers <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> comparisons to Alien heroine Ellen Ripley {{and did not want}} a clone of the character, but wanted to make her similar while adding something different.|$|E
500|$|Once Koblenz was {{captured}} in mid-March 1945, VIII Corps was assigned a 25-mile front from Koblenz upstream (southeast) to beyond Boppard and the famous landmark, the Lorelei. Patton then gave Middleton the 89th Division and 76th Division for the river crossing. Middleton chose to cross the river near the Lorelei where the river was narrow, swift, and flanked by steep terrain, eliciting another laugh from Patton. Middleton <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> little German resistance there, {{and he was able}} to get the entire 89th across in one night using inflatable rafts, and then put a pontoon bridge in place by early morning. The 87th initially attempted to cross at Koblenz but met too much resistance there, compelling them to move further upstream closer to Boppard, where their crossing went smoothly. [...] Within two days Middleton had all three of his divisions across the Rhine.|$|E

60|$|This {{had passed}} {{enough for her}} to <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a respite for perhaps a good many hours, and she had yielded to the entreaty or command of Bobus, that she would lie down and sleep, trusting to him to call her at any moment.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{laughing}} to himself:--"It's {{pleasant to}} sit by, a demi-god, {{and hear the}} surmisings of mortals, upon things they know nothing about; theology, or amber, or ambergris, it's all the same. But then, did I always out with every thing I <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no conversing with these comical creatures.|$|R
2500|$|Capaldi briefly {{appears in}} the 50th anniversary special. Moffat stated {{that it was his}} [...] "plan from the start" [...] that all the Doctors would fly in to save Gallifrey, and he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a new one at that time. He wrote it before knowing who would be cast. Capaldi filmed his {{appearance}} on 3 October 2013, long after principal photography for the special had ended, and the same day he filmed his debut scene for [...] "The Time of the Doctor".|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} an {{unofficial}} punishment: the blacklisting and social banishment of Aristides de Sousa Mendes and his family. [...] "My grandfather ... <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> some retribution, but to lose everything and have the family disgraced, he {{never thought it would}} go that far," [...] said the hero's grandson, also named Aristides. The family took meals at the soup kitchen of the Jewish community of Lisbon. When told that the soup kitchen was intended for refugees, Sousa Mendes replied, [...] "But we too are refugees." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knowing that Matt Smith was {{planning}} to leave, Moffat wrote the special specifically with the brief appearance of the Twelfth Doctor during the sequence {{of all of the}} Doctors uniting to save Gallifrey, prior to casting anyone in the role. Moffat later stated that it was his [...] "plan from the start" [...] that all the Doctors would fly in to save Gallifrey, and he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a new one at that time. He wrote it before knowing who would be cast.|$|E
60|$|Here he <b>knew</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{no one to}} {{interfere}} {{between him and his}} antagonist.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} <b>known</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no food squandered," [...] he told himself. [...] "Didn't they {{say at the}} prison that they were {{slaughtering}} the horses just for the meat, and that butter and eggs were worth their weight in gold? I'll be lucky to get bread and soup--especially as I haven't a dollar with which {{to pay for a}} meal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the {{difficulty}} I see myself," [...] Terence replied. [...] "We could {{not hope to}} pass through the circle of fortifications and, were we to take a boat and make off, we should be pursued and recaptured, to a certainty; for of course, as soon as our escape <b>was</b> <b>known,</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a hot search made for us.|$|R
2500|$|... “The {{last time}} I saw Eric Hollies bat at Birmingham,” {{recalled}} Jack Fingleton in 1958, “he was clapped and cheered {{all the way}} to the middle at No. 11. Everybody <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no pretty passes at the ball and deft deflections from Eric. They knew that if he could only survive two balls they would see something in batting unknown to any textbook.” Bateman added, “when it was time to get his pads on, Eric would prop his bat up in the Edgbaston dressing room window and say to it: ‘Now while I’m getting ready, you find out what the ball’s doing’”.|$|E
2500|$|Hanks {{told the}} Evening Standard that those {{involved}} with the film [...] "always <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a segment of society that would not want this movie to be shown. But the story we tell is loaded {{with all sorts of}} [...] and fun kind of scavenger-hunt-type nonsense." [...] He said it is a mistake [...] "to take any sort of movie at face value, particularly a huge-budget motion picture like this." [...] He also stated at the Cannes Film Festival {{that he and his wife}} saw no contradiction between their faith and the film, as [...] "My heritage, and that of my wife, suggests that our sins have been taken away, not our brains." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the morning}} of Tuesday 11 July, a {{compromise}} was reached. The Orangemen {{would be allowed to}} march along Garvaghy Road on condition that they did so silently and without accompanying bands. Ronnie Flanagan (Deputy Chief Constable of the police) told the GRRC that residents should peacefully remove themselves from the road because [...] "an angry scene between police and protesters could worsen the Ormeau marching dispute and even destabilise the ceasefires". When GRRC member Breandán Mac Cionnaith asked protesters to clear the road, some heckled him and refused. Flanagan was told there would be a better chance of the protesters moving if they <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no march there next year. Flanagan replied that [...] "there was no question of marches going where there was no consent from the community". The residents were then persuaded to clear the road. This was all confirmed by the Mediation Network. The Orangemen then marched along the road with Paisley and Trimble {{at the head of the}} march. As they reached the end of Garvaghy Road, Paisley and Trimble held their hands in the air in what appeared to be a gesture of triumph. Trimble claims that he only took Paisley's hand to prevent the DUP leader from taking all the media attention.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} in late 2012, Kelly stated that he didn't <b>know</b> if <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> another Shrinebuilder album.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a {{worry and}} a fuss. Either {{she would say}} we must wait for letters from mamma, or else that Alexis must come to Beechcroft, and all the comfort <b>would</b> <b>be</b> over, and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> gossiped about all over the place. Can't you trust me, when I tell you I have written it all to my own father and mother, and surely I know my own family best?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Next morning Frank and {{his friends}} went out to choose their claim. As we have said, the Bigbear Gully was not at that time {{generally}} known. A comparatively small number of diggers had set to work in it, and they were careful to avoid giving much information to [...] "prospecting," [...] or searching parties, because they knew that if {{the richness of the}} soil <b>were</b> <b>known,</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a general rush to it from all quarters. There was therefore no lack of unoccupied ground.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first section}} {{describes}} Sal's {{first trip to}} San Francisco. [...] Disheartened after a divorce, his life changes when he meets Dean Moriarty, who is [...] "tremendously excited with life," [...] and begins to long for {{the freedom of the}} road: [...] "Somewhere along the line I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me." [...] He sets off in July 1947 with fifty dollars in his pocket. After taking several buses and hitchhiking, he arrives in Denver, where he hooks up with Carlo Marx, Dean, and their friends. There are parties—among them an excursion to the ghost town of Central City. Eventually Sal leaves by bus and gets to San Francisco, where he meets Remi Boncoeur and his girlfriend Lee Ann. Remi arranges for Sal to take a job as a night watchman at a boarding camp for merchant sailors waiting for their ship. Not holding this job for long, Sal hits the road again. [...] "Oh, where is the girl I love?" [...] he wonders. Soon he meets Terry, the [...] "cutest little Mexican girl," [...] on the bus to Los Angeles. They stay together, traveling back to Bakersfield, then to Sabinal, [...] "her hometown," [...] where her family works in the fields. He meets Terry's brother Ricky, who teaches him the true meaning of [...] "mañana" [...] ("tomorrow"). Working in the cotton fields, Sal realizes that he is not made for this type of work. Leaving Terry behind, he takes the bus back to Times Square in New York City, bums a quarter off a preacher who looks the other way, and arrives at his Aunt's house in Paterson, just missing Dean, who had come to see him, by two days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{spoke to}} YOU, young Champion?" [...] Fogle said, and he flung down {{the top to}} Master Snivins. I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no fight; and perhaps Champion, too, was disappointed.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a thaw," [...] {{observed}} the prince. [...] "He went out skating quite early on purpose. Did he call {{out because he}} landed in the water, do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any shock that would hurt us, {{but we should}} have no air to breathe, and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dark and dismal." ...|$|R
50|$|Atwood {{was one of}} the 12 American {{track and}} field athletes who {{abruptly}} left Caracas after it became <b>known</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> stricter and improved drug testing at the 1983 Pan American Games.|$|R
60|$|Had any {{of those}} who pleaded so eloquently for his release known {{what it was to}} have a father {{tortured}} to death, as I <b>knew,</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> leas said in favor of such a wretch.|$|R
60|$|Ethel {{could answer}} with dignity, but her heart sank at {{the aspect of}} what she had undertaken. She <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> evil, but she had {{expected}} it in a more striking and less disagreeable form.|$|E
60|$|Her gown was a {{very simple}} one of sheer white organdie, and was the only evening dress she had. She <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> many smarter dresses at the reception, but the {{knowledge}} did not disturb her sensible head in the least.|$|E
60|$|Rob <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> trouble {{the moment}} he looked at this evil crew, and when they drew their daggers and pistols and began {{fiercely}} shouting in an unknown tongue, the boy sighed and took the electric tube from his coat pocket.|$|E
60|$|Neale laughed. He knew Red hated darkies--he {{suspected}} the Texan had thrown {{a gun on}} more than a few--and he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> surely <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a funeral in camp if he changed his lineman.|$|R
60|$|When old Mr. Salton {{had retired}} for the night, Adam and Sir Nathaniel {{returned}} to the study. Things went with great regularity at Lesser Hill, so they <b>knew</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no interruption to their talk.|$|R
60|$|So {{it was at}} last decided, much to Harry's own astonishment, much to his wife's delight. Kate, therefore, {{when she}} lay awake, {{thinking}} of the one word that had <b>been</b> spoken, <b>knew</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an opportunity for another word.|$|R
60|$|Nathaniel and I heard our master talking {{over the}} matter with the preacher, on the night the Council had given him full charge of {{everything}} save the dealings which might be had later with the London Company, therefore it was that we <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> different doings on the morrow.|$|E
6000|$|He slept {{upon his}} wrath, {{and in the}} morning early, at an hour when he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no loafers in the place, he went to an out-dated saddler's shop, and asked the owner, a veteran of his father's regiment, [...] "Welks, do you happen to have a cowhide among your antiquities?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame de Florac and {{my father}} talked about my profession. The Countess {{said it was a}} belle carriere. The Colonel said it was better than the army. 'Ah oui, monsieur,' says she very sadly. And then he said, 'that {{presently}} I should very likely come to study at Paris, when he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a kind friend to watch over son garcon.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. That is true; but we, like them, get our {{dividends}} {{whether we}} work or not. We work partly because we <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no dividends {{if we did}} not, and partly because if we refuse we are regarded as mentally deficient and put into a lethal chamber. But what do we work at? Before the few changes {{we were forced to}} make by the revolutions that followed the Four Years War, our governing classes had been so rich, as it was called, that they had become the most intellectually lazy and fat-headed people {{on the face of the}} earth. There is a good deal of that fat still clinging to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{he dropped}} his arms then I <b>knowed</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no gun-play. An' then Las Vegas got red in the face. He slapped Riggs with one hand, then with the other. An' he began to cuss him. I shore never knowed thet nice-spoken Las Vegas Carmichael could use such language. It was a stream of the baddest names known out here, an' lots I never heard of. Now an' then I caught somethin' like low-down an' sneak an' four-flush an' {{long-haired}} skunk, {{but for the most}} part they was just the cussedest kind of names. An' Las Vegas spouted them till he was black in the face, an' foamin' at the mouth, an' hoarser 'n a bawlin' cow.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{arrival of}} one of these story-tellers in a village was an {{important}} event. As soon as it became <b>known,</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a rush to the house where he was lodged, and every available seat - on bench, table, bed, beam, or the floor - <b>would</b> quickly <b>be</b> appropriated. And then, for hours together - just like some first-rate actor on a stage - the story-teller would hold his audience spell-bound. During his recitals, the emotions of the recitor were occasionally very strongly excited, as were also those of his listeners, who at one time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the verge of tears, at another give way to laughter. There were many of these listeners, by the way, who believed firmly in all the extravangances narrated.|$|R
