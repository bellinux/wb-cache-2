5|$|The {{northern}} pintail's breeding {{habitat is}} open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise {{a wider range}} of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.|$|E
5|$|VP6 {{forms the}} bulk of the capsid. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> {{antigenic}} and can be used to identify rotavirus species. This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus A infections.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree that grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E

5|$|Designed by Arnold Wolf from {{a concept}} {{elaborated}} by Richard Ranger, {{it is almost}} nine feet long and requires over a hundred-man hours of hand-finishing {{by a team of}} dedicated craftsmen. Resembling less a conventional loudspeaker than an elegant sideboard, it is a landmark product for the company that was sought after by the well-heeled and celebrities. With an estimated total production of about 1,000 units, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> sought after by collectors to this day.|$|E
5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high atomic number, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, {{even if it had}} once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> {{unlikely}} that Nicholas was born {{later than the}} 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, indicating that by that date he possessed a Master's degree. It was rare for someone under twenty years old or even older {{to have such a}} qualification in this period. The university or universities he attended are not known.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.epica has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, so {{is thought to be}} killed by fire. Like most Banksia species, however, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> unlikely that any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, {{if it turns out}} upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E

5|$|Nature {{has been}} more than lavish in her gifts to St. Johns. Travel as many miles as you like and go where you will, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> {{improbable}} that you will find a spot with so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E

5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> {{regarded}} and can be quite expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were {{consumed}} as meat after death, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> unlikely that dogs {{would have been}} eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs {{in the ancient world}} have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 a flock of mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often {{some distance from}} water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also {{had a significant impact}} on numbers. Nevertheless, owed to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.|$|E
5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} Pacific Coast {{breakpoints}} in the United States. They are, {{from north to}} south, Point Piedras Blancas, Point Sal, Point Conception, Point Mugu, {{the mouth of the}} San Gabriel River, San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the Tijuana River (although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant). Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> unlikely that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
