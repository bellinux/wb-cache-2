500|$|When {{dealing with}} the {{dialogue}} in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters {{as if they were}} actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: [...] "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them." [...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> books sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E

2500|$|Morton {{considered}} the tresillo/habanera (which {{he called the}} Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz.

2500|$|Charismatic Catholics {{and their}} {{practices}} {{have been criticized}} for distracting Catholics from authentic Church teachings and traditions, especially by making the worship experience more akin to Pentecostal Protestantism. According to Samuel Rodriguez, Charismatic services in America simply help in increasing the number of Catholics converting to Pentecostal and evangelical denominations: “If you are involved in a Charismatic service today, in ten years’ time—inevitably—you are going to end up <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> churches.” ...|$|E

So this MC started calling me Evil John to {{differentiate}} us. This was when I was doing Dracula and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, but I loved the name and wound up using it for my company." ...|$|E

Discussing his projects for 1952 {{in an interview with}} Contemporanul, Baconsky explained: [...] "I am especially interested in the matter of engineers who rose from the ranks of young workers.

2500|$|To the {{backdrop}} of the June 1975 Italian elections, Fo wrote Il Fanfani rapito (Fanfani Kidnapped)—a reference to Amintore Fanfani. Also in June 1975, Fo, Rame {{and other members of the}} company went to China—Fo later used his recollections of the trip in the monologue La storia della tigre (The Tale of a Tiger), with which he toured around Italy in 1978. The same year (1975) Fo was nominated for the Nobel Prize for the first time. He thought the idea absurd: [...] "I have become famous for my aversion to figures of reverence and genuflections of any kind. This Nobel business is a real comedy. I can imagine the look on the faces of certain state officials, magistrates and politicians I know. They take great pains to shut me up and clap me in handcuffs, and the Swedes go and play a trick like this ... would be like acting <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> plays." ...|$|E

[...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times.

2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{the casting}} of Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, Wainwright stated: [...] "we {{went for the}} best and we got them". The Guardian felt {{that one of the}} series' successes was the {{unlikely}} casting of a [...] "theatrical knight" [...] (Jacobi) and a [...] "TV Stalwart" [...] (Reid). Wainwright had not anticipated being able to secure an actor of Jacobi's calibre for the role of Alan, stating that she [...] "never imagined getting someone like him <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dramas", believing him to be in [...] "a different stratosphere". Upon casting Jacobi, Wainright felt that in addition to looking similar to Alec Walker, Jacobi embodied his personality perfectly, particularly his sense of humour. Jacobi was surprised to be offered the role of Alan; as his reputation centred on parts that were either [...] "posh", [...] "classical" [...] or [...] "costume". He enjoyed having the chance to play someone who is [...] "an ordinary fellow". He also felt the series provided a chance to depict a [...] "love story between two older characters that isn't patronising or stereotyped in any way". Wainwright felt that the two lead actors had a palpable chemistry that reflected her mother's second marriage. Reid and Jacobi also influenced the creative process— after Reid discovered Jacobi could jive, they implored Wainright to include a dance scene in an episode. Jacobi also inspired a scene in which two of Alan's friends (played by Roy Barraclough and Paul Copley) vie to be his best man. A teenage version of Alan is portrayed in flashback by Nico Mirallegro.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{interested}} {{to hear him}} express as his opinion what I had written him some time ago <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> letters, {{to the effect that}} if Germany won it would change the course of our civilization and make the United States a military nation. He also spoke of his deep regret, as indeed I did to him in that same letter, that it would check his policy for a better international ethical code. [...] He felt deeply the destruction of Louvain , and I found him as unsympathetic with the German attitude as is the balance of America. He goes even further than I in his condemnation of Germany's part in this war, and almost allows his feeling to include the German people as a whole rather than the leaders alone. He said German philosophy was essentially selfish and lacking in spirituality. When I spoke of the Kaiser building up the German machine as a means of maintaining peace, he said, [...] "What a foolish thing it was to create a powder magazine and risk someone's dropping a spark into it!" [...] He thought the war would throw the world back three or four centuries. I did not agree with him. He was particularly scornful of Germany’s disregard of treaty obligations, and was indignant at the German Chancellor’s designation of the Belgian Treaty as being [...] "only a scrap of paper"....But although the personal feeling of the President was with the Allies, he insisted then and for many months after, that this ought not to affect his political attitude, which he intended should be one of strict neutrality. [...] He felt that he owed it to the world to prevent the spreading of the conflagration, that he owed it to the country to save it from the horrors of war.|$|E
