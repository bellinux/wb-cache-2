40|$|Mice with uniparental partial or {{complete}} <b>disomies</b> {{for any one}} of 11 identified chromosomes show abnormal phenotypes. The abnormalities, or imprinting effects, can be attributable to an incorrect dosage of maternal or paternal copies of imprinted gene(s) located within the regions involved. Here we show that combinations of partial <b>disomies</b> may result in interactions between imprinting effects that seemingly independently affect fetal and/or placental growth in different ways or modify neonatal and postnatal imprinting effects. Candidate genes within the regions have been identified. The findings are generally {{in accord with the}} “conflict hypothesis” for the evolution of genomic imprinting but do not clearly demonstrate common growth axes within which imprinted genes may interact. Instead, it would seem that any gene that represses or limits embryonic/fetal growth to the advantage of the mother—by any developmental means—will have been subject to evolutionary selection for paternal allele repression. Likewise, any gene that favors embryonic/fetal development at consequent cost to the mother—by any developmental means—will have faced selection for maternal allele repression. The classical Igf 2 -Igf 2 r axis may therefore be unique. The findings involve reinterpretation of older imprinting data and consequently revision of the mouse imprinting map...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Human {{chromosome}} 14 q 32. 2 {{carries a}} cluster of imprinted genes. They include paternally expressed genes (PEGs) such as DLK 1 and RTL 1, and maternally expressed genes (MEGs) such as GTL 2 (alias, MEG 3), RTL 1 as (RTL 1 antisense), and MEG 8. Consistent with this, paternal and maternal uniparental <b>disomies</b> for chromosome 14 (upd(14) pat and upd(14) mat) cause distinct phenotypes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the underlying factors {{for the development of}} upd(14) pat and upd(14) mat phenotypes. The data available suggest that the DLK 1 -GTL 2 intergenic differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) {{plays an important role in}} the maternal to paternal epigenotypic switch, and that excessive RTL 1 expression and decreased DLK 1 and RTL 1 expression play a major role in the development of upd(14) pat-like and upd(14) mat-like phenotypes, respectively...|$|R

2500|$|A single-gene {{disorder}} {{is the result}} of a single mutated gene. Over 4000 human diseases are caused by single-gene defects. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and uniparental <b>disomy,</b> however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not [...] "hard and fast", although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, achondroplasia is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for achondroplasia have a severe skeletal disorder of which achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers. Sickle-cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition. When a couple where one partner or both are sufferers or carriers of a {{single-gene disorder}} wish to have a child, they can do so through in vitro fertilization, which means they can then have a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to check whether the embryo has the genetic disorder.|$|E

Their DNAs were analyzed with Affymetrix 100 K arrays.

In one patient, we found a deletion affecting only a single gene, MBD 5, which codes for the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 5.

Here we discuss how imprinted genes cause diseases and tumors and summarize the recent advances of studies on the molecular basis of this epigenetic phenomenon. In particular, we focus on two well-characterized imprinted chromosomal regions, namely the human Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region and the mouse INS 2 /IGF 2 /H 19 region.

We quantify the stringency of our methodology and relate it to previous non-tissue-specific large-scale studies.

The regions of conserved linkage in the human genome are associated with the Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS) and Beckwith–Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) where imprinting is known to be a contributing factor.

The advances in molecular and clinical diagnosis of ImpDis help to circumvent these issues, and they are accompanied by an increasing understanding of the pathomechanism behind them.
