40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} critical evaluation of “behaviorally informed paternalism” as exemplified in the arguments contained in Sarah Conly’s “Against Autonomy”. Recent developments in cognitive psychology have questioned whether a given agent is sufficiently capable of managing her own wellbeing. Conly argues for a hard version of legal paternalism, which <b>implies</b> <b>coercion</b> and overrides autonomy {{in the name of}} promoting the wellbeing or interests of those being governed. We examine the core argument of coercive paternalism through the perspectives of John Stuart Mill’s “On Liberty” and ‘libertarian paternalism’. We find the central argument for coercive paternalism wanting and argue for the preservation of the intrinsic value of decision rights contained in the doctrine of the ‘nudge’...|$|R

This argument {{is also a}} false dilemma: nothing <b>implies</b> that <b>coercion</b> and fear of punishment produces better soldiers than voluntarity, and that a professional army could not be assembled from the nation's own citizens.|$|R
30|$|Many authors {{state that}} power {{appears to be}} synonymous with oppression, coercion, and force, {{despite the fact that}} such {{negative}} approaches are just one aspect of power (Duke 1998). Despite criticism of power as the antithesis of trust, Kumar et al. (1995) contend that trusting partnerships can be built between unequals but only if the powerful party treats the weaker, vulnerable party fairly. A body of literature states that power can be used by the focal actor as an effective tool in coordinating and promoting harmonious relationships, solving conflicts, and, therefore, enhancing the performance of the whole network as well as its individual members. Some authors who have emphasized power’s positive aspects argue that possession of power does not suggest exploitation or frequent use of coercion (Blau 1964; Stern and Heskett 1969). Power does not necessarily <b>imply</b> <b>coercion</b> or use of force; it may involve any degree of compulsion, from the gentlest suggestion to absolute domination (Beier and Stern 1969).|$|R
40|$|Roemer's {{attempt to}} {{undermine}} the normative reasons that Marxists have thought exploitation important (domination, alienation, and inequality) is vitiated by several crucial errors. First, Roemer ignores the dimension of freedom which is Marx's main concern and replaces it {{with an interest in}} justice, which Marx rejected. This leads him to misconstrue the nature of exploitation as Marx understands it. Second, his procedure for disconnecting these evils from exploitation, or denying their importance, involves the methodological assumption that exploitation must strictly imply these evils. He thus fails to see that exploitation may 'cause' domination, alienation, and inequality; this assumption and the focus on justice also lead him to overlook the sort of alienation that is most important to Marx and the way exploitation, as Marx understands it, does <b>imply</b> <b>coercion.</b> Roemer's alternative conception of exploitation thus fails to capture basic Marxist normative and explanatory concerns. But Roemer's insistence on the importance of justice and the need for an articulated alternative to capitalism are a necessary supplement to a Marxist account...|$|R
60|$|The above comments, {{based on}} the drift of {{political}} practice {{during the past decade}} and a half, may be taken for what they are worth. Predictions are precarious. The average American will be inclined to regard the program of the new British Labour Party as the embodiment of what he vaguely calls Socialism, and to him the very word is repugnant. Although he may never have heard of Marx, it is the Marxian conception that comes to his mind, and this <b>implies</b> <b>coercion,</b> a government that constantly interferes with his personal liberty, that compels him to tasks for which he has no relish. But your American, and your Englishman, for that matter, is inherently an individualist he wants as little government as is compatible with any government at all. And the descendants of the continental Europeans who flock to our shores are Anglo-Saxonized, also become by environment and education individualists. The great importance of preserving this individualism, this spirit in our citizens of self-reliance, this suspicion against too much interference with personal liberty, must at once be admitted. And any scheme for a social order that tends to eliminate and destroy it should by Americans be summarily rejected.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an expanded}} framework for social planning {{in which the}} existence of coercion is explicitly acknowledged. Key issues concern the precise definition of coercion for individuals and in the aggregate, its difference from redistribution, and its incorporation into normative analysis. We explore modifications to traditional rules for optimal fiscal policy {{in the presence of}} coercion constraints and determine the degree of <b>coercion</b> <b>implied</b> by traditional social planning. The paper maps the trade-off between social welfare and aggregate coercion and explores its implications for normative policy and the comparative evaluation of institutions, including competitive democracy. coercion, redistribution, social planning, optimal fiscal policy, marginal cost of funds, public goods, collective choice...|$|R
50|$|Coercive {{power is}} the {{application}} of negative influences. It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards. The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power. Coercive power {{tends to be the}} most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it. Threats and punishment are common tools of <b>coercion.</b> <b>Implying</b> or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges, or given undesirable assignments - these are examples of using coercive power. Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting, and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership.|$|R
40|$|The silence about {{population}} growth in recent decades has hindered the ability of those concerned with ecological change, resource scarcity, health and educational systems, national security, and other global challenges to look with maximum objectivity at the problems they confront. Two central questions about population—(i) is {{population growth}} a problem? and (2) what causes fertility decline?—are often intertwined; if people think the second question <b>implies</b> possible <b>coercion,</b> or fear of upsetting cultures, they can be {{reluctant to talk about}} the first. The classic and economic theories explaining the demographic transition assume that couples want many children and they make decisions to have a smaller family when some socio-economic change occurs. However, there are numerous anomalies to this explanation. This paper suggests that the societal changes are neither necessary nor sufficient for family size to fall. Many barriers of non-evidence-based restrictive medical rules, cost, misinformation and social traditions exist between women and the fertility regulation methods and correct information they need to manage their family size. When these barriers are reduced, birth rates tend to decline. Many of the barriers reflect a patriarchal desire to control women, which can be largely explained by evolutionary biology. The theoretical explanations of fertility should (i) attach more weight to the many barriers to voluntary fertility regulation, (ii) recognize that a latent desire to control fertility may be far more prevalent among women than previously understood, and (iii) appreciate that women implicitly and rationally make benefit–cost analyses based on the information they have, wanting modern family planning only after they understand it is a safe option. Once it is understood that fertility can be lowered by purely voluntary means, comfort with talking about the population factor in development will rise...|$|R
5000|$|In Argentina Virginia Bolten is {{responsible}} for the publication of a newspaper called [...] (The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901. A similar paper with the same name was reportedly published later in Montevideo, which suggests that Bolten may also have founded and edited it after her deportation. [...] "La Voz de la Mujer described itself as “dedicated to the advancement of Communist Anarchism.” Its central theme was that of the multiple nature of women's oppression. An editorial asserted, “We believe that in present-day society nothing and nobody has a more wretched situation than unfortunate women.” Women, they said, were doubly oppressed - by bourgeois society and by men. Its feminism can be seen from its attack on marriage and upon male power over women. Its contributors, like anarchist feminists elsewhere, developed a concept of oppression that focused on gender oppression. Marriage was a bourgeois institution which restricted women's freedom, including their sexual freedom. Marriages entered into without love, fidelity maintained through fear rather than desire, oppression of women by men they hated - all were seen as symptomatic of the <b>coercion</b> <b>implied</b> by the marriage contract. It was this alienation of the individual's will that the anarchist feminists deplored and sought to remedy, initially through free love and then, and more thoroughly, through social revolution." ...|$|R
