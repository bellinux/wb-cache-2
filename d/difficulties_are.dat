5|$|Subtle {{problems}} with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of {{the early stages of}} AD. Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory <b>difficulties</b> <b>are</b> also common.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep <b>difficulties,</b> <b>are</b> also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood <b>difficulties</b> <b>are</b> depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the <b>difficulties</b> <b>are</b> removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial <b>difficulties</b> <b>are</b> also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his <b>difficulties</b> <b>are</b> manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all {{add up to a}} picture of an army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment <b>difficulties</b> <b>are</b> confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of self-mutilation to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in the army of the Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength is powerful evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} five {{difficulties with}} modelling demographic behaviour using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), with particular reference to innovation diffusion {{in the use}} of contraceptive practices. The first <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> the thin character of information and activities relevant to contraception within the wider framework of social action. The second <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> ensuring the correct relationship between ABM and existing theories, either based on aggregate statistical patterns or strong homogeneity assumptions about individuals. The third <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> ensuring an adequate representation of the contextual nature of social action, both in time and space. The fourth <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> to represent the complexity of decision processes adequately, so they can take account of the transmission of different kinds of information: norms, costs and benefits, practices and so on. The final <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> the possibility of collecting relevant data for building and testing ABMs. The chapter also draws attention to the connections between these difficulties and suggests solutions where these exist. In some cases, like the modelling of thin processes and cognitive complexity, considering social behaviour from an ABM perspective reveals important challenges for social science research that are obscured by other approaches to modelling. 1...|$|R
50|$|Two {{interpret}}ations of <b>difficulty</b> <b>are</b> possible. The first way to interpret experienced <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> that {{it reflects the}} importance of a task or of attaining a goal. Experienced difficulty in this case suggests that although the path may be difficult, it is worth it, as articulated in the saying “no pain, no gain.” The second way to interpret experienced <b>difficulty</b> <b>is</b> that it reflects the possibility of failing in a task or of attaining a goal. Experienced difficulty in this case reflects that the goal is unlikely or even impossible. The same objective experience of <b>difficulty</b> can <b>be</b> interpreted either way depending on which cues are available in the particular moment and what the identities currently on one’s mind seem to mean for action.|$|R
