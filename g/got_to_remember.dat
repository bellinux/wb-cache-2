500|$|Brown {{personally}} clarified his position. He said, [...] "We {{will not}} allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the relationship between Britain and America and between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} in July 2007, Brown {{clarified}} his position regarding Britain's relationship with the USA [...] "We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Mission Status Briefing, lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick {{noted that}} there was no way to know what caused the bag to come loose. [...] "We don't know that this {{incident}} occurred because they forgot to tether something. We don't know if perhaps the hook just came loose inside the bag," [...] Kerrick said. [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes." [...] Kerrick noted that the team would be taking extra precautions to avoid any further problems with the grease guns, by attaching them to the outside of the bags instead of inside to prevent the plungers from being inadvertently activated.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, my lads," [...] Johnson shouted, in his cheery voice, [...] "you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fight. <b>Remember,</b> if {{they get}} inside not one of you will ever {{go back to your}} {{families}} to tell the tale, while if you fight bravely you will beat them back sure enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, if I {{only had}} a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't <b>got</b> {{anything}} now <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> him by." [...] And she choked back a little sob.|$|R
2500|$|After {{his return}} in 1855, Hunt founded the first American {{architectural}} school at his Tenth Street Studio Building (beginning with only four students), co-founded the American Institute of Architects and from 1888 to 1891 {{served as the}} Institute's third president, brought the first apartment building to Manhattan {{in a burst of}} scandal, and set a new ostentatious style of grand houses for the social elite and the eccentric, competitive new millionaires of the Gilded Age. His philosophy of architectural work may be summed up in his quote [...] "The first thing you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that it's your client's money you're spending. Your goal is to achieve the best results by following their wishes. If they want you to build a house upside down standing on its chimney, it's up to you to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "If {{there was}} a hero, Glynn Lunney was, by himself, a hero, because when he walked in the room, I {{guarantee}} you, nobody knew {{what the hell was}} going on. [...] Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation. [...] I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career. [...] Absolutely magnificent. [...] No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. [...] He and he alone brought all of the scared people together. [...] And you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the flight controllers in those days were -- they were kids in their thirties. [...] They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that. [...] All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken. [...] They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My boy, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{the exact}} spot and the exact marks the boat lay in {{when we had}} the shoalest water, in {{everyone}} of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New Orleans; and you mustn't get the shoal soundings and marks of one trip mixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, either, for they're not often twice alike. You must keep them separate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's kind of you, Polly," [...] said Watty {{coming up}} with a huge bundle of grass and foliage for bedding at the moment; [...] "but Ben has <b>got</b> friends <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> him as well as you. Bob Corkey and I have made him a hut {{on the other side of}} the bushes--there, you may see the top of it through the leaves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Giles Blair, Purvis's boss at Q6; {{sophisticated}} and worldly, he {{has none of}} Purvis's internal doubts and so has great difficulty grasping the crux of Purvis's dilemma. 'I never really got beyond us being British and them being atheists and communists. You can't argue with that so I think I rather switched off after that point.....All you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do is <b>remember</b> what you believe.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{commentary}} to the Surangama Sutra, Venerable Master Hsuan Hua {{tells the}} following fable: [...] Originally every Buddha had ten thousand names. In time these ten thousand names {{were reduced to}} one thousand because people <b>got</b> confused trying <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> them all. For a while every Buddha had a thousand names, but people still couldnâ€™t remember so many, so they were again reduced to one hundred names. Every Buddha had a hundred different names and living beings {{had a hard time}} remembering them, so they were shortened again to ten.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've {{got them}} on our hands, and we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I {{wish we could}} hear of a country that's out of kings." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lize {{struggled}} to a sitting position. [...] "There's some mistake about this. Ross Cavanagh never was the whifflin' kind of man. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> he's on duty. Probably {{the letter was}} some order that carried him right back to his work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk like}} that," [...] said Ashe. [...] "That's another {{thing you have}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> If my {{treatment}} is to be successful you must not let yourself think in that way. You must exercise self-control mentally. You must think beautiful thoughts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{going over}} the top tomorrow, Rilla-my-Rilla," [...] wrote Walter. [...] "I wrote mother and Di yesterday, but somehow I feel as if I must write you tonight. I hadn't {{intended}} to do any writing tonight--but I've <b>got</b> <b>to.</b> Do you <b>remember</b> old Mrs. Tom Crawford over-harbour, who was always {{saying that it was}} 'laid on her' to do such and such a thing? Well, that is just how I feel. It's 'laid on me' to write you tonight--you, sister and chum of mine. There are some things I want to say before--well, before tomorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ropes. I was {{up against}} 'em more times than I like <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> Gee! He {{certainly}} gave me mine. But I fooled 'm. He couldn't put me out. I lasted the twenty rounds, an' I wanta tell you he's <b>got</b> some marks <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> me by. If he ain't {{got a couple of}} knuckles broke in the left hand I'm a geezer.--Here, feel my head here. Swollen, eh? Sure thing. He hit that more times than he's wishin' he had right now. But, oh, what a lacin'! What a lacin'! I never had anything like it before. The Chicago Terror, they call 'm. I take my hat off to 'm. He's some bear. But I could a-made 'm take the count if I'd ben in condition an' had my wind.--Oh! Ouch! Watch out! It's like a boil!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Brookes {{was also}} an early {{supporter}} of the fledgling acid house scene by championing Stakker Humanoid, a November 1988 hit for Humanoid (AKA Brian Dougans). In a 2013 interview with The Guardian, Brookes {{explained that he was}} given a white label of the record and immediately fell under its spell. [...] "It just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> me. I <b>remember</b> listening <b>to</b> it and thinking it was one step ahead of everything techno that was coming out. It wasn't copying anything else; it was just fabulous." [...] As a result, he played the record twice in one show - a very unusual step for a prime-time radio DJ.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, no. I {{meant what}} Hamlet {{says to the}} players. 'Nor do not saw the air too much, with your hand, thus, but use all gently.' That's what you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> in boxing, sir. Take it easy. Easy and cool does it, and the {{straight}} left beats the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In for a penny, {{in for a}} pound," [...] he said. [...] "Very well, Prue. We {{wipe off}} all scores and begin afresh. But there must be no more such doings. You've worked your little scheme through--trust a Foster for that! But in future you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that in law you're a Melville {{whatever}} you are in fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well--sure--Course {{you might}} say--" [...] Babbitt was {{conscious}} of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and relentless eye. [...] "Gosh, you know where I stand! I'm no labor agitator! I'm a business man, first, last, and all the time! But--but honestly, I don't think Doane means so badly, and you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> he's {{an old friend of}} mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Itâ€™s your plan, Captain Barber," [...] he said, impressively, [...] "and {{nobody can}} tell a man like you {{how it should be}} done. It wants acting, and youâ€™ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have a good memory <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that you havenâ€™t got a memory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've desired Hetty <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> as she's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> dance wi' you, sir," [...] {{said the}} good {{innocent}} woman; [...] "for she's so thoughtless, she'd be like {{enough to go}} an' engage herself for ivery dance. So I {{told her not to}} promise too many." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, {{springing}} fiercely to her feet: [...] "Go, indeed! Renounce me! Be so good as <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that you}} haven't <b>got</b> me <b>TO</b> renounce!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{laughed at}} that, {{but the next}} moment she was serious again. 'A man's got {{to fall out of}} love before he falls into it again,' she replied. 'I want a man that'll stop there. Besides,' she goes on, 'a woman isn't always young and pretty: we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that. We want {{something}} else in a husband besides eyes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope she}} is not {{becoming}} too clever for you. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that you're due elsewhere;--eh, old fellow?" [...] This was the first word that Herriot had said on the subject, and to that word Frank Greystock made no answer. But it had its effect, as also did the gloomy looks of Miss Macnulty, and the not unobserved presence of Mr. Andy Gowran on various occasions.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got to {{bear that}} in mind. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{it if you}} forget {{everything}} else. I don't appear in this business in any way whatsoever. If you get caught you take what's coming to you without a word. You can't turn round and say: 'I am innocent. Mr. Peters will explain all'--because Mr. Peters certainly won't. Mr. Peters won't utter a syllable of protest {{if they want to}} hang you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you realize}} a {{fraction}} of the awful things you have let me in for? How on earth am I <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> whether I go in before the chef or after the third footman? I shan't have a peaceful minute while I'm in this place. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> sit and listen by the hour to a bore of a butler who seems to be a sort of walking hospital. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> steer my way through a complicated system of etiquette.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must go tomorrow, {{because on}} Saturday I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> prepare my sermon, {{and you must}} tell Emma to get your things ready today. You can bring all your toys. And if you want {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> your father and mother by you can take one thing for each of them. Everything {{else is going to}} be sold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{of course}} it would be {{pleasant}} <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> for the very reason we were out so late was that Nikolaus <b>got</b> <b>to</b> telling how good you are to him, and how he never got whipped when you were by to save him; {{and he was so}} full of it, and we were so full of the interest of it, that none of us noticed how late it was getting." ...|$|R
60|$|I couldn't {{help feeling}} {{that this was a}} bit of luck for the widowers; but I didn't say so. One has always <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that {{opinions}} differ about girls. One man's peach, so to speak, is another man's poison. I have met men who didn't like Grace Bates, men who, if Heloise Miller or Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs, would have used them to cut the pages of a novel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> she's sick, and I {{shall need}} a little sympathy myself if she keeps on at me this way. I believe I'll tell her about my liver next time, and see how she likes it. Look here, Miss Claxon! Couldn't we get her off {{to some of those}} German {{watering}} places that are good for her complaints? I believe it would be the best thing for her--not to mention me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Willy Croup smiled. She did {{not believe}} that Mrs. Cliff really knew how much such a chimney would cost, but she said, [...] "You have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> you know, that we can't have the Cuthberts here to dinner to-morrow if the masons come to work at that chimney. Ten to one they will have to take the most part of it down, and we shall be in a general mess here for a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{been for}} six months. Some sport, I can tell you, Nora. I've {{got a little}} machine gun that's a perfect daisy. Gee! I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> pull up. The hardest work we fellows have {{sometimes}} is <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that we mustn't talk about our job. They {{used to call me}} undisciplined. I'm getting it into my bones now, though.--Why, Nora, this is queer! I guess we're going to have a cocktail together, aren't we?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Billy, here's {{the lesson}} that you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> learn. Besides <b>remembering</b> {{everything}} that I have told you, and only answering questions {{in the way that}} I have partly explained, and will explain more fully at another time, you will take particular note that we left the Thames to-day all right with a full cargo--Jim Welton bein' master, and one passenger bein' aboard, whom we agreed to put ashore at Ramsgate. That you heard me say the vessel and cargo were insured for 300 pounds, but were worth more, and that I said I hoped to make a quick voyage over and back. Besides all this, Billy, boy, you'll keep a sharp look-out, and won't be surprised if I should teach you to steer, and get the others on board to go below. If you should observe me do anything while you are steering, or should hear any noises, you'll be so busy with the tiller and the compass that you'll forget all about that, and never be able to answer any questions about such things at all. Have I made all that quite plain to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{a bit of}} it,' said Stalky cheerfully. 'He's {{a little}} shaken and excited. Probably Beetle annoyed him in the garage, but we must {{overlook}} that. We've contained him so far, and I'm going to nibble round his outposts at dinner. All you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do, Infant, is <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> you're a gentleman in your own house. Don't hop! You'll find it pretty difficult before dinner's over. I don't want to hear anything at all from you, Beetle.' ...|$|R
