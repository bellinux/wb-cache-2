5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of gamma rays, which are the most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the <b>emission</b> <b>source,</b> the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|A TEM is {{composed}} of several components, which include a vacuum {{system in which the}} electrons travel, an electron <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> for generation of the electron stream, a series of electromagnetic lenses, as well as electrostatic plates. The latter two allow the operator to guide and manipulate the beam as required. Also required is a device to allow the insertion into, motion within, and removal of specimens from the beam path. Imaging devices are subsequently used to create an image from the electrons that exit the system.|$|E
50|$|Lower-resolution {{systems can}} use {{thermionic}} sources, {{which are usually}} formed from lanthanum hexaboride. However, systems with higher-resolution requirements need to use field electron <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> such as heated W/ZrO2 for lower energy spread and enhanced brightness. Thermal field <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> are preferred over cold <b>emission</b> <b>sources,</b> {{in spite of the}} former's slightly larger beam size, because they offer better stability over typical writing times of several hours.|$|R

25|$|From the top down, the TEM {{consists}} of an <b>emission</b> <b>source,</b> which may be a tungsten filament or needle, or a lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) single crystal source. The gun is connected to a high voltage source (typically ~100–300 kV) and, given sufficient current, the gun will begin to emit electrons either by thermionic or field electron emission into the vacuum. The electron source is typically mounted in a Wehnelt cylinder to provide preliminary focus of the emitted electrons into a beam. The upper lenses of the TEM then further focus the electron beam to the desired size and location.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of TEM, the associated technique of {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) was re-investigated and did not become developed until the 1970s, with Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago developing the field emission gun and adding a high quality objective lens to create the modern STEM. Using this design, Crewe demonstrated the ability to image atoms using annular dark-field imaging. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates. In 2008, Jannick Meyer et al. described the direct visualization of light atoms such as carbon and even hydrogen using TEM and a clean single-layer graphene substrate.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structure}} {{can also}} be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as phase contrast. When using a field <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed {{due to differences in}} phase of electron waves, which is caused by specimen interaction. Image formation is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in complex phase retrieval techniques.|$|E

500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed {{during that period of time}} and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|E
500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E
2500|$|... "EPA {{developed}} the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations {{of interest for}} further study, {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of the risks. NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources, but rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, <b>emission</b> <b>source</b> types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk. This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest. Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter. Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged." ...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{is known to}} have far-ranging impacts on human health through to climate forcing. The characterization of <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and the quantification of specific source impacts to PM concentrations significantly enhance our understanding of, and our ability to, eventually predicting the fate and transport of atmospheric PM and its associated impacts on humans and the environment. Recent advances in source apportionment applications have contributed unique combinations of chemical and numerical techniques for determining the contributions of specific sources, including diesel exhaust and biomass burning. These advances also identify and help characterize the contributions of previously uncharacterized sources. Numerical modeling has also enabled estimations of contributions of <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> to atmospherically processed PM in urban and rural regions. Investigation into the <b>emissions</b> <b>sources</b> driving air quality is currently of concern across the globe.

30|$|Studies {{about both}} {{industrial}} and remote locations {{have reported that}} WSOC accounts for approximately 20 – 67  % of the total particulate carbon in the atmosphere (Sempere and Kawamura 1994). The WSOC fraction in OC also shows a clear spatial variation. The Saraikela Kharsawan site has the lowest WSOC fraction, whereas the industrial site Adityapur has the highest WSOC fraction in any a given season.

At the Adityapur, the aerosol loadings are heavily influenced by the industrial, local vehicular <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> and other primary <b>emission</b> <b>sources</b> (e.g. cooking fumes).

Additionally, a tracer species should not be formed in the atmosphere and it should not volatilize during transport so that mass balance is maintained.
