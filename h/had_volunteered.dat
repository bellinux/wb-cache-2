5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|Dedaković's second-in-command, Branko Borković, {{was another}} former JNA officer who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for service in Vukovar. The two men {{established}} a unified command structure, organised the defenders {{into a single}} brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 {{the call}} {{went out for}} volunteers from among the serving Army {{soldiers}} within certain formations still in Britain, and men of the disbanding Divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army Divisions who had seen service in Norway. In November 1940 the new army units were organised into a Special Service Brigade under Brigadier J. C. Haydon, with four Special Service Battalions. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for commando training.|$|E

5|$|In North Africa, Rommel {{received}} help in cultivating {{his image}} from Alfred Ingemar Berndt, {{a senior official}} at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for military service. Seconded by Goebbels, Berndt was assigned to Rommel's staff {{and became one of}} his closest aides. Berndt often acted as liaison between Rommel, the Propaganda Ministry and the Führer Headquarters. He directed Rommel's photo shoots and filed radio dispatches describing the battles.|$|E
5|$|Spencer reached Fort Hamilton {{around the}} same time that Colonel William S. Hamilton arrived with a large group of Menominee who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> against the Sauk and Fox. Afraid that the fort had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally drove him into the open where he {{realized}} his mistake.|$|E
5|$|The Dakotas, who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> 150 warriors {{to fight}} against the Sauks and Meskwakis, also arrived too late to {{participate}} in the Battle of Bad Axe, but they pursued the members of the British Band who made it across the Mississippi into Iowa. On about August 9, in the final engagement of the war, they attacked the remnants of the British Band along the Cedar River, killing 68 and taking 22 prisoners. Ho-Chunks also hunted survivors of the British Band, taking between fifty and sixty scalps.|$|E

5|$|The normal annual {{recruitment}} for the Indian {{army was}} 15,000 men, {{during the course}} of the war over 800,000 men volunteered for the army and more than 400,000 volunteered for non-combatant roles. In total almost 1.3 million men <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for service by 1918. Over one million Indian troops served overseas during the war. In total, at least 74,187 Indian soldiers died in World War I.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> in all by 13 August.|$|E
5|$|After the Dieppe raid, a {{long period}} of lull {{followed}} for No. 3 Commando during which time they were based around Weymouth and were brought back up to strength with an intake of 120 former policemen who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for service with the Commandos and had just completed their training at the Commando Depot at Achnacarry in Scotland. In January 1943, however, the unit received orders to move to Gibraltar, where they were stationed as a precaution in case Germany decided to invade Spain. While there the commanding officer, John Durnford-Slater, carried out reconnaissance of potential targets in Spain from the air and sent officers on leave across the border to gather intelligence.|$|E

5|$|By November 1940, {{more than}} 2,000 men <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> and were {{organised}} into four battalions in a Special Service Brigade, {{under the command}} of Brigadier J. C. Haydon. The Brigade quickly expanded to 12 battalions, which were renamed commandos. Each commando had a lieutenant colonel as the commanding officer (CO) and numbered around 450 men (divided into 75 man troops that were further divided into 15 man sections). Technically these men were only on secondment to the commandos; they retained their regimental cap badges and remained on the regimental roll for pay. The new force of commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Frost {{also met}} RAF Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox, who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> to {{accompany}} C Company for the operation; {{as an expert}} radio mechanic, {{it would be his}} job to locate the Würzburg radar set, photograph it, and to dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain. Derek Garrard of Jones' team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox, as he would be the object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform, but the War Office were obdurate.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act {{called for}} {{creation}} of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste, and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> to host the facility. Kōchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.|$|E

5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{became the}} head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his {{scientific}} and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate. There were two bomb assembly teams, a Fat Man Assembly Team under Commander Norris Bradbury and Roger Warner, and a Little Boy Assembly under Birch. Philip Morrison was {{the head of}} the Pit Crew, Bernard Waldman and Luis Alvarez led the Aerial Observation Team, and Sheldon Dike was in charge of the Aircraft Ordnance Team. Physicists Robert Serber and William Penney, and US Army Captain James F. Nolan, a medical expert, were special consultants. All members of Project Alberta <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for the mission.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} RAAF's {{airfield}} construction squadrons were disbanded {{at the end of}} the war, on 17November 1945 5ACS {{was informed}} that it would form part of Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. For this deployment it was assigned to No.81 Wing. 5ACS' advance party arrived in Japan in late 1945 and the rest of the squadron arrived at Iwakuni to the east of Hiroshima on 22February 1946. At this time the unit was under strength as only 14 officers and 189 airmen <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for occupation duties, though a further 173 personnel arrived in March and April.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months of}} his leaving the premiership Chamberlain's health began to fail; he {{resigned}} from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940. Dunglass <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had {{a hole in his}} spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery he would have been unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient's shin.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} {{war broke out}} in Europe, the Australian armed forces were less {{prepared}} than at the outbreak of World WarI in August 1914. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the best-prepared of the three services, was small and equipped with only two heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, two sloops, five obsolete destroyers {{and a number of}} small and auxiliary warships. The Australian Army comprised a small permanent cadre of 3,000men and 80,000part-time militiamen who <b>had</b> <b>volunteered</b> for training with the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). The Royal Australian Air Force(RAAF), the weakest of the services, had 246aircraft, few of them modern. While the Commonwealth Government began a large military expansion and transferred some RAAF aircrew and units to British control upon the outbreak of war, it was unwilling to immediately dispatch an expeditionary force overseas due to the threat posed by Japanese intervention.|$|E
