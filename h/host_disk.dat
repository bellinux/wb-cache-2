50|$|The ring is not {{actually}} polar, but rather has an inclination {{from the plane}} of the <b>host</b> <b>disk</b> of approximately 45 degrees. The extreme number of pinkish star-forming areas that occurs along the galaxy's ring could be the result of the gravitation interaction caused by this collision. The ring is 50,000 light-years across - much broader than the disk itself - and has a greater amount of gas and star formation than the host ring. This likely indicates a very violent formation. The polar ring contains objects numbering in the hundreds. Many of these are red and blue supergiant stars. The most recently created stars in the ring were just formed approximately 7 million years ago. This indicates that the formation of these stars has been a long process and is still occurring.|$|E

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} orbital {{evolution of}} star clusters (SCs) {{under the influence}} of dynamical friction by field stars of their <b>host</b> <b>disk</b> galaxies embedded in dark matter halos. We find that SCs with masses larger than 2 * 10 ^ 5 M_sun can show significant orbital decay within less than 1 Gyr due to dynamical friction by disk field stars in galaxies with disk masses M_d less than 10 ^ 9 M_sun. We also find that orbital decay of SCs due to dynamical friction is more remarkable in disk galaxies with smaller M_d and higher mass-ratios of disks to dark matter halos. The half-number radii R_h, sc and mean masses within R_h,sc of the SC systems (SCSs) in low-mass disk galaxies with M_d < 10 ^ 9 M_sun are found to evolve significantly with time owing to dynamical friction of SCs. More massive SCs that can spiral-in to the central regions of disks can form multiple SC systems with smaller velocity dispersions so that they can merge with one another to form single stellar nuclei with their masses comparable to ~ 0. 4 % of their <b>host</b> <b>disk</b> masses. Based on these results, we suggest that luminosity functions (LFs) for more massive globular clusters (GCs) with masses larger than 2 * 10 ^ 5 M_sun can steepen owing to transformation of the more massive GCs into single stellar nuclei through GC merging in less luminous galaxies. We also suggest that the half-number radii of GC systems can evolve owing to dynamical friction only for galaxies with their total masses smaller than ~ 10 ^{ 10 } M_sun.

Due to the small angular separation from their central star, only long-baseline interferometry provides the angular resolving power to detect disk asymmetries associated to protoplanets at solar system scales in nearby star-forming regions. In particular, infrared observations are crucial to observe scattered stellar radiation and thermal re-emission in the vicinity of embedded companions directly. For this purpose we performed radiative transfer simulations to calculate the thermal re-emission and scattered stellar flux from a protoplanetary disk hosting an embedded companion. Based on that, visibilities and closure phases are calculated to simulate observations with the future beam combiner MATISSE, operating at the L, M and N bands at the VLTI.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{physical}} model for how galactic disks survive and/or are destroyed in mergers and interactions. Based on simple dynamical arguments, {{we show that}} gas primarily loses angular momentum to internal torques in a merger, induced by {{the gravity of the}} secondary. Gas within some characteristic radius, determined by the efficiency of this angular momentum loss (itself a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, and gas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum to the stars sharing the perturbed <b>host</b> <b>disk,</b> fall to the center and be consumed in a starburst. We use a similar analysis to determine where violent relaxation of the pre-merger stellar disks is efficient on final coalescence. Our model describes both the dissipational and dissipationless components of the merger, and allows us to predict, for a given arbitrary encounter, the stellar and gas content of the material that will survive (without significant angular momentum loss or violent relaxation) to re-form a disk in the merger remnant, versus being dissipationlessly violently relaxed or dissipationally losing angular momentum and forming a compact central starburst. We test these predictions with a large library of hydrodynamic merger simulations, and show that they agree well (with small scatter) with the properties of simulated merger remnants as a function of merger mass ratio, orbital parameters, and gas distributions, in simulations which span a wide range of parameter space in thes...|$|E

However, {{except for a few}} special cases, the specific inclinations of individual AGN are unknown. We have developed a promising technique for determining the inclinations of nearby AGN by mapping the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (NLRs), which are often easily resolved with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) [O III] imaging and long-slit spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Our studies indicate that NLR kinematics dominated by radial outflow can be fit with simple biconical outflow models {{that can be used to}} determine the inclination of the bicone axis, and hence the obscuring torus, with respect to our line of sight. We present NLR analysis of 53 Seyfert galaxies and resultant inclinations from models of 17 individual AGN with clear signatures of biconical outflow. Our model results agree with the unified model in that Seyfert 1 AGN have NLRs inclined further toward our line of sight (LOS) than Seyfert 2 AGN. Knowing the inclinations of these AGN NLRs, and thus their accretion disk and/or torus axes, will allow us to determine how their observed properties vary as a function of polar angle. We find no correlation between the inclinations of the AGN NLRs and the disks of their host galaxies, indicating that the orientation of the gas in the torus is independent from that of the <b>host</b> <b>disk.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series - 116 pages, 69 figure...|$|E

40|$|Migration of protoplanets {{in their}} gaseous <b>host</b> <b>disks</b> may be largely {{responsible}} for the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. Recent simulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to drive accretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into an orbital random walk. However, these simulations neglected the disk’s ionization structure. Low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouple the magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or no turbulence. Here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetary migration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratified disk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above and below the midplane. Turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but still measurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the disk midplane. We find a decrease of two orders of magnitude in the diffusion coefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratios approaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks.

40|$|The cold {{dark matter}} (CDM) model has two unsolved issues: {{simulations}} overpredict the satellite abundance around the Milky Way (MW) and it disagrees with observations of the central densities of dwarf galaxies which prefer constant density (core) profiles. One alternative explanation known as the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model, assumes that the dark matter is a scalar field of mass(∼ 10 ^- 22 eV/c^ 2); this model can reduce the overabundance issue {{due to the lack}} of halo formation below a mass scale of ∼ 10 ^ 8 M_ and successfully fits the density distribution in dwarfs. One of the attractive features of the model is predicting core profiles in halos, although the determination of the core sizes is set by fitting the observational data. We perform N-body simulations to explore the influence of tidal forces over a stellar distribution embedded in a SFDM halo orbiting a MW-like SFDM host halo with a disk. Our simulations intend to test the viability of SFDM as an alternative model by comparing the tidal effects that result in this paradigm with those obtained in CDM for similar mass halos. We found that galaxies in subhalos with core profiles and high central densities survive for 10 Gyr. The same occurs for galaxies in low density subhalos located far from the <b>host</b> <b>disk</b> influence, whereas satellites in low density DM halos and in tight orbits can eventually be stripped of stars.

The system appears to be the result of a galaxy-galaxy interaction. We identify a sufficient number of dynamical elements containing baryons (stars and neutral gas) that there is no compelling reason to postulate the presence of an additional dark matter halo that is devoid of detectable baryons. The central galaxy VV 29 a is massive (V-rot similar to 330 km s(- 1)) and gas rich (M-HI similar to 6 x 10 (9) h(- 2) M-.). The distinctive optical plume (VV 29 b), which extends eastward from the main galaxy, is also gas rich (M-HI similar to 3 similar to 10 (9) h(- 2) M-.) and has a very low gradient in line of sight velocity (70 h(- 1) kpc. On the western side, there is an HI feature of M-HI similar to 4 x 10 (8) h(- 2) M-. that participates strongly in orbital motion about the host in the same sense of rotation as the VV 29 a itself.

We estimate the total amount of diffuse ionised gas to be of the order of (5 +- 3) x 10 ^ 10 Msun and explore its physical properties to understand its origin and the source(s) of the ionisation. The MUSE data allow the identification of a dozen of group members embedded in this structure from emission and absorption lines. We extracted spectra from small apertures defined for both the diffuse ionised gas and the galaxies. We investigated the kinematics and ionisation properties of the various galaxies and extended gas regions thanks to line diagnostics (R 23, O 32 and [OIII]/Hβ) available within the MUSE wavelength range. We compared these diagnostics to photo-ionisation models and shock models. The structure is divided in two kinematically distinct sub-structures. The most extended sub-structure of ionised gas is likely rotating around a massive galaxy and displays filamentary patterns linking some galaxies. The second sub-structure links another massive galaxy hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus to a low mass galaxy but also extends orthogonally to the AGN <b>host</b> <b>disk</b> over 35 kpc. This extent is likely ionised by the AGN itself. The location of small diffuse regions in the R 23 vs. O 32 diagram is compatible with photo-ionisation. However, the location of three of these regions in this diagram (low O 32, high R 23) can also be explained by shocks, which is supported by their large velocity dispersions. One edge-on galaxy shares the same properties and may be a source of shocks. Whatever the hypothesis, the extended gas seems to be non primordial. We favour a scenario where the gas has been extracted from galaxies by tidal forces and AGN triggered by interactions between at least the two sub-structures.
