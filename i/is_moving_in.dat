5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars about once every 27.3days (its sidereal period). However, because Earth <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its synodic period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E

25|$|A {{standing}} wave, {{also known}} as a stationary wave, is a wave that remains in a constant position. This phenomenon can occur because the medium <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction to the wave, or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of interference between two waves traveling in opposite directions.|$|E

The two peaks are not equal. The two high tides a day alternate in maximum heights: lower high (just under three feet), higher high (just over three feet), and again lower high. Likewise for the low tides.|$|E
25|$|He {{observed}} analogous {{trends in}} the field of repetitive or transposed genomic elements (TEs) including retroposed elements. These elements were initially considered to be junk, littering genomes, and proposed by only a few to constitute raw material for fortuitous and only occasional exaptations, and to be responsible for the plasticity of genomes and the modular architecture of genes. The current tide <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. A plethora of functions have been assigned to TEs, one example being the bewildering spectrum of tasks allocated to the evolutionarily young primate-specific Alu elements. Such sweeping interpretations should be challenged.|$|E

25|$|Compact Cassettes contain two {{miniature}} spools, between {{which the}} magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell. Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks {{are available on}} the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette, or by the machine automatically changing the direction of tape movement ("auto-reverse") when it detects that the tape has come to an end.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{whirling}} arm {{does not produce}} a reliable flow of air impacting the test shape at a normal incidence. Centrifugal forces {{and the fact that}} the object <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> its own wake mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. Francis Herbert Wenham (1824–1908), a Council Member of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, addressed these issues by inventing, designing and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871. Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use of this tool. Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high aspect ratio.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E

500|$|Some economists, {{mostly from}} outside Europe and {{associated}} with Modern Monetary Theory and other post-Keynesian schools, condemned {{the design of}} the euro currency system from the beginning because it ceded national monetary and economic sovereignty but lacked a central fiscal authority. When faced with economic problems, they maintained, [...] "Without such an institution, EMU would prevent effective action by individual countries and put nothing in its place." [...] US economist Martin Feldstein went so far to call the euro [...] "an experiment that failed". Some non-Keynesian economists, such as Luca A. Ricci of the IMF, contend that the eurozone does not fulfil the necessary criteria for an optimum currency area, though it <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> that direction.|$|E
500|$|VOSES uses miniature, {{all-weather}} audio speakers {{that are}} placed on the hybrid's wheel wells and emit specific sounds based on the direction the car <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> order to minimize noise pollution and to maximize acoustic information for pedestrians. If the car is moving forward, the sounds are only projected in the forward direction; and if the car is turning left or right, the sound changes on {{the left or right}} appropriately. The company argues that chirps, beeps and alarms are more distracting than useful, and that the best sounds for alerting pedestrians are carlike, such as [...] "the soft purr of an engine or the slow roll of tires across pavement." [...] One of the EVA's external sound systems was designed specifically for the Toyota Prius.|$|E
500|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm is interpreted to have originated [...] below the surface. The {{character of the}} seismic waves indicated that the swarm originated from a magmatic source. It could have formed {{as a result of}} rock fracturing at the tip of a dike and/or by movement along fault planes due to changes in the local stress field by the expansion and movement of magma. This magmatic activity is potentially linked to the hypothesized Anahim hotspot, a mantle plume that is probably responsible for older volcanism throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This volcanic belt includes the Rainbow, Ilgachuz and Itcha range shield volcanoes west of the Nazko swarm. Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older {{to the west of the}} Nazko swarm, indicating that the North American Plate <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> a westerly direction with respect to the hotspot, carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of [...] to [...] per year. Because the area where the 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake swarm}} originated is at the eastern end of the volcanic belt, it probably represents the youngest portion of the hotspot track. This suggests any future volcanic earthquakes will occur in the Nazko region or further to the east.|$|E
