5|$|Author John Green, {{though an}} Indianapolis native, {{was pleased with}} the {{selection}} of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> couple of flat streets.|$|E
5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons {{to turn it into}} a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E

25|$|In March 1942 Finnish {{forces were}} reorganized into three groups. Oesch was given command of Olonets Group in the Olonets Isthmus between Lakes Onega and Ladoga. Almost immediately, in April 1942, he faced a strong Soviet attack which was decisively beaten in ten days of battle. As the war progressed, it became {{increasingly}} clear Germany {{would lose the}} war, and the Finns would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way out. Oesch was preoccupied with planning the fortification and defense of his front, but kept a worried eye on the developments elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{procedures}} {{used in the}} algorithm have nearly O(1) cost, the overall cost of the algorithm is close to linear {{in the size of}} the expression for which a type is to be inferred. This is in strong contrast to many other attempts to derive type inference algorithms, which often came out to be NP-hard, if not undecidable with respect to termination. Thus the HM performs as well as the best fully informed type-checking algorithms can. Type-checking here means that an algorithm does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> proof, but only to validate a given one.|$|E
25|$|Owners of ADRs are {{typically}} {{notified in writing}} at least thirty days prior to a termination. Once notified, an owner can surrender their ADRs and take delivery of the foreign securities represented by the Receipt, or do nothing. If an ADR holder elects to take possession of the underlying foreign shares, {{there is no guarantee}} the shares will trade on any U.S. exchange. The holder of the foreign shares would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> broker who has trading authority in the foreign market where those shares trade. If the owner continues to hold the ADR past the effective date of termination, the depositary bank will continue to hold the foreign deposited securities and collect dividends, but will cease distributions to ADR owners.|$|E

25|$|Due to an {{expansion}} of the local railway lines, the club was told that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> new ground for the 1899–1900 season. After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of Owlerton, which at the time was several miles outside the Sheffield city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as Hillsborough Stadium) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade, Wednesday won the League in the 1902–03 and 1903–04 seasons and the FA Cup again in 1907, beating Everton 2–1, again at Crystal Palace. When competitive football was suspended in 1915 because of the outbreak of World War One, the club participated in several regionalised war leagues, until 1919, when normal service was resumed.|$|E
25|$|The 1980–81 {{season was}} {{probably}} {{the worst in the}} club's history. Rovers won just five league games during the season, and only four home wins in all competitions. The team was relegated {{at the end of the}} season, finishing in last place, seven points below the other relegated team, Bristol City. The club had also failed to agree an extension to the lease on their stadium, which had had its capacity reduced from 30,000 to 12,500 due to new safety laws, causing fears that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> new home. On 17 August 1980, a fire started in the South Grandstand in Eastville Stadium, destroying the administrative offices and changing rooms. As a result, Rovers were forced to play five games at Ashton Gate, three in the league and two in the League Cup. This location was not popular with the fans however, who considered this to be enemy territory, and all five games were poorly attended.|$|E
500|$|The game also {{features}} two other storylines with [...] "Distant Glory" [...] where Shanttoto and Gabranth {{are introduced to}} the player in two different areas where they are trapped and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way out. The other storymode, [...] "Inward Chaos", serves as an alternate scenario in which Chaos has never been defeated and the player is guided by an entity known as Shinryu to defeat Chaos.|$|E

That's something we have to be ready for. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> weakness and exploit it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Reves's death La Pausa {{was put up}} for sale, {{with the}} sale of items from the house to benefit the Reves Foundation. In 2012 La Pausa was {{withdrawn}} from sale by Sotheby's due to pending litigation. After the legal problems were resolved, Knight Frank put La Pausa up for sale in May 2013 for 40 million euros. In 2013 the French ambassador to Monaco, Hugues Moret, said of the sale that La Pausa was [...] "...part of France's heritage," [...] adding that [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way {{to keep it in}} the family." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the match}} Henrik Larsson {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he was disappointed to have scored two goals in the final and still come away with a runners up medal. Larsson stated that there was nothing to be happy about the outcome of the final. He told BBC Sport, [...] "I've said before, I'd much rather not score and be able to lift the UEFA Cup, than to score twice and finish up on the losing side. There's nothing to be happy about, but now we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|Yancey {{writes that}} Christians should be {{politically}} active and should, for example, oppose abortion, [...] "but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{way to do}} it with grace... If I'm against abortion and I don't find a way to love the woman who got the abortion and even her doctor, then I don't understand the gospel." [...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if we are willing to forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "exchange" [...] {{means that}} a partner {{institution}} accepts a student, but {{does not necessarily mean}} that the students <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> counterpart from the other institution with whom to exchange. Exchange students live with a host family or in a designated place such as a hostel, an apartment, or a student lodging. Costs for the program vary by the country and institution. Participants fund their participation via scholarships, loans, or self-funding.|$|E
2500|$|A similar problem faces {{honeybee}} swarms. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> new home, and {{the many}} scouts and wider participants have to reach consensus about which of perhaps several candidate homes to fly to. And then they all have to fly there, with their queen. The bees approach works reliably, but when researchers are so unkind as to offer two hives, equally attractive by all the criteria bees apply, catastrophe ensues, the swarm breaks up, and all the bees die.|$|E
2500|$|... wasn't so {{much about}} The Beatles. It {{was a very good}} script in which the agency of these two famous people and their story takes you somewhere deeper.

These boys knew each other when they were 16 and now they're 35 and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> new truth. We all have our own {{relationships}} like that, whether they're matrimonial relationships or friendships.|$|E
50|$|The game {{features}} {{a very similar}} gameplay to Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. There are 16 levels {{in the game and}} the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> piece of scroll (the eponymous Testament) in an every single level. The piece is usually hidden behind a door and so player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> key first. <b>To</b> fight enemy player can use four weapons -a basic handgumn, a machine gun, a fireball gun and a Double gun.|$|R
