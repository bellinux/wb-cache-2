40|$|A typical blade {{material}} {{is made of}} Nickel super alloy and can bear temperatures up to 950 °C. But the operating temperature of a gas turbine is above the melting point of super alloy nearly at 1500 °C. This could lead to hot corrosions, high temperature oxidation, creep, thermal fatigue may takes place on the {{blade material}}. Though the turbine has an internal cooling system, the cooling is not adequate to reduce {{the temperature of the}} blade substrate. Therefore to protect the blade material as well as increase the efficiency of the turbine, thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) must be used. A TBC coating of 250 μm thick can reduce the temperature by up to 200 ° C. Air Plasma Spray Process (APS) and High Enthalpy Plasma Spray Process (100 HE) were the processes used for coating the blades with the TBCs. Because thermal conductivity increases with increase in temperature, it is desired that these processes yield very low thermal conductivities at high temperatures in order not to damage the blade. An experiment was carried out using <b>Flash</b> <b>line</b> 5000 apparatus to compare the thermal conductivity of both processes. The apparatus could also be used to determine the thermal diffusivity and specific heat of the TBCs. 75 to 2800 K was the temperature range used in the experimentation. It was found out that though 100 HE has high deposition efficiency, the thermal conductivity increases with increase in temperatures whiles APS yielded low thermal conductivities...|$|E

This conclusion was reexamined. Observers pointed to the {{position of}} a small Gabor patch on the screen or compared its position to moving patches, stationary <b>lines,</b> or <b>flashed</b> <b>lines.</b> With moving patches, the illusion was larger with probe than with motor judgments; with stationary lines, the illusion was about the same size; and with <b>flashed</b> <b>lines,</b> the illusion was smaller with probe than with motor judgments. Thus, the comparison between perceptual and motor measures depended strongly on the methods used. Further, the target was mislocalized toward the fovea with motor judgments, whereas the target was displaced away from the fovea relative to line probes...|$|R

40|$|In 1956, Fraisse, et al. {{reported}} subjects judged that {{lines were}} longer when voluntary attention {{was focused on}} the lines than when attention was distracted from the lines. In the many attempts to repeat these results, none has ascertained whether attention on reported line length was a phenomenal effect. In the present study, 46 subjects were shown as stimuli pairs of horizontal or vertical briefly <b>flashed</b> <b>lines</b> with a fixation cross placed equidistant between the lines but far from each one. A change in color of one arm of the cross was used as a cue to focus subjects' voluntary attention on one line. Analysis showed attention increased the judged length of attended lines. Since this effect of attention also occurred when subjects were absolutely certain they saw the stimulus lines differed in length, this effect indicates that attention increased the phenomenal length of the attended lines. This lengthening was quite small: it involved a maximum mean increase of about. 15 in the probability of the comparative response that the attended line was longer. This effect occurred in the horizontal dimension and was almost absent in the vertical dimension. In agreement with data indicating that <b>flashed</b> <b>lines</b> expand phenomenally by activating motion detectors and that focused attention makes neural motion responses increase in amplitude, the present results suggest that focused attention makes attended lines look longer because it makes these lines expand phenomenally more rapidly...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of yellow {{has played a}} central role in distinguishing two main theories of colour vision. Hering proposed that yellow results from the activation of a distinct retinal-neural mechanism, whereas according to the Young-Helmholtz-Maxwell view, yellow results from the combined activation of red and green cone mechanisms. When red and green images are presented separately to corresponding retinal locations in the two eyes, the resulting sensation is yellow. As the pathways from the two eyes do not converge until the cortex, this suggests that yellow can indeed arise from the central combining of separate red and green channels. I now show that the reverse process can also occur; the visual system can decompose a 'yellow' stimulus into its constituent red and green components. A 'yellow' stimulus was created by optically superimposing a <b>flashed</b> red <b>line</b> onto a moving green bar. If the bar is visible only briefly, the <b>flashed</b> <b>line</b> appears yellow. If the trajectory of the green bar is exposed for sufficient time, however, the line is incorrectly perceived to trail the bar, and appears red. Motion processing occurs in the cortex rather than the retina in primates, and so the ability of motion cues to affect the {{perception of}} colour is consistent with the Young-Helmholtz-Maxwell notion of a 'central synthesis' of yellow...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe visual {{direction}} of a continuously presented monocular object is captured by the visual {{direction of}} a closely adjacent binocular object, which questions the reliability of nonius lines for measuring vergence. This was shown by Erkelens, C. J., and van Ee, R. (1997 a,b) [Capture of the visual direction: An unexpected phenomenon in binocular vision. Vision Research, 37, 1193 – 1196; Capture of the visual direction of monocular objects by adjacent binocular objects. Vision Research, 37, 1735 – 1745] stimulating dynamic vergence by a counter phase oscillation of two square random-dot patterns (one to each eye) that contained a smaller central dot-free gap (of variable width) with a vertical monocular line oscillating in phase with the random-dot pattern of the respective eye; subjects adjusted the motion-amplitude of the line until it was perceived as (nearly) stationary. With a continuously presented monocular line, we replicated capture of visual direction provided the dot-free gap was narrow: the adjusted motion-amplitude of the line was similar as the motion-amplitude of the random-dot pattern, although large vergence errors occurred. However, when we <b>flashed</b> the <b>line</b> for 67 ms at the moments of maximal and minimal disparity of the vergence stimulus, {{we found that the}} adjusted motion-amplitude of the line was smaller; thus, the capture effect appeared to be reduced with <b>flashed</b> nonius <b>lines.</b> Accordingly, we found that the objectively measured vergence gain was significantly correlated (r= 0. 8) with the motion-amplitude of the <b>flashed</b> monocular <b>line</b> when the separation between the line and the fusion contour was at least 32 min arc. In conclusion, if one wishes to estimate the dynamic vergence response with psychophysical methods, effects of capture of visual direction can be reduced by using <b>flashed</b> nonius <b>lines...</b>|$|R

We study the material flow at different strokes of the die across the entire coining process and observe that the change in the flow direction of the material in the rim region may contribute to the <b>flash</b> <b>lines.</b> Our proposed framework shows that a part of the rim region in which the flash-line defects appear is consistent with the reported experimental results.

40|$|Two briefly <b>flashed</b> <b>lines</b> {{shown in}} rapid {{succession}} evoke a sensation of motion in human observers. Line separation, temporal offset and contrast polarity are investigated. Line pairs are presented on a gray background and are either both bright or both dark (equal contrast polarity), or one line is bright {{and the other is}} dark (opposite contrast polarity). Observers are instructed to indicate the perceived direction of motion. With foveal viewing perceived direction is veridical for line pairs with equal contrast polarity, but is reversed for line pairs with opposite contrast polarity, spatial separations between 0 and 12 min of arc, and temporal offsets between 8 and 33 ms. When separations and/or temporal offsets are further increased perception reverts to veridical. When lines of opposite contrast polarity are presented in the parafovea, reversal of perceived direction is also observed.

50|$|The interstimulus {{interval}} (often abbreviated as ISI) is {{the temporal}} interval between the offset of one stimulus to {{the onset of}} another. For instance, Max Wertheimer did experiments with two stationary, flashing lights that at some interstimulus intervals appeared to the subject as moving instead of stationary. In these experiments, the interstimulus interval is simply the time between the two flashes. The ISI plays {{a large role in}} the phi phenomenon (Wertheimer) since the illusion of motion is directly due to the length of the interval between stimuli. When the ISI is shorter, for example between two <b>flashing</b> <b>lines</b> alternating back and forth, we perceive the change in stimuli to be movement. Wertheimer discovered that the space between the two lines is filled in by our brains and that the faster the lines alternate, the more likely we are to perceive it as one line moving back and forth. When the stimuli move fast enough, this creates the illusion of a moving picture like a movie or cartoon. Phi phenomenon is very similar to beta movement.|$|R

40|$|The brain can use {{multiple}} reference frames to code line orientation, including head-, object-, and gravity-centered references. If these frames change orientation, their representations must {{be updated}} {{to keep register}} with actual line orientation. We tested this internal updating during head rotation in roll, exploiting the rod-and-frame effect: The illusory tilt of a vertical line surrounded by a tilted visual frame. If line orientation is stored relative to gravity, these distortions should also affect the updating process. Alternatively, if coding is head- or frame-centered, updating errors should {{be related to the}} changes in their orientation. Ten subjects were instructed to memorize the orientation of a briefly <b>flashed</b> <b>line,</b> surrounded by a tilted visual frame, then rotate their head, and subsequently judge the orientation of a second line relative to the memorized first while the frame was upright. Results showed that updating errors were mostly related to the amount of subjective distortion of gravity at both the initial and final head orientation, rather than to the amount of intervening head rotation. In some subjects, a smaller part of the updating error was also related to the change of visual frame orientation. We conclude that the brain relies primarily on a gravity-based reference to remember line orientation during head roll...|$|R
40|$|When a suprathreshold visual {{stimulus}} is flashed for 60 - 300 ms and masked, {{though it is}} no longer visibly degraded, the perceived shape is vulnerable to distortion effects, especially when a 2 rid shape is present. Specifically, when preceded by a <b>flashed</b> <b>line,</b> a briefly <b>flashed</b> circle appears to be an ellipse elongated perpendicular to the line. Given an appropriate stimulus onset asynchrony, this distortion isperceived when the 2 stimuli (~ 4 *) are presented as far as 12 " apart but is not due to perception of apparent motion between the 2 stimuli. Additional pairs of shapes defined by taper and overall curvature also revealed similar nonlocal shape distortion effects. The test shapes always appeared tobe more dissimilar to the priming shapes, adistortion termed ashape-contrast effect. Its properties are consistent with the response characteristics of the shape-tuned neurons in the inferotemporal cortex and may reveal the underlying dimensions of early shape ncoding. From the instant astimulus is presented, the visual system accumulates information about the stimulus and begins to generate a subjective impression of its shape and location. For very brief presentations terminated by a mask, stimuli look fuzzy, ill defined, or intertwined with the details of the mask. Several studies have shown that for durations greater than- 50 ms, the stimulus begins to have a relatively sharp, crisp appearance and is seen independently of the mask (e. g. ...|$|R

Daytime and nighttime field trials using the three modes were conducted in two work zones set up on highway shoulders.

Hourly average and 85 th percentile speeds recorded during the tests were lower than corresponding hourly baseline speeds for all display modes. The greatest speed reductions occurred when the diamond display was operating. Additionally, motorists at a highway rest area were surveyed about the three displays that were operating in the parking area.

40|$|During {{prolonged}} rotation about a tilted yaw axis, {{often referred}} to as off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR), a percept of being translated along a conical path slowly emerges as the sense of rotation subsides. Recently, we found that these perceptual changes are consistent with a canal-otolith interaction model that attributes the illusory translation percept to improper interpretation of the ambiguous otolith signals. The model further predicts that the illusory translation percept must be accompanied by slowly worsening tilt underestimates. Here, we tested this prediction in six subjects by measuring the time course of the subjective visual vertical (SVV) during OVAR stimulation at three different tilt-rotation speed combinations, in complete darkness. Throughout the 2 -min run, at each left-ear-down and right-ear-down position, the subject indicated whether a briefly <b>flashed</b> <b>line</b> deviated clockwise or counterclockwise from vertical to determine the SVV with an adaptive staircase procedure. Typically, SVV errors indicating tilt underestimation were already present at rotation onset and then increased exponentially to an asymptotic value, reached at about 60 s after rotation onset. The initial error in the SVV was highly correlated to the response error in a static tilt control experiment. The subsequent increase in error depended on both rotation speed and OVAR tilt angle, in a manner predicted by the canal-otolith interaction model. We conclude that verticality misjudgments during OVAR reflect a dynamic component linked to canal-otolith interaction, superimposed on a tilt-related component that is also expressed under stationary conditions...|$|R
