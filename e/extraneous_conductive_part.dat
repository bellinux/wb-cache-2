40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of <b>extraneous</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between <b>extraneous</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> and exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> is zeroed and <b>extraneous</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all <b>extraneous</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> to the protective equipotential bonding because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these <b>extraneous</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> are present but not connected to the protective equipotential bonding is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal. Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|R
40|$|The bonding of {{electrical}} equipment plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining the same potential between <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> likely to be energized and <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> liable to introduce a "zero" potential into the premises. Voltage rises between such parts are unsafe, as they may induce harmful currents through the human body, the magnitude of which may vary depending on a number of factors.

40|$|Each {{grounding}} system (GS) needs periodical measurements to control its adequacy {{to the safety}} conditions. The tests of step and touch voltages are the sole measurements available in urban or industrial areas with reduced accessibility. In fact, in these areas, the classic measurements used to verify the electrical characteristics of the GS generally present some operational difficulties. The auxiliary current electrodes can only be located at short distances, and thus, the test methods and techniques result in conservative values {{in comparison with the}} prospected true values measurable by adopting a remote auxiliary electrode. The locations of auxiliary current electrodes at short distance make it easier to keep them permanently installed and to permit the monitoring of the adequacy of GS. This paper presents the measuring touch/step voltages procedure that provides conservative results showing some case studies done in GS of high voltage/medium voltage substations. It is essential to have the map of the constitution and configuration of the GS to know its data and the location of the various equipment and buildings, the presence of <b>extraneous</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> inside, and in proximity of the substation, such as other GS. The field measurements require a good experience of the operator that can be learned by carrying out measurements in cases of GS with influence zone accessible, so {{that it is possible to}} compare the traditional method with a remote electrode and the method at short distance...|$|R

50|$|Earthing connects exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>parts</b> of {{electrical}} equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the supply is reliably disconnected {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the exposed <b>conductive</b> <b>part</b> {{of electrical}} equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. Bonding wires are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main earthing terminal. The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumer’s earth electrode (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|R
