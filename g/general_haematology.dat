40|$|The {{importance}} of {{smoking in the}} aetiology of polycythaemia has been assessed {{in a group of}} patients referred to a <b>general</b> <b>haematology</b> clinic. All patients with true and relative polycythaemia (excluding those with polycythaemia rubra vera) were studied. Of the 21 such patients evaluated, 14 were smokers and had raised carboxyhaemoglobin levels and had no other demonstrable cause for their polycythaemia. The commonest physiological abnormality in these patients was a raised red cell mass combined with a low plasma volume. Six of the 14 patients were able to reduce their smoking with subsequent improvement in their haematocrits. These results suggest that smoking is a major cause of polycythaemia in an unselected series of referrals to a <b>general</b> <b>haematology</b> clinic. The early identification of these patients may be useful in planning therapy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Use haematology, {{biochemistry}} {{and protein}} electrophoresis analyses to establish reference values for, {{and describe the}} health status of, wild and captive colonies of critically endangered warru (black-footed rock-wallaby: Petrogale lateralis MacDonnell Ranges race). METHODS: Blood samples were taken from warru in three wild colonies (Alalka, Kalka, New Well) in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in north-west South Australia (SA) and from captive animals at Monarto Zoo, SA. <b>General</b> <b>haematology,</b> serum biochemistry and protein electrophoresis analyses were conducted and results used to establish reference ranges. For the parameters that are indicative of a population’s health, comparisons among the study sites were completed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: <b>General</b> <b>haematology</b> results suggested that warru were not experiencing chronic anaemia and the protein electrophoresis values indicated that colonies were not suffering from populationwide disease. However, the lower superoxide dismutase, retinol, total carotenoids and ascorbic acid values for New Well warru suggested those animals had a lower plane of nutrition than those at Kalka and Alalka. Higher urea concentrations in New Well and Alalka warru could be {{a reflection of the}} absence of reliable free water at these sites. CONCLUSION: The results have implications for the management of in situ colonies, including potentially using supplementary feeding to improve nutrition, and suggested that these animals were not suffering from disease. The study presents the first blood reference values for P. lateralis and, potentially, a methodology for other threatened species recovery programs to follow to establish the health of their populations.

40|$|M. Sc. (Zoology) A {{number of}} {{chemical}} substances in mining, industrial, agricultural and domestic effluents {{are likely to}} contaminate watercourses. These toxicants have a definite effect on all aquatic life, even at sublethal concentrations. Due to the extensive copper mining activities in the Phalaborwa region, there is concern that the sublethal effect of copper might affect the physiology of fish in the Olifants River, Kruger National Park, Transvaal. Copper can be found as an essential micronutrient in nearly all waters, although anthropogenic sources such as metals from mining and planting industries might produce environmental concentrations causing toxic effects to fish. Several effects of exposure to sublethal concentrations of copper have already been reported in fish, In the present study, the blood coagulation, <b>general</b> <b>haematology,</b> osmoregulation and differential {{white blood cell counts}} of the Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus were investigated after the exposures to sublethal concentrations of copper, for a short-term (96 hours) exposure as well as a long-term (four weeks) exposure in experimental flow through systems, at both 29 ± I°C and 19 ± I°C. After the respective sublethal exposures, changes in the values of blood coagulation, <b>general</b> <b>haematology,</b> osmoregulation and differential white blood cell counts were obtained, {{to determine the effects of}} the chosen copper concentrations on the blood physiology of O. mossambicus, at 29 + 10 and 19 ± I°C, respectively. After a photographic observation of blood, during all the phases of coagulation was made, it was evident that the exposure to copper, at both temperatures, resulted in delays of the blood coagulation times as well as decreases in the elasticity of the clots that formed. Copper was found to induce haemophilia at 29 ± I°C and 19 ± l°C. whilst at 19 ± I°C it also induced thrombocytopenia. Thus exposure to copper lead to coagulation defects which caused haemorrhage which can eventually cause the death of these fish [...] ...|$|E

This phenomenon {{is related to the}} rapid industrial, mining and agricultural activity growth along rivers, especially in the Upper catchment of the Olifants River, Mpumalanga. In general, metal ions have - negative effects on the physiology of fish and other aquatic biota in metal polluted waters. In this study. the sublethal effects of, manganese were determined by exposing the freshwater fish, Oreochromis mossambicus, to this metal in an experimental flow-through system. The exposure times were divided in acute (96 hours) and chronic (26 days) exposures, both at 23 ± 1 °C. The results obtained showed changes in the general, haematological, metabolic, osmoregulatory variables, as well as the differential white blood cell counts. These changes indicated several effects in the physiology of a mossainblais after sublethal manganese exposure. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found between the haematological variables of the control and exposed fish. During chronic exposure, an oxygen deficiency developed due to, the epithelial lifting of gill lamellae. As a result of hypoxia the red blood cell numbers, haemoglobin-, haematocrit and lactate concentrations increased to uplift the depleted oxygen situation. The significant differences (P < 0. 05) found in the sodium, potassium,. calcium and chloride concentrations are mainly as a result of gill damage. Manganese showed a disruptive influence on the structural organization of the gill. The differential white blood cell counts performed, showed significant fluctuations. This leucocytosis and leucopenia are normal reactions of the fishes’ body against infections of foreign substances, such as metal ions.

Group A was provided with a diet containing 25 % crude protein and 2800 Kcal of metabolizable energy from the day of hatch while group B was deprived of feed for the first 72 h post hatch (ph) after which they were introduced to feed and thereafter maintained on same diet as group A. Once feeding is commenced in each of the groups, same regimen was maintained till the end of the study. Other brooding arrangements were common to the groups. 21 days ph 12 chicks were randomly selected per group, weighed, sacrificed after which two blood samples were collected for <b>general</b> <b>haematology</b> and serum biochemistry respectively. They were then necropsied and lymphoid organs as bursa of fabricius, spleen and caecal tonsil as well as liver harvested weighed and their relative weights calculated. The remaining 24 chicks per group were then vaccinated with Newcastle Disease (ND) vaccine lasota R. Five days later, 12 chicks were again randomly elected per group and same operations as on day 21 carried out on the chicks. On day 42 ph, all the remaining chicks in each of the groups were vaccinated against ND using ND vaccine komarov R and 5 days later, they were sacrificed and again all the activities of day 21 repeated. Our results showed that delaying feeding for up to 72 h ph does not significantly affect the growth, development and function of some organs of the immune system. Moreover, it also produced no effect on Packed Cell Volume early in life as significant variation between the two groups (p< 0. 05) was only observed on day 47 ph.

From 2002, all children aged < 5 years in the UK with SCD were recommended 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV- 7) in infancy and 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine boosting, in addition to regular penicillin prophylaxis. Our objective was to determine the nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage rate of SP in children aged < 5 years with SCD before and after vaccination with PCV- 7 (by vaccine, cross-protection and non-vaccine serotypes). NP swabs were obtained from 63 children attending the Royal London Hospital or Newham <b>General</b> Hospital paediatric <b>haematology</b> clinic between April 2001 and April 2002. Later, NP swabs were obtained from 43 children attending the clinic between June and December 2004 after a PCV- 7 vaccination programme. All SP isolated by culture were serotyped and susceptibility to penicillin measured. In the first study group, 13 samples grew SP with 1 sample containing 2 different serotypes, giving a carriage rate of 21 %. Four (31 %) were intermediately susceptible to penicillin. In the second group overall NP carriage rate had decreased to 9 % (n= 4), and the proportion directly or indirectly covered by the PCV- 7 vaccine fell from 13 / 14 to 2 / 4 (P= 0. 11). One (25 %) of these isolates was intermediately susceptible to penicillin. The introduction of PCV- 7 appears to be associated with a shift in distribution of serotypes carried by children with SCD.

During and after brooding, signs of ill health such as diarrhoea, anorexia, huddling, drooping of wings, coughing and mortality were carefully monitored. Post brooding, each group retained its pen but all the groups were maintained on one diet, lpd on which they were fed {{till the end of}} the study. On day 21 Post Hatch (PH), 8 chicks per group were randomly selected, weighed individually and their group means and standard deviation calculated. They were subsequently sacrificed and through jugular venipunture, 2 ml of blood was collected into an anticoagulant bottle for <b>general</b> <b>haematology</b> while 5 mls was collected into a non anticoagulant containing bottle for serum biochemistry and serology. This was followed by necropsy of all the chicks after which some lymphoid organs and the liver were harvested and their weights determined followed by that of their relative weights.

40|$|Background: Red {{blood cell}} {{transfusion}} in sickle cell patients {{is a major}} form of supportive care and long term transfusion is recommended for patients with a risk of stroke. Many patients with SCA attend at MNH but no data {{are available on the}} frequency and pattern of alloantibodies among those frequently transfused. Objective: This study aimed at determining the frequency and pattern of red blood cell alloantibodies in sickle cell patients attending at MNH. Materials and Methods This was a descriptive cross -sectional study that was conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital between August and November 2009. Informed consent was obtained from the patients, their parents or guardians for those less than 18 years. Information on social demographic and clinical characteristics was collected from the medical files and interview from the parents or guardians. After physical examination, laboratory tests on blood were done for each study subject. ABO and Rhesus blood group and alloantibody screening were performed on every patient's sample and alloantibody identification on those found with positive screening test. The overall prevalence of RBC alloantibodies was determined and expressed as a percentage of all recruited patients during the time of data collection. All information was recorded using questionnaires and analysis was done using SPSS version 15. Results The study involved a total of 471 SCA patients aged 6 months and above attending paediatric and <b>general</b> <b>haematology</b> SCD clinic. Of these, 365 (77. 5 %) had of received a blood transfusion with 1184 total life time episodes transfusion (median, 2; range, 1 - 40). No records of transfusion documented in 106 (25. 4 %). The alloimmunization rate was 3. 2 % (15 / 471) among the SCA patients and 4. 1 % (15 / 365) of those who had been transfused. Anti-Kell was the most prevalent 20. 7 % and Rhesus blood group constituted 13. 8 % of total alloantibodies. The risk of alloimmunization was found to increase with episodes of RBC transfusion. Rather unusual that sickle and pregnancy did not elicit antibody development. Life threatening anaemia and splenomegaly were encountered in alloimmunized individuals. 	 V 111 Conclusion The alloimmunization was evident among the transfused SCA patients. The presence of clinically significant alloantibody in transfused SCA patients shows the relevant role of RBC transfusion in the risk of alloimmunization Recommendations It is recommended that blood transfusion guideline be observed so that transfusion is appropriately used in management of SCA patients. This should involve an adequate pre- transfusion antibody screen and lA T cross-match. Policy of perfection would incorporate limited/partial phenotype matching of donor RBC for Kell, D, E and C prior to commencing chronic transfusion in order to minimize the risk of alloimmunization. Finally, further prospective studies are required to track the formation, clearance and features associated with alloimmunization in SCA patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{hospitals}} and other healthcare institutions drugs are routinely stored in designated satellite {{areas on the}} wards. Often ad hoc decisions are made by clinicians and nurses regarding drug type and quantity to be stored. As a result the number of different drugs and drug packages in storage tends to increase, which may lead to inefficient drug handling and become a potential risk factor in the medication control process. Based on an extended analysis of drug inventories on three different wards {{it was hypothesized that}} a ward-individualised formulary (WIF) can halve the number of different drugs and drug packages in a drug dispensary and hence reduce bound capital, money lost through expired drugs, and facilitate safer drug handling. The interdisciplinary intervention described here took place on three 40 -bed wards in a 700 -bed university hospital housing patients in <b>general</b> internal medicine, <b>haematology,</b> nephrology and oncology. METHODS: A WIF was defined by including all drugs from the hospital formulary ordered at least three times in the past six months. A pharmacist, a nurse and a clinician reviewed the inclusion list of drugs and clinicians were strongly encouraged to prescribe drugs primarily from the WIF. Drugs excluded from the WIF were removed from the drug dispensaries and the number of included drug packages stored in the remote dispensaries was reduced according to their order history. Drug inventory on the wards was monitored from February 2004 to April 2006. RESULTS: The initial drug dispensary inventories on wards A, B and C consisted of 2031, 1667 and 1536 packages with 943, 897 and 831 different drugs valued at h 83 931, h 44 590 and h 57 285. respectively. After adjusting the drug dispensaries according to the WIF drug dispensary inventories on wards A, B and C consisted of 808 (- 60 %), 600 (- 64 %) and 485 (- 68 %) packages with 415 (- 56 %), 334 (- 63 %) and 376 (- 55 %) different drugs valued euro 28 012 (- 67 %), euro 10 381 (- 77 %) an euro 17 898 (- 69 %). The overall reductions the number of packages, the different drugs and the drug value were comparable (< 50 %) and remained low during the entire observation time (A: 18 months, B: 13 months, C: 8 months). CONCLUSION: Rearranging dispensaries by individualizing the drug inventory according {{to the needs of the}} ward by introducing a WIF is a valuable means to significantly (< 50 %) reduce [1] the number of drug packages, [2] the number of different drugs stored and [3] the capital bound drugs. The positive effects of the WIF are supported by the interdisciplinary interaction of the different professional groups involved in the medication process. The leaner drug dispensaries offer optimal basic conditions for introducing new IT-based systems to further increase the safety of the medication process...|$|R

Shu, Q., Zhou, J. S., Rutherfurd, K. J., Prasad, J., Birtles, M. J., Gopal, P. K., & Gill, H. S. (2000). Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus HNOI 7, Lb. rhamnosus HNOOl and Bifidobacterium lactis HNOI 9) have no adverse effects {{on the health of}} mice, International Dairy Journal, 9, 831 - 836 Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been consumed in foods by human beings for several centuries without any obvious adverse effects. But the safety of consumption of these organisms, especially novel strains, which are added to foods as probiotics, has been questioned recently due to occasionally reported infections implicated with some particular LAB strains. Evaluation of the safety or potential toxicity of probiotic candidate strains, especially novel strains for which no prior safety data exist, is highly recommended. The LAB strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN 001 (DR 20 TM), Lb, acidophilus HN 017 and Bifidobacterium lactis HN 019 (DR 10 TM) are three newly identified probiotic organisms with immune-enhancing properties. Their safety/potential toxicity was investigated in this study through a series of both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The mucus layer coating the surface of the gastrointestinal tract {{plays an important role in}} the gut mucosal defence system. Platelet activation and /or aggregation is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (IE). In the first part of this study, the potential pathogenicity of LAB strains was examined by in vitro mucin degradation (HN 001, HN 017, and HN 019) and platelet aggregation (HN 001 and HN 019) assays. Following incubation with hog gastric mucin (HGM) in a minimal medium, the mucin degradation activity of test strains was determined via changes in the carbohydrate and protein concentration of the culture media and molecular weight changes of mucin glycoproteins (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE). The mucinolytic activity of test strains was also measured in an agarose petri dish assay. The results from these experiments suggested that HN 001, HN 017 and HN 019 had no ability to degrade HGM in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis using platelet specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrated an inability of the test strains HN 001 and HN 019 to induce or enhance human platelet aggregation. These experiments indicated that the test strains are unlikely to degrade the mucin layer of the gastrointestinal mucosal surface or participate in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. Resistance of LAB strains to commonly used antibiotics has caused safety concerns regarding the genetic stability of these resistance properties. The antibiotic susceptibility and plasmid profiles of test organisms were investigated in another series of experiments. The susceptibility of the test strains to 18 antibiotics in common clinical use was examined by disk diffusion method. No extraordinary antimicrobial resistance was detected among the test strains (HN 001, HN 017, HN 019, and HN 067), and there were several antibiotics that efficiently suppressed the growth of test bacterial cells. A plasmid screening experiment demonstrated that all LAB strains examined were plasmid-free, this was verified by Southern blotting and DNA hybridisation techniques. These results indicate that the probiotic organisms tested here do not express or carry plasmid-associated antibiotic resistance, so their antibiotic resistance attributes are unlikely to disseminate to other clinically significant strains. To investigate the oral toxicity of test strains (HN 001, HN 017, and HN 019), conventional BALB/c mice were inoculated with a high dose (10 11 cfu/mouse/day) of the test probiotic LAB strains for 8 consecutive days. The feed and water intake, body weight gain, and general health status, of the mice were monitored. The potential translocation of inoculated LAB strains and gut mucosal histological changes following feeding were also investigated. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting techniques were used for bacterial identification. Results showed that the test LAB strains had no adverse effects on the parameters observed; no viable bacteria were recovered from blood or tissue samples (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen). These results suggest that the test strains had no acute toxicity and had no potential to result in infection in normal mice at the high dose applied in this study. To observe the consequences of longer-term consumption of test LAB strains, groups of BALB/c mice were orally administered with test LAB strains (HN 001, HN 017 and HN 019) at doses of 5 x 10 7, 10 9 or 5 x 10 10 cfu/mouse/day for 4 weeks. In addition to the indicators observed in the acute toxicity study, the animals' haematological parameters; total and differential leucocyte counts; and blood biochemistry (plasma total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and glucose) were also investigated. Similar results to those of the acute toxicity study were obtained, i. e. 4 weeks consumption of HN 001, HN 017, and HN 019 had no significant effects on the animals' <b>general</b> health status, <b>haematology,</b> blood biochemistry, or gut mucosal histological parameters. No dose-related effects were detected for any of the observed indicators. Translocation of test LAB strains was not observed. These results suggest that longer-term consumption of test strains is unlikely to cause any obvious health problems in host animals. In the final stage of this study, the potentially detrimental effects of HN 001 and HN 019 on hosts with sub-optimal immune functions were tested. To characterise the potential infectivity of test strains in immune deficient hosts, a group of adult male BALB/c mice pre-treated with dexamethasone (200 µg/mouse/ 48 hrs) were fed with freshly cultured living HN 001 or HN 019 at doses of 1. 5 ~ 2. 5 x 10 7 cfu/mouse/day for 7 days; similar safety indicators to those outlined above were monitored. Results showed that no significant changes were noted in any of the safety parameters measured. No translocation of dietary LAB or systemic infection was detected. These findings suggest that HN 001 and HN 019 are well tolerated in immunocompromised mice without any significant safety concerns. To investigate the effects of consumption of test LAB strains in hosts with a preexisting immunological dysfuction, a group of female CBA/CaH mice (6 to 8 weeks) with experimentally induced autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) were fed with freshly prepared probiotic preparations (HN 001 4. 2 x 10 8 cfu/mouse/day; HN 019 2. 16 x 10 8 cfu/mouse/day) for 5 to 8 weeks. Probiotic feeding was commenced one week prior to the immunization with auto antigens (MTg, mouse thyroglobulin). Antibody titres and spleen cell proliferative responses to the autoimmune inducing antigens (MTg) were determined via in vitro immunoassays. Lymphocyte (or mononuclear leucocyte) infiltration into thyroid tissue was also examined. Results showed that HN 001 or HN 019 feeding did not exacerbate spleen cell proliferative responses to MTg or lymphocyte infiltrations in thyroid tissues. These results indicate that feeding of HN 001 or HN 019 had no adverse effect on the induction or progress of autoimmune responses in CBA/CaH mice. Overall, the combined results from these studies suggest that the probiotic LAB strains HN 001, HN 017, and HN 019 are non-pathogenic for experimental animals and are likely to be safe for human consumption...|$|R
