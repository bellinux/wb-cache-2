40|$|Renewable energy {{resources}} such as wind and solar are increasingly more important in distribution networks and microgrids as their presence keeps flourishing. They help to reduce the carbon footprint of power systems, {{but on the other}} hand, the intermittency and variability of these resources pose serious challenges to the operation of the grid. Meanwhile, more flexible loads, distributed generation, and energy storage systems are being increasingly used. Moreover, electric vehicles impose an additional strain on the uncertainty level, due to their variable demand, departure time and physical location. This paper formulates a two-stage stochastic problem for energy resource scheduling to address the challenge brought by the demand, renewable sources, electric vehicles, and market price uncertainty. The proposed method aims to minimize the expected operational cost of the <b>energy</b> <b>aggregator</b> and is based on stochastic programming. A realistic case study is presented using a real distribution network with 201 -bus from Zaragoza, Spain. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the stochastic model when compared with a deterministic formulation and suggest that demand response can {{play a significant role in}} mitigating the uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} three metaheuristics {{are used to}} solve a smart grid multi-objective energy {{management}} problem with conflictive design: how to maximize profits and minimize carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, and the results compared. The metaheuristics implemented are: weighted particle swarm optimization (W-PSO), multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The performance of these methods {{with the use of}} multi-dimensional signaling is also compared with this technique, which has previously been shown to boost metaheuristics performance for single-objective problems. Hence, multi-dimensional signaling is adapted and implemented here for the proposed multi-objective problem. In addition, parallel computing is used to mitigate the methods’ computational execution time. To validate the proposed techniques, a realistic case study for a chosen area of the northern region of Portugal is considered, namely part of Vila Real distribution grid (233 -bus). It is assumed that this grid is managed by an <b>energy</b> <b>aggregator</b> entity, with reasonable amount of electric vehicles (EVs), several distributed generation (DG), customers with demand response (DR) contracts and energy storage systems (ESS). The considered case study characteristics took into account several reported research works with projections for 2020 and 2050. The findings strongly suggest that the signaling method clearly improves the results and the Pareto front region quality. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This study aims to {{investigate}} the synergetic benefit of wind power and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to the power system and to each other. We consider the integration of wind power and intelligent charging of PEVs into the wholesale electricity market of the New York Control Area (NYCA). We use a data-based two-settlement energy market model for the NYCA and a commuter transportation model for New York State with 7, 560 scenarios. They include curtailable and must-take wind power penetrations of up to 25 %, PEV penetrations of up to 25 % and Level 1 /Level 2 mixtures of charger infrastructure in a span of 21 summer days in 2006. Preliminary results suggest that wind power and intelligently charged PEVs greatly benefit the NYCA as independent system-level resources. However, there {{does not appear to}} be noticeable system benefits and dispatch correlations from coupling must-take wind and PEVs. Consequently, the traditional view of synergy in the grid integration of wind power and PEV charging may not always hold, prompting the need for additional studies before designing the relevant energy policies.

40|$|The {{power system}} {{is in a state}} of {{transition}} due to the increased amount of distributed energy resources (renewable energy technology, electric vehicles and demand response programs) emerging on the demand-side of the grid. Integrating these new technology sources into existing infrastructure and energy markets poses extensive challenges for power systems worldwide as operators do not have the appropriate mechanisms for monitoring or controlling low voltage networks, which is typically where these sources are connected. Energy aggregators are emerging market participants that facilitate the integration of demand-side technology by capitalising on current advances in information communication technology to develop new products that engage end-consumer participation in electricity markets. The main goal of an <b>energy</b> <b>aggregator</b> is to contractually engage with sufficient distributed energy resources from various end-consumers that the accumulative whole is large enough to participate in wholesale electricity markets. These aggregators have the ability to bridge the information and technology gap that is currently being faced by power networks today. This honours research thesis outlines the structure of a Demand Response Aggregator, Distributed Generation Aggregator and Vehicle-to-Grid Aggregator and applies the following analyses: A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis for each aggregator is presented, and an investment matrix is qualitatively derived which is then used to evaluate the potential ‘value’ the aggregators can add to the overall power system.

40|$|Battery {{electric}} and fuel cell electric vehicles {{have the potential}} to cover the shortage in renewable power generation by engaging in vehicle-to-grid. However, the vehicle-to-grid service cannot completely make up for the intermittent nature of renewables. Deterministic models were used to compute {{the extent to which the}} vehicles can engage in the vehicle-to-grid service in a smart city domain using the ‘Car as Power Plant’ model. The extent to which the vehicles can provide grid support in terms of energy valley filling is dependent on the method of selecting the vehicles for vehicle-to-grid and the nature of the load demand. Constraining algorithms limiting the extent of refuelling and recharging of the vehicles can help curtail import of hydrogen and power and spread the demand more evenly across the timeline, but also increase the waiting times during the same. An aggregator while coordinating vehicles for the vehicle-to-grid service may encounter some conflicts of interests with respect to ensuring equal vehicle-to-grid participation amongst its customers and investing in the supporting energy infrastructure. The setting of a minimum threshold fuel requirement for participating in vehicle-to-grid strongly relates to the effectiveness of the vehicle-to-grid service. There are some barriers for the adoption of vehicle-to-grid adoption such as competition from stationary batteries and its unreliability that is limiting its uptake. Additionally, the lack of mass uptake of battery {{electric and}} fuel cell electric vehicles has not yet got the market participants interested to invest in the vehicle-to-grid technology. Optimal smart charging strategies must address a variety of variables such as the solar hours, hourly grid prices, peak hours surcharge, charging infrastructure and congestion management.

40|$|Electric Vehicles (EVs) are an {{important}} source of uncertainty, due to their variable demand, departure time and location. In smart grids, the electricity demand can be controlled via Demand Response (DR) programs. Smart charging and vehicle-to-grid seem highly promising methods for EVs control. However, high capital costs remain a barrier to implementation. Meanwhile, incentive and price-based schemes that do not require high level of control can be implemented to influence the EVs' demand. Having effective tools to deal with the increasing level of uncertainty is increasingly important for players, such as <b>energy</b> <b>aggregators.</b> This paper formulates a stochastic model for day-ahead energy resource scheduling, integrated with the dynamic electricity pricing for EVs, to address the challenges brought by the demand and renewable sources uncertainty. The two-stage stochastic programming approach is used to obtain the optimal electricity pricing for EVs. A realistic case study projected for 2030 is presented based on Zaragoza network. The results demonstrate that it is more effective than the deterministic model and that the optimal pricing is preferable.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} {{to design and}} verify the behavior of stochastic systems whose parameters are not known with certainty but are instead affected by modeling uncertainties, due for example to modeling errors, non-modeled dynamics or inaccuracies in the probability estimation. Our framework {{can be applied to}} the analysis of intrinsically randomized systems (e. g., random back off schemes in wireless protocols) and of abstractions of deterministic systems whose dynamics are interpreted stochastically to simplify their representation (e. g., the forecast of wind availability). In the first part of the dissertation, we introduce the model of Convex Markov Decision Processes (Convex-MDPs) as the modeling framework to represent the behavior of stochastic systems. Convex-MDPs generalize MDPs by expressing state-transition probabilities not only with fixed realization frequencies but also with non-linear convex sets of probability distribution functions. These convex sets represent the uncertainty in the modeling process. In the second part of the dissertation, we address the problem of formally verifying properties of the execution behavior of Convex-MDPs. In particular, we aim to verify that the system behaves correctly under all valid operating conditions and under all possible resolutions of the uncertainty in the state-transition probabilities. We use Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) as the formal logic to express system properties. Using results on strong duality for convex programs, we present a model-checking algorithm for PCTL properties of Convex-MDPs, and prove that it runs in time polynomial in the size of the model under analysis. The developed algorithm is the first known polynomial-time algorithm for the verification of PCTL properties of Convex-MDPs. This result allows us to lower the previously known algorithmic complexity upper bound forInterval-MDPs from co-NP to P, and it is valid also for the more expressive (convex) uncertainty models supported by the Convex-MDP formalism. We apply the proposed framework and model-checking algorithm to the problem of formally verifying quantitative properties of models of the behavior of human drivers. We first propose a novel stochastic modelof the driver behavior based on Convex Markov chains. The model is capable of capturing the intrinsic uncertainty in estimating the intricacies of the human behavior starting fromexperimentally collected data. We then formally verify properties ofthe model expressed in PCTL. Results show that our approach can correctly predict quantitative informationabout the driver behavior depending on his/her attention state, e. g., whether the driver is attentive or distracted while driving, and on the environmental conditions, e. g., the presence of an obstacle on the road. Finally, in the third part of the dissertation, we analyze the problem of synthesizing optimal control strategies for Convex-MDPs, aiming to optimize a given system performance, while guaranteeing that the system behavior fulfills a specification expressed in PCTL under all resolutions of the uncertainty in the state-transition probabilities. In particular, we focus on Markov strategies, i. e., strategies that depend only on the instantaneous execution state and not on the full execution history. We first prove that adding uncertainty in the representation of the state-transition probabilities does not increase the theoretical complexity of the synthesis problem, which remains in the class NP-complete as the analogous problem applied to MDPs, i. e., when all transition probabilities are known with certainty. We then interpret the strategy-synthesis problem as a constrained optimization problem and propose the first sound and complete algorithm to solve it. We apply the developed strategy-synthesis algorithm to the problem of generating optimal energy pricing and purchasing strategies for a for-profit <b>energy</b> <b>aggregator</b> whose portfolio of energy supplies includes renewable sources, e. g., wind. Economic incentives have been proposed to manage user demand and compensate for the intrinsic uncertainty in the prediction of the supply generation. Stochastic control techniques are however needed to maximize the economic profit for the <b>energy</b> <b>aggregator</b> while quantitatively guaranteeing quality-of-service for the users. We use Convex-MDPs to model the decision-making scenario and train the models with measured data, to quantitatively capture the uncertainty in the prediction of renewable energy generation. An experimental comparison shows that the control strategies synthesized using the proposed technique significantly increase system performance with respect to previous approaches presented in the literature...|$|E

The Distribution Engineering Workstation (DEW) (a power flow and short circuit modeling tool) was modified to calculate the real-time characteristics of the distribution network based on the real-time electric distribution network information and provide DER operating suggestions to the Detroit Edison system operators so that regional electric stability is maintained. Part of the suggestion algorithm takes into account the operational availability of DER’s, which is known by the <b>Energy</b> <b>Aggregator,</b> DTE Energy Technologies. The availability information will be exchanged from DTE Energy Technologies to Detroit Edison. For the calculated suggestions to be used by the Detroit Edison operators, procedures were developed to allow an operator to operate a DER by requesting operation of the DER through DTE Energy Technologies. Prior to issuing control of a DER, the safety of the distribution network and personnel needs to be taken into account. This information will be exchanged from Detroit Edison to DTE Energy Technologies. Once it is safe to control the DER, DTE Energy Technologies will issue the control signal. The real-time monitoring of the DECo system will reflect the DER control.

40|$|An {{important}} function of aggregators is {{to enable the}} participation of small energy storage units in electricity markets. This paper studies two generally overlooked aspects related to <b>aggregators</b> of <b>energy</b> storage: i) {{the relationship between the}} aggregator and its constituent storage units and ii) the aggregator's effect on system welfare. Regarding i), we show that short-term outcomes can be Pareto-inefficient: all players could be better-off. In practice, however, aggregators and storage units are likely to engage in long rather than short-term relationships. Using Nash Bargaining Theory, we show that aggregators and storage units are likely to cooperate in the long-term. A rigorous understanding of the aggregator-storage unit relationship is fundamental to model the aggregator's participation in the market. Regarding ii), we first show that a profit-seeking <b>energy</b> storage <b>aggregator</b> is always beneficial to the system when compared to a system without storage, regardless of size or market power the aggregator may have. However, due to market power, a monopolist aggregator may act in a socially suboptimal manner. We propose a pricing scheme designed to mitigate market power abuse by the aggregator. This pricing scheme has several important characteristics: its formulation requires no private information, it incentivizes a rational aggregator to behave in a socially optimal manner, and allows for regulation of the aggregator's profit.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the results from our earlier {{research}} {{on the design of}} electricity markets that have to accommodate the uncertainty associated with high penetrations of renewable sources of energy. The key results show that 1) distributed storage (deferrable demand) is an effective way to reduce total system costs, 2) a simple market structure for <b>energy</b> allows <b>aggregators</b> to meet their customers' energy needs and provide ramping services to the system operator, and 3) using a receding-horizon optimization to dispatch units for the next market time-step benefits from the availability of more accurate forecasts of renewable generation and allows market participants to adjust their bids and offers in response to this new information. In our two-sided market, distributed storage in the form of deferrable demand is controlled locally by independent aggregators to minimize their expected payments for energy in the wholesale market, subject to meeting the energy needs of their customers. In addition, these aggregators are responsible for maintaining a stable power factor by installing local capabilities that automatically deal with local power imbalances. Failure to do this triggers penalties paid to the system operator. Our earlier results have shown that it is optimal for an aggregator to submit demand bids into a day-ahead market that include threshold prices for charging and discharging storage and also ensure that the expected amount of stored energy is consistent with the capacity limits of their storage. Because departures from the expected daily pattern of renewable generation are generally persistent (highly positive serial correlated), {{it is likely that the}} system operator determines an optimum pattern of demand for the aggregator that violates the capacity limits of storage by the end of the 24 -hour period. If the market uses a receding horizon, the results in this paper show that aggregators can modify their bids to ensure that the capacity limits of storage are never violated in the next market time-step. In an empirical application, a stochastic form of multi-period security constrained unit commitment with optimal power flow (the MATPOWER Optimal Scheduling Tool, MOST) using a receding-horizon optimization determines the optimum dispatch and reserves for the next hour and forecasts of the nodal prices for the next 24 hours. The results show that locally controlled deferrable demand is almost as effective as centrally controlled deferrable demand as a way to reduce system costs and mitigate the variability of renewable generation. The additional advantage from using a receding horizon is that the system operator always charges/discharges the storage managed locally by aggregators within the capacity constraints of the storage...|$|R

Demand for power generated by the utility through combustion of fuel could be replaced, lowering emission of pollutants, when the energy used to charge the batteries is produced sustainably and traded on smaller scales. The four variants of game are considered: both non-cooperative (unregulated competition) and Stackelberg (regulations on transaction price and size), each with and without DR scheduling. The Nash equilibrium is derived for each game variant in order to serve as a bid-price decision making criteria which determines the optimal bidding strategy for an aggregator to sell in the market. The model is applied to a case study involving completion for selling between two aggregators. Bidding strategy is dependent on parameters inherent to an <b>aggregator's</b> <b>energy</b> storage hardware, and the strategy selected by each aggregator does not vary with the variations in the game conditions considered. Demand response scheduling offers greater payoff for aggregators who implement it, compared with those who do not. Addition of transaction price and volume regulations to the market do not affect the participants optimal bidding strategies (the Nash equilibrium), but lowers payoffs for all aggregators participating in the market relative to unregulated competition.

40|$|The ways {{in which}} {{electricity}} is being generated, distributed, transmitted, and stored are undergoing unprecedented change. Movements for energy democracy, and proponents of a Just Transition -a transformation of the current fossil fuel-based system into place-based, sustainable, equitable, and democratically controlled economies-have attempted to capture the potential of these changes to realize a low-carbon electricity system through new and more equitable electricity generation and procurement models. Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) is one such utility-scale electricity service provision model in California that explicitly aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the provision of locally produced and democratically controlled renewable energy that simultaneously catalyzes localized economic development. Although community choice aggregation is a twenty-year-old electricity procurement and provision model, the growth of CCAs have been slow; they have only been legalized in seven states {{since its inception in}} 1997. To date, limited academic research has been conducted to examine the barriers to the growth of community choice aggregation Furthermore, this research does not connect CCA to larger strategies to enable such a Just Transition, nor does it identify policy levers to bolster community choice aggregators' ability to deliver on their stated goals. This thesis therefore examines the barriers to realizing community choice aggregation To do so, I conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals essential to the creation of six existing and two emerging community choice aggregators in California. I find that while exit fees, customer opt-outs, and financing remain persistent challenges to CCA formation, new CCA networks, and grassroots coalitions for a Just Transition have allowed CCAs to overcome these barriers. Additionally, I observed that for community choice aggregators, maintaining business functions and ensuring ratepayer-based revenue take precedence over catalyzing economic development. Ultimately, I find that while the CCA market has experienced significant development, allowing them to provide ratepayers cost competitive renewable <b>energy,</b> community choice <b>aggregators</b> have not matured to a point where they are able to meaningfully catalyze local economic development or deepen civic engagement in energy-related decisions at a local level. In order to transform those challenges into opportunities for deepening civic engagement and community wealth for (low-income) communities (of color) and further realize a vision of a just transition, this thesis concludes with proposed state regulatory changes to catalyze mutually beneficial "public-public" relationships between CCAs, electricity co-operatives, and unions to further advance a Just Transition, and help community choice aggregators deliver on their goals. by Samuel Jung.

40|$|In the {{transition}} from traditional power plants to more environmentally friendly alternatives will generate {{a need for more}} flexibility in production, transmission and consumption. Energy storage can be provide the flexibility that are required to continue to have a robust and stable electrical system. The purpose of this report is to give an overview of the electrical energy storage technologies. The classification of energy storage technologies used in this report is mechanical, chemical and electrical. In these three categories were ten different technologies presented with function, advantages, disadvantages, degree of maturity and research area for each technology. The distribution between the globally operational energy storage technologies were presented. Also the framework and regulations for actors to own and operate an energy storage in Sweden. This review was complemented with a case study about connecting a lithium ion battery system to a wind farm. The case investigated the profitability for 20 MW wind farm with a 12 MW and 18 MWh energy storage system for a five and ten-year period. The utilization of the storage was optimized with What's best for three different investment cost. The review were done in order to answer: what is the futures energy storage technology?, what applications can be replaced by energy storage for an electricity producer? and what will the effects be of the new actor Aggregator? The result from comparing three different prices for lithium ion batteries resulted in a non-profit scenario for all the cases in a five-year period. There were a maximum, minimum and predicted futuristic price, which generated a loss of 731, 220 and 76. 6 MSEK for respective case. Only the futuristic price for a ten-year period indicated an profit. The conclusion that can be drawn from this case study is that energy storage is too expensive and the extra income from utilization of the energy storage is not enough to motivate an energy storage investment. There are not a single technology that possesses all of the required properties for the applications. In the future there will be a combination of technologies to cover all the applications. For the seasonal storage pumped hydro and compressed air are most promising technologies. The flywheels and supercapacitors can contribute with short powerful burst of energy that are needed for power quality and operating reserves. For the more wide range application such as power fleet optimization and integrate the renewable energy production, batteries in form of lithium ion battery and sodium-sulfur battery will most probably be used. For electricity producers energy storage can replace existing solutions. Instead of using diesel generators for black start services, an battery can be used. Also the power quality could be enhanced with batteries acting as filters. The process can be more utilized in a more efficient way with an <b>energy</b> storage. The <b>aggregator</b> actor gathers small variable load from e. g several houses and participate on the electricity market. This actor will level out the differences in power demand during the day. It will reduce the losses and reduce the need for grid investments in both the transmission and distribution networks. It would also generate more available frequency reserves and probably change how the market is paying for the generated benefits...|$|R
