5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor <b>Eimer</b> (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. <b>Eimer</b> claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. <b>Eimer</b> linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described <b>Eimer</b> as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E

25|$|Orthogenesis was {{the theory}} that life has an innate {{tendency}} to change, in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction. The term was popularized by Theodor <b>Eimer,</b> a German zoologist, in his 1898 book On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. He had studied the coloration of butterflies, and believed he had discovered non-adaptive features {{which could not be}} explained by natural selection. <b>Eimer</b> also believed in Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics, but he felt that internal laws of growth determine which characteristics would be acquired and guided the long term direction of evolution down certain paths.|$|E

25|$|Caballero: A Historical Novel, often {{known only}} as Caballero, is a {{historical}} romance coauthored by Jovita González and Margaret <b>Eimer</b> (under the pseudonym Eve Raleigh). Written in the 1930s and early 1940s, but not published until 1996, the novel is sometimes called Texas's Gone with the Wind.|$|E
25|$|Although González and <b>Eimer</b> {{are both}} {{credited}} as authors, literary historians typically consider González the novel's primary creative force. In 1930, she earned her M.A. in {{history from the}} University of Texas at Austin, where she knew and was encouraged to write about her Mexican-American heritage by folklorist J. Frank Dobie. After her graduation, González moved to San Antonio, Texas to teach Spanish. However, in 1934, under Dobie's supervision, she received a one-year fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation that commissioned her to research and write a book on South Texas history. Caballero and another novel (Dew on the Thorn) {{seem to have been}} the result of that fellowship.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact number}} of texts in the Kangyur is not fixed. Each editor takes {{responsibility}} for removing texts he considers spurious or adding new translations. Currently {{there are about}} 12 available Kangyurs. These include the Derge, Lhasa, Narthang, Cone, Peking, Urga, Phudrak and Stog Palace versions, each named after the physical location of its printing (or copying {{in the case of}} manuscripts editions). In addition, some canonical texts have been found in Tabo and Dunhuang which provide earlier exemplars to texts found in the Kangyur. The majority of extant Kangyur editions appear to stem from the so-called Old Narthang Kangyur, though the Phukdrak and Tawang editions are thought to lie outside of that textual lineage. The stemma of the Kangyur have been well researched in particular by Helmut <b>Eimer</b> and Paul Harrison.|$|E
40|$|Talpid moles {{are small}} {{insectivores}} {{that live in}} dark underground tunnels. They depend heavily on touch to navigate and find food. Most species have an array of complex epidermal sensory structures called <b>Eimer’s</b> organs that cover {{the tip of the}} nose. In this study, the anatomy of <b>Eimer’s</b> organ was examined in the coast mole and star-nosed mole by using the fluorescent styryl pyridinium dye AM 1 - 43 and immunocytochemical staining for neurofilament 200 and substance P. In addition, DiI was used to label neural components of <b>Eimer’s</b> organ. AM 1 - 43 labeled all of the <b>Eimer’s</b> organ receptors after systemic injection, suggesting a role in mechanotransduction. Immunostaining with neurofilament 200 and substance P labeled distinct subtypes of sensory fibers. Substance P labeled a group of free nerve endings along the outer edge of <b>Eimer’s</b> organ, indicating a nociceptive role for these fibers. In contrast, neurofilament 200 labeled a more central set of nerve endings, suggesting that these fibers function as low-threshold mechanoreceptors. By labeling subsets of trigeminal afferents distant from the receptor array with DiI, we revealed innervation patterns indicating that one afferent supplies the outer, substance P-positive set of free nerve endings, whereas several afferents differentially innervate the central free nerve endings. Our results suggest that the free nerve endings innervating <b>Eimer’s</b> organ are largely mechanosensitive and may {{play an important role in}} the rapid sensory discrimination observed in these species...|$|R

500|$|The term orthogenesis was {{introduced}} by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor <b>Eimer</b> five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of directed evolution. With {{the emergence of the}} modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal Nature in 1948, by stating that it implied [...] "some supernatural force". The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as [...] "the mysterious inner force". Modern supporters include E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret <b>Eimer</b> was the {{co-author}} for Caballero: A Historical Novel {{and a close}} friend to Jovita González. She used the pseudonym Eve Raleigh in her writing, possibly referencing to Eve, the first female, and Raleigh (Sir Walter Raleigh) the English explorer of the Americas. <b>Eimer</b> was a [...] "frustrated but talented writer whose short stories had been rejected by numerous magazines". She had moved to Del Rio, Texas {{along with her husband}} [...] "Pop" [...] <b>Eimer</b> from Joplin, Missouri in concurrence with the flow of Anglo settlers moving to Texas during the agricultural boom. In Del Rio, <b>Eimer</b> [...] "developed a warm, even intimate, friendship with Jovita González, a Texas local with Mexican-descent, with whom she shared both a passion for writing and a skeptical stance toward received wisdom about politics, religion, and gender norms". Letters written to González from <b>Eimer</b> expressed her East Coast intellectuality, organized religion, and her opinions regarding societal gender norms, for example, how she persistently refused to marry. González and <b>Eimer</b> collaboratively and interethnically wrote Caballero: A Historical Novel. Although <b>Eimer</b> eventually moved back to Missouri, through the use of the U.S. mail system they continued to work and edit Caballero manuscripts and finish the novel.

50|$|Each <b>Eimer’s</b> organ is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of primary afferents, thus the star is densely innervated. It is associated with a Merkel cell-neurite complex {{at the base of the}} cell column, a lamellated corpuscle in the dermis just below the column and a series of free nerve endings that originate from myelinated fibers in the dermis, run through the central column and end in a ring of terminal swellings just below the outer keratinized skin surface. All 25,000 <b>Eimer’s</b> organs distributed along the surface of the star have this basic structure in all 22 appendages. Nevertheless, the fovea region (11th pair of rays), which is shorter in area, has a lower density of these organs—900 <b>Eimer's</b> organs on its surface while some of the lateral rays have over 1500. This may sound contradictory with the fact that this region has higher resolution and an important role in foraging behavior. However, instead of having more sensory organs this fovea region uses a different approach in which a skin surface may be more sensitive to mechanoreceptice input; it has more innervation density. Rays 1 through 9 each had about 4 fibers per <b>Eimer's</b> organ, while rays 10 and 11 had significantly higher innervation densities of 5.6 and 7.1 fibers per organ, respectively, revealing how the sensory periphery is differentially specialized across the star.|$|R

5000|$|Marasco et al. {{attribute}} different {{functions to}} <b>Eimer's</b> {{two sets of}} free-ending nerve fibres in the star-nosed mole and the coast mole Scapanus orarius. The authors published micrographs of the organ and its innervation, depicting <b>Eimer's</b> free-ending fibers {{as well as the}} Merkel cell-neurite complexes and the Vater-Pacini corpuscles. Using a histochemical marker for a protein known {{to be involved in the}} processing of pain, they were able to label the nerve fibres at the perimeter of the papilla, suggesting that they are nociceptive, i.e. they respond to pain. By contrast, the fibres in papilla's core did not stain for the protein, suggesting that they are mechano-receptive. These nerve fibres as well as the Merkel cell-neurite complexes are known to respond to local touches with great sensitivity, whereas the Vater-Pacini corpuscles are highly tuned to the frequencies of dispersed vibrations. <b>Eimer's</b> organ, therefore, forms a receptor complex, integrating pain receptors as well as three fundamentally different types of touch receptors which preferentially respond to either skin indentations or vibrations. The follicles of whiskers, also known as vibrissae or sinus hairs, and the push rods in monotremes, as published by Proske et al., represent the only other known discrete structures in the skin that combine three mechanoreceptor types.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{variation}} of this task, Haggard and <b>Eimer</b> asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide which hand to move. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the [...] "lateralized readiness potential" [...] (LRP), an ERP component which measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and <b>Eimer</b> argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.|$|E
2500|$|González invited <b>Eimer</b> to {{coauthor}} {{the novel}} {{around the year}} 1937.

2500|$|In {{her book}} Native Speakers, Cotera {{argues that the}} {{significance}} of the co-authorship of this novel has often been ignored, under analyzed, and wrongly criticized. [...] The novel has been criticized and rejected by both Chicana/o scholars and historically white publishers because of the unique collaboration between González and <b>Eimer.</b> [...] This {{played a significant role in}} the failure of getting Caballero published during their lifetimes. [...] González was extremely frustrated by this during her life. [...] There has, however, been a strong counterargument to these rejections that considers the power of these two women from such different backgrounds speaking out together against [...] "the singularity of patriarchal thinking and its bankrupt formulations of identity and authority". Another fascinating component of this collaboration is that it simultaneously tells the Mexican side of the war and reflects a partnership between a Mexican-American and Anglo-American author. [...] Cotera argues that it is only natural for these women to work together as [...] "the notion of a singular author is a construct of modernity that is inextricably linked ‘to the development of modern capitalism and of intellectual property, to Western rationalism, and to patriarchy’". [...] Caballero works to undo this discourse through collaboration as when you write together [...] "you have to desire the collaborative world under formation more than the unextended ‘yours’ and ‘mine’ of the old power structures".|$|E
2500|$|This {{collaboration}} is not however, {{to be confused}} with assimilation or [...] "selling out". [...] The romance plots in the novel have been perceived as assimilationist as if the Anglo men are conquering the Mexican women. [...] However, as Cotera notes, [...] "such criticisms are founded, of course, on the exigencies of race and nation, forcing what is essentially a critique of patriarchal ideology into service as a critique of imperialism, a service that the novel only imperfectly satisfies". [...] Instead of viewing the collaboration as a [...] "sell out" [...] or a problem, it {{can be viewed as a}} nepantla, a term the highly acclaimed and respected Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa uses based on a Nahuatl word that refers to [...] "a space between or a middle ground". [...] This concept favors the recognition of the humanity in others and ourselves in order to create bridges and overcome borders. [...] This works on multiple levels, [...] "collapsing ‘the binaries of colored/white, female/male, mind/body," [...] all of which are relevant to Caballero and the historical context of the novel. [...] <b>Eimer</b> and Gonzalez took a leap of faith in one another in both their friendship and their work, as [...] "Caballero's collaborations across difference take place against a historical and geographical backdrop that highlights the risks that such a crossing entail a U.S.-Mexico borderlands still in formation in 1846-1848…". [...] It cannot be stressed enough that beyond the Mexican/Anglo leap of faith taken, the text works with many layers of collaboration on the [...] "path of conocimiento". Caballero's structure of genres is [...] "part history, part tragedy, part romance, part feminist tract," [...] and [...] "its multivalent strategies of description reflect the very complexity of the historical transformations that it seeks to document.|$|E

50|$|In 1996 Marasco {{determined}} that the threshold by which the star-like structure senses the mechanical stimuli depends on which type of the <b>Eimer’s</b> organ was excited. He characterized three main classes of <b>Eimer’s</b> receptors, including one of slow adaptation (Tonic receptor) and two of rapid adaptation (Phasic receptor). The tonic receptor has a response {{similar to that of}} a Merkel cell-neurite complex. It has free terminals and is therefore able to detect pressure and texture with a high sensitivity and at a Random Sustained Discharge. The rapid adapting responses include a Paccinian-like response based on an (on-off) response caused by pressure and mechanical vibrations with maximum sensitivity to stimuli at a frequency of 250 Hz. The differences between both rapid responses rely on the fact that one of them only has a response during the compression phase.|$|R
