Beshear announced that his proposal for a constitutional amendment to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives <b>for</b> <b>homeowners</b> and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E

25|$|The government's role as {{the primary}} {{investor}} allows a systematic loan refinancing process to be implemented. This should enable rapid loan adjustments or workouts <b>for</b> <b>homeowners,</b> which have been facing bottlenecks due to the requirement to have various investors approve the adjustments. For example, the government could rapidly push-down 45-year mortgage terms and fixed, low interest rates, enabling many more homeowners {{to stay in their}} homes.

The income limit is $35,000 <b>for</b> <b>homeowners.</b> The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.|$|E
25|$|The {{first piece}} of {{legislation}} Rendell initiated was The Plan for a New Pennsylvania. The Plan proposed using slot machine revenue to reduce taxes by $1.5 billion (an average 30% decrease <b>for</b> <b>homeowners)</b> and included $687 million in increased education funding. The plan was {{to be paid for}} with a proposed income tax increase from 2.80% to 3.75% plus increased taxes on utilities and beer. The governor's plan passed but with a smaller tax increase to only 3.07% and increased education funding of $450 million. The final budget deal included additional taxes on cigarettes and utilities.|$|E
25|$|Some Berwick Area School District {{residents}}, including: {{low income}} residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; {{and people with}} disabilities age 18 and older, can qualify for the state's Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. The income limit is $35,000 <b>for</b> <b>homeowners.</b> Residents must apply annually to receive up to $650. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.|$|E

25|$|If a water {{absorbing}} swale {{for each}} yard {{is combined with}} permeable concrete streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains. One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land <b>for</b> <b>homeowners</b> and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, Canada's {{most populous}} province, generates some 9,600 MW annually, {{over half of}} that coming from one dozen nuclear reactors. Ontario also has natural gas, and hydro facilities. However, Ontario faces a {{challenge}} as it must replace 80% of its generating capacity in the next twenty years—the old stations have time-expired and the nuclear reactors are overstressed. A debate continues over whether to go largely nuclear or go with renewables. Since the Green Energy Act 2009, the debate has become even more heated. As one of the outcomes of the Act, electricity prices have exponentially - by 95% <b>for</b> <b>homeowners</b> and by 115% for small businesses {{in the province of}} Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Framingham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} Massachusetts that have met their legal {{requirement}} of 10% for Massachusetts Chapter 40B Affordable housing which mostly targets people with income levels in the 70% of median income. In addition to its 40B Affordable component, Framingham has a large percentage of rental units which target people in the 30% of median income bracket. Framingham has a much larger percentage of rental households than any of the surrounding towns. Statewide, the median income of rental households is 47% of the median <b>for</b> <b>homeowners,</b> and in Middlesex County it is slightly more than 50%.

500|$|Before {{the entire}} Congress {{was charged with}} seeking a {{solution}} to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and overall economic crisis of 2008, Jackson proposed that the United States Department of Agriculture increase the allotment of food stamps. During the congressional debates on a federal bailout, Jackson worried about the viability of various plan iterations to his constituents. Although only two years earlier he spoke of Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in glowing terms, he could not support the late-September version of the legislation she was proposing because he felt it contained inadequate homeowner protections. [...] Although he voted against the bill on September 29, 2008 he voted in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 on October 3, 2008. [...] He later expressed concerns in a New York Times op-ed article about the implications that the eventual bill had on enfranchisement {{due to the lack of}} protections <b>for</b> <b>homeowners</b> as it relates to voting rights.
