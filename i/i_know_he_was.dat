25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
500|$|One {{continuing}} subplot {{with the}} tour's scheduling was E Street drummer Max Weinberg's availability vis à vis {{his job as}} The Max Weinberg 7 bandleader for Conan O'Brien, given that {{during the first half}} of 2009 Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York was ending and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles was beginning. [...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they had just gotten off the Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very much trying to figure it out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

2500|$|Six {{weeks before}} the fire, he split up with his girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano. Before that, González had lost his job at a lamp factory in Queens. At {{the time of the}} fire, he was two weeks behind on the rent of his room, and the owner of the {{boarding}} house where he was staying said of him [...] "From what <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> down to his last hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Hainkel's death, Congress, on {{a motion}} from Louisiana Republican Bobby Jindal (who {{would later be}} elected {{governor}} of Louisiana), declared that Hainkel's death [...] "is a loss {{for me and for}} all Louisiana. He was a good friend {{and one of the most}} supportive people <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> always ready to lend a helping and guiding hand, whatever the situation may be." [...] Later, at Jindal's request, Congress voted to rename the post office in Hammond to honor Hainkel.|$|E
2500|$|An FBI {{recording}} of Black's hotel suite in April 1963 recorded him saying of Levinson to columnist Jack Anderson, [...] "Jack, some day when Eddie comes here for dinner or something, I {{want you to}} meet him. He's a little hard to describe. I know his whole background. He was probably the biggest bookmaker Detroit ever had. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the biggest gambler Miami ever had. Then he went to Las Vegas. He came under the granddaddy law; it excused him for anything he ever did as long as he stayed working in Nevada. He told us all those things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had {{the charge}} of him, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} to you. You see I am informed of the circumstances?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "One {{more but}} him I shall not tell about, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in earnest and really suffered, though I was as kind as I {{knew how to}} be. I'm young in these things yet, so I grieved for him, and treat his love with the tenderest respect." ...|$|E
60|$|Profuse in his farewells, he {{got down}} {{again as the}} coachman got up.
