50|$|IPC, the Association Connecting Electronics Industries, is a trade {{association}} whose {{aim is to}} standardize the assembly and production requirements of electronic equipment and assemblies. It was founded in 1957 as the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuits.</b> Its name was later changed to the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic Circuits to highlight the expansion from bare boards to packaging and electronic assemblies. In 1999, the organization formally {{changed its name to}} IPC with the accompanying tagline, Association Connecting Electronics Industries.|$|E
50|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{substrates}} that are used with planar technologies. <b>For</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuits,</b> glass-reinforced epoxy (FR-4 grade) is commonly used. High permittivity ceramic-PTFE laminates (e.g. Rogers Corporation 6010 board) are expressly intended for microwave applications. At the higher microwave frequencies, a ceramic material such as aluminium oxide (alumina) might be used for hybrid microwave integrated circuits (MICs). At the very highest microwave frequencies, in the millimetre band, a crystalline substrate might be used such as sapphire or quartz. Monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) will have substrates composed of the semiconductor material of which the chip is built such as silicon or gallium arsenide, or an oxide deposited on the chip such as silicon dioxide.|$|E

50|$|A {{metal foil}} is most {{commonly}} used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil <b>for</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuits</b> divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|E

40|$|The {{derivation}} of the closed-form spatial domain Green’s {{functions for}} the vector and scalar potentials is presented for a microstrip geometry with a substrate and a super-state, whose thicknesses can be arbitrary. The spatial domain Green’s functions <b>for</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuits</b> are typically expressed as Sommerfeld integrals, that are inverse Hankel transform of the corresponding spectral domain Green’s functions, and are quite time-consuming to evaluate. Closed-form representations of these Green’s {{functions in the}} spatial domains can only be obtained if the integrands are approximated by a linear combination of functions that are analytically integrable. In this paper, we show we can accomplish this by approximating the spectral domain Green’s functions in terms of complex exponentials by using the least square Prony’s method. © 1992 IEE...|$|E
40|$|Copper foil {{has been}} {{produced}} {{for many years}} by electroforming technique, the major use of such foil is in copper clad plastic laminates {{for use in the}} manufacture of printed circuits. In the production of copper foils various mandrel materials like chromium, nickel, stainless steel, lead, titanium, rhenium has been employed. These mandrels very often produces porous foil unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuits.</b> The present investigation was undertaken with a view to develop a suitable mandrel to produce copper foil acceptable for printed circuit production. Electrodeposited tin-nickel alloy has been found to posses good corrosion resistance and preferred in certain applications than decorative chromium. A passive film is also said to form on this surface similar to chromium. Hence electroplated tin-nickel alloy mandrel was prepared using the electrolytes reported in the literature and copper foils were electroformed over this mandrel. It has been found that electroplated tin-nickel alloy mandrel produces less number of pores in comparison to chromium and stainless steel. This mandrel has also been utilized for the production of screens by photographic masking and electroforming techniqu...|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} rapid, economical {{process has}} been devised for patterning a thin film of indium tin oxide (ITO) that has been deposited on a polyester film. ITO is a transparent, electrically conductive substance made from a mixture of indium oxide and tin oxide that is commonly used in touch panels, liquid-crystal and plasma display devices, gas sensors, and solar photovoltaic panels. In a typical application, the ITO film must be patterned to form electrodes, current collectors, and the like. Heretofore it has been common practice to pattern an ITO film by means of either a laser ablation process or a photolithography/etching process. The laser ablation process includes the use of expensive equipment to precisely position and focus a laser. The photolithography/etching process is time-consuming. The present process is {{a variant of the}} direct toner process an inexpensive but often highly effective process for patterning conductors <b>for</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuits.</b> Relative to a conventional photolithography/ etching process, this process is simpler, takes less time, and is less expensive. This process involves equipment that costs less than $ 500 (at 2005 prices) and enables patterning of an ITO film in a process time of less than about a half hour...|$|E
40|$|To {{realize the}} {{potential}} cost savings promised by printed electronics, high-speed, large-volume manufacturing methods must be established. Rotary printing {{techniques such as}} those used in the graphic arts are ideal candidates. However, very {{little research has been}} done on utilizing these techniques for printed electronics because digital processes such ink-jet printing have offered researchers a low-cost flexible solution for demonstrating the printability of their materials, despite the fact that these processes may be difficult to scale for large-volume manufacturing. 	In this thesis, gravure, a printing process which offers the highest resolution, highest speed, and largest volume production in the graphic arts is demonstrated as a viable technique for printed electronics. In order to make laboratory-scale research with this technique possible, a custom table-top gravure printing press was designed. This press allows for small amounts of ink to be utilized during a print and enables multi-layer prints with a registration accuracy not seen in conventional gravure printing presses and suitable for printed electronics. With this press, printing processes to deposit functional materials <b>for</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuits</b> are investigated with a focus on developing process modules to manufacture fully printed organic thin film transistors. Considerable effort is made to establish processes to deposit metallic lines with feature sizes below 20 &# 956;m and a total surface roughness below 20 nm, uniform thin films of polymer dielectrics with thicknesses as low as 70 nm, and high performance polymer semiconductors. These processes are then integrated to manufacture capacitors suitable for integrated circuit components and organic thin film transistors with operating frequencies as high as 18 kHz...|$|E
