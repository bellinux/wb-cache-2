25|$|Hawkeye {{joins the}} Avengers once more, and begins a brief romantic {{relationship}} with team member the Wasp. He also embarks on some solo adventures where he uncovers {{a plot to}} steal an ancient artifact in Laos, and investigates {{the murder of a}} former Soviet colonel. The Scarlet Witch, driven mad by her powers, causes a Kree warship to appear over the skies of New York. The Avengers, surprised by the appearance of the spacecraft, spring into battle. During the battle, Hawkeye's quiver of arrows is set on fire. Knowing that the explosive arrows were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> faster than he could remove them, Hawkeye flies into the engines of the Kree warship, destroying the spacecraft and sacrificing himself to save his teammates. A past version of Hawkeye is also plucked from time by the Time Variance Authority to serve as a juror in a case involving former Avengers teammate She-Hulk. She-Hulk tries unsuccessfully to warn Hawkeye as to his future.|$|E

500|$|It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to {{incorporate}} Barbie {{as a character}} who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow {{the use of the}} toy as [...] "They [...] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl's dream and desire."

Woo was first offered this job in the United States by Universal Pictures chairman Tom Pollock after he had seen Woo's film The Killer. Universal was not eager to have Woo direct an entire feature and only agreed after what producer James Jacks called a [...] "difficult period of convincing". Universal was worried about having an Asian director on set who had limited command of English on a large scale project. They hired American director Sam Raimi to oversee the film's production and to have him on standby if Woo was not able to fulfill his role as a director. Raimi was very excited to work with Woo as he was fan of his Hong Kong films. Raimi was also confident in Woo's directorial skills, stating that [...] "Woo at 70% is still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> away most American action directors working at 100%." ...|$|E

A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of some of the pictures posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI.

Robbie Daw of Idolator described the song as [...] "energetic" [...] and wrote that it follows {{in the footsteps of}} Brown's past hits [...] "Forever" [...] (2008) and [...] "Yeah 3x", [...] "but with more dancefloor urgency". Daw concluded by writing that the song [...] "should please the same crowd" [...] that listen to the music of LMFAO, Kesha and Lady Gaga.

Scott Shelter of PopCrush awarded the song three and a half stars out of four, and noted its similarities to the work of David Guetta and LMFAO. Shetler also commented that the production was lacking originality and the song [...] "isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> anyone away from a lyrical perspective". Andrew Martin of Prefix magazine was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a left over track from Guetta's album Nothing but the Beat (2011).

2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
