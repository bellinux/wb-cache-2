5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of various {{strategies for the}} diagnostic management of clinically suspected scaphoid frac ture, a decision-analytic model was built to evaluate three strat egies and to compare them with a (clairvoyant) reference diag nostic management strategy. Methods: Evaluated strategies were: (A) repeated radiography up to 2 wk; (B) repeat radiogra phy up to 6 wk; and (C) radiography, followed by bone scintig-raphy in patients with negative initial radiographs. Therapy con sisted of 12 wk of immobilization for a radiographically or scintigraphically proven fracture. Diagnostic costs, therapeutic costs, period of immobilization and nonunion rate were calcu lated for all three strategies. Estimates were derived from a descriptive management study using bone scintigraphy and available literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Overall costs were 273. 7, 317. 7 and 316. 1 <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Units</b> (ECU) for Strategies A, B and C, respectively (1 ECU = 1. 15 U. S. dollar). Strategy B led to the longest average period of immobilization (8. 6 wk), while Strategy A resulted in the highest nonunion rate (4. 7 %). The costs per nonunion saved for the additional use of bone scintigraphy (Strategy C) was ECU 2618 when compared to Strategy A.

By 1990, {{the year the}} Comoros concluded negotiations with the IMF for an economic restructuring program, the republic's total external public debt was US$162.4 million, an amount equal to about three-quarters of GNP. The government delayed implementing the structural adjustment plan and was directed by the World Bank and the IMF {{to do so by}} September 1992. The plan recommendations entailed discharging about 2,800 of 9,000 civil servants, among other unpopular measures. The IMF granted the Comoros a new credit for US$1.9 million in March 1994 under the Structural Adjustment Facility. For the period 1994-96, the Comoros sought an economic growth rate of 4 percent as well as an inflation rate of 4 percent for 1995-96. The growth rate for 1994, however, was estimated only at 0.7 percent and the inflation rate at 15 percent. Meanwhile, in a move designed to encourage private enterprise and reduce unemployment, in May 1993 the UN Development Programme had given the Comoros a credit of US$2 million for programs in these areas. In January 1994, the European Development Fund (EDF) granted 1.3 million <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Units</b> (ECUs; for value, see Glossary) to the Comoros to develop small businesses.

40|$|Objective: To analyse {{the direct}} medical costs and {{effectiveness}} of vaccinating adults aged between 18 and 64 years and elderly persons >= 65 years of age with the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Design and setting: This was a decision-analytic modelling study from the societal perspective in Belgium. The analysis compared `vaccination' with `no vaccination and treatment'. Methods: Calculations {{were based on the}} assumption that vaccination is as effective against all pneumococcal infections as it is against invasive pneumococcal disease. Data on the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis, frequency of hospitalisation, mortality rates and vaccine effectiveness were derived from the international literature. Costs were derived from analysis of historical data for cases of pneumococcal infection in Belgium. Results: Vaccinating 1000 adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years gains approximately 2 life-years in comparison with the no vaccination option. However, to realise these additional health benefits requires additional costs of 11 800 <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Units</b> (ECU; 1995 values) per life-year saved. Vaccinating 1000 elderly people (>= 65 years) leads to > 9 life-years gained as well as a small monetary benefit of ECU 1250. An extensive sensitivity analysis did not greatly affect the results for the elderly population: vaccination in this age group always remained favourable, and thus it is clearly indicated from an economic point of view. A crucial assumption for both age groups is that the effectiveness of the vaccine holds for all pneumococcal pneumonia. It is clear that the results will become less favourable if this assumption is dropped. Conclusions: Preventing pneumococcal infections by vaccination clearly benefits people's health. Reimbursement can be recommended for the elderly group; however, more accurate epidemiological data are still needed to make decisions concerning routine pneumococcal vaccination in adultsCost effectiveness, Elderly, Pharmacoeconomics, Pneumococcal infections, Pneumococcal PS 23 F TT conjugate vaccine, Research and development, Vaccines...|$|R

40|$|Aims We {{analysed}} whether generalized use of tirofiban plus heparin and aspirin {{might save}} direct healthcare costs, {{as compared with}} heparin and aspirin alone, in patients with acute coronary ischaemic syndromes in Switzerland. Methods and Results We conducted an incremental cost-consequence analysis {{from the perspective of}} the admitting hospital for the period of the first 7 days. Costs were analysed for the management of refractory ischaemic conditions and myocardial infarctions, including incremental days on the general ward or intensive care unit, as well as necessary revascularization procedures, and expressed in Swiss francs (CHF) and <b>European</b> <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> (ECU). Drug costs were based on a loading dose of 0 · 4 μ. kg− 1. min− 1 and a maintenance dose of 0 · 1 μ. kg− 1. min− 1 for tirofiban at a cost of CHF 273 · 55 (ECU 166 · 50) per vial. Heparin was administered at a loading dose of 5000 U and a maintenance dose of 1000 U. h− 1. All calculations were standardized to 100 treated patients. The costs of managing ischaemic complications were based on typical practice patterns in Swiss hospitals. The incremental costs per patient of managing unstable angina patients with recurrent ischaemia or myocardial infarction were calculated as CHF 23325 (ECU 14198) and CHF 18599 (ECU 11321), respectively. The incremental drug costs amounted to CHF 82065 (ECU 49954). The additional use of tirofiban resulted in net savings of CHF 54899 (ECU 33418) per 100 patients, achieved through a reduction in the cost of treating refractory ischaemic conditions (CHF 79306, ECU 48275) and myocardial infarctions (CHF 57658, ECU 35097).

40|$|Attitudes to home {{artificial}} nutrition (HAN) {{in cancer}} vary greatly {{from country to}} country. A 6 -year prospective survey {{of the practice of}} HAN in advanced cancer patients applied by a hospital-at-home programme in an Italian health district was performed to estimate the utilization rate, to evaluate efficacy in preventing death from cachexia, maintaining patients at home without burdens and distress and improving patients' performance status, and to obtain information about costs. Patients were eligible for HAN when all the following were present: hypophagia; life expectancy 6 weeks or more, suitable patient and family circumstances; and verbal informed consent. From July 1990 to June 1996, 587 patients were evaluated; 164 were selected for HAN (135 enteral and 29 parenteral) and were followed until 31 December 1996. The incidence of HAN per million inhabitants was 18. 4 {{in the first year of}} activity and 33. 2 - 36. 9 in subsequent years, being 4 - 10 times greater than rates reported by the Italian HAN registers. On 31 December 1996, 158 patients had died because of the disease and 6 were on treatment. Mean survival was 17. 2 weeks for those on enteral nutrition and 12. 2 weeks for those on parenteral nutrition. Prediction of survival was 72 % accurate. 95 patients had undergone 155 readmissions to hospital, where they spent 15 - 23 % of their survival time. Burdens due to HAN were well accepted by 124 patients, an annoyance or scarcely tolerable in the remainder. The frequency of major complications of parenteral nutrition was 0. 67 per year for catheter sepsis and 0. 16 per year for deep vein thrombosis. Karnofsky performance score increased in only 13 patients and body weight increased in 43. The fixed direct costs per patient-day (in <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Units)</b> were 14. 2 for the nutrition team, 18. 2 for enteral nutrition and 61 for parenteral nutrition. The results indicate that definite entry criteria and local surveys are required for the correct use of HAN in advanced cancer patients, that HAN can be applied without causing additional burdens and distress, and that its costs are not higher than hospital costs...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{assess the}} {{economic}} imapct of the Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC). The PARC programme commenced in 1986 {{with the objective}} to control and ultimately eradicate rinderpest from Africa. From among the thirty-five countries that participated in PARC, ten countries were selected for the analysis, based on data availability. The three following key socio-economic issues were addressed: cost-effectiveness, returns to investment and the welfare gains of the intervention. The standard cost-benefit approach based on a computer spreadsheet model {{was used to assess}} the economic impact of rinderpest control. Benefits of the intervention consisted of increased revenue due to avoided production losses. Estimates of the value of production losses were obtained under both `with PARC' and `without PARC' scenarios and the incremental benefits were derived as {{the difference between the two}} scenarios. In addition, an economic surplus model was used to assess the distribution of welfare effects generated by the intervention. Analysis of funding for the national campaigns showed roughly equal commitment to the programme by national governments and the principal donor, the European Union. Examination of the implementation costs in the ten countries indicated that with the exception of one country, PARC was implemented in a cost-effective manner with average costs appearing within a relatively narrow range. The figures obtained in ECU (<b>European</b> <b>currency</b> <b>units)</b> were between ECU 0. 27 and ECU 0. 60 per head of cattle vaccinated. The estimated average return from the ten countries (ECU 1. 8 for each ECU invested in the campaign) demonstrates that based on the sample of countries, rinderpest control in Africa has been economically profitable. In each of ten countries, estimated benefits at least covered the value of the investment in PARC. The programme has provided a total net present value of ECU 29 million for the ten countries, suggesting that the implementation of PARC has been a wise public investment decision. Analysis of the distribution of the welfare gains from PARC revealed that producers derived the greater share of the ECU 58 million in net value of production losses avoided due to rinderpest control in the ten countries. Consumer gains accounted for approximately one-fifth of the total, due to lower prices from increased supplies...|$|R
