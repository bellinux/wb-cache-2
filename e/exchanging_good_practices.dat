5000|$|Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) {{is a term}} {{adopted by}} the UNFCCC in 2015 {{to have a better}} name for this topic than [...] "Article 6". It refers to Article 6 of the Convention’s {{original}} text (1992), focusing on six priority areas: education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and international cooperation on these issues. The implementation of all six areas has been identified as the pivotal factor for everyone to understand and participate in solving the complex challenges presented by climate change. ACE calls on governments to develop and implement educational and public awareness programmes, train scientific, technical and managerial personnel, foster access to information, and promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects.

Two new radio programmes in Lagos school clusters were set up during the project, Radio Naus and Radio Tecnodantas FM. The “school radio for learning” project was designed to support teachers in developing the necessary ICT skills and methodologies to undertake broadcasting activities with their students.

40|$|International audienceOnce {{considered}} {{potential sources}} of danger, generating industrial risks, companies are now viewed as indispensable partners in preparing risk responses. However, this shift raises the crucial question of the coordination between the various actors, especially as the literature - particularly on public-private partnerships (PPPs) and inter-organisational collaborations - highlights multiple potential obstacles. This article analyses the conditions and difficulties {{of this type of}} collaboration in preparing the response to a major collective risk - the threat of an influenza pandemic - by examining the relations between French public authorities and companies before and during the alert raised by an outbreak of A(H 1 N 1). Shaped by responsibility and legitimacy issues, these relations are problematic and ambiguous, revealing a poorly designed framework which seems {{to be a source of}} difficulties rather than conducive to the effective handling of a pandemic threat. Ultimately, the study questions the desirability of a PPP in the specific context of risk management. This study is based on 30 interviews with public and private-sector actors together with the observation of conferences and the meetings of groups that <b>exchange</b> <b>good</b> <b>practices</b> between companies...|$|R

On the other hand, it remains vague and silent about the manner in which the dialogue should be conducted. Meanwhile, without waiting for the unification process of the European Union, several European countries have started a less structural consultation with both the Churches and other philosophies of life and with the government. In some other countries, specific consultative bodies have been established to explicate the relation to Islam. Still in other countries, rather multilateral initiatives have been taken.
