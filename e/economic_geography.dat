The economic activity generated by and conducted through LETS is based upon direct forms of social relations and a local currency which facilitate locally defined systems of value formation and distinctive moral <b>economic</b> <b>geographies.</b> Nevertheless, LETS take on some of the class and gender characteristics of the wider economy. Furthermore, the ways in which LETS are represented [...] not least in the media [...] may serve to stereotype them as exclusionary and marginal to the needs of those most in need and so to distance them from those excluded from the formal economy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{involvement}} of private sector actors in low carbon urban transitions is a neglected element of geographical analysis. Drawing on Polanyian, cultural <b>economic</b> <b>geographies</b> and the non-capitalocentric ethics of JK Gibson-Graham’s diverse economies perspective, the paper engages with the wider {{literature on the}} engagement of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in environmental action, corporate social responsibility and low carbon transitions to develop a substantivist account of the contribution of SMEs to local low carbon transitions. The paper argues that contra formalist economic analyses of economic rationality, SME owners should not {{be thought of as}} uncritical profit maximisers, but as actors in favour of positive low carbon futures. Thus the paper argues that Polanyian <b>economic</b> <b>geographies</b> and Diverse Economies perspectives, which rarely speak to each other, can be drawn together, and concludes with suggestions future research...|$|R

25|$|After the 1949 revolution, the Institute of Geography {{under the}} aegis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences became {{responsible}} for official cartography and emulated the Soviet model of geography throughout the 1950s. With its emphasis on fieldwork, sound knowledge of the physical environment and the interrelation between physical and <b>economic</b> <b>geography,</b> the Russian influence counterbalanced the many pre-liberation Western-trained Chinese geography specialists who were more interested in the historical and culture aspects of cartography. As a consequence, China's main geographical journal, the Dili Xuebao (地理学报） featured many articles by Soviet geographers. As Soviet influence waned in the 1960s, geographic activity continued as part of the process of modernisation until it came to a stop with the 1967 Cultural Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Climatic determinism, {{otherwise}} {{referred to}} as the equatorial paradox, is an aspect of <b>economic</b> <b>geography.</b> According to this theory, about 70% of a country's economic development can be predicted by the distance between that country and the equator, and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of Philip M. Parker's Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth, in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker GDP is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{location}} dynamics and spatial distribution of talent by workplace to provide evidence of the multiplicity of <b>economic</b> <b>geographies</b> of city regions. City regions are not just homogenous growth machines but complex urban landscapes. The economic growth and revitalisation of the city region {{and the rise of}} the knowledge economy, including the growth of advanced business services, have produced new location dynamics that have changed the spatial division of labour. The rise of the knowledge economy has lead to an increasing focus on labour and labour qualification as an important location factor, including the recent focus on the creative class and human capital. Based on an analysis of Copenhagen, we examine the spatial division of talent within industries to provide evidence that new uneven <b>economic</b> <b>geographies</b> of city regions are currently being produced as a result of the new location dynamics of the knowledge economy. Further, it is argued that the intraregional division of talent differs considerably even within knowledge intensive industries.
