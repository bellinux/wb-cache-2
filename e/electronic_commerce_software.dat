40|$|Although {{electronic}} commerce {{is a relatively}} new concept, it has already become a normal aspect of our daily life. The software agent technology is also relatively new. In the area of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> <b>software</b> agents could be used for example to search for the lowest prices and the best services, to buy goods on behalf of a user, etc. These applications involve a number of security issues, such as communications security, system security, and application security, that have to be solved. This paper describes how communications security is added to a lightweight agent framework. Secure agent-based {{electronic commerce}} applications require communications security services. Adding these services is a rst basis and an important enabler for the framework in order to be used for secure electronic commerce applications...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{address some of}} the {{challenges}} of the current technologies in the area of component-based programming and automated software downloading. These challenges include: component updating at runtime of affected applications, adopting the "true-push" model in order to allow for silent software modification (e. g. for removing minor implementation errors), and finding a way to integrate these technologies and <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in <b>software</b> components. To respond to these challenges, the SOFA (SOFtware Appliances) architecture, the SOFA component model and its extension, DCUP (Dynamic Component UPdating), are introduced. SOFA and DCUP provide a small set of well scaling orthogonal abstractions which address three areas: the background for <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> the component model, and support for dynamic component updating in running applications. The updating granularity can scale anything from minor implementation changes to a major reconfiguration. In contrast with the usual belief {{that it is difficult to}} map abstractions supporting component based programming to concrete computer systems, the abstractions proposed by DCUP are very easy to map to the Java and CORBA programming environments...|$|R
40|$|Business {{processes}} within {{companies are}} in general well established {{and supported by}} commercially available workflow management systems. However, when processes span multiple companies (such as, for instance, {{in the case of}} virtual enterprises or in business to business <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce),</b> <b>software</b> support quite is limited. In such cases, processes need to be implemented on top of already existing systems. The Wise project addresses this problem and provides adequate infrastructure to support the whole life-cycle of virtual enterprise processes, including the integration of legacy systems, especially of workflow management systems. In this paper, we describe our experience with the integration of SAP R/ 3 Business Workflows into Wise. In addition, and since an important characteristics of the Wise system is the enactment of processes with execution guarantees, we also discuss the provision of execution guarantees when external systems like SAP R/ 3 Business Workflows are inv [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} {{is emerging}} {{as one of the}} main application domains on the Internet and the WWW and promises to change radically the relationship between customers, retailers and service providers. However, for this to happen, electronic commerce must become effectively a better way of selling goods and services than the traditional channels. This requires a suitable infrastructure for developing electronic commerce applications that meet the needs of both customers and providers; for instance, multiparty negotiations should be supported, while restrictions on payment methods should as much as possible be banned. The current capabilities for developing <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> <b>software</b> fall short of such requirements. To contribute to the solution of this problem, we introduce here Xpect, a generic framework for the development of electronic commerce applications that provides powerful agent-based capabilities for the coordination of multiple services and the intermediation and the negotiation among multiple parties...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} is {{a rapidly}} growing area accompanied by {{the growth of the}} Internet and the World Wide Web. As information on the Internet becomes more dynamic and heterogeneous, `software agents' have been touted as the new building blocks for a new Internet structure. We foresee a future whereby the Web is populated with as many software agents (involved in electronic commerce and other activities) as there are web documents today. Organizations will not only establish web presence via web sites alone, they will also provide agents to interact with other agents. Our agent-based web commerce project investigates issues in building the infrastructure for such a large scale, distributed, agent-based web commerce system. Our approach is to provide toolkits for users to create and customize buyer and seller agents quickly. This paper describes our preliminary work in the engineering of such buyer and seller toolkits.

These tools cannot be purchased like products, {{because they do not}} reside on the user’s machine. Rather, they can be used as “services. ” In this paper, we propose a new paying mechanism for <b>Electronic</b> <b>Commerce</b> of <b>software</b> tools-on-demand, that charges users according to how much they have used a given tool: pay-per-use rental. We discuss the benefits of pay-per-use for users and producers and we evidence the critical issues in designing a system to support pay-per-use. Then we introduce WebMetrics, our pay-per-use system that supplies software metrics collection and analysis tools–on-demand. WebMetrics integrates pay-per-use in a client/server Java application.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{movement}} toward deployment of distributed approaches for <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce.</b> Intelligent <b>software</b> agents, for instance, may be instructed to act on behalf of human users in electronic transactions. A challenge with this approach is that the agents would be entrusted with access to sensitive personal or business information. How can this sensitive information be protected from unauthorized access? How can agents negotiate across jurisdictional boundaries; both corporate, and country? The latter question is of particular concern when one considers the potential for considerable variance between the regulations and policies of different governments and corporations. This is especially evident with the disparity of legislation for privacy in different countries. How can disparate regulations be accommodated effectively? What technologies are appropriate for maintaining user privacy and for protecting sensitive information for agent-based e-commerce? In this paper, we describe the issues that provoke privacy challenges for agent-based e-commerce due to current and impending privacy legislation as well as an approach for policy-driven privacy negotiation for use in distributed agent-based systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} the Internet is {{currently}} occurring at phenomenal rates. In this new environment, agents are needed to support our activities, ranging from simple Web surfing to sales and shopping. For instance, effective agents will {{change the nature of}} sales on the Internet from the current basic sales scheme to a full customer management approach. Agents can change the nature of interactions on the Internet from simple access to large databases, to dynamic and personalized information and advice sources. To implement this approach information systems will have to (1) learn their users' criteria and (2) learn how to aggregate information from different mediums and help to reinforce this information using these mediums. In order to perform both these tasks, these agents must be intelligent and embedded in software.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the Internet's connectivity has lead to proportional increase {{in the development of}} Web-based applications. Usage of downloadable content has proved e ective in a number of emerging applications including <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> <b>software</b> components on-demand, and collaborative systems. In all these cases, Internet user agents (like browsers, tuners) are widely used bythe clients to utilize and execute such downloadable content. With this new technology of using downloadable content comes the problem of the downloaded content obtaining unauthorized access to the client's resources. In e ect, granting a hostile remote principal the requested access to client's resources may lead to undesirable consequences. Hence itisimportant for the browsers to provide a framework such that the user can ne tune his system according to his trust relationship with the content authors. Currently available systems either do not allow the downloaded content to access any of the local resources or allows all the contents to have the same privileges. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a model that provides resource access control of a ner granularity for an user agent. Using our model, the client will be able to selectively grant access to resources based on a trust relationship with the principal, who has certi ed the authenticity of the contents. ...|$|E

With these elements we have implemented an <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> application inside the TRADE project 2 that demonstrates how these services can be offered in an electronic manner. 1 <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of legal and administrative services This section attempts to describe in a general way the characteristics of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. In particular, we have selected legal and administrative services to show the advantages of providing services through electronic means. 1. 1 <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services vs. <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products When we talk about <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> we are usually thinking about <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products, but there is also another kind of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> the <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. Whilst <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products consists on selecting the items we want to buy from a catalog and pay for them, <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services consists on searching for a professional or company that offers the service and contract him. During service development, there can be information request, payment or contacts with another users. 1. 2 Characteristics of legal and administrative services We have studied in detail the legal and administrative services in order to describe them. These are their main features: • There is a purchase of services.
