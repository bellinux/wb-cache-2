40|$|Data in {{the form}} of counts or {{proportions}} arise in biology, biomedical, toxicology, epidemiology and other similar fields. These data often exhibit variation greater or smaller than predicted by a simple model, such as, a Poisson or a binomial model. Thus, in practice, a model having an over or under dispersion parameter might be necessary. This is an important parameter to estimate for making appropriate inferences regarding the mean or the regression parameters in analyzing count data or binary data. Also, in some instances the dispersion parameter may be of interest in its own right. Several parametric or semi-parametric methods have been developed to estimate the dispersion parameter in the analysis of binary data. In this thesis, I first conduct an extensive empirical investigation, by simulations, to study the properties, in terms of mean bias, standard deviation and mean square error, of twenty six different estimators of the dispersion parameter that exist in the literature. Of these twenty six estimators I recommend an estimator Q 2, based on optimal quadratic estimating equations for the mean and dispersion parameters. Further, I derive an expression for a bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator (BCML) of this parameter using a beta-binomial model. A bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator of the dispersion parameter is also obtained for a regression situation. I then compare, by simulations, the BCML estimator, in terms of bias and efficiency, with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, a double extended quasi-likelihood (DEQL) estimator proposed by Lee (2004) and the estimator Q 2. A toxicological data set from Paul (1982) and a medical data set from Otake and Prentice (1984) are analyzed. The simulation results and examples indicate that the BCML estimator performs well in terms of bias and efficiency in most instances. For count data we derive a first order BCML estimator using a two-parameter negative binomial model and a (DEQL) estimator for the dispersion parameter for data involving only the mean and the dispersion parameters. The bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator of the dispersion parameter is also derived for a negative binomial regression model. The BCML estimator, in case of a two-parameter model, is compared, in terms of bias and efficiency, with the ML estimator investigated by Piegorsch (1990), the moment and the maximum extended quasi-likelihood estimators investigated by Clark and Perry (1989), and the DEQL estimator. The BCML estimator works best in term of bias and efficiency properties in most instances.

40|$|The poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite,</b> Dermanyssus gallinae, is {{currently}} a significant pest in the poultry industry in Europe. Biological control {{by the introduction of}} predatory mites is one of the various options for controlling poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> Here, we present the first results of an attempt to identify potential predators by surveying the mite fauna of European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) nests, by assessing their ability to feed on poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> and by testing for their inability to extract blood from bird hosts, i. e., newly hatched, young starlings and chickens. Two genuine predators of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> are identified: Hypoaspis aculeifer and Androlaelaps casalis. A review of the literature shows that some authors suspected the latter species to parasitize on the blood of birds and mammals, but they did not provide experimental evidence for these feeding habits and/or overlooked published evidence showing the reverse. We advocate careful analysis of the trophic structure of arthropods inhabiting bird nests as a basis for identifying candidate predators for control of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Insecticides {{commonly}} used for STLM control (methomyl, oxamyl, and pyrethroids such as esfenvalerate) are highly toxic to predatory mites.

40|$|AbstractSecondary pest {{outbreak}} is a counterintuitive ecological backlash {{of pesticide}} use in agriculture {{that takes place}} {{with the increase in}} abundance of a non-targeted pest species after pesticide application against a targeted pest species. Although the phenomenon was well recognized, its alternative causes are seldom considered. Outbreaks of the southern <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> Oligonychus ilicis are frequently reported in Brazilian coffee farms after the application of pyrethroid insecticides against the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella. Selectivity favoring the <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> against its main predatory mites is generally assumed as the outbreak cause, but this theory has never been tested. Here, we assessed the toxicity (and thus the selectivity) of deltamethrin against both mite species: the southern <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> and its phytoseid predator Amblyseius herbicolus. Additionally, behavioral avoidance and deltamethrin-induced hormesis were also tested as potential causes of <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> outbreak using free-choice behavioral walking bioassays with the predatory mite and life-table experiments with both mite species, respectively. Lethal toxicity bioassays indicated that the predatory mite was slightly more susceptible than its prey (1. 5 ×), but in more robust demographic bioassays, the predator was three times more tolerant to deltamethrin than its prey, indicating that predator susceptibility to deltamethrin is not a cause of the reported outbreaks. The predator did not exhibit behavioral avoidance to deltamethrin; however insecticide-induced hormesis in the <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> led to its high population increase under low doses, which was not observed for the predatory mite. Therefore, deltamethrin-induced hormesis is a likely cause of the reported <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess their}} {{potential}} to control poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> (Dermanyssus gallinae), we tested selected predaceous mites (Androlaelaps casalis and Stratiolaelaps scimitus) that occur naturally in wild bird nests or sometimes spontaneously invade poultry houses. This was done under laboratory conditions in cages, each with 2 – 3 laying hens, initially 300 poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> {{and later the}} release of 1, 000 predators. These small-scale tests were designed to prevent mite escape from the cages and they were carried out in three replicates at each of three temperature regimes: 26, 30 (constant day and night) and 33 – 25 °C (day-night cycle). After 6 weeks total population sizes of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> and predatory mites were assessed. For the temperature regimes of 26 and 33 / 25 °C S. scimitus reduced the poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> population relative to the control experiments by a factor 3 and 30, respectively, and A. casalis {{by a factor of}} 18 and 55, respectively. At 30 °C the predators had less effect on <b>red</b> <b>mites,</b> with a reduction of 1. 3 -fold for S. scimitus and 5. 6 -fold for A. casalis. This possibly reflected hen manure condition or an effect of other invertebrates in the hen feed. Poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> control was not negatively affected by temperatures as high as 33 °C and was always better in trials with A. casalis than in those with S. scimitus. In none of the experiments predators managed to eradicate the population of poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> This may be due to a prey refuge effect since most predatory mites were found in and around the manure tray {{at the bottom of the}} cage, whereas most poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> were found higher up in the cage (i. e. on the walls, the cover, the perch, the nest box and the food box). The efficacy of applying predatory mites in the poultry industry may be promoted by reducing this refuge effect, boosting predatory mite populations using alternative prey and prolonged predator release devices. Biocontrol success, however, will strongly depend on how the poultry is housed in practice (free range, cage or aviary systems) and on which chemicals are applied to disinfect poultry houses and to control other pest...|$|R

40|$|Using a Y-tube olfactometer, a {{study has}} been made of the {{response}} of females of the predatory miteTyphlodromus pyri Scheuten (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) to volatile kairomones of three prey species: the <b>European</b> <b>red</b> spider <b>mite</b> (Panonychus ulmi (Koch)), the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) and the apple rust mite (Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa)). Predators that had been reared onT. urticae responded only to the volatile kairomone ofP. ulmi. In contrast, when reared onVicia faba L. pollen, they responded to the kairomones of all three prey species. Pollen-reared predators, offered a choice between kairomones of two different prey species, prefer theP. ulmi kairomone to those ofA. schlechtendali orT. urticae. The difference in response between predators reared onV. faba pollen andT. urticae seems to be caused by the low carotenoid content ofV. faba pollen. Predators that had been reared onV. faba pollen mixed with crystalline -carotene behaved in a way similar to conspecific that had been reared on the carotenoid-rich prey miteT. urticae. Obviously, pollen-rearedT. pyri females are in need of carotenoids, which can be obtained from, e. g.,P. ulmi, T. urticae orA. schlechtendali. This may explain why pollen-reared predators respond to more prey species thanT. urticae-reared predators. WhyT. pyri females need carotenoids has not been established. The only known function of carotenoids in mites is involvement in diapause induction. However, as pollen-rearedT. pyri enter reproductive diapause under short-day conditions, they either extract sufficient amounts of carotenoids fromV. faba pollen, or do not need carotenoids for diapause induction. Apart from the effect of dietary requirements on prey selection, food deprivation also affects the predator's response to kairomones. All the data mentioned above have been obtained for predators that had been starved for 20 h. Predators that had been reared onT. urticae and starved for 48 h before the experiment did respond to the volatile kairomone ofT. urticae in contrast to predators from the same culture that had been starved for 20 h. Thus foraging decisions byT. pyri are affected by both starvation time and specific hunger for carotenoids...|$|R
