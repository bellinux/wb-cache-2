5|$|The FIA Group B {{regulations}} {{steered the}} concept towards a mid-engine, all-wheel-drive layout, with a Jaguar V12 engine {{as the power}} source. The concept car was designed and built at very little cost to Jaguar, as Randle called in favours from component suppliers and engineering companies he and Jaguar had worked with in the past. In return he offered public recognition <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance</b> and dangled the possibility of future contracts from Jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Some {{areas of}} the park were {{formerly}} part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal. The forests were cleared to make the area less vulnerable to Rohilla invaders. The Raja of Tehri formally ceded {{a part of his}} princely state to the East India Company in return <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance</b> in ousting the Gurkhas from his domain. The Boksas—a tribe from the Terai—settled on the land and began growing crops, but in the early 1860s they were evicted with the advent of British rule.|$|E
5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing {{might result in}} the destruction of the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance.</b> Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Relic Entertainment {{was bought}} by THQ, which {{confirmed}} in 2007 that it had acquired {{the rights to the}} series from Relic and Sierra. No further game in the series was made before THQ declared bankruptcy in 2013; on April 22, 2013, Gearbox Software announced that they had bought the rights to the series at auction for US$1.35 million. On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the production of remakes of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as Homeworld HD, later renamed Homeworld Remastered Collection. The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that Gearbox had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a releasable or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the original development tools {{with the assistance of the}} Homeworld mod community. A later posting by a developer at Gearbox further praised the mod community <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance</b> in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion Homeworld: Cataclysm was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of Gearbox, as they were unable to find the original source code for the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the {{schooner}} Isaiah K. Stetsen sank off {{the coast}} of Massachusetts during a storm. Mess Attendant First Class Arthur J. Flores and Seaman John E. Gomez, assigned to USRC Acushnet, volunteered to save survivors of the schooner and were awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for their heroism. That same year, USRC Algonquin, which was stationed in the Caribbean, set sail with fifteen Hispanic-Americans (a fourth of the cutter's complement) to San Juan, Puerto Rico to assist the Puerto Ricans battling fires that threatened to destroy parts of that city. In 1915, the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico, paid tribute to the crew of the cutter Algonquin and presented them with an Official Resolution of Thanks. The Coast Guard was already formed by September 1918, with the merger of United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Life-Saving Service, when Seaman Richard E. Cordova became the first Hispanic Coast Guardsman to perish in a military conflict when his cutter, the USCGC Tampa, was torpedoed and sunk with all its crew by a German U-Boat during World War I. The Coast Guard can be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. Boatswains Mate First Class Pablo Valent and Surfman Indalecio Lopez, members of the Texas Brazos Life-Saving Station crew were awarded the Coast Guard Silver Lifesaving Medal and The Grand Cross Medal from the American Cross of Honor Society <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance</b> in the rescue of the crew of the schooner Cape Horn on September 16, 1919. In 1935, Chief Boatswains Mate Pablo Valent was given command of the Port Isabel (Texas) Boat Station, becoming the first Hispanic-American to do so.|$|E

25|$|At 5:50am on {{the morning}} of 29 December 1929, the Lord Southborough was {{launched}} from her station in a south westerly gale in very heavy seas following reports of flares sighted close to Margate. The source of the flares was a German motorvessel called the Hermine of Wilhelmshaven. The vessel had run aground in the storm. The crew of the lifeboat boarded the vessel to help the Hermine but were unable to re-float her. The crew of the Hermine were eventually taken to shore aboard a pilot boat. For their part in the rescue the lifeboatmen were awarded certificates by the German government <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance</b> in helping the crew of the Hermine.|$|E
25|$|He then sailed for Egypt {{leaving a}} {{substantial}} garrison in Malta. Since the Order {{had also been}} growing unpopular with the local Maltese, the latter initially viewed the French with optimism. This illusion did not last long. Within months the French were closing convents and seizing church treasures, most notably the sword of Jean de Valette which is to date still exhibited in the Louvre, in Paris. The Maltese people rebelled, and the French garrison of General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois retreated into Valletta. After several failed attempts by the locals to retake Valletta, the British were asked <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance.</b> Rear Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson decided on a total blockade in 1799. The French garrison surrendered in 1800.|$|E
25|$|Tensions soon arose {{between the}} two parties. Batticaloa was the {{traditional}} port of the Kandyan kingdom (Trincomalee had long been lost, first to the Jaffna kingdom {{and then to the}} Portuguese), and Rajasingha was eager to acquire it as soon as possible. The Dutch, however, demurred, demanding full payment <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>assistance</b> in displacing the Portuguese. Despite a rising suspicion that the Dutch were not in Sri Lanka to expel the Portuguese, so much as to replace them, the alliance was one that was too valuable for Rajasingha to simply cancel, and joint Dutch–Kandyan efforts resulted in the seizure of Galle on 13 March 1640 and the restriction of Portuguese power to the west coast of Sri Lanka by 1641.|$|E
