40|$|In Northern Morocco, silvopastoral {{area was}} a free fodder {{resource}} that contributes to regular feeding of goat. The {{study was conducted in}} extensive farming of dairy goat (Bouzahri pasture). The objective is to estimate a pastoral contribution of pasture and its effect on production and milk quality. Biomass, floristic diversity and nutritional value were determined. A total of seventy pastoral species were recorded. The biomass production is estimated to 4963 kg DM/ha, composed of 89 % by Calicotome villosa, Cistus crispus, Erica arborea, Inula viscosa, Lavandula stoechas, Olea europea and Pistacia lentiscus. Calicotome villosa has the highest energy and protein (PDI) levels with 0. 62 UFL/kg DM, 0. 52 UFV/kg DM and 52 g/kg DM of protein. The forage supply is estimated to 2250 FU/ha of energy and 72. 6 kg/ha of PDIN, is evaluated at 450 euro/ha. In extensive farming, milk production is estimated to 55 kg/lactation/goat against 51 kg/lactation/goat in intensive farming (control). Goats <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> allows to reduce alimentary charge and better milk production that remains low qualitatively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} abrupt dietary {{transition}} on the faecal microbiota of forage-fed horses over a 3 -week period were investigated. Yearling Thoroughbred fillies reared as a cohort were exclusively fed on either an ensiled conserved forage-grain diet ("Group A"; n = 6) or pasture ("Group B"; n = 6) {{for three weeks}} prior to the study. After the Day 0 faecal samples were collected, horses of Group A were abruptly transitioned to pasture. Both groups continued to graze similar pasture for three weeks, with faecal samples collected at 4 -day intervals. DNA was isolated from the faeces and microbial 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene amplicons were generated and analysed by pyrosequencing. The faecal bacterial communities of both groups of horses were highly diverse (Simpson's index of diversity > 0. 8), with {{differences between the two}} groups on Day 0 (P < 0. 017 adjusted for multiple comparisons). There were differences between Groups A and B in the relative abundances of four genera, BF 311 (family Bacteroidaceae; P = 0. 003), CF 231 (family Paraprevotellaceae; P = 0. 004), and currently unclassified members within the order Clostridiales (P = 0. 003) and within the family Lachnospiraceae (P = 0. 006). The bacterial community of Group A horses became similar to Group B within four days of <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture,</b> whereas the structure of the archaeal community remained constant pre- and post-dietary change. The community structure of the faecal microbiota (bacteria, archaea and ciliate protozoa) of pasture-fed horses was also identified. The initial differences observed appeared to be linked to recent dietary history, with the bacterial community of the forage-fed horses responding rapidly to abrupt dietary change...|$|E

The cows were strip-grazed at both levels of pasture availability and were offered 20 kg DM/cow/day of fresh pasture. Cows receiving hay were offered 3 kg of chaffed hay twice daily. The in vitro [...] digestibility of the extrusa material collected from each cow was used as an. index of pasture selection and {{used in conjunction with}} chromic oxide to estimate pasture intake and substitution. The mean in vitro digestibilities ofthepasture selected by the cows grazingm-the low level of available pasture with and without hay and at the higher level of pasture availability with and without haywere 78. 1, 76. 8, 64. 4 and 65. 2 % DOM (LSD = 5. 2; P<O. OS) respectively. The estimates of digestible organic matter intake were 5. 75, 6. 65, 4. 27 and 4. 80 kg DOM/cow/day (LSD = 0. 88; PxO. 05) for the respective treatments of low pasture availability with and without hay and high pasture availability with and without hay. The mean intakesof hay for the low and high levels of available pasture were 1. 18 and 1. 30 kg DOM/cow/day respectively. Hay feeding did not affect the selection of pasture at either level of availability since the digestibility of the pasture selected by the cows fed hay was not different to that selected by cows not receiving hay. However hay feeding, reduced the pasture intake of cows grazing at the higher level of available pasture by 18 % compared with only 5 % on the shorter and more digestible pasture at the lower level of availability. It was concluded that pasture quality could have a major effect on pasture substitution...|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{patterns}} {{of a population}} of Australian brushtail possums with endemic tuberculosis were studied using radio telemetry, and by direct observational techniques, from November 1990 to April 1992. The study area, {{on the east coast}} of the Wairarapa, New Zealand, allowed observations of interaction between the major wildlife vector of tuberculosis in New Zealand, and cattle run as part of a commercial farming venture. The rugged 40 ha study area is mainly covered in 2 - 10 m high scrub, with patches of native bush and some large trees. Part of the area has been cleared of scrub and grassed. Poorer quality pasture is also available in small pockets in many other areas of the paddock. Possums had distinct ranges that remained constant over the duration of the study period, and ranges of many possums overlapped. Males had significantly larger ranges during the breeding season, and had the largest ranges overall. The area covered by a possum in a night’s activities varied considerably between possums, and often for an individual over consecutive nights. There {{were no significant differences between}} home ranges of tuberculous and non-tuberculous possums, although there were indications that the size of nightly activity areas of the former decreased as the disease progressed. Twenty-five juvenile possums were followed over 8 - 10 months, 2 dispersed from the area, and 7 died within their natal home range. Most of the juveniles died from starvation and exposure. Interactions between possums and cattle were observed in a natural setting, and also by introducing sedated possums to the same area to simulate terminally-ill tuberculous animals. Possums spent a variable amount of time <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> in the 40 sq. m observation area, ranging from a few minutes, to several hours. Normally possums appeared to avoid cattle whenever possible, and if necessary climbed trees to get away. The activities of several debilitated possums are described and their apparent indifference to external influences - in particular time of day - noted. The intense interest shown by cattle in sedated possums is described, and the possibilities for transmission of tuberculosis from possums to cattle discussed. It is concluded that transmission of tuberculosis is unlikely to occur on open pasture under normal circumstances, but that sick tuberculous possums, and later their carcases, are a source of infection. Tuberculosis in English badgers is compared, and contrasted, with the situation in New Zealand. Possible explanations for the absence of the disease in Australian wildlife are discussed. The differences in habitat and population density are suggested as the main reasons for the variations between, and within, countries. The importance of controlling tuberculosis in New Zealand, deficiencies in present control systems and possible areas for future research are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Mulvaney, F. J. (2006). The {{effect of}} {{nutrition}} during pregnancy on hogget reproduction. M. Sc. (Animal Science) Thesis, Massey University, Palmerston North. New Zealand. 59 pp The reproduction rate of hoggets in New Zealand {{is much lower}} than that observed in adult ewes. New Zealand farmers have indicated {{this is a major}} limitation to the uptake of hogget breeding and lambing. A series of studies conducted during pregnancy in the U. K. under housed conditions, utilising a concentrate diet, reported rapidly grown hoggets had reduced placental and fetal development and lamb birth weight. It is, therefore, possible nutrition during pregnancy plays a role in the poor reproductive performance seen in New Zealand hoggets. This thesis investigates the impact of 'low', 'medium' and 'high' levels of <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> during pregnancy on hogget pregnancy rate, fetal loss, lamb birth weight and growth rate of resulting lambs. Two-hundred-and-forty hoggets that were mated (identified by crayon tupp mark) during a five day breeding period were randomly allocated one of three (n- 80) nutritional regimes ('low', 'medium' and 'high'). The 'low' treatment group during the first 100 days of pregnancy were fed to maintain live weight. From day 100 until term, these hoggets were offered herbage to ensure a daily live weight change of 100 g/day. The 'medium' treated group were fed to ensure live weight change was 100 g/day throughout the entire pregnancy period, while the 'high' treated group were offered ad libitum, with the aim of achieving 200 g/day throughout the entire pregnancy period. The target live weight changes were achieved in the 'low', 'medium' and the 'high' hogget feeding treatment groups. Pregnancy rates at day 50 of pregnancy were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the 'medium' (66 %) than the 'high' (46 %) treated hoggets. At P 87, pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the 'low' and the 'medium' treated hoggets than the 'high' treated hoggets with pregnancy rates of 58, 66 and 33 %, respectively. This led to a significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced proportion of the hoggets lambing in 'low' and 'high' feeding treatment hoggets when compared to the 'medium' hogget feeding treatment. Lamb birth weight was reduced in lambs born to the 'low' (3. 5 ± 0. 16 kg) treatment hoggets when compared to the 'medium' (4. 0 ± 0. 19 kg) and the 'high' (4. 0 ± 0. 19 kg) hogget treatment groups. A 'high' level of nutrition during pregnancy did not result in reduced lamb birth weight compared to the 'medium' level of nutrition. At L 87, lambs bom to 'low' (18. 1 ± 1. 01 kg) treated hoggets were significantly (P< 0. 05) lighter than lambs bom to 'medium' (20. 6 ± 0. 76 kg) and 'high' (21. 8 ± 0. 98 kg) treated hoggets. The numbers of lambs reared at L 87 was 15, 27 and 17 for 'low', 'medium' and 'high' treated hoggets, respectively. In conclusion, feeding hoggets at a 'low' and 'high' level of nutrition led to a substantially reduced number of lambs produced. In addition, lambs born to the 'low' fed hoggets were much lighter than lambs born to 'high' fed hoggets at L 87. Therefore, this study indicates that farmers wishing to maximise reproductive performance of hoggets should feed hoggets to ensure live weight gain during pregnancy is above 60 g/day but below 200 g/day...|$|E

In central Norway, conflicts between farmers and spring-staging pink-footed geese <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>pastures</b> have escalated. To alleviate the conflict, a scheme by which farmers are subsidized to allow geese to forage undisturbed was introduced. To guide allocation of subsidies, an ecological-based ranking of fields at a regional level was recommended and applied. Here we evaluate the scheme. On average, 40 % of subsidized fields were in the top 5 % of the ranking, and 80 % were within the top 20 %.

After slaughter, carcasses were chilled at + 4 ßC for 24 h and measurements were taken on the intact cold carcasses. The carcasses were then dissected into wholesale cuts. The hot carcass weight and hindshank weight of M lambs were heavier than those of A and T lambs.

A behavioral-study was carried out in April 2014, a five-day study where each of the species were observed 3 h a day, 1, 5 h in morning and afternoon. The behavioral of llama and alpaca were observed individually and each behavior was observed in terms of duration and frequency. The study observed if the animals had a possibility to implement their natural behaviors in their enclosures and whether they showed any abnormal- or stereotypical behaviors that can occur in captivity. The questions I wanted to answer were: (1) what behaviors are occurring, (2) Is it possible to indicate from the behaviors if the animals are doing well or not, (3) Is there a difference in behaviors in the morning and afternoon? (4) Is there a difference between the sexes? (5) What actions should be undertaken to enrich and improve the habitat for llamas and alpacas in a zoo? The results from the study show that llamas and alpacas show many normal and natural behaviors, no abnormal-or stereotypical behaviors were visible.

40|$|Effective estrus {{synchronization}} in the bovine {{should have}} a great effect upon the cattle industry. Successful synchronization of estrous cycles would enable the livestock producer to control breeding and calving dates and give him greater diversity of labor use. The use of artificial insemination would also be greatly enhanced allowing {{for the use of}} high quality sires and aiding in the control of certain reproductive diseases. Embryo transfer from animal to animal would also be made easier. The most effective methods of synchronization developed to date have involved either daily feeding or daily injection of hormones. These approaches have limitations under range conditions. It is difficult to get uniform consumption of supplemental <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> Thus animals must be confined to drylot conditions {{for the duration of the}} feeding period to insure consumption of the proper amount of the supplement containing the hormone materials. These problems point to the need for an improved method of estrus synchronization. This experiment was conducted from June to September, 1965, at the Fort Robinson Beef Cattle Research Station, Crawford, Nebraska. The experiment was conducted in a series of 4 trials following a preliminary investigation. Heifers used in these trials were of two general types. One was a group of two-year-old Hereford heifers weighing approximately 800 pounds which were receiving a full feed of ground grain plus a small amount of alfalfa hay. The other group consisted of yearling Angus, Hereford, and Hereford-Angus crossbred heifers averaging approximately 600 pounds. These heifers were <b>on</b> wheat grass <b>pasture</b> until they were assigned to the experiment. They were then shifted to drylot and given 5 pounds of grain and 8 pounds alfalfa hay daily. The effectiveness of limited applications of the gonadal hormones on the synchronization of estrus was studied in 80 yearling and 18 two-year-old heifers. The treatment consisted of a single injection of varying dosages of 16 α, 17 α dihydroxy-progesterone given concurrently with an injection of 5 mg. estradiol valerate. Advisors: J. N. Wiltbank and D.

Neither diet nor age produced significant effects on M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LM) and on M. semimembranosus (SM) pH and colour. Meat texture properties (Warner–Bratzler–WB Shear Force and compression), water loss and collagen content were unaffected by diet, while the older deer had higher LM WB peak force values (4. 15 vs 4. 88 kg) and lower collagen solubility (34. 61 vs 22. 58 %). LM and M. semitendinosus (ST) of the supplemented deer had a higher content of fat (pasture vs concentrate feeding: 0. 56 vs 0. 72 % in LM; 0. 55 vs 0. 78 % in ST) and provided lower PUFA, particularly n- 3 PUFA, and higher n- 6 /n- 3 ratio (3. 30 vs 4. 76 in LM; 3. 39 vs 4. 63 in ST).

50|$|In {{general the}} agile wallaby is a solitary animal, but it {{sometimes}} forms into groups when <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> open <b>pastures,</b> a behaviour {{that may help}} with predator awareness. The agile wallaby feeds mainly at night on grasses, legumes and other herbaceous plants, but may also forage by day, especially in the wet season. In the dry season the animal's range grows larger as {{the quality of the}} grazing deteriorates and the diet expands to include flowers, fruit, twigs, fallen leaves, roots and bark. In the dry season in Boodjamulla National Park in Queensland, when food is in short supply, it has been observed pulling up seedling Livistona palms with its teeth, eating the roots and stems and discarding the leaves. When they are available, it eats the fruits of these palms, but in the dry season it also crushes and eats the hard seeds. It also consumes other seeds that have passed through the guts of fruit-eating birds. It sometimes digs holes in dry creeks and bilabongs to search for water, and this is thought to help it avoid being killed by the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) that can be found beside rivers.|$|R
40|$|In sheep grazing pasture {{contaminated}} by radiocaesium, administration of stable caesium {{was found to}} inhibit the uptake of radiocaesium. Eight lambs <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> a contaminated <b>pasture</b> received an oral dose of 500 mg CsCl and after 6 days had a radiocaesium load 17 % {{lower than that of}} a control group <b>on</b> the same <b>pasture.</b> The rate of radiocaesium excretion from 4 lambs, in metabolism cages and fed uncontaminated grass, was unaffected by CsCl dosing in comparison with controls. Thus. caesium dosing appeared to inhibit uptake but did not alter rates of caesium loss by normal processes of metabolism. Measurements of stable and radioactive caesium excretion rates were interpreted using a compartment model, based on the hypothesis of two major caesium reservoirs within the sheep, with derived biological half-lives approximately 4 and 25 days, and capacities 20 and 80 % of total, respectively. Caesium dosing appeared to saturate the latter reservoir and consequently inhibit further uptake. If a practicable method of application could be achieved, caesium dosing could be useful in the management of sheep and other grazing animals <b>on</b> radiocaesium-contaminated <b>pasture</b> and could find application to radiological protection in humans...|$|R
40|$|Overwintering of cows {{is a major}} cost in a cow-calf {{production}} system on the prairies. Winter feeding hay and straw directly <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> is a potentially more efficient and economical system compared to conventional drylot feeding in a yard. The objectives of the research described in this thesis were to compare winter <b>feeding</b> cattle directly <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> to traditional drylot over-wintering of cattle and the associated mechanized spreading of manure <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> This trial compared the effects of winter <b>feeding</b> systems <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> nutrient distribution, nutrient recovery in soil and forage, pasture forage response, cattle performance, and economics. The experiment was conducted at Lanigan, SK, on an old russian wildrye grass pasture. Pasture nutrient levels and distribution were measured before and after winter feeding, as well as forage yield, and cattle weight and condition. Nutrient capture and cycling was assessed along with {{the economics of the}} different systems. In the pasture fed systems, cattle were fed by either bale processing or bale grazing methods over the winter of 2003 - 2004. Cattle concentration was 2080 cow-days ha- 1, with the cattle in the field for 130 d. In the intensive system used for comparison, cattle were fed in a drylot and 67 tonnes ha- 1 of raw manure or 22 tonnes ha- 1 of compost was mechanically spread <b>on</b> the <b>pasture</b> in the fall of 2003. Soil inorganic nitrogen (N) levels (0 - 15 cm) measured in the spring where the cattle were winter fed <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> were 3 to 4 times the unfertilized, unmanured control treatment, with a mean gain of 117 kg N ha- 1. Soil inorganic N was not significantly elevated where manure or compost had been spread by machine. Soil extractable potassium (K) was doubled <b>on</b> the winter <b>feeding</b> sites, with a mean gain of 1209 kg K ha- 1. Soil extractable K did not increase where manure or compost had been spread mechanically. Soil distribution patterns of both nutrients were highly uneven following pasture feeding, with levels of inorganic soil N ranging from 12 to 626 kg ha- 1 and extractable soil K ranging from 718 to 6326 kg ha- 1. Additional nutrients in surface residue from uneaten feed, bedding, and manure were also heavy and variable following pasture feeding. Greater retention of N and K from urine added directly to the soil in the field in the bale grazing and bale processing systems compared to the drylot system is believed to be responsible for high soil available N and K levels compared to manure hauled from the drylot into the field. Soil extractable phosphorus (P) levels (0 - 15 cm) were measured in the fall of 2005. The compost treatment had the largest increase at 2. 6 times the control, an additional 46 kg ha- 1. Mean soil P levels did not increase significantly where the cattle were wintered. Over 18 months and 3 harvests, forage dry matter yields where the cattle were fed <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> were 3 to 5 times the control where the cattle were fed <b>on</b> the <b>pasture,</b> and 1. 4 to 1. 7 times the control where raw manure or compost was mechanically spread. Also, protein content of the forage was increased to a greater extent in the in-field feeding compared to hauled raw manure or compost, reflecting a greater conservation of N. The gain of N in the forage over 18 months <b>on</b> the winter <b>feeding</b> sites was 200 kg ha- 1 of N, almost double what was measured in soil inorganic forms. Fourteen kg ha- 1 of P was also recovered. This represented 34 % of original feed N and 22 % of original feed P that was imported into the field. Recovery of nutrients applied in the raw manure and compost sites was much lower, with only 7 % recovery of N and 4 % recovery of P in the forage. This was calculated to be 1 % of original feed N and 3 % of original feed P. The system by which the cattle were overwintered had little influence on cattle weight and condition. All systems performed favorably in maintaining body weight and condition over the winter. Some slight advantages in cattle weight gain and condition were found <b>on</b> the winter <b>feeding</b> systems compared to the in-yard drylot that appeared to be related to slightly increased feed intake. Economic calculations favored winter <b>feeding</b> directly <b>on</b> the <b>pasture</b> by 25 % over the drylot systems when the feed value of additional pasture growth over 18 months was included and by 56 % when the value of additional soil nutrients was factored in. Feed costs were similar between the systems but pasture feeding had savings in machinery use, fuel consumption and manure handling costs, and gains in pasture productivity. Systems that winter fed cattle directly <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> provided gains in nutrient cycling efficiencies, pasture growth, and economic savings compared to drylot feeding systems, while maintaining similar cattle growth and condition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decades most goose populations have become {{increasingly}} dependent on agricultural crops during wintering and migration periods. The suitability of agricultural crops to support all nutritional requirements of migratory geese for the deposition of body stores has been questioned; <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> agricultural crops may yield higher rates of fat deposition {{at the cost of}} reduced protein accretion due to an unbalanced diet. We compared amino-acid composition of forage, and investigated food-habitat use and dynamics and composition of body stores deposited by barnacle geese <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> agricultural <b>pasture</b> and in natural salt marsh during spring migratory preparation. Overall content and composition of amino acids was similar among forage from both habitats and appeared equally suitable for protein accretion. There was no relationship between body composition of geese and their preferred food habitat. Fat and wet protein contributed with 67 % and 33 %, respectively, to body stores gained at a rate of 11 g/d throughout the one-month study period. We found no evidence of impaired protein accretion in geese using agricultural grassland compared to natural salt marsh. Our study supports the hypothesis that the expansion of feeding habitat by including agricultural grassland has {{played an important role in}} the recent growth of the East Atlantic flyway population of barnacle geese and other herbivorous waterbirds. Feeding refuges of improved grassland provide geese with an adequate diet for the deposition of body stores crucial for spring migration and subsequent reproduction, thereby alleviating the conflict with agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of olive}} cake (OC) supplementation on carcass traits, {{contractile}} muscle properties and meat quality of lambs fed indoors or grazing in a Medicago arborea rangeland were studied. Twenty-four weaned male lambs (average body weight 24. 3  ±  1. 1  kg) were assigned into four treatment groups: indoor without OC, indoor with OC, pasture without OC and pasture with OC. The first {{two groups of}} lambs were fed indoor with oat hay ad libitum as based diet. The two others reared on natural rangeland improved by Medicago arborea. One of indoor and pasture groups were supplemented with 280  g/d of OC. All the groups received 400  g of concentrate. The experimental trial lasted about 3 months. Then, lambs were slaughtered at 33  kg. Rangeland lambs had higher ADG. Feeding system (FS) and OC supplementation did not affect (P >  0. 05) hot and cold carcass weights and dressing percentage. Lambs fed indoor had the greater commercial dressing percentage (P    0. 05). Lambs supplemented with OC had lower ultimate pH (P <  0. 05). Muscle of lambs fed indoor contained higher proportion of fibres type I (11. 5 vs. 7 %). However, OC supplementation tended to increase the lactate dehydrogenase activity and to decrease the isocitrate dehydogenase activity (P <  0. 10). Total and insoluble collagen contents were similar between groups. Tenderness, juiciness, fat degree and flavour intensity of meat were higher when <b>feeding</b> lambs <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> OC supplementation increased only meat juiciness (P <  0. 05). In conclusion, <b>feeding</b> lambs <b>on</b> rangeland decreased the carcass fatness and improved meat sensory effects. OC supplementation {{had little effect on}} carcass and meat of lambs fed indoor or reared on improved rangeland...|$|R
