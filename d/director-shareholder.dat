40|$|The {{derivative}} {{action as a}} minority shareholder protection device seems to be almost a dead-letter law in the British Isles {{as compared with the}} United States. Whether it can or should be revived through legislative reform and judicial interpretation presents us with important governance questions at first instance, but also raises questions regarding the importance of law, as distinct from non-legally enforceable norms, to the development of corporate governance systems, in particular regarding the <b>director-shareholder</b> relationship...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of financial distress on corporate governance in large public companies. It approaches the research from both legal and business perspectives, analysing the decisions that directors typically make in attempts to rescue the company. It explores the influence of creditors and shareholders, within existing governance codes and legal frameworks. It also examines governance as the company enters insolvency and is placed into a formal rescue regime. The thesis addresses the topic from theoretical, doctrinal and empirical perspectives. The theoretical analysis compares two parallel literatures on corporate governance and solvency/ insolvency. The doctrinal analysis examines existing statutes, case law, and regulations on corporate governance in financial distress/ rescue. The empirical study involves interpretive and comparative use of case studies of five large UK public companies that have experienced financial distress and insolvency between 2008 and 2012. It adopts an innovative approach to data collection, based on an extensive analysis of archival data. The thesis concludes that current UK governance structures have not yet evolved sufficiently to cover situations of financial distress. Equally, the law {{does not appear to have}} provided clear guidelines for director-creditor relationships and <b>director-shareholder</b> relationships in large public companies as they enter financial distress, becoming involved only when a company enters a formal rescue regime. A need is also identified for greater transparency on the influence and role of lenders and insolvency practitioners in financial distress and insolvency...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} new theory to unify the law of {{fiduciary}} duty. The prevailing view holds that fiduciary law is atomistic, arising for varied reasons in established categories of cases (such as trustee-beneficiary and <b>director-shareholder)</b> and ad hoc in relationships where one person trusts another and becomes vulnerable to harm as a result. By contrast, the critical resource theory of fiduciary duty holds that every relationship properly designated as fiduciary conforms to the following pattern: one party (the fiduciary) acts on behalf of another party (the beneficiary) while exercising discretion {{with respect to a}} critical resource belonging to the beneficiary. Relying on insights from the property rights theory of the firm, this critical resource theory holds that {{the primary purpose of the}} law of fiduciary duty is to combat opportunism within relationships that fit this pattern. The beneficiary initially protects against opportunism through self-help denying or threatening to deny the fiduciary access to the critical resource that is an essential platform for opportunistic behavior in these settings. Fiduciary law supplements self-help by depriving the fiduciary of the benefits from opportunism. By requiring the existence of a critical resource at the core of all fiduciary relationships, the critical resource theory assists courts in differentiating fiduciary relationships from relationships in which harm is caused merely by misplaced trust. The critical resource theory also justifies the varying intensity of fiduciary duties across fiduciary relationships: Where self-help is effective, fiduciary constraints are relatively weak, and where self-help is weak, fiduciary constraints are relatively intense. Three additional implications of the critical resource theory of fiduciary duty are also developed: (1) The critical resource theory implies that fiduciary duty and the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing are close cousins, both imposing loyalty obligations of varying intensity to combat opportunism; (2) the critical resource theory affirms the capacity of parties in a fiduciary relationship to contract out of fiduciary duties; and (3) the critical resource theory explains why restitution is the usual remedy for a breach of fiduciary duty...|$|E
50|$|The {{court also}} held that this applied {{not just to}} rights, but also to {{obligation}}s. So in Rayfield v Hands 1960 Ch 1 the obligation of shareholders who were directors to purchase the shares of non-director shareholders on request was enforceable on the same basis as a class right (or class obligation) of the <b>director-shareholders.</b>|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this article}} {{describes}} the legal framework for analyzing whether a partner can sue under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (2 ̆ 2 ADEA 2 ̆ 2), focusing on two fairly recent decisions in this area: (i) The U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2003 decision in Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc., P. C. v. Wells, a case in which the Court had to determine whether <b>director-shareholder</b> physicians in a medical clinic should be deemed employees for purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act (2 ̆ 2 ADA 2 ̆ 2); and (ii) the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s 2002 decision in a lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2 ̆ 2 EEOC 2 ̆ 2) against the law firm Sidley 2 ̆ 6 Austin (2 ̆ 2 Sidley 2 ̆ 2), in which the agency alleged an age discrimination claim on behalf of 32 demoted former equity partners in the firm. While several years have passed since the courts rendered these decisions, recent developments within the legal community, combined with current economic conditions, have exacerbated significantly the impact of these cases. Part I discusses the holdings of these two cases, describe some of the reactions within the legal community to these two cases, and highlight some potential concerns regarding the outcomes in these cases, particularly when applied to the modem large law firm. Because this article focuses on the impact of Clackamas and Sidley on law firms, particularly the larger ones, Part II sets forth an analysis of the modem large law firm, describing how modem firms have evolved in terms of their hierarchy, demography, goals and objectives. Part II focuses in particular on recent changes within the structure and culture of large law firms and discusses the impact that these changes might have on firm lawyers. Part III begins to bring together the above information, describing in greater detail how cases like Clackamas and Sidley might undermine the operations of modem large law firms. Part III will discuss some of the specific steps that firms may take in response to these cases and will describe how those steps might impact lawyers in a firm. Finally, Part IV proposes some solutions to this dilemma, suggesting ways in which law firms might provide partners with the protections potentially required by Clackamas and Sidley, while still running their firms in an effective, efficient, and profitable manner...|$|E
