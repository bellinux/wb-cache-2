40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} to geometric displacement optimization of external <b>helical</b> gear <b>pumps</b> is presented. In addition, relations of pump flow property {{and its influence}} factors are also inves-tigated. During that, only the pumps with transverse contact ratios of not less than one are discussed. First, using the involute property, an analytic representation for flowrates is deduced, by which displacements and fluctuation coefficients of <b>helical</b> gear <b>pumps</b> can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Then, by incorporating several design considerations, optimization problems formaximum geometric displacement are formulated and solved integrally by an opti-mization code, Multifunctional Optimization System Tool, with which various types of design variables including real, integer, and discrete can be simultaneously dealt with. Finally, the desired pumps with optimal displacement can be obtained. The proposed approach facilitates the design optimization of <b>helical</b> gear <b>pumps.</b> Moreover, influences of design parameters on the displacement and flow characteristics of the optimal pumps by assigning individual param-eters are investigated. The result also concludes that the pump with a larger module, larger face width, or smaller tooth number has bigger displacement but may cause more severe flowrate fluctuation...|$|R

40|$|Compressors with {{variable}} capacity {{are employed}} in domestic applications where better performance, fine temperature control, low power consumption and low noise levels are required. This is achievable {{not only by the}} use of an electronic inverter drive capable of operating at different frequencies, but also by technology applied in mechanical, electrical, acoustic and thermodynamic subsystems, making possible to control its cooling capacity, fully meeting the product requirements. One fundamental condition of operation is to ensure proper lubrication of mechanical components, for 100 % of compressors, operating throughout its speed range, ensuring full operation throughout its lifetime. To do that, several methods are used to pump the oil towards the bearings. This task is easily performed when the compressor’s crankshaft has high kinetic rotating energy. On the other hand, it becomes a challenge when compressor operates at lower speeds. In this case, computational techniques, using numerical methods in commercial simulators, have aided on designing oil pumping devices that maximizes the oil flow rate. Through numerical and experimental techniques, this study aims to propose a simplified, uncoupled simulation model for the compressor oil supply system. The primary response variable is the volumetric oil flow rate of a <b>helical</b> <b>pump,</b> regarding the following analysis factors: a) the immersion depth and b) shaft rotation. Numerical results from uncoupled proposed model have shown good agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|While many remote {{water pumping}} systems exist (e. g. {{mechanical}} windmills, solar photovoltaic, wind-electric, diesel powered), few combine both {{the wind and}} solar energy resources to possibly improve the reliability {{and the performance of}} the system. In this paper, off-grid wind turbine (WT) and solar photovoltaic (PV) array water pumping systems were analyzed individually and combined as a hybrid system. The objectives were to determine: (1) advantages or disadvantages of using a hybrid system over using a WT or a solar PV array alone; (2) if the WT or solar PV array interfered with the output of the other; and (3) which hybrid system was the most efficient for the location. The WT used in the analysis was rated at 900 W alternating current (AC). There were three different solar PV arrays analyzed, and they were rated at 320, 480, and 640 W direct current (DC). A rectifier converted the 3 -phase variable voltage AC output from the WT to DC before combining it with the solar PV array DC output. The combined renewable energies powered a single <b>helical</b> <b>pump.</b> The independent variable used in the hybrid WT/PV array analysis was in units of W/m 2. The peak pump efficiency of the hybrid systems at Bushland, TX occurred for the 900 W WT combined with the 640 W PV array. The peak pump efficiencies at a 75 m pumping depth of the hybrid systems were: 47 % (WT/ 320 W PV array), 51 % (WT/ 480 W PV array), and 55 % (WT/ 640 W PV array). Interference occurred between the WT and the different PV arrays (likely due to voltage mismatch between WT and PV array), but the least interference occurred for the WT/ 320 W PV array. This hybrid system pumped 28 % more water during the greatest water demand month than the WT and PV systems would have pumped individually. An additional controller with a buck/boost converter is discussed at end of paper for improvement of the hybrid WT/PV array water pumping system...|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} planetary dynamos still {{operate in a}} regime very far from the planets. For example, {{it seems unlikely that}} viscous forces are at all significant in planetary interiors, yet some of the simulations display a significant dependence on viscosity, and indeed in some of the simulations the dynamo mechanism is itself viscously driven, taking the form of <b>helical</b> Ekman <b>pumping</b> within columnar convection rolls. Given the similarity of the external magnetic fields observed in the terrestrial planets and gas giants, and the extremely small value of the Ekman number in all such cases, it seems natural to suppose that the underlying dynamo mechanism in these planets is independent of viscosity and insensitive to mechanical boundary conditions. A key step to identifying this mechanism is to determine the source of helicity in planetary cores. In this paper we explore the possibility that the helicity in the core of the Earth arises from the spontaneous emission of inertial waves, driven by the equatorial heat flux in the outer core.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>helical</b> axial inducer <b>pump</b> was investigated in non-cavitating and heavily cavitating regimes {{over a wide range}} of tip clearance and solidity. It was found that cavity length is related to the occurrence of two cavitation phenomena: a non-steady or oscillating form of cavitation occurs when the cavity length is nearly equal to the spacing between the impeller blades, and complete pump failure is imminent if the cavity is nearly as long as the blade chord. The extent of the oscillating cavitation regime was little affected by the variation of tip clearance or solidity in the range investigated. However, an increase in tip clearance or a decrease in solidity definitely impairs cavitation performance at low inlet pressures. On the basis of these experiments a cavitation number limit is proposed for safe inducer operation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSolar {{power is}} a natural and {{symbiotic}} choice for water pumping. It {{is one of the}} most economically attractive solar energy applications with direct drive PV systems often providing decades of reliable service. There is a good match between seasonal solar resource and seasonal water needs. Photovoltaic water pumping (PVWP) systems can meet a wide range of needs and are relatively simple, reliable, cost competitive, and low maintenance. A typical system configuration includes a PV array, pump, controller, inverter (for ac), and overcurrent protection. Until recently PVWP was competitive for only relatively small pumping loads. Over the past decade, the competitiveness of PVWP has increased dramatically, significantly expanding the range of pumping loads/requirements where PVWP is competitive. There have been dramatic price reductions in PV modules over the past decade, by over 80 %, while prices for competing gasoline or diesel fuel have risen by over 250 %. PVWP is most cost-effective for steady pumping needs such as community water supply or livestock watering—both year-round pumping requirements in most cases, and for irrigation water pumping when irrigation takes place much of the year. New technological innovations in controller technology has expanded PVWP range by an order of magnitude to ∼ 25 kW, with 100 kW expected in the near future. Similarly, more efficient <b>helical</b> rotor water <b>pumps</b> have been developed that are reliable and simple to operate...|$|R
40|$|This thesis details my {{work on the}} {{development}} of fabrication techniques for high power doped fibre lasers, using novel fibre geometries, and their demonstration. The main methods for increasing output power were using helical cores, multiple cores and large cores. A method for fabricating helical core fibres was proposed and implemented. Core and cladding pumped devices were successfully constructed, and were then tested in collaboration. A cladding <b>pumped</b> <b>helical</b> core fibre laser improved the beam from a 30 µm core from an M 2 of 3. 3 to < 1. 4, with a maximum output power of 64 W and slope efficiency of 84 %. A ribbon fibre with multiple laser emitting cores was fabricated. The difficulties in the fabri cation of such a fibre required extensive research, and arise from the large aspect ratio of the preform and fibre, and the low size reduction during fibre drawing. Through many steps a ten core ribbon fibre was fabricated, which was used, in collaboration, to achieve an output laser power of 250 W, with a slope efficiency of 65 %. Using a spectral beam combination technique, 5 cores were locked together. The output from a number of cores within a circular fibre with no combination is a method for attaining stable high powers with moderate beam quality. A three core fibre was fabricated, and showed an M 2 of 5 and slope efficiency of 75 %. This fibre was then tapered down from 150 µm in order to improve the beam quality further, and for 125 µm and 100 µm tapers, the M 2 values measured were improved to 4. 3 and 3. 5, respectively. An Yb-doped rod was fabricated, with a large core of 140 µm diameter, and machined flats to break the cladding symmetry. The power attained was only 13. 4 W with a slope efficiency of 20 %, due to surface imperfections. A fibre created with altered fabrication techniques showed no surface defects and showed over 90 % transmission for 800 nm light. Experiments performed by a colleague showed a slope efficiency of 69 % and an M 2 of 11, indicating that the fabrication method could create an effective cladding pumped rod laser...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{electromagnetic}} (EM) fields have various {{applications in}} fundamental research, communication, and home appliances. Even though, {{there are still}} some subtle features of electromagnetic field known to us a century ago, yet to be utilized. It is because of the technical complexities to sense three dimensional electromagnetic field. An important characteristic of electromagnetic field is its orbital angular momentum (OAM). The angular momentum consists of two distinct parts; intrinsic part associated with the wave polarization or spin, and the extrinsic part associated with the orbital angular momentum (OAM). The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is inherited by helically phased light or helical (twisted) electric field. The investigations of Allen on lasers carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), has initiated a new scientific and technological advancement in various growing fields, such as microscopy and imaging, atomic and nano-particle manipulation, ultra-fast optical communications, quantum computing, ionospheric radar facility to observe 3 D plasma dynamics in ionosphere, photonic crystal fibre, OAM entanglement of two photons, twisted gravitational waves, ultra-intense twisted laser pulses and astrophysics. Recently, the plasma modes are also investigated with orbital angular momentum. The production of electron vortex beams and its applications are indicated by Verbeeck et al. The magnetic tornadoes (rotating magnetic field structures) exhibit three types of morphology i. e., spiral, ring and split. Leyser <b>pumped</b> <b>helical</b> radio beam carrying OAM into the Ionospheric plasma under High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) and characteristic ring shaped morphology is obtained by the optical emission spectrum of pumped plasma turbulence. The scattering phenomenon like (stimulated Raman and Brillouin backscattering) is observed to be responsible for the interaction between electrostatic and electromagnetic waves through orbital angular momentum. The ring shape morphology of a beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM) is ideal for the observation of solar corona around the sun where the intensity of the beam is minimum at the center, in solar experiments, and Earth's ionosphere. The twisted plasma modes carrying OAM are mostly studied either by the fluid theory or Maxwellian distributed Kinetic Theory. But most of the space plasmas and some laboratory plasmas have non-thermal distributions due to super-thermal population of the plasma particles. Therefore the Kinetic Theory of twisted plasma modes carrying OAM are recently studied using non-thermal (kappa) distribution of the super-thermal particles {{in the presence of the}} helical electric field and significant change in the damping rates are observed by tuning appropriate parameters. status: publishe...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: This paper addresses {{an original}} project that encompasses the conception, development and clinical {{application of a}} <b>helical</b> bypass <b>pump</b> called the Spiral Pump, that uses the association of centrifugal and axial propulsion forces based de the Archimedes principle. This project has obtained a Brazilian Patent and an International Preliminary Report, defining it as an invention. METHODS: The aim of this work was to evaluate the hemodynamic capacity {{and the impact of}} its application on blood cells by means of experimental in vitro tests, including hydrodynamic efficiency, effect on hemolysis and flow visualization. Moreover, in vivo experimental tests were carried out on lambs that were submitted to cardiopulmonary bypass for six hours and in 43 patients submitted to heart bypass surgery using the Spiral Pump. RESULTS: When the rotor-plastic casing gap was 1. 5 mm, the flow generated was nearly 9 L/min, the pressure was greater than 400 mmHg at 1500 rpm, and the normalized hemolytic indexes were not greater than 0. 0375 g/ 100 L in high-flow and pressure conditions. Additionally, by the flow visualization techniques, stagnation was not seen inside the pump nor was turbulence identified at the entrance or exit of the pump, or at the ends of the spindles. In the in vivo tests using cardiopulmonary bypasses for 6 hours in lambs, the pump maintained adequate pressure rates and the free hemoglobin levels ranged between 16. 36 mg% and 44. 90 mg%. Evaluating the results of the 43 patients who used this pump in heart bypass operations we observed that the free hemoglobin ranged from 9. 34 mg% before to 44. 16 mg% after surgery, the serum fibrinogen was from 236. 65 mg% to 547. 26 mg%, platelet blood count from 152, 465 to 98, 139 and the lactic dehydrogenase from 238. 12 mg% to 547. 26 mg%. The Activated Coagulation Time was close to 800 seconds during the bypass. CONCLUSION: The Spiral Pump was very effective in generating adequate flow and pressure and caused no excessive harm to the blood cells...|$|R
