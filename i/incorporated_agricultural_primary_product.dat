GATT Article XVI legitimised the use of export subsidies on <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> under certain circumstances, but forbade the use of export subsidies on non-primary products.

Moreover, lead, cadmium and chromium concentrations were 0. 023 mg, 0. 012 mg and 0. 290 mg/wet weight kg in milk samples, respectively. 50 % and 40 % of the milk samples the lead and cadmium values were out of the permissible limit.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{major sources of}} data for {{agricultural}} statistics in the developing world: censuses, sample surveys and administrative data. In censuses and sample surveys, agricultural data are regularly collected through interviews; {{in the case of}} administrative data, agricultural data are collected through records of day to day operations. However, for many variables good quality agricultural statistics can only be generated when reliable and updated technical conversion factors or technical coefficients are available, which convert a calculated statistics to a different unit of measure. Examples are extraction rates, which convert <b>agricultural</b> <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> in processed products (e. g. flour from wheat), and dressed carcass weight, which converts the weight of a slaughtered animal into edible meat. Technical conversion factors can rarely be calculated with statistical precision using agricultural census / survey data and administrative records – particularly in developing countries where self-consumption is common and the informal economy large – and some direct measurement is needed. However, investments to improve agricultural data and statistics have been primarily focusing on improving the quality of data from surveys and administrative records, with little attention given to technical conversion factors.

Conversely, Nigeria has economic problems, her poverty situation is alarming though it records an impressive rate of economic growth which grew at an average 7. 6 % between 2003 and 2010 (World Bank 2011), but this {{did not lead to}} sustainable development. This research work presents the position of agricultural sector as a dominant tool for reviving the Nigerian Economy from being monoculture. The paradox of growth in the face of poverty and inequality conflicts rational economic and social theories as well as historical trends showing vividly the structural disequilibrium in the Nigerian economy which has sustained the key productive and highly employable sectors below potential while supporting consumerism and rent-seeking sector which made laudable growth rate stranded at top of the pyramid not getting to both middle and bottom where the larger percentage of the populace can be better off. Among the recommendations made was that government should give immediate attention to the procurement and subsiding of farm tools for easy development of the sector. Also, Irrigation system should be encouraged for better efficiency in production process.

30|$|In Panel a) of Fig. 11, we {{show the}} {{evolution}} of Argentine exports (largely composed of <b>agricultural</b> exports—both <b>primary</b> <b>products</b> and agro-manufactures). Exports grew steadily until the late 1930 s and early 1940 s, when, concurrently with the IS model, they plummeted. Exports recovered in the 1980 s and early 1990 s, and after the mid- 1990 s, they skyrocketed, especially due to technology adoption in agricultural. Panel b) of Fig. 11 uncovers interesting features of these trends. We report the share of corn, wheat, and soybean production of Argentina in world production. We see that the shares of corn and wheat grew steadily from the early 1900 s until around the 1930 s. The shares abruptly collapsed in the late 1930 s and early 1940 s up until around the 1950 s. From the 1950 s to the 2000 s, the production shares of corn and wheat stagnated: they showed a slightly increasing trend from 1950 to the mid- 1970 s, a slightly declining trend from the 1970 s to the 1990 s, and a slightly increasing trend in the 1990 s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} devaluation on output growth in Less Developed Countries (LDCs). The issue has {{played an important role}} in the economic and political agendas of developing countries for several decades during which devaluation has been one of the most frequently used policy tools under both IMF-regulated and independent stabilization programs in these countries. Whether devaluation of the currency affects national income positively or negatively has also received considerable attention among academic researchers. In this paper, in order to analyze empirically whether or not devaluation results in output contraction in LDCs, data from 18 sample countries are used in a fixed-effect procedure. LDCs are divided into two categories and two different regression analyses are conducted. First, data from a group of 10 countries, including both manufacturing product exporters as well as <b>agricultural</b> and <b>primary</b> <b>product</b> exporters, are used to estimate a model of real output behavior for a period of 25 years. Then, to investigate if there exists a qualitative difference between different countries in terms of the effect of devaluation on economic growth, data from two different groups of countries (...|$|R
