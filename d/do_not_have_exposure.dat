The concept of {{culture is a}} way to capture {{something}} that deaf people share - not only deaf people, but groups of deaf people that are all over the world. It describes what deaf people have in common, their common history, their sets of ideas, their common practices. Culture itself captures a sense of commonality within a group of people. American Sign Language is a critical part of that commonality.Carol Padden has experienced Deaf Culture first-hand since birth. However, in the Deaf Community, this is not always the case. Many Deaf people from hearing families <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>exposure</b> to Deaf culture until they become adults. In fact, Carol Padden's spouse Tom Humphries became deaf at the age of six, but did not meet other Deaf people until he entered college.

Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between 20 - 22 / 11 / 2013 in the town and surrounding areas. Line list was developed from registration book. Questionnaire was developed & used to elicit the required information. Epi Info 3. 5. 3 software & Microsoft Excel 2007 did analysis & entry. Result: Starting from 01 / 11 / 2013 to 30 / 11 / 2013, total of 16 animal bites reported from kebribeyah. Both sexes were equally bitten eight (50 %) each. Majority of the victims 10 (62. 5 %) were in the age group of one - 20 years. Most of the victims exposures 14 (87. 5 %) were WHO Classification of category III, whereas 2 (12. 5 %) victims were category I. common site of bite was the leg 8 (50 %) victims. About eight (50 %) of the victims has been reported within 24 h of the bite. Majority of the victims 13 (81. 3 %) were Unprovoked bites. All bites were due to stray dogs. About 14 (87. 5 %) of the cases received post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Health professionals working at health center <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>exposure</b> on administration of PEP.

40|$|Majority of Arab EFL {{students}} {{reach the}} university with generally poor English and bad pronunciation in particular. Students in Arab countries have little opportunities to speak English where Arabic is their native language. Since correct pronunciation {{is very important}} to avoid misunderstanding when communicating with others and to build self-confidence when trying to speak in front of other people, the current paper investigates the reasons for Arab EFL students to face problems in English pronunciation. The participants were 10 Preparatory Intensive English (PIE) students of University Malaysia Pahang (UMP). Using an in-depth qualitative methodology which is individual interviews, all interviews were audio-recorded with the participants’ consent. The participants were undergraduate Arab EFL students who completed their high school and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>exposure</b> to English language. All recorded interviews were analyzed manually. From the data analyzed some emergent themes were found. For instance, students confessed that the lack of using media such as listening to English songs and watching English news and movies affected their pronunciation competence. Furthermore, little emphasis on English pronunciation in formal classroom also contributes to students’ mispronunciation in English language. It was claimed that teachers do not correct students’ mispronunciation and there were no pronunciation activities conducted inside classrooms. Moreover, some social factors affect the students’ ability to speak in English with correct pronunciation, for instance, they speak English just inside the class during their lectures but whenever they leave their class, they use their own mother tongue. This paper attempts to shed some light on the impediments that Arab EFL students face in English pronunciation and to give recommendations on Pronunciation Language Strategies (PLS) that could be applied by the students to improve their English language pronunciation. Some other pedagogical recommendations are also included...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There {{are certain}} {{concerns}} regarding the safety {{for the environment}} and human health {{from the use of}} engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) which leads to unintended exposures, as opposed to the use of ENPs for medical purposes. This review focuses on the unintended human exposure of ENPs. In particular, possible effects in the brain are discussed and an attempt to assess risks is performed. Animal experiments have shown that investigated ENPs (metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes) can translocate to the brain from different entry points (skin, blood, respiratory pathways). After inhalation or instillation into parts of the respiratory tract a very small fraction of the inhaled or instilled ENPs reaches the blood and subsequently secondary organs, including the CNS, at a low translocation rate. Experimental in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that several types of ENPs can have various biological effects in the nervous system. Some of these effects could also imply that ENPs can cause hazards, both acutely and in the long term. The relevance of these data for risk assessment is far from clear. There are at present very few data on exposure of the general public to either acute high dose exposure or on chronic exposure to low levels of air-borne ENPs. It is furthermore unlikely that acute high dose exposures would occur. The risk from such exposures for damaging CNS effects is thus probably very low, irrespective of any biological hazard associated with ENPs. The situation is more complicated regarding chronic exposures, at low doses. The long term accumulation of ENPs can not be excluded. However, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>exposure</b> data for the general public regarding ENPs. Although translocation to the brain via respiratory organs and the circulation appears to be very low, there remains a possibility that chronic exposures, and/or biopersistent ENPs, can influence processes within the brain that are triggering or aggravating pathological processes. In general, the present state of knowledge is unsatisfactory for a proper risk assessment in this area. Crucial deficits include lack of exposure data, the absence of a proper dose concept, and that studies often fail in adequate description of the investigated ENPs. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Mesothelioma is a {{malignant}} conditioncaused {{by exposure to}} asbestos that has typically a long latency period. The disease is usually found in the later stages when the prognosis is poor despite treatments. Objective: To report a mesothelioma found in a laboratory. Method: We reported here {{a case of a}} 60 year-old-man who was exposed to asbestos fibres-first when he studied in a laboratory at high school and then he <b>had</b> <b>exposure</b> over the following years until graduating with a master’s degree, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>exposure</b> after it. He was a smoker as a teenager and he gave up after 23 years. His first symptom was coughing at night which lasted for several months until the pleural fluid was discovered {{on the right side of}} thorax. This triggered investigations led to a diagnosis of mesothelioma. According to a systematic literature search, mesothelioma <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been reported previously in relation to asbestos exposure in laboratory work. An operation was carried out, but the patient refused to take chemotherapy due to the limited benefits that could be expected from it. Instead, he opted for a Budwig protocol. The case has had a good quality of life since the surgery, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any medications. He has regular check-ups at the hospital. Conclusion: Our study has shown that mesothelioma is not only a risk to people directly exposed to asbestos, but also indirectly fr om, for example, laboratory work. People should avoid exposure to asbestos in daily life. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hundred and ten cheek {{teeth that}} were {{extracted}} (1993 - 2008) because of apical infection (n= 79; mean dental age 3. 5 years) or idiopathic cheek teeth fractures (n= 31; median dental age 8. 5 years) were examined, including analyses of transverse and longitudinal sections and CAT scan images of these teeth. Computerised axial tomography was useful to determine pulp chamber anatomy and could identify pulp horns suspicious of pulpitis and exposure. The apical infections were mainly (68 %) due to anachoresis (blood or lymph born infection), with the residual cases caused by descending periodontal disease (23 %), infundibular caries (4 %), fissure fractures (3 %) and dysplasia (3 %). The idiopathic fracture patterns {{were similar to}} previously described patterns. Occlusal pulpar exposure was found in 32 % of apically infected cheek teeth, including exposure of multiple pulps in 27 % and a single pulp in 5 %. This finding re-enforces the value of detailed intra-oral examination of suspect apical infection cases. However, 10 % of apically infected cheek teeth had changes to the occlusal secondary dentine termed occlusal pitting, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>exposure</b> of the underlying pulp. The term occlusal defect would therefore be more appropriate to use in live patients. Multiple pulpar exposures occurred in some cheek teeth with apical infections, and the pulp involvement reflects the anatomic relationships of these pulps.

40|$|As {{the need}} to improve students' {{practical}} communication abilities increases, task-based language teaching (TBLT) is gaining attention. TBLT is based on the principle of focus-on-form in which the primary focus is on meaning, and learners attend to form when comprehending or producing communicative messages. In addition, learners are often required to process simultaneously meaning, function and form. Admittedly, TBLT based on a focus-on-form approach seems to be effective in developing students' communicative abilities. However, in the Japanese English as a foreign language (EFL) learning environment in which learners <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much <b>exposure</b> to English and have little need for communication in English in their daily lives, there is still considerable skepticism regarding the effectiveness of TBLT or focus on form.

This suggested that such contacts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> greater <b>exposure</b> to serum hepatitis virus than that occurring through natural means. Among those persons possessing antibody, the multiply transfused haemophiliacs showed a marked tendency for higher antibody titres than their contacts, implying differences in pathogenesis between infection acquired through multiple transfusion and infection acquired naturally. The presence of antibody to hepatitis B antigen (HB Ag) is considered on epidemiological grounds to be an indication of previous infection with serum hepatitis virus. Using the sensitive techniques of passive haemagglutination or radioimmunoassay for detection of antibody, recent serological surveys have suggested that subclinical infection may be a common event. It has been possible to relate this to known risk factors such as multiple transfusion with blood or blood products and contact with renal dialysis units or institutions for the mentally retarded (Lander, Alter, and Purcell, 1971; Szmu...|$|R

Data from this study were collected at Middlesex County College from four sections of Data Structures using C++ Programming. Data were gathered from the participants during the experimental semester by using a student programming self-efficacy survey and four programming achievement tests. The researcher made use of a C++ and Java programming expert panel to help develop and determine the validity of the content of the student self-efficacy survey and the four Data Structures achievement tests. In addition, students were asked on each test to subjectively evaluate their cognitive load pertaining to the material covered by each question. The data were examined for significant interactions among the students 2 ̆ 7 prior programming languages experiences, exposure to using the PBE system, cognitive load, and achievement.
