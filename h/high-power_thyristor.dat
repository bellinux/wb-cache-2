25|$|In {{the modern}} world, silicon diodes {{are the most}} widely used {{rectifiers}} for lower voltages and powers, and have largely replaced earlier germanium diodes. For very high voltages and powers, the added need for controllability has in practice led to replacing simple silicon diodes with <b>high-power</b> <b>thyristors</b> (see below) and their newer actively gate-controlled cousins.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- <b>High-power</b> <b>thyristors</b> {{with direct}} light –triggering and {{integrated}} protection functions can be utilized advantageously for applications in which several thyristors are connected in series. This applies {{in particular to}} High-Voltage DC (HVDC) transmission, Static Var Compensation (SVC), converters for medium voltage drives, and also to certain pulse power applications. Recent progress in both device innovations and optimization of some application systems is reviewed in this article. Key words- HVDC, Light Triggering thyristors, SVC VLF and OWT...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} <b>high-power</b> <b>thyristors</b> {{in conjunction with a}} low-voltage supply for generating pulsed magnetic fields. A modular bank of electrolytic capacitors is charged through a programmable solid-state power supply and then rapidly discharged through a bank of thyristors into a magnetizing coil. The modular construction of capacitor banks enables the discrete control of pulse energy and time. Peak fields up to 15 telsa (150 KOe) and a half period of about 200 microseconds are generated through the discharges. Still higher fields are produced by discharging into a precooled coil (77 °K). Measurement method for a pulsed field is described...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} is described {{that provides a}} basis for predicting whether any device design change will improve or degrade the unavoidable trade-off that must be made between the conduction loss and the turn-off speed of fast-switching <b>high-power</b> <b>thyristors.</b> The technique makes use of a previously reported method by which, for a given design, this trade-off was determined {{for a wide range}} of carrier lifetimes. It is shown that by extending this technique, one can predict how other design variables affect this trade-off. The results show that for relatively slow devices the design can be changed to decrease the current gains to improve the turn-off time without significantly degrading the losses. On the other hand, for devices having fast turn-off times design changes can be made to increase the current gain to decrease the losses without a proportionate increase in the turn-off time. Physical explanations for these results are proposed...|$|R

The circuit performs {{as a simple}} switched-mode power supply and recovers the inductive and capacitive snubbers energy induced in power inverters back into the dc rail {{with the aid of}} an extra switch. The features and operation of the proposed circuit are given and supported by PSpice simulations and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|As pulsed-power systems used {{to drive}} EM {{launchers}} evolve from laboratory to operational environments, high-power solid-state devices are emerging as the leading switch technology for these systems. These devices, specifically <b>high-power</b> <b>thyristors</b> and diodes, offer the advantages of improved energy efficiency, reduced volume, and reduced auxiliaries over spark-gaps and ignitrons. Proper application of these devices requires understanding of their behavior both during forward conduction and during reverse recovery. The semiconductor device models available in most circuit simulation software packages do not accurately characterize large power thyristors and diodes for thermal management and snubber design. A semiconductor-device model is presented that captures device reverse-recovery and on-state conduction behavior utilizing a time-varying resistance {{that depends on the}} solid-state device properties and operating circuit parameters. The information needed to construct this model can be extracted from the device datasheet or obtained from the manufacturer. This circuit model is used to analyze pulsed-power circuits typically {{used to drive}} railguns. Of key interest in these simulations are the voltage transients and energy losses in the solid-state devices during the reverse-recovery process. This behavior is analyzed for different circuit element values and device parameters such as peak reverse current, and reverse recovery charge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{power factor}} control scheme for <b>high-power</b> gate-turn-off <b>thyristor</b> current-source {{converters}} is proposed in this paper. Using both feedforward and feedback control tech-niques, the proposed scheme guarantees that the input power factor of the converter can be kept at unity or a maximum achievable value. Another feature of this scheme is parameter insensitive, that is, variations in the line and load impedance or changes in the filter capacitor size will not affect the process of tracking the maximum input power factor. No parameters in the control scheme should be adjusted to accommodate such variations or changes. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the operating principle of the scheme.

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} to the instantaneous junction temperature evaluation of <b>high-power</b> diodes (<b>thyristors)</b> is presented. The model allows obtaining the instantaneous junction temperature waveform starting from the expressions of the device transient thermal impedance and forward voltage drop. The linearity properties of resistors and capacitors (RCs) networks are used to obtain the thermal system transfer function from the transient thermal impedance curve. Thus, an expression that relates the forward voltage drop to the forward current and the junction temperature is used to "feedback" {{the influence of the}} temperature variation on the device forward characteristic. The model is also validated by comparing the results obtained from simulation against the one obtained from surge tests performed on one sample device...|$|R
