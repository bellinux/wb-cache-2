25|$|Heat is {{transferred}} either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy {{is transferred}} by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> from the rising hot {{water to the}} sinking cold water contributes to the convection process. Heat is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction. The collector fluid is circulated through the carrier pipes to the heat transfer vault.

25|$|CRI merely {{measures}} the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source {{with the same}} CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, {{due to a lack}} of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the gamut area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500nbsp&K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500nbsp&K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area.

25|$|When the {{expectation}} value is added over all modes in a cavity, this is Wien's distribution, and it describes the thermodynamic <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in a classical gas of photons. Wien's Law implicitly assumes that light is statistically composed of packets that change energy and frequency {{in the same}} way. The entropy of a Wien gas scales as the volume to the power N, where N {{is the number of}} packets. This led Einstein to suggest that light is composed of localizable particles with energy proportional to the frequency. Then the entropy of the Wien gas can be given a statistical interpretation as the number of possible positions that the photons can be in.|$|E

We show that simulations at a single density in conjunction with an equilibrium-liquid simulation at the same density allow one to predict the plastic flow-event statistics at other densities.

25|$|Similar {{considerations}} apply {{whenever the}} energy level spacing {{is much larger}} than the thermal energy. For example, this reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of blackbody radiation. The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kBT, there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container. However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ν goes to infinity; moreover, Planck's law of black body radiation, which describes the experimental <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.|$|E
25|$|Since 1980, China's energy {{production}} has grown dramatically, {{as has the}} proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang. Though China has rich overall energy potential, most {{have yet to be}} developed. In addition, the geographical <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than {{in the southern part of}} the northeast.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of light}} quanta began with Max Planck's {{published}} law of black-body radiation ("On the Law of <b>Distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> in the Normal Spectrum") by assuming that Hertzian oscillators could only exist at energies E {{proportional to the}} frequency f of the oscillator by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant. By assuming that light actually consisted of discrete energy packets, Einstein wrote an equation for the photoelectric effect that agreed with experimental results. It explained why the energy of photoelectrons was dependent only on {{the frequency of the}} incident light and not on its intensity: a low-intensity, high-frequency source could supply a few high energy photons, whereas a high-intensity, low-frequency source would supply no photons of sufficient individual energy to dislodge any electrons. This was an enormous theoretical leap, but the concept was strongly resisted at first because it contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from James Clerk Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic behavior, and more generally, the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems. Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, resistance to the idea of photons continued, since it appeared to contradict Maxwell's equations, which were well understood and verified.|$|E

2500|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} {{of a light}} source may be defined in two ways.

The source luminous efficacy (LES) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power input to the source, such as a lamp. Visible light is measured in lumens, a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye; the luminous {{efficacy of}} radiant energy (LER) is a measure of how well the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> matches the perception of the eye.
