The western slopes of the <b>hill</b> <b>drop</b> into the subunit of the Münstereifel Valley (Münstereifeler Tal, 274.0).|$|E
50|$|Mynydd Twyn-glas is a {{sprawling}} 472-metre-high mountain extending into Caerphilly and Torfaen county boroughs in South Wales. It lies southwest of Pontypool, west of Cwmbran {{and east of}} Newbridge and taking {{the form of a}} rolling plateau the margins of which are defined by steep slopes, many of which are cloaked with conifer plantations. A broad shoulder extending south from the summit is known as Mynydd Maen whilst to the north is Mynydd Llwyd. The thickly afforested northern slopes of the <b>hill</b> <b>drop</b> down steeply into Cwm y Glyn.|$|E

50|$|The first runway (9/27), 1615 m long, {{was opened}} in 1951. It is a {{tabletop}} runway, with landing approaches that {{lead up to}} the extreme edges of a hillside. The edges of the <b>hill</b> <b>drop</b> into a valley from a height of about 90 m to 9 m) within a short distance of just 500 m on {{the east of the}} runway and from about 83 m to 25 m on the western side. The runway was not level, with the height varying from 90 m to 83 m from east to west. Landing on this short runway was considered difficult.|$|E
50|$|Riders {{board the}} trains in an {{enclosed}} loading station on a hillside. Leaving the station, trains make a left hand {{turn into a}} bat-infested tunnel, make a slight right turn, and climb the first lift hill. At {{the top of the}} lift hill, trains pass under a waterfall and drop to the left. This is followed by a right hand turn, after which the track crosses under the second lift hill and drop. After crossing under the second lift <b>hill</b> <b>drop,</b> the track goes through a 270 degree clockwise spiral and passes through a short tunnel. Trains emerge from the tunnel and pass through the flooded town of Tumbleweed. The train passes over a decaying trestle (where the track is slightly banked from side to side), before entering Davy Jones Mine, where it hits a trim brake. Trains then make a left hand turn and climb the second lift hill.|$|E
50|$|Leaving {{the outdoor}} station, trains enter a bat-infested tunnel, {{make a right}} hand turn, then a left hand turn before {{climbing}} the first lift hill, which takes trains through a cavern full of stalactites. Leaving the lift hill, the train drops away to the right, then levels out and makes a left hand turn. The track then crosses under the second lift <b>hill</b> <b>drop</b> before making a right hand turn. The sounds of coyotes can be heard howling at the train as it dives into an underground cave. At {{the end of the}} tunnel, the train hits a trim brake, exits the tunnel, and climbs the second lift hill. At the top of the lift, an animatronic goat bleats at passing guests as the train drops away to the right, crosses under the lift hill, and rises up into a downward spiraling clockwise helix. Leaving the helix, the train shoots through a small canyon, then drops down into a mining camp, where it hits another trim brake. The train then makes a left hand turn, enters another tunnel, and climbs the third lift hill. As the train climbs the lift, the tunnel is dynamited, and artificial smoke is blasted in guests' faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel. The train then drops to the right, towards the river, then makes a right hand turn and passes through a short tunnel. After crossing over the drop, the trains make a left hand turn as they pass through the ribcage of a T-rex skeleton, hit a trim brake, then make a right hand turn into the final brakes. The train then travels by the buildings of Rainbow Ridge as it returns to the station.|$|E

50|$|The castle <b>hill</b> <b>drops</b> steeply away on all sides; {{thus the}} {{fortress}} {{was very difficult}} to attack despite its relatively low situation above the valley. Vilsegg lies about 350 m lower than its neighbouring castle on the German side of the border - the Falkenstein.|$|R
50|$|Just {{before the}} <b>hill</b> <b>drops</b> away towards Benzingerode, {{the remains of}} fortifications {{belonging}} to a 10th-century fortress, the Struveburg are visible in the terrain. After the woods had been cleared, the hill ridge was used for centuries as grazing land. Later parts of the area were reforested with Black Pine (Pinus nigra) and quarries established.|$|R
50|$|This house {{demonstrates}} Wright's {{ability to}} fit a design to a site.

50|$|The {{surrounding}} <b>hills</b> <b>drop</b> steeply to the water's edge, from Cefn Cyfarwydd and Creigiau Gleision to the east, and Pen Llithrig y Wrach to the west, and as {{a consequence}} have not been forested in the 20th century, as were the slopes of neighbouring Llyn Crafnant. Indeed there is not a tree to be seen, and the general aspect is one of bleakness. Dependent on the weather conditions, the waters often appear dark.|$|R

50|$|Singletrack (or single track) {{describes}} {{a type of}} mountain biking trail that is approximately {{the width of the}} bike. It contrasts with double-track or fire road which is wide enough for four-wheeled off-road vehicles. It is often smooth and flowing, but may also feature technical rocky sections, go over tree roots, and include berms, banked turns, switch-backs, <b>hills,</b> <b>drops,</b> jumps, and so forth. Singletrack which descends significantly, and in the most downward direction, is said to be following the fall line.|$|R

60|$|The 10th of August, 1852, brought {{little change}} to the dull monotony of wind, fog, and {{treeless}} coast line. Only the sea was occasionally flecked with racing sails that outstripped the old, slow-creeping trader, or was at times streaked and blurred with the trailing smoke of a steamer. There were a few strange footprints on those virgin sands, and a fresh track, that led from the beach over the rounded <b>hills,</b> <b>dropped</b> into the bosky recesses of a hidden valley beyond the coast range.|$|R
