5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that <b>here</b> <b>but</b> I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E

5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Wind River Indian Reservation, the U.S. Cavalry constructed Fort Brown on the reservation lands, which was subsequently renamed Fort Washakie. During the late 19th century, the fort was staffed by African-American members of the U.S. Cavalry, better known as the Buffalo Soldiers, including the second African-American graduated from the United States Military Academy, John Hanks Alexander. Chief Washakie is buried at the fort, which is located immediately east of the forest boundary. Rumor has it that Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian who provided invaluable assistance to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is also buried <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> it is now considered that this is unlikely and that her actual burial place was Fort Lisa in North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterward, {{the highway}} descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major state road, NY7, and {{overlaps}} {{with it for}} a short distance. Two miles after that concurrency ends, NY22 follows the upper Hoosic River to Hoosick Falls, the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> after another , at North Hoosick, NY67 comes in from {{the east and the}} two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County.|$|E

5|$|The sullen {{determination}} of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown most forcibly {{by the fact that}} despite the powerful protection now here for those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none of the miners have returned to work, and the mine pumps are still worked by the bosses and clerks in the employ of the companies... They will be peaceable while the soldiers are <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> when they go away, they will have many a grievance to redress from their standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|Undivided Keyser and Tonoloway Formations {{occur in}} the {{southern}} and southeastern parts of the Buffalo Creek watershed. The Hamilton Group occurs in {{a small portion of}} the southeastern part of the watershed. Undivided Onondaga and Old Port Formations also occur <b>here,</b> <b>but</b> take up a bigger area in the watershed. The Bald Eagle Formation occurs in small parts of the western and northwestern areas of the watershed. The Juniata Formation occurs in the same areas as the Bald Eagle Formation, as well as part of the northern part of the watershed. However, it takes up more area than the Bald Eagle Formation. The Reedsville Formation also occurs in the western and northwestern parts of the watershed. The undivided Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formations occur in a zigzagging band that goes from the northeastern to the southwestern part of the watershed. The Clinton Group occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of the Bloomsburg and Mifflinville Formations. It also occurs in a few scattered areas in the northeastern and western parts of the watershed. The Tuscarora Formation occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of the Clinton Group. The Wills Creek Formation occurs in parts of the southern and northeastern areas.|$|E
