5000|$|The polling {{address of}} the {{instrument}} is set to [...] "0". Only one instrument can be put on each instrument cable signal pair. One signal, generally specified by the user, is specified to be the 4-20 mA signal. Other signals are sent digitally {{on top of the}} 4-20 mA signal. For example, pressure can be sent as 4-20 mA, representing a range of pressures, and temperature can be sent digitally over the same wires. In point-to-point mode, the digital part of the <b>HART</b> <b>protocol</b> {{can be seen as a}} kind of digital current loop interface.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{application}} of current loops is {{the industry standard}} 4-20 mA current loop for process control applications, where they are extensively used to carry signals from process instrumentation to PID controllers, SCADA systems, and Programmable logic controllers. They are also used to transmit controller outputs to the modulating field devices such as control valves.

Some 4-20 mA field devices can be powered by the current loop itself, removing the need for separate power supplies, and the [...] "smart" [...] <b>HART</b> <b>Protocol</b> uses the loop for communications between field devices and controllers.

In this report, an overview of the aforementioned protocols is given; followed by a description of the integration methods, and a depiction of the hardware and software components which constitute the framework of the experimental trials. The experimental work comprised the use of level, pressure and temperature sensors with HART capabilities. These devices were connected to HART-enabled signal conditioners (I/O modules) for transmission of HART data into a Profibus DP communication gateway; which incorporates the data into Profibus telegrams.

40|$|Abstract- Wireless mesh {{networks}} (WMNs) {{consist of}} mesh routers and mesh clients, where mesh routers have minimal mobility and form {{the backbone of}} WMNs. They provide network access for both mesh and conventional clients. This paper considers the interaction between channel assignment and distributed scheduling in multi-channel, multi radio Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Recently, a number of distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks have emerged. Due to their distributed operation, these algorithms can achieve {{only a fraction of}} the maximum possible throughput. As an alternative to increasing the throughput fraction by designing new algorithms, we present a novel approach that takes advantage of the inherent multi-radio capability of WMNs. We show that this capability can enable partitioning of the network into subnetworks in which simple distributed scheduling algorithms can achieve 100 % throughput. The partitioning is based on the notion of Local Pooling. Using this notion, we characterize topologies in which 100 % throughput can be achieved distributedly with algorithms, which characterized in Dijkstra and KBR (Key based routing) and also in this paper, we will discuss the applications of WMNs. Emerson process management comes under the industrial automation applications of WMNs using WirelessHart and Emerson’s smart wireless extreme applications.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} a hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy (<b>HART)</b> <b>protocol</b> {{in patients with}} inoperable non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) who were ineligible for combination radiochemotherapy studies. Methods and Materials: From February 1989 through August 1994, 23 patients ineligible for available combined modality protocols in our institution were enrolled and treated with HART, consisting of 63 Gy given in 42 fractions of 1. 5 Gy each, twice daily, with a minimum time interval of 6 h between fractions, 5 days a week, over an elapsed time of 4. 2 weeks, or 29 days. There was no planned interruption. Results: The 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year survival rates were 61 %, 39 %, and 19 %, respectively, with a median survival of 16. 8 months. At the time of analysis, 4 patients are alive and 19 have died, 16 from NSCLC and 3 from cardiac disease. Overall response rate was 48 %, with 22 % of patients achieving a complete response and 26 % a partial response. Correlation between acute response rate and survival was poor. First site of relapse was local-regional in 8 patients (35 %), distant in 6 patients (26 %), and local-regional and distant in 4 (17 %) patients. One patient had Grade IV and 2 had Grade III esophagitis. One patient presented with chronic Grade III lung toxicity. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: In this group of 23 patients ineligible for radiochemotherapy, this HART regime was quite feasible and was followed by little toxicity.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are nowadays a reality. The wide consensus gained by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard has facilitated {{the adoption of}} wireless links {{not only in the}} consumer world but also as a valid replacement of traditional wired industrial networks. In particular, the physical layer specs of IEEE 802. 15. 4 comply with the critical requirements of industrial applications as low cost and low power. The most remarkable example of this strategy is WirelessHART (WH), which is the first wireless fieldbus based on an open standard and specifically designed for process measurement and control applications. It uses traditional IEEE 802. 15. 4 radios but adopts a synchronized time-division medium-access strategy and relies on <b>HART</b> <b>protocol</b> for the upper layers. Its mesh topology allows for efficient and reliable coverage of large areas. It was presented in September 2007, but test specifications have officially been released just a few months ago, together with the announcement of the "Wireless Test System", which is only available to HART consortium members. In this paper, the authors deeply discuss the design and performance of a new and innovative packet analyzer purposely designed for the WH protocol.
