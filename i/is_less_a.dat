25|$|Some {{researchers}} (Friesen & Swift, 2009) {{believe that}} the underpricing of IPOs <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> deliberate act {{on the part of}} issuers and/or underwriters, and more the result of an over-reaction on the part of investors (Friesen & Swift, 2009). One potential method for determining underpricing is through the use of IPO underpricing algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Like The Secret Adversary, The Man in the Brown Suit <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> {{novel of}} pure {{detection}} {{than it is}} a thriller typical of its period. It follows the adventures of Anne Beddingfeld as she becomes involved {{in a world of}} diamond thieves, murderers, and political intrigue in this tale set in exotic South Africa. Colonel Race makes his first appearance in the novel; he later appears in Cards on the Table, Sparkling Cyanide, and Death on the Nile.|$|E
25|$|Postmodern {{music is}} either {{music of the}} postmodern era, or music that follows {{aesthetic}} and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly {{in reaction to the}} ideals of the modernist. Because of this, postmodern music is mostly defined in opposition to modernist music, and a work can either be modernist, or postmodern, but not both. Jonathan Kramer posits the idea (following Umberto Eco and Jean-François Lyotard) that postmodernism (including musical postmodernism) <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an attitude.|$|E

25|$|Local tourism {{officials}} {{viewed it}} as deus ex machina when Hollywood stepped in to rescue their industry. Harrison Ford, in the 1985 movie Witness, portrayed a Philadelphia detective who journeys to the Amish community {{in order to protect}} an Amish boy who has witnessed a murder in Philadelphia. The detective is attracted to the boy's widowed mother; the movie <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> thriller than a romance about the difficulties faced by an outsider in love with a widow from The Community. The film was nominated for eight Oscars, and won two. However, the real winner was Lancaster County tourism.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, {{the casual}} video game, Double Fine Happy Action Theater, was {{published}} for the Xbox 360 Kinect through the Xbox Live Arcade by Microsoft Game Studios. The title <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> game and more an interactive toy, {{in which the}} Kinect is used to create augmented video on the players' screen, putting the players into scenarios such as walking through lava or playing in a giant ball pit. Happy Action Theater was the first game to be directed by Tim Schafer since Brütal Legend in 2009, and came about during Once Upon a Monster, finding that his young daughter had difficulty with the Kinect precision and aimed to make a game that required far less precision but was still enjoyable. Its sequel, Kinect Party, featuring even more augmented reality scenarios, was published by Microsoft Game Studios in December 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{evidence of}} religion in the text is meager. The phrase divina misericordia in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei, where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, {{and the use of the}} phrase <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity on closer inspection only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a lamella, or metal leaf. Such “magic words” often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.|$|E

25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E
25|$|Singapura {{achieved}} {{its significance}} {{due to its}} role as a port. It seems to fit as least in part the definition of a port of trade in which trade <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> function of the economy and more a function of government policy; thus trading would have been highly structured and institutionalized, with government agents playing key roles in port activities. Portuguese traders' account in particular, suggest that Singapura operated in such a manner. Reports from merchants of different countries also indicate that Singapura was a point of exchange, rather than a source for goods. Local products were limited in type and mainly consisted of lakawood, tin, hornbill casques (an ivory-like part of the hornbill bird, which was valued for carved ornaments), some wooden items and cotton. Other commonly traded products included a variety of fabrics (cotton and satins), iron rods, iron pots, and porcelains. Chinese traders also reported that there were agricultural products but very few due to poor soil. Although these goods were also available from other Southeast Asian ports, those from Singapura were unique in terms of their quality. Singapura also acted as a gateway into the regional and international economic system for its immediate region. South Johor and the Riau Archipelago supplied products to Singapore for export elsewhere, while Singapura was the main source of foreign products to the region. Archaeological artefacts such as ceramics and glassware found in the Riau Archipelago evidence this. In addition, cotton was transshipped from Java or India through Singapura.|$|E

500|$|David Bushnell, {{writing in}} The Hispanic American Historical Review, {{points out that}} the work <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> pure {{historical}} account than others suggest. García Márquez's Bolívar is a man [...] "who wanders naked through the house, suffers constipation, uses foul language, and much more besides." [...] He argues that documentation does not support many of these details. Bushnell suggests, however, that the fact that the novel is not entirely historically accurate does not necessarily distinguish it from the work of professional historians. The main difference, Bushnell believes, is that García Márquez's work [...] "is far more readable" [...] than a pure history.|$|E

[...] Writing in the Toronto Star, Greg Quill said that the pilot introduced Brisco as [...] "a western in the loosest use of the term". Quill noted that the pilot includes [...] "every cliche in the western movie arsenal", but that [...] "everything, from characters to plot turns, is skewed away from the norm", and that the pilot episode rose above the level of western spoof to become an [...] "outrageously confident tribute to... the best of the genre".|$|E
500|$|In his Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time, {{historian}} Reinhart Koselleck discusses Altdorfer's {{representation of}} time in a more philosophical light. After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting's contemporary context, he posits that the latter type <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis argues: [...] "...for , 4th-century Persians look like 16th-century Turks not {{because he does not}} know the difference, but because the difference does not matter... The Alexanderschlacht, in other words, exemplifies a premodern, untemporalized sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness... Altdorfer's historical overlays evince an eschatological vision of history, evidence that the 16th century (and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) remained locked in a static, constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same... In such a system there can be no event as such: anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history, which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated..." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters {{have been around for}} more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again." [...] To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. [...] "It's also the blockbuster," [...] Travers said, [...] "I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it [...] "provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that [...] "while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone gave a mixed {{review of}} the album, {{wondering}} why the remix album was necessary {{to be released in}} the first place. She nevertheless added that [...] "he album has some diverting moments. Goldfrapp's down-tempo 'Judas' <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>a</b> remix than a smart cover, and the Weeknd and Illangelo re-imagine 'Marry the Night' as a strobe-y, atmospheric R epic. But there are two or three duds for each winner—like the bludgeoning 'Scheiße', a gratuitous exercise that strives to make a dance-floor thumper out of a song that was born that way." [...] Rosen's view was shared by Paul Rice from Slant Magazine, who gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Rice's main complaint was that [...] "ertain artists cry out for the remix treatment more than others, usually those whose vocal talents are relatively straightforward and could benefit from the extra fuss." [...] He added that Gaga was not such an artist and that the original Born This Way album [...] "in particular, is too big and untamed, full of too many of its own references and styles, from Springsteen to Madonna. As such, it's best enjoyed on its own flawed, bombastic terms." [...] Nick Levine, reviewing the album for BBC Music felt that most of the tracks are already available as digital downloads and CD singles, [...] "so it's easy to dismiss Born This Way: The Remix as inessential and, yes, a cash-in. But taken as a whole, this release offers enough revelations to suggest the original album is worth revisiting. That additional purpose, whether intentional or not, feels at least partly fulfilled." [...] Levine complimented The Weeknd and Twin Shadow's remixes, while criticizing Foster the People and Sultan & Ned Shepard for their predictable remixes.|$|E
