During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights Elder Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an Elder Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in which she would subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath.

Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E

The Guardian, liberal in its political outlook, remarked that Home [...] "does not look like the man to impart force and purpose to his Cabinet and the country" [...] and suggested that he seemed too frail politically to be even a stop-gap.

In two samples, participants reported the most negative emotional <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> months and in one sample also the most positive one. Results indicated that emotional intensity predicted social sharing and mental rumination, while neuroticism was positively related to intrusive thoughts about negative events, and extraversion to mental rumination and social sharing about positive events. Difficulty describing feelings was negatively related to social sharing for negative events and reduced fantasy to mental rumination for positive events...|$|R
