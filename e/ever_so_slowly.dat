The drug kicks in and you're on speed! Whoah! You get the buzz – it's crazy, it's outrageous, the carpet's moving and everybody's laughing and having a great time. But then, <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly,</b> the walls start closing in and it's like you're {{never going to get}} out of this fucking place. It's an ugly nightmare and there's no escape." [...] To convey the effects of the various drugs, Gilliam and Pecorini assembled a list of [...] "phases" [...] that detailed the [...] "cinematic qualities" [...] of each drug consumed. For ether, Pecorini said they used a [...] "loose depth of field; everything becomes non-defined"; for adrenochrome, [...] "everything gets narrow and claustrophobic, move closer with lens"; mescaline was simulated by having [...] "colors melt into each other, flares with no sources, play with color temperatures"; for amyl nitrite, the [...] "perception of light gets very uneven, light levels increase and decrease during the shots"; and for LSD, [...] "everything extremely wide, hallucinations via morphs, shapes, colors, and sound." ...|$|E

Pupkin hadn't had time to say yes before the judge appeared at the door, just as they were stepping up on to the piazza, and he had a table napkin in his hand and the dynamite sparks were flying from his spectacles as he called out: ...|$|E
60|$|If, then, {{animals and}} plants do vary, let it be <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> {{slightly}} or <b>slowly,</b> why should not variations or individual differences, which are in any way beneficial, be preserved and accumulated through natural selection, or {{the survival of the}} fittest? If man can by patience select variations useful to him, why, under changing and complex conditions of life, should not variations useful to nature's living products often arise, and be preserved or selected? What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature, favouring the good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life. The theory of natural selection, even if we look no further than this, seems to be in the highest degree probable. I have already recapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and objections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of the theory.|$|R

6000|$|After that rhyme, {{which came}} into his head all at once, he became {{conscious}} of music, very soft-lovely! Mum playing! He bethought himself of a macaroon he had, laid up in his chest of drawers, and, getting it, {{came back to the}} window. He leaned out, now munching, now holding his jaws to hear the music better. [...] "Da" [...] used to say that angels played on harps in heaven; but it wasn't half so lovely as Mum playing in the moony night, with him eating a macaroon. A cockchafer buzzed by, a moth flew in his face, the music stopped, and little Jon drew his head in. She must be coming! He didn't want to be found awake. He got back into bed and pulled the clothes nearly over his head; but he had left a streak of moonlight coming in. It fell across the floor, near the foot of the bed, and he watched it moving <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> towards him, as if it were alive. The music began again, but he could only just hear it now; sleepy music, pretty--sleepy--music--sleepy--slee.....|$|E
60|$|Be {{that as it}} may, {{during the}} whole of that day, and the next, nobody {{was able to get}} him out. There was a continual banging of the kettle-drum, which seemed to give him renewed spirits. Every ball as it came to him was sent away into {{infinite}} space. All the Englishmen were made to retire to further distances from the wickets, and to stand about almost at the extremity of the ground. The management of the catapults was intrusted to one man after another,--but in vain. Then they sent the catapults away, and tried the old-fashioned slow bowling. It was all the same to Jack. He would not be tempted out of his ground, but stood there awaiting the ball, let it come <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly.</b> Through the first of the two days he stood before his wicket, hitting to the right and the left, till hope seemed to spring up again in the bosom of the Britannulists. And I could see that the Englishmen were becoming nervous and uneasy, although the odds were still much in their favour.|$|E
60|$|If I had {{had it in}} {{my heart}} to think Ambient a little of a hypocrite for {{appearing}} to forget at table everything he {{had said to me}} during our walk, I should instantly have cancelled such a judgment, on reflecting that the good news his wife was able to give him about their little boy was reason enough for his sudden air of happiness. It may have come partly, too, from a certain remorse at having complained to me of the fair lady who sat there,--a desire to show me that he was after all not so miserable. Dolcino continued to be much better, and he had been promised he should come downstairs after he had had his dinner. As soon as we had risen from our own meal Ambient slipped away, evidently for the purpose of going to his child; and no sooner had I observed this than I became aware that his wife had simultaneously vanished. It happened that Miss Ambient and I, both at the same moment, saw the tail of her dress whisk out of a doorway, which led the young lady to smile at me, as if I now knew all the secrets of the Ambients. I passed with her into the garden, and we sat down on a dear old bench which rested against the west wall of the house. It was a perfect spot for the middle period of a Sunday in June, and its felicity seemed to come partly from an antique sun-dial which, rising in front of us and forming the centre of a small, intricate parterre, measured the moments <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly,</b> and made them safe for leisure and talk. The garden bloomed in the suffused afternoon, the tall beeches stood still for an example, and, behind and above us, a rose-tree of many seasons, clinging to the faded grain of the brick, expressed the whole character of the place in a familiar, exquisite smell. It seemed to me a place for genius to have every sanction, and not to encounter challenges and checks. Miss Ambient asked me if I had enjoyed my walk with her brother, and whether we had talked of many things.|$|E

6000|$|I long so {{for news}} {{of you that}} nothing but this act of {{aggression}} will serve, and that even though I know (none better!) what a heavy, not to say intolerable overburdening of illness is the request that those even too afflicted to feed themselves shall feed the post with vivid accounts of themselves. But though I don't in the least imagine {{that you are not}} feeding yourself (I hope very regularly and daintily,) this is all the same an irresistible surrender to sentiments of which you are the loved object--downright crude affection, fond interest, uncontrollable yearning. Look you, it isn't a request for anything, even though I languish in the vague--it's just a renewed [...] "declaration"--of dispositions long, I trust familiar to you and which my uncertainty itself makes me want, for my relief, to reiterate. A vagueish (which looks like agueish, but let the connection particularly forbid!) echo of you came to me shortly since from Rhoda Broughton--more or less to the effect that she believed you to be still in Scotland and still nurse-ridden (which is my rude way of putting it;) and this she took for not altogether significant of your complete recovery of ease. However, she is on occasion a rich dark pessimist--which is always the more picturesque complexion; and she may that day but have added a more artful touch to her cheek. I decline to believe that you are not rising by gentle stages to a fine equilibrium unless some monstrous evidence crowds upon me. I have myself little by little left such a weight of misery behind me--really quite shaken off, though <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly,</b> the worst of it, that slowness is to me no unfavouring argument at all, nor is the fact of fluctuations a thing to dismay. One goes unutterably roundabout, but still one goes--and so it is I have come. To where I am, I mean; which is doubtless where I shall more or less stay. I can do with it, for want of anything grander--and it's comparative peace and ease. It isn't what I wish you--for I wish and invoke upon you the superlative of these benedictions, and indeed it would give me a good shove on to the positive myself to know that your comparative creeps quietly forward. Don't resent creeping--there's an inward joy in it at its best that leaping and bounding don't know. And I'm sure you are having it--even if you still only creep--at its best. I live snail-like here, and it's from my modest brown shell that I reach, oh dearest Howard, ever so tenderly forth to you. I am having--absit omen!--a very decent little summer. My quite admirable niece Peggy has been with me for some weeks; she is to be so some three more, and her presence is most soothing and supporting.

Plodding, articulate and heavy drums often complement the essence of the psychedelic realm depicted by the entire debut album.|$|E
50|$|The person {{affected}} by Alice in Wonderland Syndrome may also lose {{the sense of}} time, a problem similar {{to the lack of}} spatial perspective. In other words, time seems to pass very slowly, akin to an LSD experience. The lack of time, and space, perspective leads to a distorted sense of velocity. For example, one could be inching along <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> in reality, yet it would seem as if one were sprinting uncontrollably along a moving walkway, leading to severe, overwhelming disorientation. This can then cause the person to feel as if movement, even within his or her own home, is futile.|$|E

He actually beat Akiyama in the second round, but lost {{to him in the}} fourth and final round.

50|$|Together with Gerard Duveen, Matthias Themel and Jyoti Verma, Wagner {{showed how}} modern {{scientific}} knowledge <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> penetrates traditional and culture-bound knowledge in developing societies. This „modernization“, however, does not erase the old stock of thinking, but produces {{a kind of}} cognitive polyphasia, first postulated by Serge Moscovici. The authors show that both, the modern and the traditional ways of thinking and talking co-exist and are being applied in different situations and settings: The traditional terminology and ideas are used primarily in private family contexts and the more modern and scientific stock of ideas primarily in the public. This split between domains and logically contradictory systems of representations {{is by no means}} restricted to traditional or modernizing societies and cultures, but can easily be observed in highly developed and industrialized countries as well.|$|E

National Ballet School alumnus {{and former}} Alberta Ballet member Sabrina Matthews’ “clearing” has direction and form.

Bridgett Zehr was particularly stunning, her pas de deux with Piotr Stanczyk almost spiritual. Stacey Shiori Minagawa and Chris Body plus Greta Hodgkinson and Nehemiah Kish rounded out this strong cast.

5000|$|The Piedra Movediza fell in 1912 {{and split}} in two below.

Masefield translates the commentary as follows: 'He filled a ship with abundant goods, ..., for the purposes of trade, entered upon the ocean and, in successively roaming about, on seven occasions approached his own city via an expedition up the Indus. But on the eighth occasion, he embarked into his ship with his goods loaded on board thinking he would go to Suvaṇṇabhūmi.

But Bāhiya, being tossed about <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> by the motion of the waves as he made his way (to safety) after grabbing hold of a ship’s plank, on the seventh day reached the shore in the locality of the port of Suppāraka.'

5000|$|Disintegration is {{characterized}} by a significant usage of synthesizers and keyboards, slow, [...] "droning" [...] guitar progressions and Smith's introspective vocals. [...] "Plainsong", the album's opener, [...] "set the mood for Disintegration perfectly", according to journalist Jeff Apter, by [...] "unravelling <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> in a shower of synths and guitars, before Smith steps up to the mic, uttering snatches of lyrics ('I'm so cold') as if he were reading from something as sacred as the Dead Sea Scroll." [...] Smith felt the song was a perfect opener for the record, describing it as [...] "very lush, very orchestral". The album's third track, [...] "Closedown", contains layers of keyboard texture complemented with a slow, gloomy guitar line. The track was written by Smith as a means to list his physical and artistic shortcomings. Despite the dark mood present throughout Disintegration, [...] "Lovesong" [...] was an upbeat track that became a hit in the United States. Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted the difference from other songs: [...] "the Simon Gallup/Boris Williams rhythm section create a tight, serviceable dance groove, while Smith and Porl Thompson add further guitar fills and filigrees as well, adding just enough extra bite to the song. Smith himself delivers the lyric softly, with gentle passion." ...|$|E
