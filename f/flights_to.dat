5|$|In 1989, Braathens SAFE {{started its}} first {{international}} scheduled service since 1960, from Fornebu to Billund in Denmark. Two years later, the company started flying to Newcastle, after Dan-Air had {{withdrawn from the}} route, and to Malmö in Sweden. That year also saw the start of Norway Airlines, who started a base at Fornebu and offered <b>flights</b> <b>to</b> London-Gatwick, {{as well as to}} Stockholm, in cooperation with Transwede, and to Copenhagen, in cooperation with Sterling Airlines. In 1992, both Norway Airlines and Dan-Air went bankrupt, and Braathens SAFE started <b>flights</b> <b>to</b> London-Gatwick. It terminated the Malmö route in 1994. After the deregulation, Braathens SAFE also introduced <b>flights</b> <b>to</b> Alicante, Málaga, Rome and Stockholm. Widerøe introduced international services to Gothenburg and Berlin.|$|E

30|$|These {{previous}} studies have seldom involved different types of interdependence across different asset markets in the same region. Most of the papers mentioned above focus on the interdependence between different regional markets for one identified financial asset. For instance, Brièrea et al. (2012) investigated the interdependence between different regions. They proved that the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality is more frequent than the contagion during a financial crisis. The existing studies on different types of interdependence feature two limitations. First, the majority of studies focus on {{the logic of the}} <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality or co-movements, because cash flow direction is not published and is in reality difficult to track. Bernanke et al. (1996) analyzed the mechanism of <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality in the credit market by employing the general equilibrium model. Vayanos (2004) compared the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality and the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> liquidity in the different asset markets using dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling. Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008) also investigated the lender of the last resort during the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality period under the guidance of general equilibrium theory. Second, some studies on interdependence between different assets focus on interdependence in one specific country but seldom conduct a comparison of interdependence between various asset markets in different regions, especially the comparisons between developed and emerging markets. Lang and Nakamura (1995) summarized the rules of <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality in the U.S. credit markets, while Baur and Lucey (2009) focused on <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> quality in the stock markets and corporate bond markets in the G 8 countries; however, they failed to study a similar phenomenon in emerging markets. Beber et al. (2009) found that interdependence is aroused by <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> liquidity instead of quality when investigating interdependence in the European government bond markets.|$|R
