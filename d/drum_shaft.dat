50|$|The exposed <b>drum</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a velocity regulation strategy for attenuating inherently periodic velocity {{variations of the}} organic photoconductive (OPC) drum in electrophotographic (EP) processes. Color misregistration {{is directly related to}} the fluctuations of the OPC drum velocity so that a reduction in velocity variations can improve image quality significantly. In order to reduce drum velocity variations, a velocity profile of the drum rotated by a constant motor drive is acquired through a rotary encoder mounted on the <b>drum</b> <b>shaft,</b> and it is necessary to find its amplitude, frequency, and phase. Then, it is possible that the drum velocity is regulated by modulating a brushless DC motor pulse in a sinusoidal shape. Experimental results show significant reduction in periodic velocity undulations of OPC drum...|$|E

40|$|The health state {{perception}} of mining equipment {{is intended to}} have an online real- time knowledge {{and analysis of the}} running conditions of large mining equipments. Due to its unknown failure mode, a challenge was raised to the traditional fault diagnosis of mining equipments. A health state perception algorithm of mining equipment was introduced in this paper, and through continuous sampling of the machine vibration data, the time-series data set was set up; subsequently, the mode set based on the frequency closeness was constructed by the d neighborhood method combined with the TSDM algorithm, thus the forecast method {{on the basis of the}} dual mode set was eventually formed. In the calculation of the frequency closeness, the Goertzel algorithm was introduced to effectively decrease the computation amount. It was indicated through the simulation test on the vibration data of the <b>drum</b> <b>shaft</b> base that the health state of the device could be effectively distinguished. The algorithm has been successfully applied to equipment monitoring in the Huoer Xinhe Coal Mine of Shanxi Coal Imp&Exp. Group Co., Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|Because {{customers}} are requiring front-loaded washing machine to handle big capacity laundry and have faster rotation speed to increase drying ability, there are being {{a lot of}} studies for achievement of high speed dehydration, high-strength and lightweight of washing machine in the latest washing machine business. It is essential that strength of Drum Assembly which is composed of spin <b>drum,</b> <b>shaft,</b> flange is improved to attain that target. In term of spin drum, {{it is difficult to}} realize joint strength required at high speed operation because joint strength of mechanical press-joining method is low remarkably in comparison with welding. Also in case of shaft system, stress from bending and twisting are complexly loaded onto the shaft supporting the horizontal drum, causing problems in fracture strength and fatigue life. The results of this study show optimal joining condition for mechanical press-joining by performing lots of tensile joining strength test with various specimen under multi-change of important design factor such as seaming width, bead area and bead depth etc. and the optimal design of shafting system for big capacity, high-rotation drying through strength analysis, experiment and evaluation...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} loaded {{mechanisms}} of the drilling rig is a lifting gear. Its perfection and reliability decrease time of the trip and {{in such a way}} increase the effectiveness of drilling rig operation. Insufficient calculation of movement and burden characteristics of the lifting gear brings to violation of power drive energy resources and law of resistance, laid in mechanism component, or to the overload and falling out of main components and parts and as a result there may be a decrease of the work effectiveness of the whole drilling rig. Analytical model of the lifting gear of the drilling rig is shown on pict. 1. There is depicted the following: I 1 – brought out to the drawworks <b>drum</b> <b>shaft</b> inertia moment of the movable parts of the drive, I 2 – brought out inertia moment of the drawworks drum and movable parts of the block-and-tackle system, I 3 – brought out inertia moment which includes mass of string of pipes and floating block, MM – the moment of the tyre-pneumatic socket (coupling), c 23 – brought out rope rigidity of block-and-tackle system and string of pipes, MT-braking torque.

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{but little}} explored {{field of application}} of the shape-memory technology is the area of rotary actuators, in particular for generating endless motion. This paper presents a miniature rotary motor based on shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires and overrunning clutches, which produces high output torque and unlimited rotation. The concept features an SMA wire tightly wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum to convert wire strains into large rotations within a compact package. The seesaw motion of the drum ensuing from repeated contraction-elongation cycles of the wire is converted into unidirectional motion of the output shaft by an overrunning clutch fitted between <b>drum</b> and <b>shaft.</b> Following a design process developed in a former paper, a six-stage prototype with size envelope of 48 × 22 × 30 mm is built and tested. Diverse supply strategies are implemented to optimize either the output torque or the speed regularity of the motor with the following results: maximum torque = 20 Nmm; specific torque = 6. 31 × 10 - 4 Nmm/mm 3; rotation per module = 15 deg/cycle; and free continuous speed = 4. 4 rpm...|$|R

40|$|A Grapple Hoist Assembly is {{currently}} {{used on the}} Rotary Mode Core Sampling Trucks (RMCSTs) to actuate the sampler and retrieve the pintle rod during sampling operations. The hoist assembly includes a driven drum approximately two inches wide and six inches in diameter that rotates to pay out or reel in the 5 / 32 -in. cable The current Grapple Hoist Assembly, detailed on drawing H- 2 - 690057, is prone to ''bird nesting'' the cable on the drum. ''Bird nesting'' is {{a condition in which}} the cable does not wind onto the drum in a uniformly layered manner, but winds in a random fashion where the cable essentially ''piles up'' inappropriately on the drum and, on some occasions, winds on the <b>drum</b> drive <b>shaft.</b> A system to help control this ''bird nesting'' problem has been designed as an addition to the existing components of the Grapple Hoist Assembly. The new design consists of a mechanism that is timed with, and driven by, the shaft that drives the drum. This mechanism traverses {{back and forth across the}} width of the drum to lay the cable on the drum in a uniformly layered manner. This test plan establishes the acceptance criteria, test procedure and test conditions It also describes the test apparatus necessary to verify the adequacy of the level wind system design. The test is defined as qualification testing (LMHC 1999 b) and as such will be performed at conditions beyond the parameters that the Grapple Hoist Assembly is allowed to operate by the Safety Equipment List (SEL) (LMHC 1998) ...|$|R
40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor. As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, shroud, inner <b>drum,</b> and hollow <b>shaft,</b> swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation. The swirl speed was large enough to cause a significant pressure drop. The {{flow straightener}} consists of vanes on {{the back side of the}} shroud plate. These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the inner drum in such a way as to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the flow straightener and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the flow straightener...|$|R
