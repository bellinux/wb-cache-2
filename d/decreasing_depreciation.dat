The {{aim of this study}} was to capture the development of methods of depreciation, amortization of transferring these methods into the numerical expression and assess the impact of the development of depreciation to the tax base. This work does not cover only the current depreciation issues, but focuses on the development of depreciation for the period from 1995 to 2010. Development of income taxes, depreciation rates and coefficients from 1995 - 2010 was favorable for taxpayers.

Two effects of 2 ̆ 2 congestion 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 recycling 2 ̆ 2 influence depreciation towards opposing outcomes: (1) poverty (depreciation) trap: the entire investments can only cover the increasing depreciation; (2) a type of endogenous /sustainable growth that capital accumulation and technological progress give rise to an everlasting growth via <b>decreasing</b> <b>depreciation</b> power. Therefore, poverty trap can be avoided and prosperous sustainable/ endogenous growth might be achieved if congestion of obsolete physical capital is prevented and depreciation power is lowered.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} case studies on various areas of financial accounting. The areas of financial accounting discussed include inventory valuation, relevant income and assets, statement of cash flows, accounts receivable and estimations, inventory and revenue recognition, depreciation, international accounting standards, long-term debt, stockholders’ equity, securities, income and regulation, deferred taxes, and pension and retirement plans. In the financial accounting case on inventory valuation, two companies’ financial statement values were analyzed through evaluating the related balance sheets and income statements to determine which company would be a better investment. Through ratio analysis related to profitability and liquidity of the companies, it was determined that Glenwood Heating, Inc. is the better potential investment. For the second case on financial accounting, several different kinds of income and assets were evaluated to determine which income statement and balance sheet accounts are most relevant for investors and other users of the financial statements. The income accounts that were considered include persistent income, equity income, interest income, and other income from operations. The the asset accounts that were determined critical for decision making by investors and other users of the financial statements include total operating assets, assets from affiliates, and investments. The third case provides a thorough discussion and explanation on the purpose, format, and usage of the statement of cash flows. The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to report cash receipts or inflows and cash payments or outflows during the fiscal period. For the fourth case, Accounts Receivable and Estimations, several different contributors to the accounts receivable account are discussed and analyzed for a specific company, Pearson. Accounts that affect accounts receivable include current receivables, trade receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts, and allowance for sales returns. Additionally, journal entries are expressed to show how the specific account affects accounts receivable. The fifth case addresses the revenue recognition financial accounting principle to determine if a specific company, GAC, has accurately calculated financial statement accounts, such as revenue, accounts receivable, inventory, and unearned revenue. Through an evaluation of the revenue recognition principle and GAC’s financial statements, it was determined that the company was breaking the revenue recognition principle and must change the account values accordingly. The sixth case evaluates different depreciation methods considering both legal and illegal methods for <b>decreasing</b> <b>depreciation</b> expense in the fiscal period. Northwest, Delta, and United Airlines used legal methods to depreciate the same asset different over a certain period, but Waste Management used illegal depreciation methods to falsify earnings to investors, the public, and the SEC. The seventh case explains the differences between GAAP and IFRS when accounting for various liabilities. For the eight case, long-term debt was evaluated in Rite Aid to explore different kinds of debt, methods of issuance, interest expense, and discounts on bond payables through journal entries and calculations. The ninth case, Stockholders’ Equity, evaluates the common stock, treasury stock, dividends, and related ratios in two companies to consider different method for accounting for these values and transactions and to determine what the resulting values tell investors about the company. For the tenth case, State Street Corporation’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what securities the company current held. Through exploration of the unclassified balance sheet, it was established that State Street Corporation held trading securities, listed at fair value, available-for-sale securities, listed at fair value, and held-to-maturity securities, accounted for at amortized cost. The eleventh case considers several large corporations’ business models to establish what risks these companies face and which aspects of the financials are most important in determining risk. It was decided that revenue and revenue growth are more important than income and income growth. For the twelfth case, ZAGG, Inc. ’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what factors contribute to the total income tax calculation for a company with international operations. The factors included in the income tax calculation were tax at federal statutory rate, state tax, non-deductible expense, domestic production activities deduction, return to provision adjustment, and increase in valuation allowance.

30|$|Bris et al. (2006) further {{argue that}} {{benefits}} of tax shield increases with increase in profitability, {{increase in tax}} rate, and <b>decrease</b> in <b>depreciation.</b> They estimated that costs associated with financial distress could be 2 – 20 % of assets. Andrade and Kaplan (1998) empirically found financial distress costs to be 10 – 20 % of assets. Jalilvand and Harris (1984) include transaction costs {{and other forms of}} market imperfections in their research study. This shows that capital structure is dynamic in nature, and if it does not correspond to a target level, there must be a convergence strategy to achieve a target capital structure. Thus, few important questions with regard to capital structure decisions might be how transaction costs influence capital structure? Secondly, what factors determines the speed of adjustment towards a target level of capital structure? How firms react to capital structure shocks? These implications extend the static approach of capital structure and form the foundation and framework for a dynamic capital structure policy.|$|R

30|$|Turning to {{our main}} results, the {{estimated}} coefficients on both RERD and RERA show a positive sign, indicating {{the presence of}} qualitatively symmetric effects: while a real peso depreciation tends to increase the investment level, an appreciation does the opposite. Quantitatively, however, the effects are asymmetric: in column (3.2), for example, the estimated coefficient on RER appreciations, at 0.97, {{is more than twice}} the estimated coefficient on depreciations. Thus, while an appreciation tends to <b>decrease</b> investment, a <b>depreciation</b> tends to increase it, but to a lesser degree. The results resemble those obtained for the capital accumulation rate in manufacturing, tradables, and the economy as a whole.|$|R
40|$|This note investigates {{effects of}} {{exchange}} rate uncertainty on optimal trade policies and market prices within a standard export subsidy model. As exchange rate changes, relative efficiencies of firms {{in different countries}} change. In accordance with the conventional result, we show that changes in expected exchange rate effects optimal subsidies through relative costs. In particular, increase in expected depreciation of own currency increases subsidy levels when marginal cost is constant. Introducing import dependency, however, violates this uniform relation, and subsidy levels may <b>decrease</b> with increasing <b>depreciation.</b> Subsidy levels always decrease in import dependency when depreciation is expected. We also show that market price is less sensitive to exchange rates, compared to the free trade case (no subsidies) ...|$|R
30|$|Irrespective {{of the new}} {{intercept}} shifts, {{the equations}} continue to show qualitatively symmetric RER effects: while an appreciation tends to <b>decrease</b> investment, a <b>depreciation</b> tends to increase it. Allowing for intercept shifts, however, does {{reduce the size of}} the estimated coefficients on the RER components, particularly so on RERA. This creates some ambiguity about the extent of quantitative asymmetry. In column (4.1), in particular, the Wald test cannot reject the null of equal coefficients on RERD and RERA. Column (4.4) shows the same result, but the equation may be misspecified due to the inclusion of M 3. Columns (4.2) and (4.3), finally, do reject the null of equal coefficients. Overall, the evidence continues supporting the hypothesis of quantitatively asymmetric effects of appreciations and depreciations.|$|R

These hypotheses are tested on an annual sample of 101 countries over the 1961 - 1988 period, and are not rejected by the data.

Estimation results for German women suggest that deviations from full-time employment are associated with significant wage cuts owing to the depreciation of human capital. Postponing the discontinuity leads to a further fall of the wage rate. Controlling for individual heterogeneity with respect to industry sector and job position <b>decreases</b> the estimated <b>depreciation</b> rates. This we interpret as an indication for segregation in the labor market.

40|$|Conference, and {{attendees}} at Carnegie Mellon and Harvard University faculty workshops. All remaining deficiencies {{are entirely}} our own. Inflation, Foreign Exchange, and Parsimonious Equity Valuation Inflation poses problems for parsimonious equity valuation using bottom line accounting numbers. At issue are the distortions in earnings and book values that follow {{from the use}} of historical cost unadjusted for general price level changes. These distortions include the understatement of operating assets and the mismatching of allocated costs that reflect past price levels with revenues that reflect current price levels. In this paper, we consider accounting policies that allow one to recover parsimonious valuation in an inflationary environment. Our model generalizes the cash flow dynamics of Feltham and Ohlson (1996) to encompass stochastic inflation. We show that parsimonious valuation can be achieved through either a restatement of book value and increase in depreciation similar to the policy recommended by SFAS 33, or a <b>decrease</b> in <b>depreciation</b> sufficient to capture both effects. We also suggest an approach for approximate parsimonious valuation without preparing full-scale general price level adjusted financial statements. Extending the analysis to the setting of a multinational firm with a unit operating in a country experiencing inflation, we show how to achieve parsimonious valuation in domestic currency through foreign currency translation using either historical or current exchange rates as prescribed under SFAS 8 and SFAS 52, respectively. Results speak to the value relevance of components of comprehensive income. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a simple {{model in which}} exporting firms are heterogeneous, {{both in terms of}} productivity and liquidity, with the latter being affected by exchange rate changes. This configuration is used to analyze the profits sensitivity to exchange rate changes. The originality of the article lies in the assumption that exchange rate shocks can either boost or depress liquidity, thus allowing one to study exposure in different scenarios. The model predicts that the sensitivity of a firm’s profits to exchange rate changes depends on its financial condition: an increase in the cost of external funds makes profits less sensitive to exchange rate shocks when a firm’s liquidity <b>decreases</b> following a <b>depreciation</b> of the domestic currency. The predictions of the model are tested using a large data set of French exporting firms: results confirm that for firms whose liquidity is negatively correlated with exchange rate movements, an increase in financial costs lowers exposure...|$|R

An investor has the option to delay the purchase of an income-producing property because the investor incurs sunk transaction costs and receives stochastic rental income. At the date of purchase, the investor also chooses a loan-to-value ratio, which balances the tax shield benefit against the cost of debt financing resulting from a higher borrowing rate and a lower rental income. An increase in the sunk cost or the risk of investment will not affect the financing decision, but will delay investment.

40|$|The fashionable {{analysis}} of financial crisis accentuates {{on the role}} of corporate debt composition bearing the maturity and currency mismatch. Using 226 listed companies in Jakarta Stock Exchange, this paper investigates the role of currency and maturity mismatches in propagating the negative effects of currency depreciation. By nature, depreciation could enhance export performance by its “competitiveness effect”, since price of goods should be cheaper. Nevertheless, due to the effects of maturity and currency mismatch, <b>depreciation</b> <b>decreases</b> net worth of the firms through “balance sheet effect”. This paper focuses on the impact of currency depreciation on firm-level investment. By panel data analysis, we find that firms with more dollar debt invest less in both long and short-term investment. Unfortunately, this paper fails to provide empirical evidence on the impact of currency depreciation on firm-level investment and other firm performance. However, it seems that the extreme currency depreciation followed by financial and economic crisis destroys structurally investment condition in Indonesia. Therefore, even though currency depreciation is not related significantly to firm-level investment, it is likely not true that the depreciation does not matter on firm as well as economic performance...|$|R
40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 systems 2 ̆ 2 {{concept of}} swine {{production}} research incorporates {{an awareness that}} there is more to consider than merely the level of production and implies that an enterprise is a system of many components which all play a part in determining net return. While level of production is an important factor affecting profitability, production costs are equally important. Numerous factors influence swine production and this information must be integrated to determine how enterprise profitability is affected. Five pork production systems were simulated using a deterministic computer model to analyze the effect that lactation length, estrus at initial mating, estrus at post-weaning mating and maximum parity have on the efficiency of producing 200 litters per year. Under this approach, production inputs were treated as dependent variables determined by animal performance. Mating gilts at first estrus does not appear to provide a means to improved efficiency, but this system does reduce overall facility requirements, which in turn reduce capital outlay and risk. Mating sows at first versus second estrus following weaning after a 35 -day lactation improved feed efficiency and facility utilization. Production costs declined from 98. 11 to 94. 73 per 100 kg of pork marketed, increasing net profit by 5086. Decreasing maximum parity from five down to one increased the number of replacement gilts entering the breeding herd annually which resulted in poorer reproductive performance, fewer market hogs, and a larger percentage of pork marketed as culled breeding stock. Reducing maximum parity from five to one decreased income as well as increased production costs. Production efficiency improved when lactation length declined from 35 to 18 days as a result of <b>decreased</b> feed, <b>depreciation</b> and capital charges. This result occurred in spite of a decline in litter size due to early weaning. The simulated results conclude that increasing reproductive rhythm, tightening farrowing schedules and farrowing continuously offer producers opportunities to boost sow productivity, make more efficient use of facilities and improve herd efficiency...|$|R

Provided the world interest rate [...] is given, the model predicts the domestic rate will become {{the same level of}} the world rate by arbitrage in money markets. However, in reality, the world interest rate is different from the domestic rate. Rüdiger Dornbusch considered how exchange rate expectations made an effect on the exchange rate.

Thus, a monetary expansion, in the short run, does not necessarily improve the trade balance. This result is not compatible with what the Mundell-Fleming predicts. This is a consequence of introducing exchange rate expectations which the MF theory ignores. Nevertheless, Dornbusch concludes that monetary policy is still effective even if it worsens a trade balance, because a monetary expansion pushes down interest rates and encourages spending. He adds that, in the short run, fiscal policy works because it raises interest rates and the velocity of money.|$|R
40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 81, 750 in 2000 for the 212 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. The median or middle income was $ 69, 414. This is the second annual increase from the extremely low levels of 1998. Almost all of the increase {{can be attributed to}} the increase in the value of inventories, government payment, and the <b>decrease</b> in <b>depreciation</b> charge. However, the change in depreciation was almost entirely due to a change in the accounting procedures, not a change in purchasing behavior by farmers. Using the "new" depreciation rules, net farm income (NFI) in the previous 5 years was estimated to be higher than when the "old" rules were used. For example, the "new" NFI was estimated to be $ 61, 347 in 1999 which is $ 17, 585 higher than the NFI using the "old" rules. As in previous years, the actual profit levels experienced by individual farms vary greatly from the overall average profit. When the net farm incomes for the 212 farms in the report are ranked from lowest to highest, the resulting graph shows how much the incomes do vary. Several farms experienced negative income and several experienced very high incomes. Most of the net farm incomes ranged from below 0 to about $ 150, 000. The median or middle income was $ 69, 414. The high 20 % of the farms had an average net farm income of $ 199, 929 which is an increase from 1999. The low 20 % of the farms had an average loss of $ 424 in 2000 which is better than 1999. Average gross cash farm income in 2000 was $ 422, 897. This was a 9 % increase from 1999. Four sources of sales again dominated: corn, hogs, soybeans, and beef finishing. Soybean sales increased 18 % between 1999 and 2000; hog sales, by 14 %; corn sales by 4 %, and beef finishing by 7 %. Government payments of all types increased again to $ 50, 567 per average farm in 2000 [...] an increase from $ 44, 674 in 1999, $ 30, 021 in 1998, and $ 12, 257 in 1997. As a percentage of total income, government payments were 12 % in 2000, compared to 11 % in 1999, 8 % in 1998, and 3 % in 1997. Cash expenses increased 7 % to an average of $ 348, 711 in 2000. As a percentage of both cash expenses and depreciation in 2000, feeder purchases; feed, seed, fertilizer, and crop chemicals; and rent dominate. Both the average rate of return on assets (ROA) and the rate of return to equity (ROE) increased substantially in 2000 compared to 1999. In 2000 ROA averaged 12 % and ROE was 19 % using assets valued on a cost basis. Using a market value basis, average total equity (of the 181 sole proprietors) was $ 605, 149 at the end of 2000. This was an increase of $ 50, 064 during the year for these 181 farms. Average equity has continued to improve since 1986. The average debt-asset ratio improved, that is, decreased to 47 % at the end of 2000. The average corn yield was 150 bushels per acre; soybeans were at 46 bushels per acre. Results by Type of Farm The 212 farms in the report are classified as a certain type of farm (e. g., hog) on the basis of having 70 percent or more of their gross sales from that category. Using this 70 percent rule in 2000, there are 63 crop farms, 13 hog farms, 24 crop and hog farms, 6 beef farms, and 15 crop and beef farms. (There are 87 farms which do not have a single source (or pair of sources) of income over 70 %.) Compared to 1999, all types of farms (except beef farms) had better net farm incomes in 2000. A similar story can be seen in the rate of return to assets (ROA). (Assets are valued on a cost-basis for ROA). Using assets valued on a market basis, the average crop farm has a debt-to-asset ratio of 45 % at the end of 2000. Farms with 70 % of their income from either hogs or beef had an average debt-to-asset ratio higher than 50 %.
