40|$|The aims of {{the project}} were to {{investigate}} the management, agronomic and economic performance and practical feasibility {{of a system of}} strip intercropping of <b>herbage</b> <b>legumes</b> and organic vegetables in which nitrogen transfer and conservation are affected by a combination of grazing ruminant livestock and crop rotation. Aspects of management examined included crop and legume choice, strip width, grazing management, crop husbandry, and weed, pest and disease control. Measures of agronomic performance included crop productivity and quality, plant and soil nutrient balances, and weed, pest disease incidence. Economic performance was assessed using gross margin calculations. Practical feasibility was deduced from the experience of conducting the experiment, {{and in terms of the}} responses of growers presented with the idea. These aims were met by a combination of three inter-related activities: a theoretical study; a field experiment; and a financial and economic evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The project {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the management parameters, options and performance {{of a system of}} strip intercropping of <b>herbage</b> <b>legumes</b> and organic vegetables in which nitrogen transfer and conservation is effected by a combination of grazing ruminant livestock and crop rotation. The study will involve 3 inter-related approaches: a theoretical evaluation, a field experiment and a financial and economic evaluation. The theoretical evaluation will be achieved via a combination of a review of relevant literature and consultation with horticulturists, scientists and representatives from the organic food industry. The field experiment will be conducted {{to investigate the}} management parameters and performance of a theoretically promising intercropping system consisting of red clover/timothy as the legume and spring cabbage as the first crop followed by a second crop such as salad beetroot, with sheep grazing introduced at certain stages. Objectives of the field experiment will include assessing the effects of varying strip width on system performance, examining the effects of sheep grazing on transfer of N from legume to crop and investigating the effects of crop rotation on nutrient transfer and conservation. A financial evaluation of the proposed system will be conducted initially using costs and values derived from literature and industrial sources; this will then be refined using data provided by the field experiment. The economics and implementation of the system will be assessed via a survey of organic vegetable growers and via a market assessment in collaboration with Safeway plc...|$|E
40|$|Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} <b>herbage</b> <b>legume</b> in temperate ag-riculture. Its success has been due to its adaptation to a wide range of soil and environmental condi-tions, molecular nitrogen (N 2) -fixing ability and high nutritive value for ruminants.

40|$|<b>Herbage</b> from <b>legumes</b> or legume-rich swards {{potentially}} has lower {{concentrations of}} water soluble carbohydrates (= wsc) {{and a higher}} buffering capacity (= bc) than grass grown in pure stands. The analysis of three forage legumes (= Trifolium repens, Tri-folium pratense and Lotus corniculatus) in monoculture and mixtures (= 50 / 50) with the grass species Festuca rubra demonstrates, that the ratio of wsc concentration to bc is critical low, especially when the herbage is harvested at physiological young stages to obtain a higher forage quality. This means an increased risk for silage mak-ing, especially at DM contents which are below 30 %. New breedings of the grass spe-cies Lolium perenne with higher sugar contents offer a possibility to increase the wsc concentration in grass/legume mixtures. Our studies show, that the tested high-sugar grass is suitable to increase the wsc concentrations in mixture. However, the grass has grown in monoculture. A present project is focussed on the open question if the advantage of high-sugar varieties is also evident in legume/grass mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Herbage {{contributes}} much dietary protein to ruminant diets. High-producing ruminants need part of {{the dietary}} protein to be resistant to ruminal degradation. Estimates of herbage protein degradability have not considered agronomic factors in herbage production. This research examined how herbage species, maturity stage, plant part, and nitrogen (N) fertilization modify the N composition of herbage;Smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were harvested at four, two-week intervals during spring of 1984 and 1985. Total herbage, leaves, and stems were analysed for herbage quality and various N fractions. Less than 13 % of the total N in herbage was available fiber N (AFN) (neutral detergent fiber N (NDFN) minus acid detergent fiber N (ADFN)). Available fiber N increased with <b>herbage</b> maturity. <b>Legumes</b> had twice the N in ADF as did grasses. Concentrations of NDFN and ADFN in leaves and stems reflected the different amounts and proportions of tissues in each organ. Stems had more ADFN, which reflects the greater amount of lignified structural tissue. Leaves had more NDFN, which mirrors the greater amount of mesophyll tissue. Immature herbage was most digestible, least in NDF, and highest in N concentration;Smooth bromegrass (SBG) was grown in mixture with alfalfa or fertilized with three levels of N in combination with three levels of nitrapyrin, a nitrification inhibitor, and harvested at four, two-week intervals during spring of 1985 and 1986. Total herbage of SBG was analyzed for various N fractions. Nitrapyrin {{had no effect on}} chemical composition of herbage. Nitrogen fertilizer increased both dry matter yield and N concentration in SBG, but did not alter available fiber N or herbage quality;It is concluded that herbage should be managed to optimize the yield of digestible energy to best use the large proportion of degradable N in herbage...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation with wastewaters from agri-industry {{processes}} such as milk factories, piggeries, wineries and abattoirs is commonplace. These wastewaters {{all have}} high levels of potassium (K). Potassium concentration in effluents from domestic wastewater sources are relatively low, reported to vary between 10 and 30 mgL− 1. Higher levels of potassium are reported for effluents from olive oil mills, 10, 000 – 20, 000 mgKL− 1, wool scouring, 4200 – 13, 000 mgKL− 1, cheese and lactic whey and potato processing, ∼ 1800 mgKL− 1, piggery effluent, 500 – 1000 mgKL− 1 and winery wastewaters, up to 1000 mgKL− 1. Application of wastewaters with these high potassium levels has been found to increase the overall level of soil fertility, with the exception of alkaline effluents which can dissolve soil organic carbon. Long-term application of suchwastewater may cause the build-up of soil potassium and decrease the hydraulic conductivity of the receiving soils. These potential impacts are uncertain and have been inadequately researched. Regulatory limits for potassium in drinking water have been set only by the European Union with no toxicological or physiological justification.

For interpretation of the results one was used analyzes of variance, with randomized designe consting. The medium height of the appraised plants was of 5, 1 m, diameter of the height of the chest of 16, 8 cm, diameter of the height of the base 18, 6 cm and diameter of the cup 5, 3 m. you hoist presented Them floral buttons between January and February, they bloomed between January and March and they fructified between February and March.

40|$|Field {{research}} was undertaken in Uruguay (1) to study legume proportion effects on N[subscript] 2 fixation and transfer by white clover (Trifolium repens L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), each grown with tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb); (2) to estimate N fertilizer effects on N[subscript] 2 fixation in first-year or established swards; and (3) to study legume and N fertilizer effects on soil N. Two small-plot experiments were planted in 1983 and 1984 with legume and grass seed rates to obtain four swards ranging from 30 to 90 % <b>legume</b> (<b>herbage</b> yield) in each mixture. Fixed N was estimated by [superscript] 15 N isotope dilution using tall fescue pure stands as reference. Legume N {{derived from the}} atmosphere (%Ndfa) in first harvests was 58 % for birdsfoot trefoil (BT), and 74 % for white clover (WC) and red clover (RC). Values of %Ndfa were higher (90 %) in winter and spring with no differences between species. Maximum 2 -year herbage fixed-N was 500 kg ha[superscript]- 1 and was exhibited by a RC pasture. Increasing percentage legume decreased %Ndfa linearly with similar slopes for the three species. As legume proportion increased, N[subscript] 2 fixed per-area increased linearly for RC and BT but the increase for WC was curvilinear with a plateau at high WC proportions. Thus, strongly WC-dominated swards are not needed to optimize N[subscript] 2 fixation. Transferred N increased with time, comprising up to 60 % of grass-N. The annual amount transferred was similar for WC and RC but in summer, N transfer and soil nitrate were higher for the WC mixtures. Over time, transfer by BT became lower than for the clovers. A one-time N rate of 100 kg ha[superscript]- 1 depressed %Ndfa values temporarily, only while the increased soil ammonium and nitrate remained high. Negative effects of N on annual fixed-N yield and legume stands were stronger for BT and in the seeding year. It is concluded that different patterns {{of growth in the}} legumes and the grass interact with mineral soil-N levels and are major factors influencing N[subscript] 2 fixation...|$|R
40|$|Although New Zealand is {{fortunate}} {{in having a}} climate mild enough to allow some growth of pasture in winter even in the extreme south of the South Island (Duffy, 1971), growth is nevertheless considerably less than in spring and summer. O’Connor et al, (1968) point out that at Lincoln, Canterbury, winter production from a New Zealand Certified Grasslands Ruanui Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne c. v.) and New Zealand Certified Grasslands Huia white clover (Trifolium repens c. v.) sward is at best only 8 % of the mean total annual dry matter (D. M.) production. A similar seasonal pattern is shown by irrigated pastures (Rickard, 1968), as well as pastures in the milder North Island of New Zealand (O’Connor and Vartha, pers comm.). Stocking of grazing animals is normally related to {{the growth rate of}} pastures in the spring, with conserved hay or silage, plus specially grown greenfeed or root crops being fed if necessary to offset the winter feed deficit. However on hill country too steep for tractor cultivation, cropping and conservation are not possible. Animals have to rely upon in situ grazing of native or dominant browntop (Agrostis tenuis) swards which may not have been improved by the aerial introduction of clovers. In an unimproved state, {{the quality and quantity of}} the herbage grown on such areas are low, Molloy (1966) have discussed clover introduction into native swards and the notably beneficial result this has on stock thrift, particularly during the winter period. Considerably better growth rates of stock grazing legumes rather than grasses have been noted by many authors including Ulyatt, (1971), and McLean et al (1962); this superiority being due largely to the greater digestible organic matter intake and higher ratio of soluble to insoluble carbohydrate associated with the <b>herbage</b> of <b>legumes</b> (Ulyatt, 1971). Consequently the presence of clover, and the winter activity of this, have an important influence on the productivity of steep hill country during winter. An increase of winter activity is also desirable, but not essential, in clover associated with flat or gently rolling pastures. The main pasture legume used in New Zealand has, in the past, been the white clover cultivar Huia. Whilst since 1945 selection and breeding of ryegrasses has brought about a very considerable improvement in the winter or cool season activity of these (Corkill, 1966), no legume cultivar having an increased level of cool-season activity has been released to commerce in New Zealand over the same period to date. Breeding for increased winter growth has been an objective of the Grasslands Division Plant Breeding Section for many years (Barclay, 1960). Since 1957, breeding and selection work has been proceeding with the objective of increasing the winter growth of the New Zealand Certified Grasslands white clover cultivar – Huia (henceforth to be referred to as Huia) without sacrificing the moderately good summer growth of this strain, (Barclay, 1969). Seed of a promising cultivar selected during the course of this work – New Zealand Grasslands 4700 white clover, (henceforth to be referred to as 4700) became available for testing in 1967. The investigation to be reported here aimed to measure the cool-season activity of 4700 by comparison with that of Huia, at the same time elucidating if possible the factors controlling this growth...|$|R
40|$|Iowa {{pastures}} are {{diverse in}} the landscapes and soil conditions present within small area units. Introducing legumes into these areas {{has the potential}} to improve seasonal distribution and quality of the pasture forage. This study was performed to quantify the spatial and temporal variation in legume contribution to the plant community when seeded into established cool-season grass pastures. Pastures were seeded with a mixture of eleven legumes and then divided into three grazing methods (non-grazed, continuous, and rotational), with each grazing method containing five landscape positions (upland, sideslope, bottomland, opposite sideslope, and opposite upland). Legume dry matter composition, legume species richness, legume diversity, and forage quality was determined during the grazing season and associated with site soil characteristics. Sideslope positions had greater legume dry matter composition (161 g kg- 1) than either the upland (62 g kg- 1) or bottomland landscape positions (7 g kg - 1), and legume concentrations increased as the growing seasons progressed in the grazed treatments. Legume species richness also was greater for sideslope landscape positions. Legume dry matter composition showed a strong, positive linear relationship to species richness in continuous, rotational, and non-grazed treatments (r 2 = 0. 77, 0. 84, and 0. 74), and may potentially be utilized as a tool to estimate the need for re establishment in these pastures. Legume dry matter diversity using the Shannon-Wiener index was greatest for grazed pastures, but was positively linearly related to legume dry matter composition in only rotationally grazed paddocks (r 2 = 0. 88). Upland and bottomland sites with the greatest total available dry matter herbage production potential contained the lowest legume concentrations and <b>legume</b> <b>herbage.</b> Forage NDF was lowest and IVDMD was greatest on sideslopes (527 g kg- 1, 630 g kg- 1) compared to uplands (552 g kg- 1, 608 g kg- 1) and bottomlands (568 g kg- 1, 560 g kg- 1). Of all spatial and temporal variables, land slope best explained the variation in legume dry matter composition (r 2 = 0. 66) and species richness (r 2 = 0. 75). Competition resulting from the greater grass component at lesser slopes appeared to be a limiting factor for legume establishment. Land slope is easily quantified, and could serve as a basis for pasture division for differential fertilization, seeding, and grazing management...|$|R
40|$|Bulk tank {{milk from}} 28 dairy farms was sampled every second month for 2 yr {{to assess the}} effects of {{grassland}} management, production system and season on milk fatty acid (FA) composition, concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins, Se, and milk sensory quality. Grassland management varied {{in terms of time}} since establishment. Short-term grassland management (SG) was defined as establishment or reseeding every fourth year or more often, and long-term grassland management (LG) was defined as less frequent establishment or reseeding. Fourteen organic (ORG) dairy farms with either short-term or long-term grassland management were paired with 14 conventional (CON) farms with respect to grassland management. Within ORG farms, SG farms differed from LG farms in herbage botanical composition, but not in concentrate FA concentrations, dry matter intake, or milk yield. Within CON farms, herbage composition, concentrate FA concentrations, dry matter intake, and milk yield showed no or insignificant variations. The ORG farms differed from CON farms in herbage botanical composition, concentrate FA concentrations, concentrate intake, and milk yield. Compared with ORG-LG farms, ORG-SG farms produced milk fat with higher proportions of C 10 : 0 and C 12 : 0 associated with higher <b>herbage</b> proportions of <b>legumes</b> (Fabaceae) and lower proportions of other dicotyledon families. Compared with milk from CON farms, milk fat from ORG farms had higher proportions of most saturated FA and all n- 3 FA, but lower proportions of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 cis- 9 associated with higher forage proportion and differences in concentrations of FA in concentrates. Compared with the outdoor-feeding periods, the indoor feeding periods yielded milk fat with higher proportions of most short-chain and medium-chain FA and lower proportions of most C 18 -FA associated with grazing and higher forage proportions. Milk concentrations of α-tocopherol and β-carotene were lower during the grazing periods. Inclusion of fishmeal in organic concentrates may explain higher Se concentrations in organically produced milk. Milk sensory quality was not affected in this study. In conclusion, grassland management had minor effects on milk composition, and differences between ORG farms and CON farms may be explained by differences in concentrate intake and concentrate FA concentrations. Milk produced on ORG farms versus CON farms and milk produced during the outdoor versus indoor feeding periods had potential health benefits due to FA composition. In contrast, the higher milk-fat proportions of saturated FA in milk from ORG farms may be perceived as negative for human health...|$|R
