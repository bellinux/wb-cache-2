Balanced equivalence relations in the lattice correspond to clusters of partially synchronized cells in a network. In this paper, we restrict attention to regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> with simple real eigenvalues, and one-dimensional internal dynamics for each cell. We first show that lattice elements with nonzero indices indicate the existence of codimension-one synchrony-breaking steady-state bifurcations, and furthermore, the positions of such lattice elements give the number of partially synchronized clusters. Using four-cell regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> as an example, we then classify {{a large number of}} regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> into a small number of lattice structures, in which networks share an equivalent clustering type.

50|$|In {{parallel}} computer architectures, a systolic array is a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>network</b> of tightly coupled data processing units (DPUs) called cells or nodes. Each node or DPU independently computes a partial result {{as a function}} of the data received from its upstream neighbors, stores the result within itself and passes it downstream. Systolic arrays were invented by Richard P. Brent and H. T. Kung, who developed them to compute greatest common divisors of integers and polynomials. They are sometimes classified as multiple-instruction single-data (MISD) architectures under Flynn's taxonomy, but this classification is questionable because a strong argument can be made to distinguish systolic arrays from any of Flynn's four categories: SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD, as discussed later in this article.|$|E
5000|$|This {{spanning}} technique {{which includes}} container structures ushers {{in a new}} development in town-planning. Raised plans increase the original area of the city becoming three-dimensional. The tiering of the spatial city on several independent levels, {{one on top of}} the other, determines [...] "spatial town-planning" [...] both from the functional and from the aesthetic viewpoint. The lower level may be earmarked for public life and for premises designed for community services as well as pedestrian areas. The piles contain the vertical means of transport (lifts, staircases). The superposition of levels should make it possible to build a whole industrial city, or a residential or commercial city, on the same site. In this way, the Spatial City forms what Yona Friedman would call an [...] "artificial topography".

40|$|Regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> are a {{class of}} coupled cell network, which {{comprises}} one type of cell (node) with one type of coupling (arrow), and each cell has {{the same number of}} input arrows (called the valency of the network). In coupled cell networks, robust synchrony (a flow-invariant polydiagonal) corresponds to a special kind of partition of cells, called a balanced equivalence relation. Balanced equivalence relations are determined solely by the network structure. It is well known that the set of balanced equivalence relations on a given finite network forms a complete lattice. In this paper, we consider regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> in which the internal dynamics of each cell is one-dimensional, and whose associated adjacency matrices have simple eigenvalues (real or complex). We construct explicit forms of lattices of balanced equivalence relations for such networks by introducing key building blocks, called lattice generators, along with integer numbers called lattice indices. The properties of lattice indices allow construction of all possible lattice structures for balanced equivalence relations of regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> of any number of cells with any valency. As an illustration, we show all 14 possible lattice structures of balanced equivalence relations for four-cell regular <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Current Bayesian net {{representations}} do {{not consider}} structure in the domain and include all variables in a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>network.</b> At any time, a human reasoner in a large domain may direct his attention to only {{one of a number}} of natural subdomains, i. e., there is ?localization' of queries and evidence. In such a case, propagating evidence through a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>network</b> is inefficient since the entire network has to be updated each time. This paper presents multiply sectioned Bayesian networks that enable a (localization preserving) representation of natural subdomains by separate Bayesian subnets. The subnets are transformed into a set of permanent junction trees such that evidential reasoning takes place at only one of them at a time. Probabilities obtained are identical to those that would be obtained from the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>network.</b> We discuss attention shift to a different junction tree and propagation of previously acquired evidence.

40|$|Abstract—Modularity {{is known}} to have {{benefits}} for neural systems and their evolution, and this paper aims to improve the evolutionary neural network algorithm EPNet to take advantage of those benefits. Neural networks exist with varying degrees of modularity ranging from pure modular networks characterized by disjoint partitions of hidden nodes with no communication between modules, to pure <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> with significant connections throughout. In between are apparently <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> that can be seen to have some degree of modularity if the hidden nodes are reorganized appropriately. In this paper, a modularity measure is presented and extended that can be applied to any neuron at any level in the network to provide a fine analysis of node partitioning. It also allows the rearrangement of nodes to create modules in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks,</b> and that is used to improve the EPNet algorithm to evolve modular neural networks. Experimental results on a simple classification task confirm that the new modular EPNet algorithm does indeed lead to more modular networks than the classical EPNet algorithm, without compromising the performance on the given task...|$|R

It is found that with appropriate normalization, the SINR and spectral efficiency converge with probability 1 to asymptotic limits as N increases. This technique is applied to networks with power-law node intensities, which includes <b>homogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> as a special case, to find a simple approximation for the spectral efficiency.
