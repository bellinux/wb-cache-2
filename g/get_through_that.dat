500|$|The Byrds {{included}} {{a recording of}} [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] on their 1965 debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day. The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him [...] "The only way you're going to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> door is over my dead body...You're {{going to stay in}} this room until you do the vocal." [...] According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer [...] "got it all out and sang like an angel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bright was nightwatchman. He {{ended up}} scoring 30 ad {{taking part in}} a {{partnership}} with Dean Jones, who made 210. [...] "It was one of the better efforts of human endurance I’ve seen," [...] said Bright. [...] "He was very ill, we were all very ill. To <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that,</b> with the heat being unbearable, but he was good enough to hit the singles when he needed to and get the fours when they were there. The good thing was that he had {{to spend the night in}} hospital on a saline drip so we didn’t have to spend the night hearing about how good a knock it was.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A much pleasanter way, though, {{than that}} of being badly wounded, and so found on the field by the enemy," [...] the countess said; [...] "and you were fortunate, indeed, in <b>getting</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> terrible battle unhurt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Catherine Bell {{said of her}} character: “The first season, she {{was more}} {{withdrawn}} and was being abused by her son, but now she {{has come out of}} her shell.

6000|$|... "Well, {{maybe we}} can <b>get</b> <b>through,</b> if <b>that's</b> the case," [...] said the shipowner's son, slowly. [...] "Just the same, I think old Haskers the meanest man alive." ...|$|R

Carolyn Loveridge wrote to say: [...] "Thank you once again for providing a professional and excellent service for South-West Leicestershire". Angel Gould, a leader at 1st Barwell Cubs, wrote to say she had discovered the station quite by chance and on questioning her cubs that evening she was surprised {{that a lot of}} them were already listening to Fosseway Radio, [...] "I hope the message <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> they and myself like listening to Fosseway Radio and long may it continue".|$|R

"This is a gay {{and lively}} {{beginning}} for a hermit," [...] she thought, {{as she made}} her way around the house, [...] "and I don't see how on earth I am ever going to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> window again.

50|$|Amplifiers may {{oscillate}} {{gently in}} ways that are hard to detect without an oscilloscope, or the oscillations may be so extensive that only a very distorted or no required signal at all <b>gets</b> <b>through,</b> or <b>that</b> damage occurs.

60|$|Enter the single-minded Dick, {{whose only}} fault at the gipsying, or picnic, {{had been that}} of loving Fancy too exclusively, and depriving himself of the {{innocent}} pleasure the gathering might have afforded him, by sighing regretfully at her absence,--who had danced with the rival in sheer despair of ever being able to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> stale, flat, and unprofitable afternoon in any other way; but this she would not believe.|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy {{wasted no}} time in {{squeezing}} {{through a hole in the}} floor way over in one corner, a hole that Farmer Brown's boy had intended to nail a board over long before. Unc' Billy knew that Bowser couldn't <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that,</b> even if he did manage to dig his way under the henhouse. Once through that and fairly in the henhouse, Unc' Billy drew a long breath. He felt safe for the time being, anyway, and he didn't propose to worry over the future.|$|E
60|$|How {{long they}} would have {{continued}} to argue and try to appear polite if something hadn't happened, nobody knows. But something did happen. There was a sudden loud sniff {{just around the corner}} of the henhouse. It was from Bowser the Hound. Right then and there Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk forgot all about politeness, and both tried to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> hole at the same time. They couldn't, because it wasn't big enough, but, they tried hard. Bowser sniffed again, and this time Unc' Billy managed to squeeze Jimmy aside and slip through. Jimmy was right at his heels.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} for his {{information}} and gave him some snuff, which he took gratefully, being bored by his long vigil. Then I asked him how many people the great witch-doctor had with him. He {{said he did not}} know, but he had seen a number of tall men come to the mouth of the donga to fetch food that had been placed there. Again I inquired if he had seen any women, whereon he replied none, Zikali being, he understood, too old to trouble himself about the other sex. Just then an officer, making his rounds, came up and looked at me so sternly that I thought it well to retreat. Evidently there was no chance of <b>getting</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Off we go!" [...] shouted Larry, {{and with}} a crack of the whip the sleigh started. It was drawn by a heavy pair of horses, who looked well able to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> any {{snowdrift}} <b>that</b> might present itself.|$|R

60|$|Of {{course the}} aunts arrived {{in all their}} best, all cautioning {{everybody}} else to keep quiet and all gabbling excitedly at the least provocation. Jamie suffered the most during that day, so divided was he between the desire to behave well and the frantic impulse to shout {{at the top of}} his voice, turn somersaults, and race all over the house. Occasional bolts into the barn, where he let off steam by roaring and dancing jigs, to the great dismay of the fat old horses and two sedate cows, helped him to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> trying period.|$|E
6000|$|How {{she managed}} to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> evening, Polly never knew, yet {{it was not a}} long one, for at eight o'clock she slipped out of the room, meaning to run home alone, and not compel any one to serve as escort. But she did not succeed, for as she stood warming her rubbers at the dining-room fire, {{wondering}} pensively as she did so if Maria Bailey had small feet, and if Tom ever put her rubbers on for her, the little overshoes were taken out of her hands, and Tom's voice said, reproachfully, [...] "Did you really mean to run away, and not let me go home with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'He {{who helps}} himself {{deserves to be}} helped,' said Old Mother Nature. Mr. Mink didn't know what she meant by that, but {{the next morning he}} found out.

He could swim as much as he pleased and not get the least bit wet, because the water couldn't <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> new coat. And ever since that long-ago day when the world was young, the Minks have had waterproof coats and have been famous fishermen. Hello, Peter Rabbit!
