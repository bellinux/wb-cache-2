25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E
60|$|Jeeves came in {{with the}} nightly whisky-and-soda. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the chappie's manner {{that he was still}} upset.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who is that?' cried Mr Abney. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{the sound}} of his voice that his nerves were on wires. 'Who was that who spoke?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Eleanor was beckoning Jimmy, but {{the child}} went on. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "he thinks you nice, <b>I</b> know. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> {{the way he looked}} at you. Perhaps you didn't see him, but I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I believe you're {{a sort of}} honorary dog yourself. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> the way {{you stopped}} that fight at Roville. You plunged into a howling mass of about a million hounds of all species and just whispered in their ears and they stopped at once. Why, the more one {{examines}} this, the better it looks. I do believe it's {{the one thing you}} couldn't help making a success of. It's very paying, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure enough, {{there in}} the {{distance}} war some horsemen coming across the plain; but they war straggling, and not many of them. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not make head nor tail of it. They war Injins, sure enough, for even at that distance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> their figures. Then I saw as there was more of them coming behind them; the idea suddenly struck me: 'Ride, Captain!' I shouted; 'ride with your men for your life, they are chasing some one.' ...|$|R
60|$|This {{familiar}} address had {{the effect}} of reassuring the general, for he came right for us, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> his heightened colour that his temper was at boiling point.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY. He only {{smiled and}} said: [...] "We'll {{see if you}} gain weight to-morrow." [...] As if that mattered now! Why, I'm way above normal as it is! But you know Stanton--always putting you off. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{the way he said}} it he'd be willing to consider---- ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{relieved}} when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful; {{that she had been}} crying bitterly, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the redness of her eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{long time}} the Indian {{remained}} silent, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the expression of his grave face whether my reasoning weighed with him or not; I therefore offered up a brief prayer that the Spirit of God might open his eyes--as well as my own--to see, and our hearts to receive, the truth, whatever that might be. Then I said,--"The thoughts of Big Otter are deep, what do they lead to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} ashamed of my profession," [...] he said, {{swallowing}} a morsel of the hump with evident delight, slily endeavouring {{at the same time to}} distinguish the peculiarities of the singed and defaced skin, [...] "I ought to be ashamed of my profession, were there beast, or bird, on the continent of America, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> some one of the many evidences which science has enlisted in her cause. This--then--the food is nutritious and savoury--a mouthful of your corn, friend, if you please?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Fire-Men squatted {{around the}} fire and slept with their heads bowed forward on their knees. They did not sleep soundly. Their ears twitched in their sleep, and they were restless. Every little while one or another got up and threw more wood upon the fire. About the circle {{of light in the}} forest, in the {{darkness}} beyond, roamed hunting animals. Lop-Ear and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them <b>by</b> their sounds. There were wild dogs and a hyena, and for a time there was a great yelping and snarling that awakened on the instant the whole circle of sleeping Fire-Men.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was just}} {{daylight}} as we {{stepped down from}} the Pullman at West Salem, but father was there! Seated in our [...] "canopy-top surrey" [...] and holding restless ramping Black Dolly to her place, he was too busy to glance at us, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>by</b> the set of his head, that he was emotionally intense.|$|E
60|$|By and by, {{they looked}} down with deeper {{attention}} still. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> their gestures and their excited manner that the lava, after its lull, {{had begun to}} ascend afresh. The man in the mask advanced and prostrated himself. He quivered with emotion. He flung his arms up wildly. His limbs shook. He seemed as if in the bodily presence of Pélé.|$|E
60|$|He sprang {{through a}} gate into a field, {{dragging}} the reluctant Pompey after him. We had hardly got under {{the shelter of}} the hedge when the carriage rattled past. I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong within, his shoulders bowed, his head sunk on his hands, the very image of distress. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> my companion's graver face that he also had seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect he {{has gone}} off to sleep," [...] Cuthbert said, [...] "he {{has been in a}} lot of pain all night and half an hour ago they took off his {{bandages}} and put on fresh ones, and I fancy they must have hurt him amazingly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> his quick breathing, for he did not utter a moan. I am glad that {{he has gone}} off to sleep. I heard the doctor tell him that he thought he might get the use of his arm again, though it would probably be stiff for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her grief almost wrecked my own {{self-control}} but I soothed her as best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> {{her that}} she would soon be among old friends and that she couldn't turn back now. [...] "Go on and make a little visit anyway," [...] I added. [...] "It's {{only a few hours}} from Ordway and you can go home at any time." ...|$|R
60|$|His answer {{startled me}} into perfect silence. Mr. Sherwin kept a large linen-draper's shop {{in one of}} the great London thoroughfares! The boy {{mentioned}} the number, and the side of the way on which the house stood--then asked me if I wanted to know anything more. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> him <b>by</b> a sign that he might leave me, and that I had heard enough.|$|R
60|$|Hooja {{called to}} Juag to stop {{when he saw}} that our craft was moving. He was much {{interested}} in the sail, and not a little awed, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> his shouted remarks and questions. Raising my head, I saw him plainly. He would have made an excellent target for one of my guns, and I had never been sorrier that I had lost them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{bet your}} sweet life. I've handled {{too much of}} it not to know it in the dark. Just rub a piece between your fingers.--Like that. Why, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the taste of it. I've eaten enough of the dust of the teams. Here's where our fun begins. Why, you know we've been workin' our heads off since we hit this valley. Now we're on Easy street." ...|$|E
60|$|Then by an odd chance, as I {{passed to}} the outer door, there was the British Ambassador himself. He was {{standing}} beside the door waiting to open it. There was no mistaking him. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> his cocked hat and brass buttons and the brass chain across his chest {{that it was the}} Ambassador. The way in which he swung the door back and removed his hat showed him a trained diplomat.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a strange}} apathy about him," [...] said Flora, [...] "but I believe it is chiefly for want of exertion. I should like to rouse him if papa would let me; <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> him how these Andersons are {{reckoning}} on his getting down. If he does, I shall be ready to run away, that I may never meet any one here again." ...|$|R
40|$|An {{awareness}} of professional boundaries {{can be obtained}} through formal educational training, {{a review of the}} literature, and practice experience. For this author, an introduction to boundaries resulted from a relationship developed with an adolescent in a residential treatment facility. A professional's reflection on boundaries is shared, highlighting such areas as dual relationships and boundary confusion. The phone rang early on the first Satvirday moming that I had off in a month. It was Holly, a fifteen-year-old adolescent whom I worked with in a residential treatment facility. I immediately felt a knot in my stomach — <b>I</b> ̂ <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the tone of her voice that she was in trouble and would be requesting my assistance. How did I know this? Past experience. Over the course of th...|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting to}} reload, {{or even to}} look if {{the main body of}} the Zulus had seen the death of their two scouts, I turned my horse and drove my heels into his sides. As soon as I was down the slope of the rise I pulled a little to the right in order to {{intercept}} the waggons before the Zulus saw them. I had not gone three hundred yards in this new direction when, to my utter astonishment, I struck a trail marked with waggon-wheels and the hoofs of oxen. Of waggons there must have been at least eight, and several hundred cattle. Moreover, they had passed within twelve hours; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> the spoor. Then I understood; the Impi was following the track of the waggons, which, in all probability, belonged to a party of emigrant Boers.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. MILER. It's {{about your}} divorce case. This 'ere [...] "Watchfire," [...] ye see, belongs to some fellers that won't 'ave their men gettin' into the papers. So this 'ere friend of Mr. Malise--very nice 'e spoke about it: [...] "If it comes into Court," [...] 'e says, [...] "you'll 'ave to go," [...] 'e says. [...] "These beggars, these dogs, these dogs," [...] 'e says, [...] "they'll 'oof you out," [...] 'e says. An' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{the sound of}} his voice, 'e meant it--proper upset 'e was. So that's that! ...|$|E
60|$|Adventures {{are to the}} adventurous. They abound {{on every}} side; but only the chosen few {{have the courage to}} embrace them. And they will not come to you: you must go out to seek them. Then they meet you half-way, and rush into your arms, for they know their true lovers. There were eight Blighted Fraus at the Home for Lost Ideals, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> simple {{inspection}} that they had not had an average of half an adventure per lifetime between them. They sat and knitted still, like Awful Examples.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{numerous}} subtle signs, {{which might}} have been lost upon anyone but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent. As impassive as ever to the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot. After his habit he said nothing, and after mine I asked no questions. Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption. All would come round to me in due time.|$|E
60|$|The {{regiment}} {{to which}} our friend {{had been appointed}} was the 71st Highland Light Infantry, which wore the red coat and the trews, and had its depot in Glasgow town. There we went, all three, by coach: the Major in great spirits and full of stories about the Duke and the Peninsula, while Jim sat in the corner with his lips set and his arms folded, and I knew that he killed de Lissac three times an hour in his heart. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> the sudden glint of his eyes and grip of his hand. As to me, I {{did not know whether}} to be glad or sorry; for home is home, and it is a weary thing, however you may brazen it out, to feel that half Scotland is between you and your mother.|$|R
60|$|I was in New York when I {{received}} {{the order to}} proceed immediately to Chicago. The man who gave me the order {{was one of the}} oligarchs, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> his speech, though I did not know his name nor see his face. His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake. Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered, that we had been countermined. The explosion was ready for the flash of powder, and countless agents of the Iron Heel, including me, either on the ground or being sent there, were to supply that flash. I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart was beating madly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded instructions were given.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> {{the way you}} mispronounce {{the words}} that's got a's in them, you know; such as saying loff when you mean laff --but you'll get over that. He's a right down good fellow, and a little sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker and the {{blacksmith}} that work in the navy yard, {{but not so much}} with the others. The fact is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style that is-- in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't so very much, even if he's that. But over there of course it's different. So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and the first {{he knew he had to}} get to work or starve. Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged he was all right--did you say anything?" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{the first}} thing that I did was to {{dismount}} and to lead my mare into a small wood through which a stream ran. There I watered her and rubbed her down, giving her two pieces of sugar soaked in cognac from my flask. She was spent from the sharp chase, but it was wonderful to see how she came round with a half-hour's rest. When my thighs closed upon her again, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the spring and the swing of her {{that it would not be}} her fault if I did not win my way safe to Paris.|$|E
6000|$|And his meaning dawned upon me. Still {{holding to}} my {{end of the}} oar, I shoved the tiller over with my back, and even bent my body to keep it over. As it was the Mist was nearly dead before the wind, and this {{maneuver}} was bound to force her to jibe her mainsail {{from one side to}} the other. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the [...] "feel" [...] when the wind spilled out of the canvas and the boom tilted up. Paul's man had now gained a footing on the little deck, and my man was just scrambling up.|$|E
60|$|A sullen roar {{from the}} warriors {{recalled}} my attention toward them. They stood shaking their fists {{at me and}} yelling insults. From {{the direction of the}} village I saw a single warrior coming to join them. He was a huge fellow, and when he strode among them <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> his bearing and their deference toward him that he was a chieftain. He listened to all they had to tell of the happenings of the last few minutes; then with a command and a roar he started for me with the whole pack at his heels. All they had needed had arrived--namely, a brave leader.|$|E
60|$|He {{told me that}} he had {{cleansed}} and sewn up Stephen's wound, {{which appeared}} to be doing well, although the spear had pierced right through the shoulder, luckily without cutting any artery. So I went in to see the patient and found him cheerful enough, though weak from weariness and loss of blood, with Miss Hope feeding him with broth from a wooden native spoon. I didn't stop very long, especially after he got on to the subject of the lost orchid, about which he began to show signs of excitement. This I allayed as well as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> him that <b>I</b> had preserved a pod of the seed, news at which he was delighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes (if {{you must}} chaw it over), Tyler {{appointed}} him; or, {{if it was}} n't him, it was old Granny Harrison, and that's all one. I tell you, Aunt 'Becca, there's no mistake about his being a Whig. Why, his very looks shows it; everything about him shows it: if I was deaf and blind, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>by</b> the smell. I seed him when I was down in Springfield last winter. They had a sort of a gatherin' there one night among the grandees, they called a fair. All the gals about town was there, and all the handsome widows and married women, finickin' about trying to look like gals, tied as tight in the middle, and puffed out at both ends, like bundles of fodder that had n't been stacked yet, but wanted stackin' pretty bad. And then they had tables all around the house kivered over with [------] caps and pincushions and ten thousand such little knick-knacks, tryin' to sell 'em to the fellows that were bowin', and scrapin' and kungeerin' about 'em. They would n't let no Democrats in, for fear they'd disgust the ladies, or scare the little gals, or dirty the floor. I looked in at the window, and there was this same fellow Shields floatin' about on the air, without heft or earthly substances, just like a lock of cat fur where cats had been fighting.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'Well, hurry {{in to the}} fire, do! Ugh, what a storm! Do {{you suppose}} anybody will come? You must be half frozen, you poor thing! Come quick, or you'll {{certainly}} perish!' She flies from the portiere to the fire burning on the hearth, pokes it, flings on a log, jumps back, brushes from her dress with a light shriek the sparks driven out upon it, and continues talking incessantly in a voice lifted for her husband to hear in the anteroom. 'If I'd dreamed it was any such storm as this, I should never have let you go out in it in the world. It wasn't at all necessary to have the flowers. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have got on perfectly well, and I believe NOW the table would look better without them. The chrysanthemums would have been quite enough; and I know you've taken more cold. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> your voice {{as soon as you}} spoke; and just as quick as they're gone to-night I'm going to have you bathe your feet in mustard and hot water, and take eight of aconite, and go straight to bed. And I don't want you to eat very much at dinner, dear, and you must be sure not to drink any coffee, or the aconite won't be of the least use.' She turns and encounters her husband, who enters through the portiere, his face pale, his eyes wild, his white necktie pulled out of knot, and his shirt front rumpled. 'Why, Edward, {{what in the world is}} the matter? What has happened?' ...|$|R
