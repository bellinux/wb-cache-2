50|$|Papapetrou {{was born}} in 1960 into a Greek {{immigrant}} family in Melbourne. She attended the University of Melbourne, graduating {{with a degree in}} Arts and Law in 1984. In 1997 she graduated with a Master of Arts degree from RMIT University and with a PhD from Monash University in 2007. She worked as a lawyer between 1985 and 2001. Papapetrou began taking photographs as early as 1987, and in her early years, she focused on cultural <b>identity,</b> <b>photographing</b> subcultures including Elvis Presley fans and impersonators, Marilyn Monroe impersonators, drag queens, body builders, circus performers and wrestlers. More recently she has focused on the representation of childhood in photography.|$|R

30|$|Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications has now {{released}} {{the first batch}} of articles on this special topic. In addition to this editorial, we (Lander, Bruce & Bindemann, 2018) have published here a narrative review of the topic. In our review we note that, {{with the exception of}} work on impairments in face recognition (prosopagnosia), research has only recently begun to investigate why there are such wide variations in individual abilities to perceive and recognise faces. These investigations have raised as many questions as answers about the reasons why some people are so much better than others at recognising faces. Our review also highlighted two specific areas of application - the recruitment and use of “super-recogniser” (SRs) in forensic operations, and the scrutiny of passport or other <b>identity</b> <b>photographs</b> used to gain access to restricted areas. These are areas that a number of the papers published here address.|$|R
50|$|Established as a success, he {{exhibited}} {{regularly at}} the London Salon of Photography and works {{appear in the}} annual Photograms of the Year between 1914-1928. Cecil had at least two pupil/assistants who established successful careers on their own Paul Tanqueray who had also attended Tonbridge School and Angus McBean whose work Cecil noticed when exhibited near his Gallery at a tea-room named, The Pirate's Den. McBean later claimed that he took many of his sittings in the mid 1930s. Although the studio continued as a functioning entity until the Second World War, including official photographs of King George VI. He later experimented with the photographic machine that became {{the basis of the}} Photo-Me studios {{that can be used to}} obtain instant <b>identity</b> <b>photographs</b> for passports and other official documents. He was to die in obscurity in Brighton and a number of his negatives were acquired by the National Portrait Gallery after a house clearance.|$|R

40|$|The Lost Object of Love is {{a project}} that has at its heart, loss and identity. The loss of a child as she {{physically}} changes whilst growing up has prompted an enquiry into ways of drawing and painting that deal with loss and transient <b>identity.</b> <b>Photographs</b> inspire my images as other painters have also, since its invention, used photographs. Portraiture in both photography and painting has significantly changed in the eras of pre and post Cubism, both pictorially and conceptually. One of {{the main components of}} naturalistic portraiture is its ability to define a subject. This can be difficult when trying to explore complex identity through mimetic representation. Photography has become very close to painting in its ability as a medium to produce powerful, evocative art. However, I have sought to define what is still different between painting and photography and conclude that touch can return corporeality to an image that photography has made absent. In order to both protect my daughter's privacy and to afford greater imaginative input; masks, performance, and painting techniques have all been explored. A series of watercolour drawings and paintings have been made in which the child stereotype has been challenged. I have included a discussion on representation and power, especially pertaining to mothers as artists and their responsibilities towards their own child subjects...|$|R

40|$|Spoofing <b>identities</b> using <b>photographs</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{techniques}} to attack 2 -D face recognition systems. There seems to exist no comparative studies of different techniques using the same protocols and data. The motivation behind this competition is to compare the performance of different state-of-the-art algorithms on the same database using a unique evaluation method. Six different teams from universities around the world have participated in the contest. Use of one or multiple techniques from motion, texture analysis and liveness detection appears to be the common trend in this competition. Most of the algorithms are able to clearly separate spoof attempts from real accesses. The results suggest the investigation of more complex attacks. 1...|$|R

25|$|In part, secrecy {{was also}} {{maintained}} by the way scripts were written.

Once the scripts for episodes six, seven, and eight were finished, they were released all at once—but only to those crew and cast who had a need to know. These three episodes were then shot together. The secrecy campaign did not, however, prevent the cast and crew from trying to guess the murderer's <b>identity.</b> During production, <b>photographs</b> of all the cast members were pasted up in a production trailer, and cast and crew placed bets on who they thought the killer was.|$|R
40|$|We report data {{contrasting}} {{the processing}} of facial <b>identity</b> from static <b>photographs,</b> and facial expression from static and moving images, in two patients with face processing impairments.

The second patient is relatively good at perceiving facial identity, but poor at judging emotional expression from both static and moving faces. The data {{are consistent with the}} existence of separate processes for encoding face identity and facial expression, and, furthermore, indicate the separate encoding of expression from moving and static images...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates visualized {{identities of}} ‘former Yugoslav’ migrant {{women in the}} Netherlands. Ten women with roots in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina or Croatia were asked to depict their identities {{in a series of}} {{photographs}} over the course of one week. Subsequently they were prompted to contextualize their photographs during an individual ‘photo-elicitation’ interview. The author identifies four modes of photographic self-representation by means of a step-wise analysis of the 1175 photographs: archival photos, self-portraits, still lifes and snapshots. The study shows how the four modes are used to visualize different intersecting identities. It appears that conviviality, togetherness, {{is one of the main}} features in their visualized <b>identities.</b> Moreover, the <b>photographs</b> not only mediate the people, events and objects of the migrants’ lived cultures but also elements of the research project in itself...|$|R
50|$|As part of Chapter V, Simon {{worked to}} {{document}} the bloodline of South Korean Choe Jangguen. Choe was an engineer aboard the ship Tongyeong in 1977 when captured amidst a conflict with the North Korean armed forces.

In the footnotes of this chapter Simon photographed a VHS tape of Pulgasari, a film produced by director Shin Sang-ok, later captured by North Korea in order to utilize his film-making talents to improve the film industry in North Korea. The footnotes also include Megumi, a graphic novel about the abduction of Megumi Yokota, as a photograph of Tongyeong Port, where Cheo Jangguen was last seen leaving for a mission, as well as Choe's <b>identity</b> documents and <b>photographs</b> of his ship returning after his abduction by North Korean armed forces.|$|R
40|$|At border control, {{it is the}} personnel’s job to {{identify}} possible passport fraud, in particular to verify whether the photograph in a travel document matches its bearer. However, as various earlier studies suggest, <b>identity</b> verification from <b>photographs</b> or CCTV is far from accurate. The {{aim of this study}} was thus to investigate identity verification at border control. Particularly, we examined the influence of display duration in document verification. Results showed that performance significantly suffered from time restrictions, which stresses the importance of working environments at border control free of time pressure. A second aim was to assess a possible benefit of inversion of the document on identity verification performance, as was suggested by anecdotal evidence from security personnel but clearly contradicts the well known inversion effect in face recognition. Indeed, no such beneficial influence of inversion was found in this study. The results are discussed in terms of application-oriented implications...|$|R
