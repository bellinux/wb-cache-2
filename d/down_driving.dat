60|$|A sudden rush nearly knocked them <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> {{them under}} a gargoyle, whose spout was {{streaming}} with wet, and completed the drenching; {{but there was}} a porch and an open door of a church close behind, and into this Linette dragged her mistress. Dripping, breathless, bruised, she leant against a pillar, not going forward, for others, much more gaily dressed, had taken refuge there, and were chattering away, for little reverence was paid at that date to the sanctity of buildings.|$|E
60|$|Then, panting heavily, Number Forty {{rolled out}} from the station on to the lonely waste, and when, as we jolted over the switches, the lights died out behind, Robertson became intent as he shoved the lever home. For a moment the big drivers whirred on the snow-greased line, then the wheel-treads bit the metals, and the plates {{commenced}} to tremble beneath our feet. Staring out through a quivering glass I could see a white haze rising and falling ahead as the wild gusts came <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> an icy coldness through the vibrating cab, while, when these passed, {{there was only the}} glare of the huge head-lamp flickering like a comet down the straight-ruled track.|$|E
60|$|As I {{write these}} lines I lift {{my eyes and}} look seaward. I am on the beach of Waikiki {{on the island of}} Oahu. Far, in the azure sky, the trade-wind clouds drift low over the blue-green {{turquoise}} of the deep sea. Nearer, the sea is emerald and light olive-green. Then comes the reef, where the water is all slaty purple flecked with red. Still nearer are brighter greens and tans, lying in alternate stripes and showing where sandbeds lie between the living coral banks. Through and over and out of these wonderful colours tumbles and thunders a magnificent surf. As I say, I lift my eyes to all this, and through the white crest of a breaker suddenly appears a dark figure, erect, a man-fish or a sea-god, on the very forward face of the crest where the top falls over and <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> in toward shore, buried to his loins in smoking spray, caught up by the sea and flung landward, bodily, a quarter of a mile. It is a Kanaka on a surf-board. And I know that when I have finished these lines I shall be out in that riot of colour and pounding surf, trying to bit those breakers even as he, and failing as he never failed, but living life as the best of us may live it. And the picture of that coloured sea and that flying sea-god Kanaka becomes another reason for the young man to go west, and farther west, beyond the Baths of Sunset, and still west till he arrives home again.|$|E

60|$|Off {{went the}} five {{thousand}} horsemen, drawn up in a wedge-like form, and I {{must say that}} the general in command handled them very ably. Starting at a hand gallop, {{for the first three}} hundred yards he rode straight {{at the tip of the}} tongue-shaped mass of cavalry which, numbering, so far as I could judge, about eight thousand sabres, was advancing to charge us. Then he suddenly swerved to the right and put on the pace, and I saw the great wedge curl round, and before the foe could check himself and turn to meet it, strike him about halfway down his length, with a crashing rending sound, like that of the breaking-up of vast sheets of ice. In sank the great wedge, into his heart, and as it cut its way hundreds of horsemen were thrown up on either side of it, just as the earth is thrown up by a ploughshare, or more like still, as the foaming water curls over beneath the bows of a rushing ship. In, yet in, vainly does the tongue twist its ends round in agony, like an injured snake, and strive to protect its centre; still farther in, by Heaven! right through, and so, amid cheer after cheer from our watching thousands, back again upon the severed ends, beating them <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> them as a gale drives spray, till at last, amidst the rushing of hundreds of riderless horses, the flashing of swords, and the victorious clamour of their pursuers, the great force crumples up like an empty glove, then turns and gallops pell-mell for safety back to its own lines.|$|E

50|$|The move is {{executed}} from an Argentine backbreaker rack (face up, {{with the}} neck and one leg cradled) position. The wrestler pushes the opponent forward while holding the opponent's leg with one arm, and {{the head with the}} other arm, and then sits <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> the opponent head first down to the floor.|$|E
50|$|Released with version 1.0.8. These {{additions}} {{can be used}} {{in different}} game modes, but are mostly used in races. Fuel is drained based on how long the acceleration key is held <b>down.</b> <b>Driving</b> into a pit stop will fill the car's fuel tank. Damage will slow the car down, hitting objects and other cars will inflict damage. These settings can be customized.|$|E
50|$|The attacking wrestler {{stands behind}} an opponent, {{grabbing}} {{them by their}} head or hair to seemingly perform a standard mat slam. However, as the wrestler pulls the opponent backwards down to the mat, the wrestler kneels <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> the opponent's back into the wrestler's exposed knee. If the wrestler uses the opponent's hair to pull them back onto the wrestler's exposed knee it {{is known as a}} hair pull backbreaker.|$|E

50|$|Another {{variation}} {{sees the}} wrestler perform a vertical suplex, {{but instead of}} twisting the upside down opponent to face them, the wrestler turns 180° to face the opponent before sitting <b>down</b> and <b>driving</b> them back first between their legs.|$|R
50|$|The player {{controls}} {{the position of}} the red motorcycle with the Y-axis of the directional pad, and controls acceleration with the A and B buttons. Using B causes greater acceleration, but also increases the motorcycle's temperature shown as a bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen. When the temperature exceeds safe limits the bar becomes full; the player will be immobilized for several seconds while the bike cools <b>down.</b> <b>Driving</b> over an arrow will immediately reduce the bike's temperature.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler {{stands behind}} an {{opponent}} and applies a cobra clutch on his/her opponent, placing one of his/her {{hands against the}} opponent's neck after hooking the opponent's arm with it. He/she then scoops the opponent's near leg with his/her other arm and lifts the opponent up, flips the opponent upside down, and then either kneels or sits <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> the opponent down to the mat on his/her neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique.|$|E
50|$|The kayaker {{enters and}} sustains a bow stall while {{drifting}} towards a wave or hole. As their boat enters the trough of the feature they pull <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> their boat vertically into the water. As {{they move to}} {{the peak of the}} wave or hole the boat will also be rising from their pull down and they can perform a loop over the feature itself. Timed correctly the kayaker can achieve a higher trajectory loop than in flat water because the feature helps launch the boat.|$|E

On 10 August, with Captain J. M. Mason as his pilot, he destroyed another Pfalz D.III over Brie Bridge, and on 4 September, with Lieutenant D. J. T. Mellor, he gained his sixth and final victory by <b>driving</b> <b>down</b> a Fokker D.VII over Roisel.|$|R
50|$|This move is {{performed}} behind the opponent, the wrestler grabs his/her opponent {{by the hair}} (or by the head in case if wrestler's bald or if performing wrestler is a clean performer) and pulls them back, so the opponent's back lands on the wrestler's knee. Another variation of this move is the wrestler faces the opponent, grabs them by the hair and twists round so the wrestler and opponent are back to back, and then the wrestler pulls the opponent's hair <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> their back into the wrestler's knee.|$|E
5000|$|One day, {{shortly after}} his birthday, Kurt confides to his cousin that he has {{fallen in love with}} Sabine, a customer. She has been working as a nanny but has just {{resigned}} from her job. When she is about to respond to a newspaper employment ad for a nanny, Peter secretly connects her call to Kurt who invites Sabine home for an interview. He is so uptight that he does not realize Sabine wants to work as a nanny until she enquires about his child. Kurt explains that there is in fact a child in the house but it belongs to his cousin Peter. The next day they [...] "borrow" [...] Heinerle, the son of one of Peter's friends. He soon turns the house upside <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> the housekeeper Frau Stadelmeier to despair.|$|E
50|$|Sabu quickly {{attacked}} Tony with chair {{shots and}} two Arabian Skullcrushers, a move {{in which he}} delivered two leg drops with a chair {{to the back of}} Tony's head. After kicking out of the pin attempt, Tony reversed one of Sabu's moves and hit him with the chair. He lifted and slammed Sabu before hooking Sabu's leg and suplexing him onto the chair. Tony then dragged Sabu to the stage and suplexed him. As Sabu crawled back into the ring, Tony performed a diving leg drop to the back of Sabu's neck. He then placed his head between Sabu's legs, lifted him upside down, and sat <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> Sabu's head down to the mat. Tony picked up the pinfall after hitting Sabu with two Meteorites, a move in which he lit his hand on fire and punched Sabu twice.|$|E

50|$|The wrestler {{places the}} {{opponent}} in a front facelock and hooks {{one of the}} opponent's legs with his/her free arm. The wrestler then lifts the opponent upside down or on to his/her shoulders, and then sits <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> the opponent between his/her legs, head and shoulder first. A wrist-clutch variation of this driver exists which sees the wrestler lift the opponent on to his/her shoulders, and while the opponent is on his/her shoulders, he/she uses the hand hooking the opponent's leg to reach upwards and clutch the wrist of the arm opposite the hooked leg. While maintaining the wrist-clutch, they then perform the driver. There is a further variation {{that does not include}} the shoulder lift that sees the wrestler hook the leg and wrist while the opponent is standing in front of him/her, lift the opponent upside down and then fall to the sitout position.|$|E
5000|$|A player piano is a {{modified}} piano that [...] "plays itself". The piano keys move {{according to a}} pattern of holes punched in an unwinding scroll. Unlike a music synthesizer, the instrument actually produces the sound itself, with the keys moving up and <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> hammers that strike the strings. Like its counterpart, a player piano can be played by hand as well. When a scroll is run through the instrument, the movement of its keys produce the illusion that an invisible performer is playing the instrument. Vonnegut uses the player piano as a metaphor to represent how even the most simple of activities, such as teaching oneself {{how to play the}} piano in one's spare time, has been replaced by machines instead of people. Early in the book, Paul Proteus's friend and future member of the Ghost Shirt Society, Ed Finnerty, is shown manually playing a player piano, suggesting the idea of humans reclaiming their animus from the machines.|$|E
5000|$|The Spanish hound is a scenthound with a {{great sense}} of smell; {{characteristically}} it is an old type of European hound with a cold nose style of hunting. It has a distinctively loud, booming howl. Hunters can know the different phases of the hunt by listening to the hound: as it hunts, its voice changes from a loud, long bay to choppy short barks, indicating it has found its quarry. In far northern Spain, they call the short pattern of choppy barks the [...] "latido" [...] or [...] "llatido". In the South, the hound is primarily used in hunting rabbits, similar to the better known Basset Hound. Their favorite traditional method is to let the hare have a head start so the hound can work the trail until it catches up and wears its prey <b>down,</b> <b>driving</b> it into the path of the hunter.This kind of hunting is called [...] "caza de la liebre a la vuelta" [...] (coming back hare hunting).|$|E
5000|$|Ridley then {{served with}} No. 1 Squadron RNAS in {{northern}} France, initially flying a Sopwith Triplane. On 29 April 1917 he gained {{the first of}} his 11 victories, sharing in the <b>driving</b> <b>down</b> of an Albatros D.III with Flight Sub-Lieutenant Herbert Rowley. He had gained a further three victories; <b>driving</b> <b>down</b> Albatros D.Vs on 17 July and 14 August, and a DFW Type C reconnaissance aircraft on 10 September, before being promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 October 1917. His squadron was then re-equipped with the Sopwith Camel, and on 6 December he gained his fifth aerial victory, <b>driving</b> <b>down</b> an Albatros D.V north of Passchendaele, to become an [...] "ace". He went on to destroy enemy observation balloons on 12 March and 8 April 1918.|$|R
