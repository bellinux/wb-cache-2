Mismatches were efficiently repaired in wild-type Escherichia coli transfected with phi X 174 heteroduplexes only when two unmethylated GATC sequences were present in phi X 174 DNA. The requirements for GATC sequences in substrate DNA and for the E. coli MutH function in E. coli mismatch repair can be alleviated {{by the presence of}} a persistent nick (transfection with nicked heteroduplex <b>DNA</b> in <b>ligase</b> temperature-sensitive mutant at 40 degrees C). A persistent nick in the GATC sequence is as effective in stimulating mutL- and mutS-dependent mismatch repair as a nick distant from the GATC sequence and from the mismatch.

40|$|Escherichia coli encodes two <b>DNA</b> ligases, <b>ligase</b> A, {{which is}} {{essential}} under normal laboratory growth conditions, and ligase B, which is not. Here we report potential functions of ligase B. We found that {{across the entire}} Enterobacteriaceae family, ligase B is highly conserved in both amino acid identity and synteny with genes associated with oxidative stress. Deletion of ligB sensitized E. coli to specific DNA damaging agents and antibiotics resulted in a weak mutator phenotype, and decreased biofilm formation. Overexpression of ligB caused a dramatic extension of lag phase that eventually resumed normal growth. The ligase function of ligase B was not required to mediate the extended lag phase, as overexpression of a ligase-deficient ligB mutant also blocked growth. Overexpression of ligB during logarithmic growth caused an immediate block of cell growth and DNA replication, and death of about half of cells. These data support a potential role for ligase B in the base excision repair pathway or the mismatch repair pathway...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian DNA {{polymerase}} μ (pol μ) {{is related}} to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, but its biological role is not yet clear. We show here that after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR), levels of pol μ protein increase. pol μ also forms discrete nuclear foci after IR, and these foci are largely coincident with IR-induced foci of γH 2 AX, a previously characterized marker of sites of DNA double-strand breaks. pol μ is thus part of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. pol μ also associates in cell extracts with the nonhomologous end-joining repair factor Ku and requires both Ku and another end-joining factor, XRCC 4 -ligase IV, to form a stable complex on DNA in vitro. pol μ in turn facilitates both stable recruitment of XRCC 4 -ligase IV to Ku-bound <b>DNA</b> and <b>ligase</b> IV-dependent end joining. In contrast, the related mammalian DNA polymerase β does not form a complex with Ku and XRCC 4 -ligase IV and is less effective than pol μ in facilitating joining mediated by these factors.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of telomerase, telomeres progres-sively shorten with every round of DNA replication, leading to replicative senescence. In telomerase-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{shortest}} telomere triggers the onset of senescence by activating the DNA damage checkpoint and recruit-ing homologous recombination (HR) factors. Yet, the molecular structures that trigger this checkpoint and the mechanisms of repair have remained elusive. By tracking individual telomeres, we show that telomeres are subjected to different path-ways depending on their length. We first demon-strate a progressive accumulation of subtelomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through 50 - 30 resec-tion as telomeres shorten. Thus, exposure of subtelomeric ssDNA could be the signal for cell cycle arrest in senescence. Strikingly, early after loss of telomerase, HR counteracts subtelomeric ssDNA accumulation rather than elongates telomeres. We then asked whether replication repair pathways contribute to this mechanism. We uncovered that Rad 5, a <b>DNA</b> helicase/Ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> of the error-free branch of the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway, associates with native telomeres and cooperates with HR in senescent cells. We propose that DDT acts in a length-independent manner, whereas an HR-based re-pair using the sister chromatid as a template buffers precocious 50 - 30 resection at the shortest telomeres...|$|R

25|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair is a DNA repair mechanism.

Upon the treatment of this invasion complex with Ce(IV) /EDTA at 37 °C and pH 7. 0, both of these single-stranded portions were selectively hydrolyzed at the designated site, resulting in the site-selective two-strand scission of the double-stranded DNA.

25|$|Each Okazaki {{fragment}} is {{preceded by}} an RNA primer, which is {{displaced by the}} procession of the next Okazaki fragment during synthesis. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA hybrids that are created {{by the use of}} RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand, leaving behind a primer:template junction. DNA polymerase α, recognizes these sites and elongates the breaks left by primer removal. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases. At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I, which repairs the nicks that are left between the 3'-OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand.

DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase.</b> Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured.

Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop the concept of "genetic memory", the storage of information into genetic material, through the demonstration of the feasibility and benefits of recording the time-history of one or more environmental state variables into genetic material. First, the amount of information that could be stored into non-coding DNA using a lossy mechanism such as regulated diffusion is determined by developing a mathematical model. Next, a mechanism through which this concept of sensing, recording, and storing information on the nanoscale could be accomplished is proposed. In conjunction with DNA, which is the actual means of storing information, the proposed approach for the realization of genetic memory also uses thermosensitive liposomes as a means of sensing state variables and acting as a valve to transport and release the DNA in response to the appropriate stimuli. Each variant of thermally sensitive liposomes contains a unique DNA sequence that serves as an identifier. Upon release, the <b>DNA</b> encounters <b>ligase,</b> ATP, and other cofactors and binds - preserving a record of the stimulus experienced by the liposomes. Liposomes, through careful design, can be developed to have unique transition temperatures at which the permeability rate of the contents encapsulated by the liposome increases. It is only at or above this transition temperature that a liposome will become porous. Through modeling and experimentation, the feasibility of the liposome/DNA system as a mechanism for information storage is successfully demonstrated. Dissertatio...|$|R

If these overhangs are compatible, repair is usually accurate. NHEJ can also introduce mutations during repair. Loss of damaged nucleotides at the break site can lead to deletions, and joining of nonmatching termini forms insertions or translocations. NHEJ is especially important before the cell has replicated its DNA, {{since there is no}} template available for repair by homologous recombination.

40|$|The DNA that accumulates in the lambda {{infection}} {{restricted to}} the early (circular) stage of replication consists of approximately two-thirds covalently closed circles and one-third relaxed circles bearing a single interruption in either strand of the duplex.

Digestion of the labeled molecules with restriction enzymes and reconstruction experiments in which Hershey circles were generated by annealing of interrupted strands isolated from the relaxed circles support this interpretation. The results indicate that the relaxed circles consist of a population containing one interruption in either of the two strands of the duplex jointly representing the two "nicks" contained in Hershey circles (in which the cohesive ends are annealed).

We sought to determine whether circulating neoplastic DNA results from alterations {{in the balance of}} angiogenesis activators and inhibitors. METHODS: Sixty patients with invasive ovarian carcinomas with somatic TP 53 mutations that had been characterized for circulating neoplastic DNA had carcinoma analyzed for microvessel density using immunohistochemistry with CD 31 and for the expression of VEGF, ANGPT 1, ANGPT 2, PTGS 2, PLAU, THBS 1, CSF 1, PIK 3 CA, HIF 1 A, IL 8, MMP 2, and MMP 9 message by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of each gene was calculated relative to GAPDH expression for each neoplasm. Patient plasma had been tested for circulating neoplastic <b>DNA</b> using a <b>ligase</b> detection reaction. RESULTS: MMP 2 expression was significantly correlated with free plasma neoplastic DNA (P =. 007). Microvessel density was not correlated with plasma neoplastic DNA or BRCA 1 / 2 mutation status. The expression pattern of other angiogenic factors did not correlate with plasma neoplastic DNA but correlated with each other. BRCA 1 / 2 mutated carcinomas had significantly different expression profiles of angiogenesis activators and inhibitors in comparison to sporadic carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: MMP 2 expression is associated with the presence of circulating neoplastic DNA in women with ovarian carcinoma. These data are consistent with the proinvasive properties of MMP 2 and suggest that the presence of circulating neoplastic DNA indicates a more aggressive malignant phenotype.

40|$|PTTG binding factor (PBF) {{has been}} implicated in many cancers, {{including}} thyroid. One of the main treatments for thyroid cancer is ablation using Il 3 l. Previous research has shown PBF can inhibit Il 3 l uptake into the thyroid, which may account for some cancer recurrence. Unpublished data has shown PBF can bind to and inactivate p 53, disrupt DNA repair, induce genetic instability and cause a twofold rise in the E 2 <b>ligase</b> <b>DNA</b> repair protein Rad 6.

The aim of this project {{was to determine if}} PBF binds to and promotes Rad 6 to impair DNA repair using siRNA, transfection, Western blotting and Co-Immunoprecipitation techniques. Results found that knock down of Rad 6 lowered p 53 levels and overexpressed Rad 6 resulted in an abnormal Rad 6 -p 53 co-localisation. Also, as PBF can induce Rad 6, Rad 6 can also induce PBF. In conclusion increased Rad 6 expression resulted in an abnormal, perhaps oncogenic, interaction with p 53, but it is still unknown if PBF binds to Rad 6 inhibiting DNA repair capacity. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide problem which is often asymptomatic in the early stages leading to delayed diagnosis. Unfortunately advanced disease has no cure with treatment being palliative only. Evidence is accumulating that sex hormones can act both as a risk factor and propagate CRC tumour growth. However, current research examining the oestrogen metabolism pathway in CRC has revealed conflicting results. In an attempt to uncover what drives tumour growth the key oestrogen enzymes in both CRC cell lines and human tissue were investigated using LCA 4 S, FACS, RT-PCR, Western Blotting and radiolabelled STS activity assay. Results demonstrated that CRC cell line data are extremely variable. Colo 205 cells had greatest STS activity within CRC cell lines and in contrast to other studies oestradiol had no effect on apoptosis. In human female samples STS activity was increased in cancerous tissue compared to matched normal controls and this activity could be inhibited by STX 64.

In this dissertation, such imaging techniques, along with ensemble fluorescence spectroscopy tools have been used to investigate three systems of nucleic acid enzymes. An engineered biosensor built from a theophylline aptamer and the hammerhead ribozyme (termed an aptazyme) was scrutinized using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and ensemble fluorescence studies. It was found that a catalytically active state is accessed both in the theophylline-bound and, if less frequently, in the ligand-free state. The resultant residual activity (leakage) in the absence of theophylline contributes to the limited dynamic range (< 100 fold) observed for the aptazyme. In addition, slow conformational rearrangements dampen the speed in which the catalytically active conformation is accessed. In contrast, the only known naturally occurring aptazyme uses a chemical cofactor to instantaneously trigger catalysis (with a 100, 000 fold activation range), rather than the slower rearrangement of an inactive into an active structure. To examine the effects of the U-turn of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, recently found to be {{at the heart of the}} ribozyme’s catalytic core, both <b>DNA</b> and RNA <b>ligase</b> mediated methods were evaluated to assemble the ribozyme from chemical synthesized fragments. Upon successful assembly of the ribozyme, preliminary smFRET studies were performed revealing global dynamics and heterogeneity promising to unveil new insight into the functional role of the U-turn. Recently designed nano-robots called Molecular Spiders use nucleic acid enzymes as “fuel” to traverse on a specific two-dimensional landscape. In this thesis, individual Spider movement was surveyed by single fluorescent particle tracking. Two-dimensional Spider movement was followed in real-time, providing evidence for the previously hypothesized model that Spiders move in a self-repellent autonomous (cybernetic) walk. These nano-walkers represent potential drug delivery vehicles with the ability to understand and follow external cues. Overall, the work presented in this dissertation has illuminated the suitability of single particle fluorescence techniques to monitor the functional behavior and heterogeneity of single nucleic-acid based molecules ranging from biosensors and small catalytic ribozymes to novel molecular nano-robots...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy is the {{clinical}} {{application of the}} ionizing radiation to treat cancer. Ionizing radiation causes multiple modes of damage to the DNA damage such as SSBs, DSBs and modified bases such as thymine glycol. These lesions can exist as clusters {{in one or two}} helical turns of DNA. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely toxic to cells because they can lead to genomic rearrangements and even cell death. If base lesions accompany these DSBs, there will be a substantial hindrance for repair. NHEJ is the primary DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells. HRR repairs single strand breaks (SSBs) or Double strand breaks (DSBs), during late S phase and G 2 phase of the cell cycle, by using an undamaged copy of the DNA sequence, and is therefore largely error-free. The NHEJ pathway repairs DSBs without the requirement for sequence homology and can be error-free or error-prone, and is most active during G 1 phase. Thymine glycol (Tg) is the most common oxidation product of thymine. It is produced endogenously as a consequence of aerobic metabolism or via exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation (IR); {{it is one of the}} predominant types of base modifications produced by ionizing radiation. Due to clustering of radiation-induced damages, many DSBs are accompanied by damaged bases such as Tg at or near the DSB ends that may interfere with subsequent gap filling and ligation. The base excision repair pathway plays a major role in removal of thymine glycol from the damaged DNA strand. During NHEJ, after synapsis by Ku and DNAPKcs and processing of the DNA ends, XRCC 4 /Ligase IV complex ligates the <b>DNA.</b> This <b>ligase</b> activity is promoted by the interaction of XLF/XRCC 4 filament with Ligase IV. Linearized plasmids with Tg at the 5 th -Tg 5 positions from the broken end were subjected to a repair assay using XRCC 4 -like factor (XLF) -deficient cell extracts, with or without the addition of XLF and Endonuclease III and/or ddTTP and Klenow fragments. End joining of Tg 5 was compared to plasmid with Tg at third position-Tg 3 in extracts. In addition, the ability of purified NHEJ proteins Ku, DNAPKcs and XRCC 4 /Ligase IV, to repair the Tg 1 (Tg at the end), Tg 2 (Tg at the second position), Tg 3 and Tg 5 in the presence and absence of XLF was assessed. The data indicated that the cell extract could ligate the Tg 5 plasmids only in the presence of XLF. End joining of the Tg 5 was less in comparison to Tg 3 with base excision repair being more active in Tg 5 competing with the joining. Plasmids with Tg were treated with Endonuclease III and ddTTP to test whether the end joining occurred before or after Tg removal. Endonuclease III and ddTTP treatment showed reduced intensity of the joined fragment suggesting that end joining occurred without removal of Tg in some cases. The extracts were not able to fill in the processed end by the BER though it has a 3 ′-OH which was filled in by the treatment with Klenow enzymes derived from E. coli DNA Polymerase I, following removal of extract proteins by proteolysis. When purified proteins were used to treat the plasmids, it is observed that there was increased efficiency of repair with increased distance of the Tg from the end may be due to less distortion of the ends as Tg is away from the end. While Tg 1 and Tg 2 required XLF presence for the repair, Tg 3 and Tg 5 could show a small amount of repair in its absence. XLF enhanced the repair of Tg 3 and Tg 5. While the repair by extract showed no repair in the same substrates without XLF, there was repair by purified proteins without XLF, suggesting there is some competition with the XRCC 4 /Ligase for the DSB by other proteins and XLF is required to overcome this. In conclusion, cell extract was able to ligate the plasmid with Tg located at fifth position from the DSB but with lower efficiency compared to Tg 3 plasmids. The base excision repair pathway is more functional if the modified base is far from the DSB. End joining by the purified proteins was proportional to the thymine glycol position from the DSB end. XLF was mandatory for repair of Tg 1 and Tg 2 by the purified proteins, and not for Tg 3 and Tg 5...|$|R

[...] While human cells utilize both short- and long-patch BER, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was long thought to lack a short-patch pathway {{because it does}} not have homologs of several mammalian short-patch proteins, including pol β, <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III, XRCC1, and the kinase domain of PNKP. [...] The recent discovery that the poly-A polymerase Trf4 possesses 5' dRP lyase activity has challenged this view.|$|E
