5|$|Andros was {{commissioned}} governor of New England in 1686.

Furthermore, he had infuriated Puritans in Boston by promoting the Church of England, which was rejected by many Nonconformist New England colonists.|$|E

On 5 September 2008, the jury acquitted Stuart of the charges causing Beardsley grievous bodily harm.|$|E
5|$|The second {{show was}} widely {{acknowledged}} as {{superior to the}} afternoon performance, although Village Voice reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set {{with a lack of}} respect. Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha's hand drums, Heckman observed, so <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod.|$|E
5|$|This {{alliance}} {{was probably}} a weakly centralized state, with a military organization {{similar to the one}} of the Hellenistic Kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization is a matter of debate, with archaeologists, such as archeologist Kris Lockyear, <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity and only a few region-wide trends. Others, such as historian Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.|$|E
50|$|Aghoris {{base their}} beliefs on two {{principles}} common to broader Shaiva beliefs: that Shiva is perfect (having omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence) and that Shiva {{is responsible for}} everything that occurs - all conditions, causes and effects. Consequently, everything that exists must be perfect and to <b>deny</b> <b>the</b> perfection of anything would be to <b>deny</b> <b>the</b> sacredness of all life in its full manifestation, {{as well as to}} <b>deny</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Being.|$|R

5|$|After Operation Maiglöckchen, the {{division}} shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> Partisans {{access to the}} security zone. Since its arrival in the zone {{the division}} had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's Zeleni kadar (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became more aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating.

For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{subsequent}} loss {{of much of}} Italy to the Lombards, the Byzantines maintained control of the seas around the peninsula. As the Lombards rarely ventured to sea, the Byzantines were able to retain several coastal strips of Italian territory for centuries. The only major naval action of the next 80 years occurred during the Siege of Constantinople by the Sassanid Persians, Avars and Slavs in 626. During that siege, the Slavs' fleet of monoxyla was intercepted by the Byzantine fleet and destroyed, <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> Persian army passage across the Bosporus and eventually forcing the Avars to retreat.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, the General Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent the General Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Virginia Tech regained much of the game's {{momentum}} after wide receiver Justin Harper returned a Kansas punt 84 yards for a touchdown, pulling the Hokies within three points. Tech stopped Kansas's offense on the subsequent possession and drove down the field, seemingly for the tying score. Kansas defender Joe Mortensen rushed through the Virginia Tech line and blocked the kick, <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> Hokies three points and preserving a 17–14 Kansas lead. The two teams traded touchdowns during the fourth quarter, but Virginia Tech was unable to get the go-ahead score it needed. Kansas earned the victory, 24–21, {{in one of the}} highest-rated bowl games of the 2007–2008 bowl season.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{personally}} presided at {{the trial}} of John Lambert in November 1538 for <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> real presence. At the same time, he shared in the drafting of a proclamation giving Anabaptists and Sacramentaries ten days {{to get out of}} the country. In 1539 Parliament passed the Six Articles reaffirming Roman Catholic practices such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy and the importance of confession to a priest and prescribed penalties if anyone denied them.

5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John Birch and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} of eliminating {{one of the few remaining}} Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and Birch, and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's first move was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> Royalist forces' mobility. Birch was unable to press home his advantage however, and over the next few months Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E
5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the elixir of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of yin and yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E
5|$|Later King Shantanu, {{captivated by}} her {{fragrance}} and beauty, {{fell in love}} with Satyavati. She married Shantanu on condition that their children inherit the throne, <b>denying</b> <b>the</b> birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the forest for penance and breathed her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E
