5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon.</b> Since the <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon</b> is 20% more than the liquid gallon, {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 <b>Imperial</b> <b>Gallon)</b> fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in Port Moresby {{for the bulk}} storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon.</b> A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.|$|E

25|$|Several of {{the units}} of liquid volume or {{capacity}} have similar names, but have different volumes – {{and in the case}} of fluid ounces and pints, different relations. In addition the definitions of the imperial and US gallons are based on different concepts – the <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon</b> is defined in terms of the volume occupied by a specified mass of water, while the US gallon is specified in terms of cubic linear measure.|$|E
25|$|The British Weights and Measures Act of 1824 {{repealed}} all existing British {{weights and}} measures legislation, some {{dating back to the}} 1300s, and redefined existing units of measure. In particular, a new standard yard and troy pound were manufactured as the standards for length and weight respectively. A new measure, the <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon,</b> which replaced the many gallons in use, was defined as being the volume of 10pounds of water at 62°F which, after the authorized experiments, was found to be 277.274 cubic inches. The bushel, which like the gallon, had definitions reflecting the various gallons, was defined as 8imperial gallons.|$|E
25|$|Petrol {{is still}} {{sold by the}} <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon</b> in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Myanmar, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The United Arab Emirates Cabinet in 2009 issued the Decree No. (270 / 3) specifying that, from 1 January 2010, the new unit sale price for petrol will be the litre and not the gallon. This {{in line with the}} UAE Cabinet Decision No. 31 of 2006 on the {{national}} system of measurement, which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country.

25|$|When colonies {{attained}} dominion status, {{they also}} attained {{the right to}} control their own systems of weights and measures. Many adopted the imperial system of units with local variations. India and Hong Kong supplemented the imperial system of units with their own indigenous units of measure, parts of Canada and South Africa included land survey units of measure from earlier colonial masters in their systems of measure while many territories used only a subset of the units used in the United Kingdom—in particular the stone, quarter and cental were not catalogued in, amongst others, Australian, Canadian and Indian legislation. Furthermore, Canada aligned her ton with US measures by cataloguing the ton of 2000lb as being legal for trade, but kept the <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{units are}} still used in {{ordinary}} conversation. Today, Canadians typically use {{a mix of}} metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, {{the use of the}} metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening. Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100km and statute miles per <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon,</b> leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity (tons), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).|$|E

Better results were achieved by adding 2.5% mono methyl aniline (M.M.A.) to 100 octane fuel. The new fuel allowed the five-minute boost rating of the Merlin 66 to be raised to +25 {{pounds per square inch}} (272kPa; 2.7atm).

500|$|The {{development}} of special fuel {{was attributed to}} the work of [...] "Rod" [...] Banks, an engineer who specialised in fuels and engine development. After using neat benzole for early ground test runs; a mixture of 11% aviation petrol and 89% benzole, plus 5cubic centimetres (cc) of tetra-ethyl lead per <b>Imperial</b> <b>gallon</b> (4.5L) was tried. This blend of fuel was used to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, and continued to be used until June 1931. It was discovered that adding 10% methanol to this mixture resulted in a 20hp (15kW) increase, with the further advantage of reduced fuel weight– particularly important for aircraft use– due to its lowered specific gravity. For the 1931 airspeed record attempt acetone was added to prevent intermittent misfiring, the composition of this final blend was 30% benzole, 60% methanol, and 10% acetone, plus 4.2cc of tetra-ethyl lead per gallon.|$|E

500|$|Carr Hill by 1820 was {{a modern}} and populous village, {{situated}} on hill, still isolated from Gateshead and Felling. A variety of industries had developed alongside Warburton's pottery and were prospering; a flint glass manufacturer, under {{the management of}} Alexander Elliot, three corn mills- Carr Hill Mill, Felling Windmill and St John's Mill (the latter built after an earlier mill was destroyed by a mysterious fire in 1824)– and a fire brick kiln. There were also three inns and [...] "some neat houses occupied by respectable families". [...] By 1840 Carr Hill Reservoir had been built and, under {{the management of the}} Newcastle Water Company was the major water supplier for residents in Carr Hill, Sheriff Hill and Windy Nook, and freestone quarries, similar to Kells' Quarry in Windy Nook, were producing Newcastle Grindstone of excellent quality. In 1856 a Methodist Chapel was built. [...] During the mid-19th century, the increasing population led to calls for social amenities to be improved; footpaths were a particular concern, although an examination of ordnance survey mapping demonstrates the continued isolation of the village generally. The success of Warburton's pottery resulted in a street being named after him, but the lack of residential development is evident. Carr Hill glassworks and quarries are still clearly marked, along with Swan Pond and a public house, The Free Gardeners Arms. By the mid-19th century Carr Hill Reservoir was {{in the hands of the}} Whittle Dean Water Company, and in 1883 was converted into a 10-million <b>imperial</b> <b>gallon</b> (45 million l; 12 million US gal) open reservoir.|$|E
