40|$|In {{this new}} CEPS Policy Brief, the author, the Director General of <b>DG</b> <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> at the European Commission, explores {{the utility of}} the EU’s newest foreign policy tool, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Describing the ENP as a virtuous circle, Landaburu characterises the policy as one based on shared values and enlightened self-interest. He argues that by {{increasing}} the prosperity, stability and security of the EU’s neighbours and by projecting the EU’s prosperity, stability and security beyond its borders, it increases its own. In other words, “by helping our neighbours, we help ourselves”...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 the European Commission, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Directorate General (DG) Justice, adopted a policy of promoting children's rights, a project that inevitably relied on the support of children's rights organizations. This article examines why the relationship between the Commission and the children's rights networks shifted from consensus to disenssus and how this has impacted on the children's rights agenda. We argue that the relationship with children's rights networks did not follow the normal pattern of Commission–interest group relations. Clientelistic, symbiotic relations were difficult to establish. The disengagement of the key children's rights advocacy organizations from the Commission's agenda intensified the impact of the conflict between DG Justice and <b>DG</b> <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> over the issue and prevented the Commission from accomplishing its goal to become an agenda-setter in this area...|$|E
40|$|Since 1991, the European Commission¿s TACIS {{programme}} {{has been}} an instrument for providing Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) {{for the promotion of}} the economic reform and recovery of ex-Soviet countries. In the field of Nuclear Safety, the program aims at transferring Western safety culture, know how and technology and is facilitating the sharing of experience by the implementation of projects in areas like On Site Assistance, Design Safety, Regulatory Authorities, Safeguards and Waste. More than ¿ 1. 1 billion have been allocated to the Nuclear Safety programmes in the Beneficiary countries Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Kazakhstan since their beginning. The European Commission Directorate General (<b>DG)</b> <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> (DG-RELEX) is responsible for the strategy and the indicative multi-annual programs, the DG Europe Aid Co-operation Office (DG-AIDCO) {{is in charge of the}} annual action programs through which the individual assistance projects are identified and implemented. The DG Joint Research Centre (DG-JRC) is the Technical & Scientific adviser of the above-mentioned EC Directorates. In the field of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) fire safety, TACIS projects include supplies of passive and active fire protection equipment to NPPs under the On-site Assistance Projects, studies under the Design Safety Projects as well as support to Regulatory Bodies. This paper presents an overview of the projects, carried out over a decade. Furthermore, the paper describes the background, objectives and achieved results of a number of representative projects in more detail. It also illustrates some of the difficulties experienced in meeting the needs and expectations of the Beneficiary side respecting at the same time all the legal and financial rules of the TACIS program. Finally, the paper summarizes some lessons learnt as well as issues that remain open. JRC. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|E

40|$|Aid {{effectiveness}} {{is an issue}} for all donors, including the EU as a system of 27 member states plus community organisations. As the European Commission has established itself as an international cooperation agency, it has increasingly been asked for evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} aid, possibly even more so than bilateral donors. Aid has been administered by the European Commission since 1958, yet the European institutions have only had a distinct mandate for development cooperation since the Maastricht Treaty of 1993. Since then – and also in the Lisbon Treaty – development cooperation has been a shared competency of the European Commission and member states. This paper examines European Commission policybut also assesses the system as a whole. Assessing the effects or potential outcomes of reforms requires substantial information. As a result of recent reforms in the European Commission’s aid administration, information about the EU’s aid system is now more readily available, not least due to the publication of the annual report on aid issued by EuropeAid. Other independent sources of information are also available, including Court of Auditor reports, DAC peer reviews and member state institutions’ enquiries. Furthermore, work by researchers on EU cooperation policy has increased. Financing from the EU accounts {{for more than half of}} global Official Development Assistance (ODA), of which one fifth is administered by the European Commission. Looking only at the Commission administered funds, the financing is based on two main sources: (a) funds from the EU budget and (b) funds beyond the EU budget (namely the European Development Fund – EDF). While this distinction has not changed, the structure of the EU’s budget for external actions (including development cooperation) has been modified. It has been simplified and includes four thematic instruments with (a) global coverage and (b) geographic coverage. At the global level, activities also fall under the funding responsibility of the Council (Common Foreign and Security Policy), while at geographic level the EDF persists. The international debate about aid effectiveness focuses on three main types of questions: should aid be scaled up substantially, will partner governments be required to improve their governance first, and what about donor governance (including issues of aid architecture) ? These three strands also shape much of the debate around EU aid. Debates on the EU’s unsatisfactory performance in the past have addressed various aspects of the EU’s aid system. Despite a prioritisation among goals (poverty reduction has been identified as the main aim), there are persistent variations in the interpretation of this objective among member states. The organisational structure has changed and positive efforts have been made with the creation of EuropeAid and a move towards decentralisation to the Commission delegations in partner countries. Other reforms, however, like the geographical split between the Directorate-General on Development (Africa) and <b>DG</b> <b>External</b> <b>Relations</b> (rest of the world) are not yet complete. The Lisbon Treaty will address this issue, but not the remaining split in funding instruments with the European Development Fund (EDF) as a tool for cooperation with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific separated from the general EU budget. However, since 2000, the EU has strengthened its overarching development cooperation strategy via the inclusion of new elements in the Cotonou Agreement and through the opment of the EU Africa Strategy and the European Consensus on Development. With regard to modalities of aid delivery, the EU has been subject to a number of critical assessments. Partly in response to these criticisms, innovative instruments such as budgetary support to partner countries have been created and the Commission now appears to be one of the leaders in international discussions. EU aid is targeting the political level more significantly and has included elements of quality control with regard to managing for results. Yet, within the broader scheme of the Paris Declaration, a first international assessment in 2006 revealed that much remains to be done. Challenges for EU cooperation architecture and management exist in at least four broader areas: First, the EU faces the challenge of increasing partner country orientation as demanded by the Paris Declaration. This includes the creation of an EU external action service, but also some organisational demands that come along with aid instruments like budget support and tronger political engagement at country level. Second, the EU still needs to grapple with how to organise a sensible division of labour in this com lex system in order to reduce double work and transaction costs for partners. The EU Code of Conduct on a division of labour is a promising start at policy formulation level. Implementation, however, will get to the core of some member states’ interests and will consequently be difficult. Thirdly, the EU faces a debate on what share of the budget should be spent on international development. A general budget review will be conducted starting in 2008. And strong lobby interests within the EU are likely to fight against even minor efforts towards reducing costs for the common agricultural policy to support increases in development assistance. If no increases are decided upon, the community-based funding for development will decrease against member state funding – i. e. not acting will result in shifting the aid architecture. And fourthly, pending reforms with the Lisbon treaty in the area of foreign policy will likely have effects on development policy. While the new not-so-called EU foreign minister will coordinate external relations more broadly (including development cooperation) and therefore be a step towards improving coherence, it is unclear whether this step will actually move the EU towards coherence for development. With the Commission having done most of its homework in development policy, attention should turn to systemic issues beyond communitarised development policy. Sorting out the system is a key task that the Commission and EU member states have yet to come to terms with. Some crucial decision will already be taken in 2008 / 09, determining the direction of EU development cooperation for the next decade or so...|$|E

ABSTRACT: This {{dissertation}} work deals with <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> between {{a school and}} its stakeholders and their management. <b>External</b> <b>relations</b> are studied in schools {{at all levels of}} education (ISCED 0 - 6). Pedagogical sciences, management, marketing, psychology and sociology serve as the theoretical basis. The primary theme of the thesis is regional colleges in the Czech Republic, whose <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> are considered an important principle of their development. We deal with major theoretical and political starting points of research into the <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> of regional colleges based on national and international educational policy documents; we take into account the context of changes in higher education systems and colleges in recent decades in our country and the world. The empirical part illustrates the changes in <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> of various types of schools using case studies successively at kindergartens, primary and secondary schools. We focus on an analysis of <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> and their management of regional colleges in the Czech Republic in more detail.

The main finding of this paper shows that an M&A that struggles can affect its <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> negatively. To what degree the <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> will be affected, depends on the change in market structure and the market share of the M&A, how differentiated the products in the industry are, existing substitutes, and if the struggling affects the public or not. Further, this paper finds that the main reasons for SAS Braathens struggle can be traced back to poor communication and the management...|$|R
