2500|$|... 2H-Site-specific Natural Isotope Fractionation-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(2H-SNIF-NMR) {{is a type}} of NMR {{specialized}} in measuring the deuterium concentration of organic molecules at natural abundances. The NMR spectra distinguishes hydrogen atoms in different chemical environments (e.g. The order of carbon that hydrogen binds to, adjacent functional groups, and even geminal positions of methylene groups), making it a powerful tool for position-specific isotope analysis. The chemical shift (in frequency units) of 2H is 6.5 times lower than that of 1H. [...] Thus, it is difficult to resolve 2H peaks. To provide high-enough resolution to separate 2H peaks, high strength magnetic field instruments (~11.4T) are applied. Application of NMR to study hydrogen isotopes of natural products was pioneered by G´erard Martin and his co-workers in the 1980s. For several decades it has been developed and expanded. The D/H NMR measurement is sometimes coupled with IR-MS measurement to create a referential standard. The sensitivity of SNIF-NMR is relatively low, typically requiring ~1nbsp&mmol of samples for each measurement. The precision with respect to isotope ratio is also relatively poor compared with mass spectrometry. Even the state-of-art instruments can only measure D/H ratios with around 50~200‰ error depending on the compound. Therefore, so far technique can only distinguish the large D/H variations in preserved materials. In 2007, Philippe Lesot and his colleagues advanced this technique with a 2-Dimensional NMR using chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) instead of isotropic solvents to dissolve organic molecules. This enables the measurements of quadrupolar doublets for each nonequivalent <b>deuterium</b> <b>atom.</b> Thus reduces peak overlaps and provides more detailed information of hydrogen chemical environment.|$|E

The probability density, which is calculated by including quantum effects, is localized on an aluminum top site in both cases of hydrogen and <b>deuterium</b> <b>atoms</b> of the ground state. In addition, some excited states are distributed between aluminum atoms {{on the surface of the}} nanowire.

The results are compared with previous proton NMR measurements on dihydrides of similar hydrogen contents. The deuteron relaxation rate Γ 1, {{which consists of}} quadrupolar (Γ 1,quad), dipolar (Γ 1,dip), and electronic (Γ 1,e) contributions, is dominated by Γ 1,quad.

Water incorporating a <b>deuterium</b> <b>atom</b> has a mass of 19, over 5% heavier. The energy to vaporise the heavy water molecule is higher than that to vaporize the normal water so isotope fractionation occurs during the process of evaporation.

50|$|Hydrogen-deuterium {{exchange}} (also called H-D or H/D exchange) is {{a chemical}} reaction {{in which a}} covalently bonded hydrogen atom {{is replaced by a}} <b>deuterium</b> <b>atom,</b> or vice versa.

The use of acid, base or metal catalysts, coupled with conditions of increased temperature and pressure, can facilitate the exchange of non-exchangeable hydrogen atoms, so long as the substrate is robust to the conditions and reagents employed.

The most common isotope, , sometimes called protium, {{accounts for more}} than 99.98% of hydrogen in water and consists of only a single proton in its nucleus.

5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that every {{molecule}} of water has 2 hydrogen atoms, so if you consider 3210 (half of 6420) molecules of water and only one of the molecules of the 3210 has one of its two hydrogen atoms with the neutron, this would give you the ratio of 1:6420 of deuterium, but there would only be a ratio of 1:3210 for HDO (which is 312 ppm of HDO water molecules.) Furthermore, the number of molecules per million of D2O (a molecule in which both hydrogen atoms are deuterium) would only be one molecule in about 10 million molecules.
