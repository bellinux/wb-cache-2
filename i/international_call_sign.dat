50|$|As of 19 September 1947 Australia {{adopted the}} ITU <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{protocol}} and recognised amateur radio stations as valid licensees. The ITU issued Australia with the AXA-AXZ, VHA-VNZ and VZA-VZZ blocks.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Army uses {{fixed station}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> which begin with W, such as WAR, used by U.S. Army Headquarters. Fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for the United States Air Force {{stations}} begin with A, such as AIR, used by USAF Headquarters. The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture of}} tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture}} of {{tactical}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N. For example, the carrier USS John F. Kennedy had the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> NJFK for unclassified and navigation communications with other vessels, but uses tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> that vary with its mission. In tactical situations, the Marine Corps utilizes <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> naming conventions similar to the Army's.|$|R

Her <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> is OUCJ.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, the International Radio Conference (Atlantic City, 1947) met {{and refined}} the <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> blocks. Canada was issued with CFA-CKZ, CYA-CZZ, VAA-VGZ, VXA-VYZ, XJA-XOZ and 3BA-3FZ. [...] These came into force 1 January 1949. The 3BA-3FZ block {{eventually}} was reallocated between Mauritius, Equatorial Guinea, Kingdom of Swaziland, Fiji, and Panama.|$|E
50|$|On August 3, 2012 {{following}} an ITU update of the Table of <b>International</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Sign</b> Series, Niue has the entire E6 prefix block and ZK2 became available for AREC use. The issue with Tokelau remains outstanding, with NZART liaising with the RSM, {{who is in}} turn liaising with the ITU. In the interim, AREC are using ZK9 as the callsign prefix in the ZL3 area.|$|E
50|$|Officially Gorch Fock is a Type 441 class {{naval ship}} with the NATO pennant number A60. Her <b>international</b> radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> is DRAX.|$|R
5000|$|In most countries, the {{aircraft}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also known as registration marks) {{are linked to}} the <b>international</b> radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, {{the aircraft}} itself) receive <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian aircraft <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> (see below).|$|R
50|$|KHWB-LD {{signed on}} in May 1982 as W59AS channel 59, a {{satellite}} repeater of the PTL Network via WJAN-TV from Canton, Ohio. W59AS {{was owned by}} Full Gospel Fellowship <b>International.</b> The W59AS <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was unusual for a station in Oregon, as <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> starting with W are usually issued east of the Mississippi River; this was rectified on November 30, 1987, when the station became K59DJ.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{countries}} have specific conventions for classifying call signs by transmitter characteristics and location. The call sign format for {{radio and television}} call signs follows a number of conventions. All call signs begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union. For example, the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: [...] "AAA"-"ALZ", [...] "K", [...] "N", [...] "W". For a complete list, see <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocations.|$|E
50|$|Gerbault soon {{discovered}} that he missed the Pacific islands, and decided to return there. Firecrest was by now well worn, {{so he decided to}} build a new boat, 34 feet long, which he christened Alain Gerbault; launched 4 June 1931 at Sartrouville, the boat had <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> O.Z.Y.U, hence the title of his last book, published posthumously. He sailed again for the South Pacific, and vanished from the public eye, spending years wandering from island to island. He wrote several books about life on the islands, and criticising the modern western way of life.|$|E
5000|$|Today, each {{sea-going ship}} must keep {{on board the}} book or computer's play-disk [...] "List of Ship Stations and Maritime Mobile Service Identity Assignments" [...] of ITU publication, fresh edition, where listed all sea-going ships and their call signs also. This book must be fresh due to renewal (new edition had place every some years). in this book (or disk) mentioned:"Call sign formed from the <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> series in {{accordance}} with Article 19, Section III of the Radio Regulations (RR). The sign = (equal) in this column indicates that {{the name of the}} ship is used to identify the station in radiotelephony." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in the United States are {{identifiers}} {{assigned to}} {{radio and television}} stations. They are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and consist of from 3 to 9 letters and digits, with their composition determined by the station's service category. By <b>international</b> agreement, all <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> starting with the letters K, N and W, as well as AAA-ALZ, are reserved exclusively {{for use in the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|As {{broadcast}} stations became {{commonplace in}} the 1920s, some original three and four-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> were reassigned as the corresponding ships {{were removed from}} U.S. registry. The WSB <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> had been held by two ships (the SS Francis H. Leggett, shipwrecked off Oregon's coast on September 18, 1914, and later the Firwood, a ship destroyed by fire near Peru on December 18, 19195) before being assigned to the Atlanta Journal for use by its presumably unsinkable Atlanta, Georgia broadcast radio station in 1922. Similarly WEZU, the <b>international</b> radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of the ship SS Lash Atlantico, was assigned in 1997 to a broadcast station.6 Additional <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> would be reassigned to coastal stations or moved from marine radio to terrestrial broadcast radio when ships were sold for registration to foreign nations, as the new owners would obtain new, local <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for any existing shipboard radio stations.|$|R
5000|$|Slashed zero is an {{alternate}} glyph for the zero character. Its slash {{does not extend}} outside the ellipse (except in handwriting). It {{is often used to}} distinguish [...] "zero" [...] ("0") from the Latin script letter [...] "O" [...] anywhere that people wish to preempt [...] of the two, particularly in encoding systems, scientific and engineering applications, computer programming (such as software development), and telecommunications. It is also used in Amateur Radio <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> such as XXØXX, XØXXX, and so on in the United States and in other countries. See, also, [...] for information on <b>international</b> amateur radio <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|R
50|$|No call {{signs are}} issued to {{transmitters}} of long-range navigation systems (Decca, Alpha, Omega), or transmitters on frequencies below 10 kHz, because frequencies below 10 kHz {{are not subject}} to international regulations. In addition, in some countries lawful unlicensed low-power personal and broadcast radio signals (Citizen's Band, Part 15 or ISM bands) are permitted; an <b>international</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> is not issued to such stations due to their unlicensed nature. Also, wireless network routers or mobile devices and computers using Wi-Fi are unlicensed and do not have call signs. On some personal radio services, such as Citizen's Band it is considered a matter of etiquette to create one's own call sign, which is called a handle (or trail name). Some wireless networking protocols also allow an SSID or a MAC address to be set as an identifier, but with no guarantee that this label will remain unique.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} and commercial prosperity of Venice in the Later Middle Ages {{was based on}} an extensive network of <b>international</b> agreements, <b>called</b> pacta, <b>signed</b> with the Mediterranean partners in order to maintain free and safe traffic routes and to ensure freedom of movement for its merchants. The pacts formed the basis of ius or mos mercatorum and the international law of that time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} illustrate the Venetian pacts with the eastern Mediterranean, to outline their nature, forms, contents and effectiveness...|$|R
5000|$|GoJet Airlines LLC is {{a company}} {{headquartered}} in Bridgeton, Missouri, United States. Wholly owned by Trans States Holdings, it has 1670 employees. It operates commuter feeder services under the United Express and Delta Connection names. Go Jet Airlines has crew bases at Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport, O'Hare International Airport, Denver International Airport, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Flights are currently operated out of United's hubs at O'Hare International Airport and Denver International Airport, as well as Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport. GoJet's Delta Connection flights currently operate out of Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport , Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Raleigh-Durham <b>International</b> Airport. Its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Lindbergh" [...] is named after aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh, who flew the Spirit of St. Louis solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927, {{the first person to}} do so.|$|R
5000|$|Patrick and Conrad formed Radio Seaway, Inc., {{taking its}} name from the St. Lawrence Seaway, which had opened in 1959 and had made Cleveland an ocean port. The new owners wanted to shed the [...] "WDOG" [...] image and wanted a new callsign that would reflect their {{orientation}} toward community service to the greater Cleveland area. The initial choice was WCLE, as [...] "CLE" [...] was the International Air Transport Association airport code for Cleveland Hopkins <b>International</b> Airport. Those <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> also had a previous history in the market, as they were used on a daytime-only station owned by United Broadcasting, a company organized by The Plain Dealer's parent company, Forest City Publishing, in the 1930s. At the same time, United Broadcasting also owned WHK, which now broadcast on a full-time basis. Due to new regulations enacted that prohibited duopolies in a single market, WCLE was relocated to Akron, Ohio as station WHKK, which today broadcasts as WHLO.|$|R
40|$|Deaf {{people who}} {{form part of}} a Deaf {{community}} communicate using a shared sign language. When meeting people from another language community, they can fall back on a flexible and highly context-dependent form of communication <b>called</b> <b>international</b> <b>sign,</b> in which shared elements from their own sign languages and elements of shared spoken languages are combined with pantomimic elements. Together {{with the fact that}} there are few shared sign languages, this leads to a very different global language situation for deaf people as compared to the situation for spoken languages and hearing people as analyzed in de Swaan (2001). We argue that this very flexibility in communication and the resulting global communication patterns form the core of deaf culture and a key component of the characterization of deaf people as "visual people. ...|$|R
50|$|Amateur radio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are {{allocated}} to amateur radio operators around the world. The <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used to}} legally identify the station or operator, with some countries requiring the station <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to always be used and others allowing the operator <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|Military <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{assigned}} {{as unique}} identifiers to military communications. In wartime, monitoring an adversary's communications {{can be a}} valuable form of intelligence. Consistent <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> can aid in this monitoring, so in wartime, military units often employ tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and sometimes change them at regular intervals. In peacetime, some military stations will use fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the <b>international</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio station}} {{has had the}} WAZX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> since 1993, when it changed from its long-time WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> dates back to 1965 when the station {{switched}} to a Top 40 radio format from an MOR radio format and original <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of WSMA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in South America {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} identifying radio and TV stations. Argentina and Brazil both have broadcast <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> systems. Some stations still broadcast their <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> a few times a day, but this practice is becoming very rare. <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> were first assigned to South American countries in 1913, and the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> blocks were expanded to include amateur radio in 1947.|$|R
50|$|On February 4, 2016, WREJ swapped <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{with its}} sister station, {{assuming}} the WLEE <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WONA on March 15, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The station {{went on the}} air as WSFC-FM on 1964-09-01; in 1968, {{the station}} changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WSEK. On 2005-08-09, the station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WKEQ-FM, on 2005-08-18, the station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WKEQ, and on 2016-06-01 changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to the current WJQQ.|$|R
5000|$|Some aviators use {{the same}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{throughout}} their careers; in other cases an aviator might {{have a series of}} <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> For example, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen was originally given the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Hulk" [...] because of her ability to bench-press 200 pounds. Later, after a television appearance in which she wore detectable makeup, she received the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Revlon", and a 1998 biography was entitled <b>Call</b> <b>Sign</b> Revlon.|$|R
50|$|The station's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{used to be}} CBJ-FM until 1999. At that time, that <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{started to}} be used by its sister station CBJ as it moved from AM to the FM band; that station got the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CBJ-FM, and the old CBJ-FM thus had to change its own <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{held the}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CFXL-FM until June 2008, when it adopted its current <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The former CIQX-FM in Calgary {{took over the}} CFXL-FM <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> a few days later.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly one of {{the rarest}} <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> [...] "Concorde", was once used to {{identify}} British Airways' Concorde aircraft. The intent of this <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was to raise the air traffic control operators' awareness of the unique performance of the aircraft and the special attention it required. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was appended to British Airways' normal radio <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> e.g. [...] "Speedbird-Concorde One". Air France, the only other airline to operate the Concorde commercially, {{did not use the}} [...] "Concorde" [...] <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> at all in normal service; its Concorde flights simply used the standard Airfrans <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|Four-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are the norm. Three-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are only}} {{permitted}} to CBC Radio stations or to commercial stations which {{already had a}} three-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> before the current rules were adopted, and five-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> exclusively identify CBC transmitters (which may be either rebroadcasters or Ici Radio-Canada Télé owned-and-operated stations outside of Quebec).|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{broadcast}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are optional, but are allocated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and {{are unique}} for each broadcast station. Most European and Asian countries {{do not use}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> to identify broadcast stations, but Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan do have <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> systems. Britain has no <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the American sense, but allow broadcast stations {{to choose their own}} trade mark <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> up to six words in length.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in India {{are unique}} {{identifiers}} for telecommunications and broadcasting in India. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology regulates <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> nationally, and the International Telecommunication Union regulates <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> internationally.|$|R
