40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis I is a {{lysosomal}} {{storage disease}} where {{the lack of}} alpha-L-iduronidase leads to lysosomal accumulation of heparan and dermatan sulfates. This storage results in varying degrees of cardiac, skeletal, respiratory, corneal, and neural disease. Few treatments are available to patients with limited results, especially in treatment of cardiac and skeletal complications. We treated neonatal mucopolysaccharidosis I dogs with intravenous recombinant enzyme replacement therapy at the conventional 0. 58 mg/kg or a higher 1. 57 mg/kg weekly dose. Higher dosage led to complete normalization of lysosomal storage in liver, spleen, lung, kidney, synovium and myocardium, as well as normalization of storage in the hard-to-treat mitral valve. There was normalization of all biochemical and <b>functional</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> and striking improvements in clinical and radiographic signs of skeletal disease. In addition to somatic improvements, high and intrathecal enzyme treatment led to decreased secondary storage burden of gangliosides in the cerebral gray matter. Importantly, all animals failed to mount an antibody response to enzyme therapy, consistent with neonatal tolerization. Taken together, these findings using the canine model advocate neonatal testing and early treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I to more completely treat cardiac and skeletal manifestations of human mucopolysaccharidosis I disease...|$|E
40|$|There are {{published}} many {{reports of the}} clinical tests of the autonomic nervous tonus. R. Exner (1948). emphasized that oxygen consumption and pulse rate vary with the correlation under the certain tonic states of the autonomic nervous system, moreover that, his method elucidates the autonomic tonicity from these two correlative values with special regards to in-, or decrease of body weight. As a rule, general sympathicotonia or vagotonia appears seldom in the clinical practice. The unsatisfactoriness of the tests hitherto in use depends upon that sympathico-, or parasympathicotropic hypertonus is rather confined to partial somatic symptoms or to functional states of several organs, {{and that there is}} usually found the intermingled condition of sympathico-, and parasympathicotonia. In order to investigate the clinical significance of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test, author reexamined Exner 2 ̆ 7 s method and observed the influence of several autonomic agents upon the result of his test. Spirometer in the type of Benedict-Roth was used in this experiment as well as Exner 2 ̆ 7 s procedure. For the purpose to estimate oxygen consumption, the basal metabolism was determined with Knipping 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus. And the respiratory curves were analysed. Before the application of the autonomic agents according to Exner 2 ̆ 7 s proposal, the standard form (2 ̆ 2 Grundform 2 ̆ 2) was determined and thereafter studied the effects of the agents upon the patterns classified by Exner, moreover the fluctuation, of Manoiloff-Kroll reaction and of blood sugar and etc. were simultaneously examined. The types of the spirograms registered in 121 cases were devided into three. The 2 ̆ 2 irregular 2 ̆ 2 spirograms can be more frequently seen in patients suffered from essential and juvenile hypertension, hyperthyroidism, lastly <b>functional</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases</b> than in normal health. Fifty cases were classified into the standard forms according to Fxner 2 ̆ 7 s plan. Normal health and essential hypertension predominate in 2 ̆ 2 stenic normal 2 ̆ 2 form, hyperthyroidism in 2 ̆ 2 sympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2, <b>functional</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases</b> and hysteria in 2 ̆ 2 asthenic 2 ̆ 2, while 2 ̆ 2 parasympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2 is dominantly observed in various incretoric disorders, except for the 2 ̆ 2 undetermined 2 ̆ 2 form in 5 cases. Some corrections may be necessary as to the relationship pointed out by Exner between pulse rate and oxygen consumption; the reason can be explained as follows. (a) Normal pattern among 50 cases can be found only in one case suffered from pulmonary stenosis companied with palpitation as chief complain. As to pulse rate and basal metabolic value, 2 ̆ 2 sthenic normal 2 ̆ 2 pattern can be observed in 23 cases without tendency to decrease in body weight. So that, to speak strictly, it may not be classified to any group of patterns. (b) The interrelation between pulse and basal metabolic rates is studied on 288 cases. Both values run, in a certain extent, parallel with each other; however such cases are found lesser than those observed by Exner. (c) In organic heart diseases, pulse rates depend upon not only cardiac, but also extracardiac factors, consequently Exner 2 ̆ 7 s method can hardly be applied. (d) From the results of the responses to autonomic agents, it may be safe to say that both pulse and basal metabolic rates change almost indifferently from Exner 2 ̆ 7 s assumption. Responses to autonomic agents do not show a difinite characteristic correlation to the tonicity determined before the examination. (a) Norepinephrine, Priscol 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2, Reserpine (Serpasil 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2) and Deserpidine 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2 alter scarcely the patterns classified by Exner. (b) Atropine and Ansolysen 2 ̆ 2 Dai Nippon Seiyaku 2 ̆ 2 set up 2 ̆ 2 adynamic 2 ̆ 2 pattern accompanied with tachycardia. (c) Epinephrine elicites 2 ̆ 2 sympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2 type. (d) Chlorpromazine does not show a certain mode of response, nearly among a half of cases, but there occurs the slight decrease in basal metabolism. In hyperthyroidism, tachycardia as well as arrhythmia appear by means of this medication. (e) Mode of variation of either Manoiloff-Kroll 2 ̆ 7 s test or blood sugar does not always agree with that of results of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test. So far as the limits above mentioned are considered into the interpretation of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test, his method may be evaluated as one of the indication of the autonomic tonus at the given time-point...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid cardiac single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) /CT imaging allows combined assessment of anatomical and <b>functional</b> aspects of <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease.</b> In {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD), hybrid SPECT/CT imaging allows detection of coronary artery stenosis and myocardial perfusion abnormalities. The clinical value of hybrid imaging has been documented in several subsets of patients. In selected groups of patients, hybrid imaging improves the diagnostic accuracy to detect CAD compared to the single imaging techniques. Additionally, this approach facilitates functional interrogation of coronary stenoses and guidance with regard to revascularization procedures. Moreover, the anatomical information obtained from CT coronary angiography or coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) adds prognostic information over perfusion data from SPECT. The use of cardiac hybrid imaging has been favoured by the dissemination of dedicated hybrid systems {{and the release of}} dedicated image fusion software, which allow simple patient throughput for hybrid SPECT/CT studies.

40|$|AIMS: The {{differentiation}} of embryonic stem (ES) cells into energetically efficient cardiomyocytes contributes to <b>functional</b> <b>cardiac</b> repair and is envisioned to ameliorate progressive degenerative <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases.</b> Advanced cell maturation strategies are therefore {{needed to create}} abundant mature cardiomyocytes. In this study, we tested whether the redox-sensitive heme oxygenase- 1 /carbon monoxide (HO- 1 /CO) system, operating through mitochondrial biogenesis, acts as a mechanism for ES cell differentiation and cardiomyocyte maturation. RESULTS: Manipulation of HO- 1 /CO to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis demonstrates a direct pathway to ES cell differentiation and maturation into beating cardiomyocytes that express adult structural markers. Targeted HO- 1 /CO interventions up- and downregulate specific cardiogenic transcription factors, transcription factor Gata 4, homeobox protein Nkx- 2. 5, heart- and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 1, and MEF 2 C. HO- 1 /CO overexpression increases cardiac gene expression for myosin regulatory light chain 2, atrial isoform, MLC 2 v, ANP, MHC-β, and sarcomere α-actinin and the major mitochondrial fusion regulators, mitofusin 2 and MICOS complex subunit Mic 60. This promotes structural mitochondrial network expansion and maturation, thereby supporting energy provision for beating embryoid bodies. These effects are prevented by silencing HO- 1 and by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenging, while disruption of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial DNA depletion by loss of mitochondrial transcription factor A compromise infrastructure. This leads to failure of cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation and contractile dysfunction. INNOVATION: The capacity to augment cardiomyogenesis via a defined mitochondrial pathway has unique therapeutic potential for targeting ES cell maturation in <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease.</b> CONCLUSION: Our findings establish the HO- 1 /CO system and redox regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as essential factors in ES cell differentiation {{as well as in}} the subsequent maturation of these cells into <b>functional</b> <b>cardiac</b> cells...|$|R

40|$|Age {{comprises}} {{the single most}} important risk factor for <b>cardiac</b> <b>disease</b> development. The incidence and prevalence of <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases,</b> which represents the main cause of death worldwide, will increase even more because of the aging population. A hallmark of aging is that it is accompanied by a gradual derailment of proteostasis (eg, the homeostasis of protein synthesis, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation). Loss of proteostasis is highly relevant to cardiomyocytes, because they are postmitotic cells and therefore not constantly replenished by proliferation. The derailment of proteostasis during aging is thus an important factor that preconditions for the development of age-related <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as atrial fibrillation. In turn, frailty of proteostasis in aging cardiomyocytes is exemplified by its accelerated derailment in multiple <b>cardiac</b> <b>diseases.</b> Here, we review 2 major components of the proteostasis network, the stress-responsive and protein degradation pathways, in healthy and aged cardiomyocytes.

In women with known congenital heart disease, a relationship was found between abnormal uteroplacental Doppler flow patterns and cardiac function before and during pregnancy. Conversely, women without a history of congenital heart disease, but with abnormal uterine artery resistance and pregnancy complications, more often showed global left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (33 %; P= 0. 0001), impaired myocardial relaxation (72 %; P Conclusion There is increasing evidence for an association between pre-existing subclinical cardiac dysfunction, poor placentation (reflected by uteroplacental Doppler flow abnormalities) and poor pregnancy outcome. It may be postulated that pre-existing suboptimal cardiac performance, {{as a result of}} either congenital heart disease or a subclinical latent condition, is one of the common denominators of poor placentation, leading to poor pregnancy outcome.
