5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was <b>dumped,</b> <b>the</b> air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
5|$|While {{under house}} arrest, Bhimsen smuggled {{a letter to}} the Resident Hodgson {{appealing}} him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment, but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshowr was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.|$|E

40|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are alkaline metals commonly occurring in natural environ-ment. In clean groundwater their content usually does {{not exceed the}} value of 100 mg⋅dm- 3 (Na) and 90 mg⋅dm- 3 (K). Leakage waters of unsealed or improperly sealed refuse dumps constitute a potential grave source of water environment contamination. In the initial years of refuse <b>dumping</b> <b>the</b> leakage may contain up to 2, 500 mg⋅dm- 3 of sodium and up to 3, 100 mg⋅dm- 3 of potassium. The leakage from “old ” dumps contains up to 3, 700 mg⋅dm- 3 sodium and up to 1, 580 mg⋅dm- 3 potassium. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to demonstrate the character and the dynamics of the changes in sodium {{and potassium}} concentrations in the leakage waters of <b>the</b> Maœlice Re-fuse <b>Dump</b> in Wrocaw and in the groundwater in the adjacent areas. Since sand-gravel deposits lie in the base of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> and <b>the</b> groundwater level is fairly high, contact oc-curs between the groundwater and <b>the</b> <b>dumped</b> waste as well as contamination transfer. Only part of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> has a sealing and a drainage carrying the leakage to a tank. In the late 1990 s the exploitation of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> was terminated and rehabilitation started with a view to limiting the access of the water to <b>the</b> refuse <b>dump.</b> <b>The</b> paper presented the results of the research covering the period from 1995 to 2007 on sodium and potassium contents in the groundwater coming to <b>the</b> <b>dump,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> leakage and in the groundwater coming out of <b>the</b> <b>dump.</b> <b>The</b> research has shown that both the concentrations and the proportions between sodium and potassium contents in the groundwater coming to <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> stayed within <b>the</b> natural ranges, exceeding them only in 2000 - 2001.

As he had a high clearance rate, Justice Department didn't look at him too closely. Joe's efforts to persuade Rico to change his ways fell on deaf ears and much to Joe's distate, he found himself turning to Rico on occasion for information on underworld figures.

The prosecution also answered the doubts raised by the defence about when on 10 July the body was dumped at the airstrip by suggesting that Einem could have <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> body sometime very late on 10 July or in the early morning of 11 July before going to work for the day.|$|E
