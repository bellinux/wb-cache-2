5|$|The Reed & Smith group (which {{acquired}} New Taplow Mill in 1950) {{became one}} of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A <b>Fourdrinier</b> machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and boards. It is now owned by Asia File Corporation.|$|E

25|$|A {{machine for}} making a {{continuous}} sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for Saint-Léger Didot family in France. The paper machine {{is known as a}} <b>Fourdrinier</b> after the financiers, brothers Sealy and Henry <b>Fourdrinier,</b> who were stationers in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.|$|E

25|$|In 1803 {{the first}} {{automatic}} papermaking machinery {{was developed in}} Hemel by the <b>Fourdrinier</b> brothers at Frogmore. Paper making expanded in the vicinity in the early 19th century and grew into the huge John Dickinson mills in the 20th.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{paper mill}} {{is divided into}} several sections, roughly {{corresponding}} to the processes involved in making handmade paper. Pulp is refined and mixed in water with other additives to make a pulp slurry. The head-box of the paper machine (<b>Fourdrinier</b> machine) distributes the slurry onto a moving continuous screen, water drains from the slurry (by gravity or under vacuum), the wet paper sheet goes through presses and dries, and finally rolls into large rolls. The outcome often weighs several tons.|$|E
25|$|The first {{illustrations}} {{to accompany}} the text of Paradise Lost {{were added to the}} fourth edition of 1688, with one engraving prefacing each book, of which up to eight of the twelve were by Sir John Baptist Medina, one by Bernard Lens II, and perhaps up to four (including Books I and XII, perhaps the most memorable) by another hand. The engraver was Michael Burghers (not 'Burgesse' as given in the Christ's College website). By 1730 the same images had been re-engraved on a smaller scale by Paul <b>Fourdrinier.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{much of the}} growing American paper {{industry}} was based along the Hudson River {{in and around the}} cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking. To make paper, manufacturers used the <b>Fourdrinier</b> paper machine developed early in the century, which could make continuous paper rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special felts that could both brace paper and help dry it.|$|E
2500|$|Newman {{was born}} on 21 February 1801 in the City of London, the eldest {{of a family of}} three sons and three daughters. His father, John Newman, was a banker with Ramsbottom, Newman and Company in Lombard Street. His mother, Jemima (née <b>Fourdrinier),</b> was descended from a notable family of Huguenot {{refugees}} in England, founded by the engraver, printer and stationer Paul <b>Fourdrinier.</b> [...] Francis William Newman was a younger brother. His eldest sister, Harriet Elizabeth, married Thomas Mozley, also prominent in the Oxford Movement. The family lived in Southampton Street (now Southampton Place) in Bloomsbury and bought a country retreat in Ham, near Richmond, in the early 1800s.|$|E
2500|$|Continuous {{production}} {{is a method}} by which a process operates without interruption for long periods, perhaps even years. [...] Continuous production began with blast furnaces in ancient times and became popular with mechanized processes following {{the invention of the}} <b>Fourdrinier</b> paper machine during the Industrial Revolution, which was the inspiration for continuous rolling. [...] It began being widely used in chemical and petroleum refining industries {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. [...] It was later applied to direct strip casting of steel and other metals.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{papermaking}} {{began in}} the early 19th century in Europe with the development of the <b>Fourdrinier</b> machine. [...] This machine produces a continuous roll of paper rather than individual sheets. These machines are large. [...] Some produce paper 150 meters in length and 10 meters wide. [...] They can produce paper at a rate of 100km/h. In 1844, Canadian Charles Fenerty and German F.G. Keller had invented the machine and associated process to make use of wood pulp in papermaking. This innovation ended the nearly 2,000-year use of pulped rags and start a new era for the production of newsprint and eventually almost all paper was made out of pulped wood.|$|E
2500|$|Paper {{was made}} one sheet {{at a time}} by hand until {{development}} of the <b>Fourdrinier</b> paper machine (c. 1801) which made a continuous sheet. [...] Paper making was severely limited by the supply of cotton and linen rags {{from the time of}} the invention of the printing press until the development of wood pulp (c. 1850s)in response to a shortage of rags. [...] The sulfite process for making wood pulp started operation in Sweden in 1874. Paper made from sulfite pulp had superior strength properties than the previously used ground wood pulp (c. 1840). The kraft (Swedish for strong) pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s. [...] Pulping chemicals are recovered and internally recycled in the kraft process, also saving energy and reducing pollution. [...] Kraft paperboard is the material that the outer layers of corrugated boxes are made of. [...] Until Kraft corrugated boxes were available, packaging consisted of poor quality paper and paperboard boxes along with wood boxes and crates. Corrugated boxes require much less labor to manufacture than wooden boxes and offer good protection to their contents. [...] Shipping containers reduce the need for packaging.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} the son of paper maker and {{stationer}} Henry <b>Fourdrinier</b> and grandson of the engraver Paul <b>Fourdrinier</b> (1698-1758), who were of Huguenot descent. His brother was Henry <b>Fourdrinier,</b> his later partner in business.|$|E
50|$|Paul <b>Fourdrinier</b> is {{mentioned}} as the engraver {{of some of}} the works listed above, and he has been identified with the Paul <b>Fourdrinier</b> who was of the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, married to Susanna Grolleau, and who died in January or February 1758. The couple had at least five children, including a son Henry <b>Fourdrinier,</b> whose daughter, or granddaughter, Jemima <b>Fourdrinier</b> was the mother of Cardinal John Henry Newman. The engravings listed are in all cases inscribed ‘P. Fourdrinier.’ The title-page of Chambers's ‘Civil Architecture’ says that the plates were engraved by ‘Old Rooker, Old <b>Fourdrinier,</b> and others.’ Paul <b>Fourdrinier</b> also founded a stationery business which was carried on by his son and grandsons (Henry and Sealy)) until at least 1811.|$|E
50|$|Paul <b>Fourdrinier</b> (20 December 1698 - 18 February 1758), {{sometimes}} referred to as Peter or Pierre <b>Fourdrinier,</b> was an 18th-century engraver in England.|$|E
50|$|Paul <b>Fourdrinier,</b> {{engraver}} and printseller, {{was born}} on 20 December 1698 in Groningen in the Netherlands, the son of Jacques <b>Fourdrinier</b> and his wife, Jeanne Theroude, Huguenot refugees from Dieppe, Normandy.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1766, {{the son of a}} paper maker and stationer, and {{grandson}} of the engraver Paul <b>Fourdrinier,</b> 1698-1758, elsewhere mistakenly named Pierre <b>Fourdrinier.</b> With his brother, Sealy, he commissioned the development of the <b>Fourdrinier</b> machine, a papermaking machine that could make continuous paper (rolls). A patent was granted on July 24, 1806, for a machine that could make any size of paper, very quickly.|$|E
50|$|The first {{mechanical}} invention {{to revolutionize}} paper making was the <b>fourdrinier</b> machine invented in 1799, in France, by Nicholas Louis Robert and perfected by Henry <b>Fourdrinier</b> and his brother, Sealey. The second was the Keller-Voelter grinders for turning wood into wood pulp.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{machines}} with entire <b>Fourdrinier</b> sections mounted above a traditional <b>Fourdrinier.</b> This allows making multi-layer paper with special characteristics. These are called top Fourdriniers {{and they make}} multi-ply paper or paperboard. Commonly this is used for making a top layer of bleached fibre to go over an unbleached layer.|$|E
50|$|Sealy <b>Fourdrinier</b> (9 October 1773-1847) was an English paper-making entrepreneur.|$|E
50|$|The first paper {{making machine}} was the <b>Fourdrinier</b> machine, built by Sealy and Henry <b>Fourdrinier,</b> stationers in London. In 1800, Matthias Koops, working in London, {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.|$|E
