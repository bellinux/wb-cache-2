In recent years, several router-based <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> have been proposed for anomaly detection. Their effectiveness needs to be assessed.

40|$|Software {{testing is}} {{a process in which}} a {{software}} system's dynamic behaviours are observed and analysed so that the system's properties can be inferred from the information revealed by test executions. While the existing software testing theories might be adequate in describing the testing of sequential systems, they are not capable to describe the testing of concurrent systems that can exhibit different behaviours on the same test case due to non-determinism and concurrency. This paper presents a theory of behaviour observation in software testing. We first introduce and formally define the notion of <b>observation</b> <b>scheme</b> that characterises systematic and consistent methods of behaviour observations and recordings. We propose a set of desirable properties for <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> and study the relationships among the properties. We provide several constructions of <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> that have direct implications in current software testing practice. We then explore the relationships betw [...] ...|$|R

This paper aims {{to illustrate}} how the <b>observation</b> <b>scheme</b> was developed and helped evaluate {{the extent to which the}} teachers’ practitioner knowledge in adapting the communicative approach (CA) develops. The CA, including communicative language teaching (CLT) and task-based language teaching (TBLT), has been strongly promoted by professionals in the area of second language (L 2) teaching and learning. It has also been embraced by national curriculum guidelines in many countries where English is taught as a foreign (EFL) or second language (ESL). However, it is not widely accepted in teachers’ practice. An action research study was set up to help teachers develop and implement a context-sensitive CA in a Taiwanese EFL secondary school. To observe teachers’ knowledge growth in the CA, a systematic <b>observation</b> <b>scheme</b> was developed. This was done by firstly clarifying what CA, CLT, and TBLT mean, then identifying the key principles which are informed by theories related to L 2 learning and cognitive psychology, and finally, comparing the criteria with common cited <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> and giving consideration to contextual factors. The scheme was applied to observe three volunteer teachers once a month and trace their knowledge growth for five months. The scheme effectively captured insights into this growth. It is believed that this framework can also be applied to other settings where a gap exists between the governments’ expectation and the classroom reality...|$|R

The project, which was launched in November 2005 and is ongoing, involved on site observation of oral examiners as a means of evaluating and monitoring the KPG oral exams for English; the project aimed at gathering information about, inter alia, the conditions of the oral exam administration, examiner discourse practices, examiner efficiency and conduct. The project involved the design of structured <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> used by trained observers during each exam administration (from November 2005 to May 2008). The <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> (the categories of which were refined after each exam administration based on the analysis of results) focused mainly on the discourse practices of examiners who assume the role of interlocutor in the KPG oral exams. More specifically, specific observation categories were gradually developed focusing on the changes examiners/interlocutors made to task rubrics and their interventions to candidates’ language output. The <b>observation</b> <b>scheme</b> findings have provided a wealth of data concerning the frequency and nature of examiner interventions and have contributed significantly to the refinement and development of the KPG oral examiner training programme...|$|R

The proposed method {{is based on a}} graph-theoretic approach and assumes only the knowledge of the system's structure. More precisely, we express, in simple graphic terms, necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong observability of a state or an input component. These results are then directly applied to study the observability of a distributed system in some different configurations. In fact, we define two configurations called decentralized interconnected <b>observation</b> <b>scheme</b> and decentralized autonomous <b>observation</b> <b>scheme,</b> for which we check whether or not any given part of the states or the inputs of a considered subsystem is strongly observable.

We consider a bivariate model with asynchronous <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> and correlated Brownian motions. The {{goal is to}} find a good estimator for the quadratic covariation of the two Itô processes that paves the way for statistical inference. It is proved that a closely related sequence of statistical experiments is locally asymptotically normal (LAN) in the Le Cam sense. By virtue of this property optimal convergence rates and efficiency bounds for asymptotic variances of estimators can be concluded. The proposed nonparametric estimator is founded on a combination of two modern estimation methods devoted to an additive observation noise {{on the one hand and}} asynchronous <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> on the other hand. Both are motivated and introduced at first to provide the grounding on that the combined estimator for the general model can be constructed. With the inflow of the theory by Hayashi an...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we further {{develop the}} approach, {{originating}} in [13], to " computation-friendly " hypothesis testing via Convex Programming. Most {{of the existing}} results on hypothesis testing aim to quantify in a closed analytic form separation between sets of distributions allowing for reliable decision in precisely stated observation models. In contrast to this descriptive (and highly instructive) traditional framework, the approach we promote here can be qualified as operational – the testing routines and their risks are yielded by an efficient computation. All we know in advance is that, under favorable circumstances, specified in [13], the risk of such test, whether high or low, is provably near-optimal under the circumstances. As a compensation {{for the lack of}} " explanatory power, " this approach is applicable to a much wider family of <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> and hypotheses to be tested than those where " closed form descriptive analysis " is possible. In the present paper our primary emphasis is on computation: we make a step further in extending the principal tool developed in [13] – testing routines based on affine detectors – to a large variety of testing problems. The price of this development is the loss of blanket near-optimality of the proposed procedures (though it is still preserved in the <b>observation</b> <b>schemes</b> studied in [13], which now become particular cases of the general setting considered here) ...|$|R
