500|$|However, when McDonald {{reassembled}} {{the band}} for a last-minute scheduling at the Woodstock Festival, another personnel change {{resulted in the}} group's final lineup, which included recruits Mark Kapner on keyboards, Doug Metzner on bass, and Greg Dewey on drums. Among the festival's most memorable moments was McDonald's unexpected solo performance on August 16, 1969, which included [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] as a finale. The audience receptively responded by chanting along with McDonald. McDonald's rendition of [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] propelled the song into the mainstream culture in the U.S., and was featured on the Woodstock film, which was released on March 26, 1970. Radio stations regularly played both versions of the cheer, though the opposition to [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] limited its exposure to underground stations. In December 1969, McDonald began his own career outside the band, releasing cover versions of Guthrie-penned songs on Thinking of Woody Guthrie, and country standards on Tonight I'm Singing <b>Just</b> <b>For</b> <b>You.</b> All the while, the group looked {{to capitalize on the}} momentum from Woodstock and their appearance in the film, Zachariah, by releasing their fifth album, CJ Fish, in May 1970. The album was a moderate success, reaching number 111 nationally. However the band members lacked the motivation for touring and recording, which led to their disbandment in mid-1970.|$|E

Gladys Knight recorded {{the theme song}} for the James Bond film, Licence to Kill in 1989, which became a top ten single in the UK. Two years later, she released her 1991 album, Good Woman, which included the top five R hit, [...] "Men", and Grammy-nominated duet version of [...] "Superwoman", recorded with Dionne Warwick and Patti LaBelle. A 1994 album, <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>You,</b> featured the hits [...] "I Don't Wanna Know" [...] and her cover of Boyz II Men's [...] "End of the Road", and went gold. Knight still records and performs today. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she sometimes leads the Saints Unified Voices choir.|$|E
