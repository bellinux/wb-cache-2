5|$|In {{response}} to Yusuf Pasha's request, the Ottoman government sent its instructions to Rhodes, where {{they arrived at}} the end of April. The government would set up an official investigatory commission before which representatives of the Jewish and Greek communities were ordered to present their evidence. In mid-May, the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners. On May 21, they were ceremoniously called before the court (shura) and freed under the <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> the elders of the Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|Strategic risk {{posed by}} German {{control of the}} Belgian and {{ultimately}} French coast was considered unacceptable. German <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> post-war behaviour were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian neutrality. However, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) {{in the event of}} war with Germany.|$|E

Phocas, nonetheless, had Narses executed by burning him alive. At about the same time, Dara, an important Byzantine city in Mesopotamia, fell to the Persians. Khosrau was encouraged to cease simply raiding the Byzantine provinces, instead attempting to conquer them. In 607, he launched concurrent invasions on Mesopotamia and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} French civil law and Chadian {{customary}} law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Council, have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court {{is made up of}} a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, {{although}} the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} groundwork for the {{incorporation}} of many of the <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E

Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography {{on the basis of}} the Charter's <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, Blair {{resigned}} {{as the leader}} of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown, previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded him following the 2007 Labour Party conference. Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank, Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US subprime mortgage crisis the previous year, and a private buyer of the bank could not be found.|$|E
5|$|In May 1569, Elizabeth {{attempted}} {{to mediate the}} restoration of Mary in return for <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> the Protestant religion, but a convention held at Perth rejected the deal overwhelmingly. Norfolk continued to scheme for a marriage with Mary, and Elizabeth imprisoned him in the Tower of London between October 1569 and August 1570. Early in the following year, Moray was assassinated. Moray's death coincided with a rebellion in the North of England, led by Catholic earls, which persuaded Elizabeth that Mary was a threat. English troops intervened in the Scottish civil war, consolidating {{the power of the}} anti-Marian forces. Elizabeth's principal secretaries Sir Francis Walsingham and William Cecil, Lord Burghley, watched Mary carefully with the aid of spies placed in Mary's household.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{remained}} {{confined in}} a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios {{in the capital}} and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not clear, she was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations. Staurakios too {{seems to have been}} recalled and, along with Irene, again took {{an active role in the}} governance of the state. This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E

The latter admonished Qasim for his betrayal of Muhammad Ali, to which Qasim responded with an apology and an explanation that his hand was forced. By the end of the meeting, the two reconciled and Ibrahim reappointed Qasim as mutassalim of both Nablus and Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851 {{gave all}} of the Wahpeton and Sisseton Sioux (upper Sioux) lands west of the Mississippi River to the U.S. government. The Treaty of Mendota that same year ceded the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute Sioux (lower Sioux) lands in {{southern}} Minnesota, requiring relocation to an area near modern Morton. Both treaties, however, were amended to during the ratification process to eliminate the explicit <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> lands retained by the tribes. Additionally much of the promised payments were never delivered in part ostensibly because of debts owed by the Sioux to the fur traders.|$|E
5|$|The {{face to face}} meeting {{lasted about}} three hours. Hitler demanded the {{annexation}} of the Sudetenland, and through questioning him, Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities. After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved. Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations—principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks. The French agreed to the requirements. Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed, causing the Czechoslovak government to fall.|$|E

By a 4-3 split decision, the Supreme Court of Canada held that s. 13(1) was constitutional.

The treaty represented a major victory for Washington administration, and placated many of the critics of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, by making the frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. The region that Spain relinquished its claim to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E
5|$|Upon Umar's {{arrival in}} Jerusalem, a pact known as The Umariyya Covenant was composed.

For the first time, after almost 500 years of oppressive Roman rule, Jews were once again allowed to live and worship inside Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E
