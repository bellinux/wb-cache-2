40|$|Abstract. The Contaminant Exposure and Effects-Terrestrial Vertebrates (CEE-TV) {{database}} {{was developed}} to conduct simple searches for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information,</b> examine exposure trends, and identify significant data gaps. The CEE-TV database contains 16, 696 data records on free-ranging amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals residing in estuarine and coastal habitats of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Great Lakes. Information in the database was derived from over 1800 source documents, rep-resenting 483 unique species (about 252, 000 individuals), with sample collection dates spanning from 1884 to 2003. The majority of the records contain exposure data (generally con-taminant concentrations) on a limited number (n = 209) of chlorinated and brominated compounds, cholinesterase-inhib-iting pesticides, economic poisons, metals, and petroleu...|$|E
40|$|Effect {{assessment}} is usually based on responses obtained from standard tests, in which organisms are well fed {{and in an}} optimal population density. For a more thorough assessment of <b>ecotoxicological</b> risk, <b>information</b> is needed for chemical effects in systems that closer reflect the potential exposure in the field systems. Responses measured in standard density experiments do not fully reflect the field scenario, where populations' size fluctuate with environmental conditions, leading to very low organism number in certain season/conditions and high number in others. In the present study, the possible interaction between density and Cu-pollution was investigated in regard to population growth, using Enchytraeus crypticus, and for individual juvenile growth, using Eisenia fetida. The standardized ISO and OECD guidelines for enchytraeids and earthworms were adapted to test four densities and four Cu concentrations. The final population number {{was used to assess}} the effects and possible interaction between densities and Cu toxicity for population responses and the increase in individual organism wet weight was used as growth response. The study showed that although initial density itself had tremendous impact on population and individual growth, organisms under different densities had the same sensitivity to Cu.

40|$|Benthic macroinvertebrates are {{important}} components of aquatic river ecosystems. These organisms {{are often used}} for biological monitoring since they are good indicators of the aquatic freshwater environment health status which can be negatively affected by human, agricultural and industrial activities. Many studies focused {{on the use of}} observed changes in macroinvertebrate communities or populations, but studies using biochemical biomarkers in these species are almost absent. The aim of this paper was to test the employment of ecotoxicological biomarkers in Ephemeroptera larvae to assess the water quality of the Alcantara river (Sicily) from its headwater to its mouth. This river represents the main source of potable water for all the counties situated in the Alcantara valley and for the city of Messina, and is the primary irrigation source for the large surrounding agricultural lands. Acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and Benzo(a) pyrene monooxygenase (BPMO) activity were evaluated in Serratella ignita (Ephemerellidae) larvae from different sampling sites along the river to show the potential presence of xenobiotic substances. Environmental parameters, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity and flow velocity, were also measured at different sampling sites. The biomarker approach in invertebrates represents an early warning signal of <b>ecotoxicological</b> alterations, providing <b>information</b> on which contaminants exert toxic effects on different biota. The results showed that the highest inhibition of AChE activity in S. ignita larvae was in Randazzo and Castiglione di Sicilia villages (i. e. high and medium level of the river). Here, agricultural activities are intense, with high production of fruit, olives, citrus and the heaviest usage of fertilizers, pesticides, and neurotoxic substances like organophosphate insecticides and carbammates in all the Alcantara valley. Regarding BPMO activity, the highest value was recovered in S. ignita larvae from the river mouth, which was characterised by the highest entry of water run off of streets and loaded with xenobiotic lipophilic compounds. Both AChE and BPMO were not linked to water temperature values. The data reported in the present work represent the first attempt to monitor levels of two widely recognised enzymatic biomarkers in benthic macroinvertebrates. Results indicate the possible use of this approach in macroinvertebrate larvae to study the health status of Alcantara river. The river appears to be impacted by contamination mainly from waste discharges and, upstream, from large pasture areas. Considering the world-wide distribution of S. ignita, the biomarker approach used to assess water quality may be applicable not only to Alcantara river, but also to other lotic ecosystems...|$|R

In the present report it was studied whether the available (ecotoxicologically based) integrated environmental standards would already provide an acceptable level of protection for humans. It appeared that {{for many of the}} investigated substances this was not the case. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate both human- and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> in these standards. Moreover,it appeared obligatory to take several routes of exposure into account.

Digestate and fugate {{are believed to be}} good fertilizers. However, there is often a tradeoff between other environmental impacts linked to agricultural production like eutrophication or ecotoxicity. Only limited <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> is known about the effects of digestate or fugate on terrestrial fauna and flora. This is the first study comparing the survival and reproduction of collembolans as the representative soil fauna and the root growth and photosynthetic activity of Sinapis alba and Panicum miliaceum plants when exposed to digestate and fugate. Comparison of ecotoxicological results with chemical analysis of both digestate and fugate has led to the conclusions that application of digestate and fugate was beneficial neither for tested plants, nor for zooedaphon. Under practically used dosing both digestate and fugate can represent potential ecotoxicological problems, which can affect zooedaphon diversity and reproduction resulting in degradation of soil structure, reduction of microbial activity or water retention capacity of treated soils. That is why we do recommend at least simplified ecotoxicological testing of digestate as presented in this study. Ecotoxicity testing can support decision of direct application on soil, or mixing the digestate with other materials (like compost, manure, pond sediments, or biochar), what will help to utilize nutrients and consequently can prevent degradation of soil fertility...|$|E

However, this mostly overlooks the fact that species in the field that may employ variable life-history strategies, which may have consequences concerning the vulnerability of such species to exposure with contaminants. We aimed to highlight the importance of copepods in ecology and to underline the need to include freshwater copepods in ecotoxicology. We carried out a literature search on copepods and Daphnia in ecology and ecotoxicology to compare the recognition given to these two taxa in these respective fields. We also conducted {{a detailed analysis of}} the literature on copepods and their current role in ecotoxicology to characterize the scale and depth of the studies and the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> therein. The literature on the ecology of copepods outweighed that in ecotoxicology when compared with daphnids.

30|$|An {{evaluation}} method that promotes transparency, {{such as the}} CRED {{evaluation method}}, can effectively reduce bias related to expert judgment. However, expert judgment should, and cannot, be excluded from the evaluation process. It is needed because {{the weight of the}} individual evaluation criteria leading to a final reliability and relevance categorization strongly depends on study design, substance tested, and organisms used. Thus, a single criterion may be critical for one study, but not for another. When a study is evaluated, the final categorization should be based on a balanced assessment of its strengths and weaknesses within a specific framework. Thus, the reliability and relevance categorization of a study should never be based on merely counting the number of fulfilled criteria [48, 49]. Systematic evaluation approaches for toxicological studies such as the ToxRTool [9, 23] emphasize this need for expert judgement. Failure to meet a single criterion considered critical for a particular study result may invalidate a study, while this criterion may not be critical for another study with a different substance or test organism. By requiring the reporting of evaluation results for each criterion, the CRED evaluation method provides documented transparency regarding the use of expert judgment in study evaluations. This allows risk assessors to focus their discussions on the specific strengths and weaknesses of a study rather than solely on Klimisch categories. Such improved transparency can guide and facilitate the identification and use of key studies, and ensure that all relevant and reliable <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> is included in future hazard and risk assessment.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> {{for most}} {{contaminants}} {{is limited to}} a small number of taxa, and these are generally restricted to comparatively hardy organisms that are readily extractable from test media and easily identifiable. Advances in DNA sequencing can now provide a comprehensive view of benthic invertebrate diversity. The authors applied 454 pyrosequencing to examine the responses of benthic communities in microcosms exposed to sediments with elevated concentrations of triclosan, the endpoint being eukaryl communities that have successfully vertically migrated through the manipulated sediments. The biological communities associated with the 3 treatments (control triclosan, low triclosan [14 mg/kg], and high triclosan [180 mg/kg]) clustered into 3 groups: control/low (n= 6 controls and 4 low), moderate (n= 2 low), and high (n= 5 high). One sample was discarded as an outlier. The most pronounced change as a response to triclosan was the loss of number of metazoan operational taxonomic units (OTUs), indicative of the control/low and moderate groups, with this being most evident in the range of taxa associated with the classes Chromadorea and Bivalvia and the phylum Kinorhyncha. The authors also describe a range of other taxa that aided discrimination between the groups; compare findings with traditionally obtained meio- and macrofaunal communities obtained from the same experiment; and illustrate some of the advantages and limitations associated with both the molecular and traditional approaches.

40|$|International audienceSince REACh applies {{in all of}} EU, special {{emphasis}} {{has been put on}} the reduction of systematic ecotoxicity testing. In this context, it is important to extract a maximum of information from existing ecotoxicity databases in order to propose alternative methods aimed at replacing and reducing experimental testing. Consequently, we analyzed a database of new chemicals registered in France and Europe during the last twenty years reporting aquatic ecotoxicity data with respect to three trophic levels (i. e., Algae EC 50 72 h, Daphnia EC 50 48 h and Fish LC 50 96 h). In order to ensure the relevance of the comparison between these three experimental tests, we performed a stringent data selection based on the pertinence and quality of available <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information.</b> At the end of this selection, less than 5 % of the initial number of chemicals was retained for subsequent analysis. Such an analysis showed that fish was the least sensitive trophic level, whereas Daphnia had the highest sensitivity. Moreover, thanks to an analysis of the relative sensitivity of trophic levels, it was possible to establish that respective correction factors of 50 and 10 would be necessary if only one or two test values were available. From a physicochemical point of view, it was possible to characterize two significant correlations relating the sensitivity of the aforementioned trophic levels with the chemical structure of the retained substances. This analysis showed that algae displayed a higher sensitivity towards chemicals containing acid fragments whereas fish presented a higher sensitivity towards chemicals containing aromatic ether fragments. Overall, our work suggests that statistical analysis of historical data combined with data yielded by the REACh regulation should permit the derivation of robust safety factors, testing strategies and mathematical models. These alternative methods, in turn, could allow a replacement and reduction of ecotoxicological testing...|$|E

The <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> is presented for only those endpoints {{for which the}} chemicals are COPECs. The CR/PC OU is located in Anderson and Roane Counties, Tennessee and consists of the Clinch River and several of its embayments in Melton Hill and Watts Bar Reservoirs. These waters have received hazardous substances released {{over a period of}} 50 years from the US Department of Energy`s Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), a National Priority List site established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. A remedial investigation has been conducted to determine the current nature and extent of any contamination and to assess the resulting risk to human health and the environment. The feasibility study evaluates remedial action alternatives to identify any that are feasible for implementation and that would effectively reduce risk. Historical studies had indicated that current problems would likely include {sup 137 }Cs in sediment of the Clinch River, mercury in sediment and fish of Poplar Creek and PCBs and pesticides in fish from throughout the OU. Peak releases of mercury and {sup 137 }Cs occurred over 35 years ago, and current releases are low. Past releases of PCBs from the ORR are poorly quantified, and current releases are difficult to quantify because levels are so low. The site characterization focused on contaminants in surface water, sediment, and biota. Contaminants in surface water were all found to be below Ambient Water Quality Criteria. Other findings included the following: elevated metals including cesium 137 and mercury in McCoy Branch sediments; PCBs and chlordane elevated in several fish species, presenting the only major human health risk, significant ecological risks in Poplar Creek but not in the Clinch River...|$|E

This {{study was conducted}} in the Ervedosa mine area (Bragança, Portugal), where both underground and open pit exploration of tin and arsenic minerals were performed for about one century (1857 - 1969). We aimed at obtaining <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> with terrestrial and aquatic plant species to integrate in the {{risk assessment}} of this mine area. Further we also intended to evaluate if the assessment of other parameters, in standard assays with terrestrial plants, can improve the identification of phytotoxic soils. For this purpose, soil samples were collected on 16 sampling sites distributed along four transects, defined within the mine area, and in one reference site. General soil physical and chemical parameters, total and extractable metal contents were analyzed. Assays were performed for soil elutriates and for the whole soil matrix following standard guidelines for growth inhibition assay with Lemna minor and emergence and seedling growth assay with Zea mays. At the end of the Z. mays assay, relative water content, membrane permeability, leaf area, content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), malondialdehyde levels, proline content, and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm and ΦPSII) parameters were evaluated. In general, the soils near the exploration area revealed high levels of Al, Mn, Fe and Cu. Almost all the soils from transepts C, D and F presented total concentrations of arsenic well above soils screening benchmark values available. Elutriates of several soils from sampling sites near the exploration and ore treatment areas were toxic to L. minor, suggesting that the retention function of these soils was seriously compromised. In Z. mays assay, plant performance parameters (other than those recommended by standard protocols), allowed the identification of more phytotoxic soils.

In this aim, growth parameters of L. minor, gluthathione S-transferase (GSTs), catalase (CAT),ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and/or gene expressions (pi-gst, cat, cytochrome P 450 4 (cyp 4), multidrug resistant 1 (mdr 1), and superoxide dismutase (sod)) were measured. GST activities increased significantly in L. minor exposed to DC 3, but no changes were found in CAT activity. In C. fluminea, EROD activity was induced significantly in both gill and digestive gland tissues after 3 days’ exposure to DC 3, while a GST increase was observed only in digestive gland tissues, suggesting that these pharmaceuticals induced an oxidative effect. Gene expression analysis revealed transient transcriptomic responses of cyp 4, sod, and mdr 1 under drug concentrations 2 or 3 and no change of expression for the other genes (cat and pi-gst) or condition (environmental drug concentration) tested.

40|$|Today, human risk {{assessment}} (HRA) and environmental {{risk assessment}} (ERA) are typically separated. There {{is a lack of}} mutual understanding between experts and data from toxicological and ecotoxicological studies are not readily accessible by risk assessors of the two disciplines. The need for RA will continue to increase (e. g. REACH or toxicity of mixtures) along with budget restrictions and political and public pressure {{to reduce the number of}} animal tests. Therefore more cost effective, predictive and rapid tests for high quality sustainable RA are needed, including a better exploitation of existing data. The HEROIC project - a coordination action of the 7 th FP - will provide a platform for networking among all the relevant stakeholders in the RA value chain and will provide them with the most relevant background information to contribute to the development of harmonised approaches which meet the challenges of RA. The project will enable the improvement and harmonisation of tools and methods in RA, by exploring how data generated in ecotoxicology and human toxicology can be applied across disciplines for integrated RA, and develop a framework for integrated methodologies and approaches for RA. This will increase transparency in RA and allow better risk communication to maintain public trust and to give unambiguous guidance for improved risk management.

40|$|In this study, the {{availability}} of physico-chemical and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> on 78 transformation products for 20 regularly used pesticides in the open literature is evaluated. Based on this information, it is attempted to predict the relative risk for the aquatic environment of each transformation product in comparison to its parent pesticide. It is concluded that for the 78 transformation products selected, the data set on physico-chemical and ecotoxicological behaviour is not very large. Measured log K(ow) values and other physico-chemical properties are known for only 30 - 40 % of the selected transformation products. The overall reliability of the collected physico-chemical values {{is considered to be}} moderate to slight, while for the ecotoxicological data set, reliability is considered to be sufficient. In many cases, {{there is a need for}} more information especially on the persistency and no-observed-effect concentrations of the pesticide's transformation products. In general, over 50 % of the transformation products of triazines, carbamates and phenoxypropionic acids pose, in theory, a similar to higher risk than their parent pesticide, while over 50 % of the transformation products of synthetic pyrethroids, organophosporous pesticides and dithiocarbamates probably pose less risk. High risk was expected for products with high accumulation or persistency in sediment and/or high toxicity together with considerable bioaccumulation (potential) or relatively high concentrations or persistency in water. A generalization of the joint features that caused an increased risk for ecosystems could not be made for most pesticide classes. Exceptions are the synthetic pyrethroids, for which transformation products with a similar or even higher log K(ow) than the parent pesticide caused an increased potential risk, while for the carbamates the presence of the carbamate group in the transformation product was the joint characteristic of chemicals with predicted increased risk. For three transformation products, monitoring data based on concentrations measured in surface water in The Netherlands were compared with maximum permissible concentrations. This comparison indicated that two of these compounds pose a potential risk of adverse effects in the field situation in Dutch aquatic ecosystems. For all other transformation products, the potential risk in the field situation could not be established because of the absence of monitoring data. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{national}} and international legislation, obligations and commitments aim to promote and maintain a healthy and biologically diverse marine environment from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. In addition, a set of Contributory Marine Objectives (CMOs) {{have been developed to}} meet the Government’s overall vision for clean, safe, healthy, biologically diverse and productive seas. These objectives require sustained and routine observations of oceanic and coastal ecosystems to achieve their goals. This report evaluates the applicability of existing and suggested (where gaps have been highlighted) environmental indicators {{that can be used to}} monitor and assess the state of UK deep-sea habitats. These indicators are reviewed against potential anthropogenic pressures, ecosystem structure and function, as well as statutory obligations and CMOs. The principal anthropogenic pressures that may have an impact on UK deep-sea habitats are identified as demersal fisheries, Oil and gas industry activities, land-based/shipping pollution and climate change. At present, there are no routine UK deep-sea environment monitoring programmes and the only protected area in UK deep water is the Darwin Mounds region. This investigation has identified seventeen potential indicators of impacts that can be mapped to the assessment framework, which will be used to implement an integrated monitoring programme. The review of the anthropogenic pressures with regard to relevant indicators highlighted many gaps in current deep-sea habitat monitoring efforts. Gaps that could currently be covered or addressed by suggested indicators are: • The impact of demersal fishing on UK deep-water habitats. This activity is not routinely monitored and its impact is unknown in the vast majority of UK deep-sea habitats, although it is thought to be the principle threat. (Indicator: photographic transects to measure extent, abundance and diversity of habitats). • No routine monitoring programmes on the sustained impact of oil and gas industry activity on deep-sea habitats are in place, although the industry is required to perform initial environmental impact assessments. (Indicator: community change around drill sites). • The extent and impact of litter/debris (shipping, fishing and land-based) is unknown in the deep sea (Indicator: photographic transects, will show extent but not effects). Anthropogenic pressures that cannot be addressed with current operational indicators may be addressed by indicators that are under development. Other gaps in monitoring effort require more research to improve knowledge of the habitats and the impacts caused by the pressures. Also, monitoring effort should not focus only on ‘charismatic’ species (e. g. corals and sponges). The critical review of the indicators highlighted significant gaps in their accurate implementation: • The extent, abundance and diversity of specific UK deep-sea habitats are poorly understood, or remain unknown. Surveys still recover many species new to science and there is a paucity of knowledge of deep-sea ecological processes. • The UK does not currently monitor bioaccumulation of contaminants of any kind in deep-sea organisms. • There is no <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>information</b> for deep-sea organisms. • Molecular and biochemical indicators are potentially useful in revealing contaminant exposure and the health of species, but such techniques remain under development. The review of the indicators in addressing ecosystem structure and function revealed that while some can be used to address ecosystem structure (e. g., photographic transects to reveal extent of specific habitats, species abundance and diversity), there are presently no indicators available to address the issue of ecosystem function directly. Within the deep sea higher biodiversity appears to support higher rates of ecosystem processes and increased efficiency with which these processes are performed. Anthropogenic effects that negatively affect biodiversity will therefore have a negative impact on ecosystem function. Indicators that monitor biodiversity may therefore act as proxies for monitoring ecosystem function. A review of the current indicators in place suggests that regional and international statutory obligations and CMOs are not being fully addressed or fulfilled, primarily because there are no routine monitoring programmes in UK deep-sea waters. Photographic transects of the seafloor are potentially the most useful for routine monitoring and assessment of the fragile or vulnerable deep-water habitats found in UK waters and will help to address legal obligations. Such habitats include seamounts, carbonate mounds and reefs (notable for the presence of the deep-water coral, Lophelia pertusa), sponge aggregations, octocoral ‘gardens’ and chemosynthetic habitats (cold seeps and pockmarks). However, for monitoring, management and protection programmes to work successfully, we need to increase our knowledge of the location and ecology of these deep-sea habitats in UK waters...|$|E
