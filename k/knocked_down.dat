5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E

40|$|Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) {{regulate}} {{virtually all}} biological processes. PTKs phosphorylate substrates in a sequence-specific manner and relatively short peptide sequences determine selectivity. Here, we developed {{new technology to}} determine PTK activity profiles using peptide arrays. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to investigate signaling in the whole organism, given its wealth of genetic tools, including morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> technology. We used zebrafish embryo lysates to determine PTK activity profiles, thus providing the unique opportunity to directly compare the effect of protein <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> on PTK activity profiles {{on the one hand}} and phenotypic changes on the other. Methodology. We used multiplex arrays of 144 distinct peptides, spotted on a porous substrate, allowing the sample to be pumped up and down, optimizing reaction kinetics. Kinase reactions were performed using complex zebrafish embryo lysates or purified kinases. Peptide phosphorylation was detected by fluorescent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding and the porous chips allowed semi-continuous recording of the signal. We used morpholinos to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> protein expression in the zebrafish embryos and subsequently, we determined the effects on the PTK activity profiles. Results and Conclusion. Reproducible PTK activity profiles were derived from one-day-old zebrafiish embryos. Morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> of the Src family kinases, Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes and distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles. Interestingly, the peptide substrates that were less phosphorylated upon Fyn and Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> were preferential substrates of purified Fyn and Yes. Previously, we demonstrated that Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> phenocopied Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> Interestingly, Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> The control Nacre/Mitfa <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> did not affect the PTK activity profile significantly. Our results indicate that the novel peptide chip technology can be used to unravel kinase signaling pathways in vivo...|$|R

5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when <b>knocked</b> <b>down.</b> A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is <b>knocked</b> <b>down.</b> It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E
