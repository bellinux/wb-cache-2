40|$|Background: A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} describes the performance of dental fear questionnaires in various countries. We describe {{the psychometric properties of}} Greek versions of the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) and the Dental Fear Survey (DFS) in adult Greek patients. Methods: Greek versions of the MDAS and DFS were administered to two samples of adult dental patients. In the first sample, 195 patients attending one of three private practice dental offices in a large city in Greece completed the questionnaires in the waiting room before dental treatment. After treatment, their dentists (who did not know how the patients had answered the questionnaire) rated their anxiety during dental treatment. In the second sample, 41 patients attending a Greek university dental school clinic completed the questionnaire twice at two separate visits, in order to provide test-retest data. Cronbach's alpha was used to compute the <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies,</b> while Spearman's rho was used to compute the testretest reliabilities. Construct validity was assessed by correlating the responses to the MDAS and DFS by Spearman's rho. Spearman's rho was also used to examine the criterion validities, by comparing the questionnaire responses with the dentists' ratings of anxiety. Results: The <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> for the MDAS were 0. 90 and 0. 92 in the two samples; for the DFS, the <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> were 0. 96 in both samples. The test-retest reliabilities were 0. 94 for the MDAS and 0. 95 for the DFS. The correlation between the two questionnaires was 0. 89. The patients' responses to both questionnaires were significantly related to the dentists' ratings of their anxiety during dental treatment (both p values less than 0. 001).

25|$|Honing theory, {{developed}} principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, {{posits that}} creativity arises {{due to the}} self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is {{a way in which}} the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.|$|E

Patients (N = 442) with different skin disorders completed the original item pool. Principal-components analysis suggested a 6 -factor solution that was largely replicated with 2 additional samples of 192 patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and 165 patients with atopic dermatitis. Four of the subscales showed very good <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies,</b> retest reliabilities, and sufficient correlations with expert ratings: Social Anxiety/Avoidance, Itch-Scratch Cycle, Helplessness, and Anxious-Depressive Mood. Two short additional subscales, Impact on Quality of Life and Deficit in Active Coping, showed moderate <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies,</b> but good retest reliabilities. Correlations of the subscales with measures of depression, anxiety, and coping, and meaningful differences between dermatological subgroups support their construct validity.

Consistent with these models, research has demonstrated implicit affective associations with alcohol, using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), that predict unique variance in drinking behavior above explicit cognitions. However, different IAT versions {{have been used to}} measure implicit affective associations with alcohol, and the present study sought to determine which of these IAT variants showed the highest validity and <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies.</b> In total, 4800 participants completed one of six IAT versions via the Internet: a bipolar IAT (i. e., positive vs. negative), a unipolar positive IAT (i. e., positive vs. neutral), or a unipolar negative IAT (i. e., negative vs. neutral) with general positive and negative stimuli or with positive and negative alcohol-related affective states. While the alcohol-related affective bipolar and unipolar positive IAT versions and the general affective bipolar and unipolar positive IAT versions showed comparable <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies,</b> somewhat lower <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> were found for the unipolar negative IAT versions. Further, alcohol-related affective IAT variants were more strongly related to explicit measures than general affective IAT versions. Also, alcohol-related and general affective bipolar and unipolar positive IAT variants were related to drinking behavior, but not unipolar negative IAT variants. Finally, the bipolar alcohol-related affective IAT, the unipolar alcohol-related positive IAT and the unipolar general positive IAT predicted drinking behavior above explicit measures. Overall, the bipolar alcohol-related affective IAT outperformed all other IAT variants with respect to its relationship with explicit measures and drinking behavior...|$|R

Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND).
