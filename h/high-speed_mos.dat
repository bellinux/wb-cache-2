40|$|Abstract-For {{digital system}} designs the {{propagation}} delays {{due to the}} physical interconnect can have a significant, even dominant, impact on performance. Timing analyzers attempt to capture {{the effect of the}} interconnect on the delay with a simplified model, typically an RC tree. For mid-frequency MOS integrated circuits the RC tree methods can predict the delay to within 10 percent of a SPICE simulation and at faster than lOOOx the speed. With continual progress in integrated cir-cuit processing, operating speeds and new technologies are emerging that may require more elaborate interconnect models. Digital bipolar and <b>high-speed</b> <b>MOS</b> integrated systems can require interconnect models which contain coupling capacitors and inductors. In addition, to enable timing verification at the printed circuit hoard level also re-quires general RLC interconnect models. Asymptotic Waveform Eval-uation (AWE) provides a generalized approach to linear RLC circuit response approximations. The RLC interconnect model may contain floating capacitors, grounded resistors, inductors, and even linear con-trolled sources. The transient portion of the response is approximated by matching the initial boundary conditions and the first 2 q- 1 moments of the exact response to a lower order q-pole model. For the case of an RC tree model a first-order AWE approximation reduces to the RC tree methods. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to design}} <b>high-speed</b> power-efficient <b>MOS</b> Current-Mode Logic (MCML) static frequency dividers is proposed. Analytical criteria {{to exploit the}} speed potential of MCML gates are first introduced. Then, an analytical strategy is formulated to progressively reduce the bias currents through the stages without affecting the divider operation speed, thereby reducing the overall power consumption. The proposed design approach is general and independent of the process adopted. Thanks to its simplicity, {{it can be used}} in a pencil-and-paper approach, avoiding a tedious and time-consuming trial-and-error approach based on simulations. Moreover, the analytical approach allows for a deeper understanding on the power-delay trade-off involved in the design. As a design example, a 1 / 8 frequency divider is designed and simulated by using a 0. 18 -um CMOS process...|$|R
40|$|In <b>high-speed</b> applications, <b>MOS</b> current mode logic (MCML) {{is a good}} alternative. Scaling down {{supply voltage}} of the MCML {{circuits}} can achieve low power-delay product (PDP). However, the current almost all MCML circuits are realized with dual-rail scheme, where the NMOS configuration in series limits the minimum supply voltage. In this paper, single-rail MCML (SRMCML) circuits are described, which can avoid the devices configuration in series, since their logic evaluation block can be realized by only using MOS devices in parallel. The relationship between the minimum supply voltage of the SRMCML circuits and the model parameters of MOS transistors is derived, so that the minimum supply voltage can be estimated before circuit designs. An MCML dynamic flop-flop based on SRMCML is also proposed. The optimization algorithm for near-threshold sequential circuits is presented. A near-threshold SRMCML mode- 10 counter based on the optimization algorithm is verified. Scaling down the supply voltage of the SRMCML circuits is also investigated. The power dissipation, delay, and power-delay products of these circuits are carried out. The {{results show that the}} near-threshold SRMCML circuits can obtain low delay and small power-delay product...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} neuromorphic cortical-layer {{processing}} microchip for address event representation (AER) spike-based processing systems. The microchip computes 2 -D convolutions of video information represented in AER format in real time. AER, {{as opposed to}} conventional frame-based video representation, describes visual information as a sequence of events or spikes in a way similar to biological brains. This format allows for fast information identification and processing, without waiting to process complete image frames. The neuromorphic cortical-layer processing microchip {{presented in this paper}} computes convolutions of programmable kernels over the AER visual input information flow. It not only computes convolutions but also allows for a programmable forgetting rate, which in turn allows for a bio-inspired coincidence detection processing. Kernels are programmable and can be of arbitrary shape and arbitrary size of up to 32 32 pixels. The convolution processor operates on a pixel array of size 32 32, but can process an input space of up to 128 128 pixels. Larger pixel arrays can be directly processed by tiling arrays of chips. The chip receives and generates data in AER format, which is asynchronous and digital. However, its internal operation is based on analog low-current circuit techniques. The paper describes the architecture of the chip and circuits used for the pixels, including calibration techniques to overcome mismatch. Extensive experimental results are provided, describing pixel operation and calibration, convolution processing with and without forgetting, and high-speed recognition experiments like discriminating rotating propellers of different shape rotating at speeds of up to 5000 revolutions per second.
