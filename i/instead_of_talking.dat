He appeared in Claude Chabrol's French picture Innocents with Dirty Hands, {{playing the role}} of Louis Wormser, the wealthy alcoholic husband of Romy Schneider's character Julie Wormser. It was poorly received by critics, and Steiger found the director, whom he had admired, a bitter disappointment. He was highly critical of Chabrol's lack of communication and aloofness from the production, and preference for playing chess on set <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> through scenes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times dismissed it as [...] "little more than a soap opera", writing: [...] "The performances are of a piece—uniformly atrocious.

The song was written by Bilal Hajji and Savan Kotecha, along with the song's {{producer}} Nadir [...] "RedOne" [...] Khayat. The song was released as a promotional single {{in anticipation of the}} re-release of Overcome (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why he was letting the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. [...] "The Silence" [...] is an R and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about them.|$|E

The influential editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold, who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to Woman in the Nineteenth Century as [...] "an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female". New York writer Charles Frederick Briggs said that she was [...] "wasting the time of her readers", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not [...] "truly represent the female character". English writer and critic Matthew Arnold scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, [...] "My G–d, what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!"

They noted the song's retro sound, like nostalgic dance music, and felt that the band's decision to move to Tokyo two years ago was reflected in the song. Kenji Sasaki of Skream! felt that the song had a [...] "gentle electronica feel", praising the 1980s-style synths, aggressive sound and [...] "unique poetic sentiment" [...] of Yamaguchi's. He also praised the emotions the song gave him, mixing pain and exhilaration. Tomoki Takahashi of Rockin' On Japan felt the greatest strength of the song was how its lyrical content jarred with its [...] "high-spirited words" [...] and [...] "explosive hybrid beat". He noted that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about the pleasures of the dance floor, Yamaguchi's lyrics were introspective, discussing loneliness, pain and longing.

2500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he {{was drafted}} into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew {{comparisons}} to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in The Times Herald asserted, [...] "Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked are the things that get his pitching compared to Kendrick’s: He isn’t overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins over the last seven seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency." [...] Buchanan also possesses a strong work ethic – <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> to the media or celebrating with teammates after throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out nine, he completed a 45-minute medicine ball workout.

Redfeather was a wise-cracking turkey planning to be voiced by John Candy, and Percy, who was to be voiced by Richard E. Grant, was revised to become mute. Following the death of John Candy in March 1994, co-screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co-wrote for Pocahontas, and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking.</b> Joe Grant stated Redfeather [...] "had comic potential–he thought he was handsome, a lady's man. When we decided he couldn't talk, and, having no hands, he couldn't mime..." [...] Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair-braiding raccoon, in which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors [...] "loved the idea and {{got rid of the}} turkey character." [...] Likewise, according to Sito, Meeko was created because they were [...] "naturally enigmatic, because they have little hands and a little mask over their face like a thief." [...] Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird where [...] "I have hummingbirds all over my backyard, [...] I thought, 'That's a great animal to animate.'" [...] According to the directors, Governor Ratcliffe's pampered pet, Percy, was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went.|$|E

Credo ist: Information statt Infotainment, Gespräch statt Floskeln, Wissensvermittlung anstelle von Talkshowformaten und Dialog statt Konfrontation.
