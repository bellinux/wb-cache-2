While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 <b>kilobits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many <b>kilobits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{processing power}} and screen sizes of mobile devices {{has made it}} desirable to watch multimedia presentations on the go. On such devices the data network bandwidth is usually the limiting factor, which imposes a tradeoff between quality and resolution on the presented content. A new video compression system called High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is currently under development. The vision of HEVC {{is to create a}} compression system that achieves the same quality at half the bit rate compared to the existing H. 264 /AVC standard [2]. The goal of this thesis is to investigate how HEVC performs compared to H. 264 /AVC using mobile platforms and sport content as the scenario. The subjective test was conducted on an Apple iPad. It indicated that HEVC has a clear gain in compression compared to H. 264 /AVC. On average at a resolution of 640 x 368, HEVC achieved a good quality rating at approximately 550 <b>kilobit</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> while H. 264 /AVC did almost reach this quality at 1000 <b>kilobit</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> However, it was shown that subjective quality gain varied over content. The objective measurements showed an overall reduction in bit rate of 32 % forthe luma component. However, the reduction of bit rate was highly variable over content and resolution. A high correlation between the subjective and objective measurements was found, which indicates that it was almost a linear relationship between the reported subjective and objective results. In addition, a proposed deblocking filter was implemented. The filter applies a new filter function of the luma samples and performs line based filtering decision. On average the reduction in bit rate was reported to be 0. 4 %, with a maximum reduction of 0. 8 % for the luma component. The decoding time relative to the second version of the HEVC test model was reported to be 1. 5 % higher. This is most likely due to the line based filtering decision. The general impression of HEVC is that it has the ability to reach the stated vision, and perhaps even surpass, when finalized. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Fast and {{accurate}} generation of worm signatures {{is essential to}} contain zero-day worms at the Internet scale. Recent work has shown that signature generation can be automated by analyzing the repetition of worm substrings (that is, fingerprints) and their address dispersion. However, at the early stage of a worm outbreak, individual edge networks are often short of enough worm exploits for generating accurate signatures. This paper presents both theoretical and experimental results on a collaborative worm signature generation system (WormShield) that employs distributed fingerprint filtering and aggregation over multiple edge networks. By analyzing real-life Internet traces, we discovered that fingerprints in background traffic exhibit a Zipf-like distribution. Due to this property, a distributed fingerprint filtering reduces the amount of aggregation traffic significantly. WormShield monitors utilize a new distributed aggregation tree (DAT) to compute global fingerprint statistics in a scalable and load-balanced fashion. We simulated a spectrum of scanning worms including CodeRed and Slammer by using realistic Internet configurations of about 100, 000 edge networks. On average, 256 collaborative monitors generate the signature of CodeRedI-v 2 135 times faster than using {{the same number of}} isolated monitors. In addition to speed gains, we observed less than 100 false signatures out of 18. 7 -Gbyte Internet traces, yielding a very low false-positive rate. Each monitor only generates about 0. 6 <b>kilobit</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> of aggregation traffic, which is 0. 003 percent of the 18 megabits <b>per</b> <b>second</b> link traffic sniffed.
