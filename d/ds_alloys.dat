Experiments were performed utilizing linear out-of-phase (OP) and in-phase (IP) TMF loadings on longitudinally-oriented smooth and cylindrically-notched specimens. Several notch severities were considered with elastic stress concentrations ranging from 1. 3 to 3. 0. The local response of the notched specimens was determined using the finite element method with a transversely isotropic viscoplastic constitutive model. Comparing the analysis to experiments, the locations observed for crack nucleation in the notch, which are offset from the notch root in <b>DS</b> <b>alloys,</b> are consistent with the maximum von Mises stress. Various local and nonlocal methods are evaluated to understand the life trends under OP TMF.

40|$|During {{dendritic}} solidification {{liquid flow}} is induced both by buoyancy forces and solidification shrinkage. There is {{strong evidence that}} the major reason for the liquid flow is the former, i. e., thermosolutal convection. In the microgravity environment, {{it is thought that}} the thermosolutal convection will be greatly diminished so that convection will be confined mainly to the flow of interdendritic liquid required to satisfy the solidification shrinkage. An attempt is made to provide improved models of dendritic solidification with emphasis on convection and macrosegregation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{research conducted}} {{to apply the}} Fractional Step Method to finite-element simulations of directional solidification. The Fractional Step Method (FSM) is {{also referred to as}} a projection method and as a splitting method, and has been applied commonly to high Reynolds number flow simulations. However, it is less common for low Reynolds number flows, such as occur in an alloy undergoing directional solidification (DS). The FSM offers increased speed and reduced memory requirements by allowing non-coupled solution of the pressure and velocity components. The FSM provides significant benefits for predicting flows in a DS alloy, since other methods presently employed are not computationally efficient. Previously, the most suitable finite-elements based methods for predicting flow in a DS alloy has been the penalty method for two-dimensional simulations and Galerkin least-squares (GLS) for three-dimensional simulations. The penalty method and GLS have the disadvantage that they require the coupled solution of the velocity components. The FSM allows decoupled iterative solution of the finite element equations, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of the method, both in terms of memory and CPU requirements. Numerical simulations are now commonly used to predict macrosegregation in directionally solidified (DS) castings, which are used in jet and spacecraft engines. In particular, the finite-element simulations can predict the existence of "channels" within the processing mushy zone and subsequently "freckles" within the fully processed solid, which are known to result from macrosegregation. This macrosegregation {{is a direct result of}} thermosolutal convection of the melt during the solidification process. Freckles cause strong material non-uniformities in the castings that are therefore scrapped. The phenomenon of thermosolutal convection in an alloy undergoing DS is explained, along with applications for <b>DS</b> <b>alloys.</b> Next, the momentum and continuity equations for a binary alloy undergoing DS, and the application of the FSM to these equations are presented, along with characteristics of the FSM that make its application to DS challenging. Finally, results of applying the FSM to simulations of DS in a binary alloy are given for two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries, including performance improvements over methods previously applied...|$|E

The porosity, microhardness and thickness of MAO-layer formed on samples with different initial structures are analyzed in detail. Attention is paid {{to the influence of}} MAO process modes on the quality layer. It has been proved that the MAO processing allows reaching quality coverage with high microhardness values of 1200 - 1300 HV and thickness up to 114 μm on high-silicon aluminum alloy. It has been found that the initial microstructure of alloy greatly affects the thickness of the MAO - layer. The paper explains the observed effect using the physical principles of MAO process and the nature of silicon particles distribution in the billet volume.

40|$|In this paper, the {{corrosion}} {{residual strength}} of the AZ 91 <b>D</b> magnesium <b>alloy</b> {{in the presence of}} sulfate-reducing bacteria is studied. In the experiments, the chemical composition of corrosion film was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In addition, a series of instruments, such as scanning electronic microscope, pH-meter and an AG- 10 TA materials test machine, were applied to test and record the morphology of the corrosion product, fracture texture and mechanical properties of the AZ 91 <b>D</b> magnesium <b>alloy.</b> The experiments show that the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) {{play an important role in}} the corrosion process of the AZ 91 <b>D</b> magnesium <b>alloy.</b> Pitting corrosion was enhanced by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Corrosion pits are important defects that could lead to a significant stress concentration in the tensile process. As a result, sulfate-reducing bacteria influence the corrosion residual {{strength of the}} AZ 91 <b>D</b> magnesium <b>alloy</b> by accelerating pitting corrosion...|$|R
40|$|The {{protective}} {{behavior for}} a molten AZ 91 <b>D</b> <b>alloy</b> {{in an open}} melting furnace was investigated under a protective gas mixture containing 3 % SO 2 and 97 % CO 2, and the protection mechanism was discussed. Experimental {{results show that the}} gas mixture provides effective protection for AZ 91 D melt in the temperature range from 680 ìC to 730 ìC. The microstructure, chemical composition and phase composition of the surface film formed on the molten AZ 91 <b>D</b> <b>alloy</b> were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The SEM results demonstrate that the surface films with an average thickness between 0. 5 レm and 2 レm are dense and coherent in the protected temperature range. The EDS results reveal that the surface film mainly contains elements S, C, O, Al and Mg. The XRD results show that the surface film consists of MgO, MgS and a small amount of C phase...|$|R

40|$|The low {{density and}} good {{mechanical}} properties make magnesium and its alloys attractive construction {{materials in the}} electronics, automotive, and aerospace industry, together with application in medicine due to their biocompatibility. Magnesium AZ 91 <b>D</b> <b>alloy</b> is an alloy with a high content of aluminum, whose mechanical properties overshadow the low corrosion resistance caused by {{the composition of the}} alloy and the existence of two phases: α magnesium matrix and β magnesium aluminum intermetallic compound. To improve the corrosion resistance, it is necessary to find an effective protection method for the alloy surface. Knowing and predicting electrochemical processes is an essential for the design and optimization of protective coatings on magnesium and its alloys. In this work, the formations of nickel protective coatings on the magnesium AZ 91 <b>D</b> <b>alloy</b> surface by electrodeposition and chemical deposition, are presented. For this purpose, environmentally friendly electrolytes were used. The corrosion resistance of the protected alloy was determined in chloride medium using appropriate electrochemical techniques. Characterization of the surface was performed with highly sophisticated surface-analytical methods...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical and {{gravimetric}} measurements {{were used to}} examine the effects of neodymium and gadolinium additions on the galvanic corrosion behaviour of AM 50 and AZ 91 <b>D</b> magnesium <b>alloys</b> coupled to A 570 Gr 36 carbon steel and AA 2011 -AA 6082 aluminium alloys. Rare earth modified alloys showed Al 2 Nd/Al 2 Gd and Al-Mn-Nd/Al-Mn-Gd intermetallics, reduced area fraction of β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase and increased corrosion resistance due to increased surface passivity and suppression of micro-galvanic couples. Neodymium and gadolinium additions improved the galvanic corrosion resistance of AM 50 alloy, but were less effective in case of the AZ 91 <b>D</b> <b>alloy.</b> The AA 6082 alloy was the most compatible material and the AA 2011 alloy was the least compatible. © 2014 CSIC.
