5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E

25|$|Some viruses, {{known as}} oncoviruses, {{contribute}} to the development of certain forms of cancer.

5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus.</b> These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND To {{assess the}} use of illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco {{as one of the}} {{predictors}} of successfultreatment of heroin addiction with methadone. For the assessment of health status of thepatients the absence of infections with <b>viruses</b> of <b>hepatitis</b> B, <b>C</b> and HIV is also important. METHODS Questionnaires, qualitative approaches, medical evidences and laboratory tests. RESULTS In the group of 61 patients, treated in CPTAID with methadone for at least one year, in thelast year of treatment 67. 2 % didn’t use heroin, 34. 4 % didn’t smoke marihuana, 72. 1 %didn’t use cocain, 85. 2 % didn’t use extasy and 65. 6 % didn’t use the medications of bensodiasepines type.

50|$|Extranuclear {{transmission}} of viral genomes and symbiotic bacteria is also possible. An example of viral genome transmission is perinatal transmission. This occurs from mother to fetus during the perinatal period, which begins before birth and ends about 1 month after birth. During this time viral material may be passed from mother to {{child in the}} bloodstream or breastmilk. This is of particular concern with mothers carrying HIV or <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>viruses.</b> Examples of cytoplasmic symbiotic bacteria have also {{been found to be}} inherited in organisms such as insects and protists.|$|R

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of HCC occurs in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, in countries where hepatitis B infection is endemic and many are infected from birth.

It is more common in male than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> is {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus,</b> including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E

Co-infection with hepatitis B and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>viruses</b> is frequent in highly endemic areas.

25|$|At the 5' and 3' {{ends of the}} RNA are the UTR, {{that are}} not {{translated}} into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES — Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a very long protein containing about 3,000 amino acids. The core domain of the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> (HCV) IRES contains a four-way helical junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot. The conformation of this core domain constrains the open reading frame's orientation for positioning on the 40S ribosomal subunit. The large pre-protein is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into the 10 smaller proteins that allow viral replication within the host cell, or assemble into the mature viral particles. Structural proteins made by the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> include Core protein, E1 and E2; nonstructural proteins include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> {{belongs to}} the genus Hepacivirus, {{a member of the}} family Flaviviridae.

There is also at least one virus in this genus that infects horses. Several additional viruses in the genus have been described in bats and rodents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> has a {{positive}} sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single open reading frame that is 9600 nucleotide bases long. This single open reading frame is translated to produce a single protein product, which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins. This is why on publicly available databases, such as the European Bioinformatic Institute, the viral proteome only consists of 2 proteins.|$|E
