5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within {{five weeks of}} hatching and can hunt for mice {{within a week of}} leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', nor {{was there}} any {{requirement}} to form one; since they were fighting on <b>home</b> <b>territory,</b> they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.|$|E
5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where {{and when they were}} needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany {{because of the}} significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> {{and all of its}} overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|The species {{lives in}} families, with {{population}} densities of 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. Family feeding territories do not overlap with each other, and mostly {{remain the same}} each year; however, the home territories of different family groups are larger and do overlap with each other. Both males and females have been observed to mark corners of stones mostly located {{near the center of}} their <b>home</b> <b>territory,</b> from April to December, by rubbing their neck glands against them.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
50|$|In general, Callithrix and Mico species tend to form larger {{groups and}} live within smaller home ranges, and thus live in higher {{population}} densities, than other Callitrichids. But these statistics can vary dramatically among various Callithrix species. C. jacchus and C. pencillata typically have <b>home</b> <b>territories</b> {{of less than}} 10 hectares, while other Callithrix species tend to have larger <b>home</b> <b>territories.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{many years}} Burger King has sold beer {{in several of}} its {{international}} locations, such as Germany, but not in its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E

5|$|The {{policy was}} {{supported}} by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England. When Sir Walter Raleigh was released from imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish. Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish. On Raleigh's return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain. James's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, especially after his Protestant son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's Rhineland <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick, and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Sir Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment, which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. Urged on by the Duke of Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Conflict {{between the}} two rivals was renewed in 948, when Mu'izz al-Dawla again marched against Mosul, but was forced to cut off his {{campaign}} to assist his brother Rukn al-Dawla, who was having trouble in Persia. In exchange, Nasir al-Dawla agreed to recommence the payment of tribute for the Jazira and Syria, {{as well as to}} add the names of the three Buyid brothers after that of the Caliph in the Friday prayer. Another round of warfare erupted in 956–958. While the Buyids were preoccupied with the rebellion of their Daylamite troops under Rezbahan ibn Vindadh-Khurshid in southern Iraq, Nasir al-Dawla the opportunity to advance south and capture Baghdad. After the suppression of the Daylamite revolt, however, the Hamdanids were not able to maintain their position {{in the face of the}} Buiyd counteroffensive, and abandoned the city. Peace was renewed in exchange for the recommencement of tribute and an additional indemnity, but when Nasir al-Dawla refused to send the second year's payment, the Buyid ruler advanced north. Unable to confront the Buyid army in the field, Nasir al-Dawla abandoned Mosul and fled to Mayyafariqin and then to his brother Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo. The Buyids captured Mosul and Nasibin, but the Hamdanids and their supporters withdrew to their <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> in the mountains of the north, taking with them their treasures as well as all government records and tax registers. As a result, the Buyid army was unable to support itself in the conquered territory, all the more since the predominantly Daylamite troops were resented by the local people, who launched guerrilla attacks on them. Sayf al-Dawla tried to mediate with Mu'izz al-Dawla, but his first approaches were rebuffed. Only when he agreed to assume the burden of paying his brother's tribute for the entire Diyar Rabi'a, did the Buyid ruler agree to peace. This agreement marks the reversal of roles {{between the two}} Hamdanid brothers, and the establishment of the predominance of the family's Syrian branch.|$|E
