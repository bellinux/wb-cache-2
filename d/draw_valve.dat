5000|$|Approval {{was given}} in 2012 for the {{construction}} of the pipeline from Split Rock Dam. The dam, which was built in 1988, already had a <b>draw</b> <b>valve</b> in the wall in preparation for the pipeline to Barraba. The pipeline and associated capital works were completed in December 2015.|$|E
50|$|All {{ice cream}} must be frozen quickly to avoid crystallization. With soft serve, this is {{accomplished}} by a special machine {{at the point of}} sale. Pre-mixed product (see definitions below) is introduced to the storage chamber of the machine where it is kept at 3 Â°C. When product is drawn from the <b>draw</b> <b>valve,</b> fresh mix combined with the targeted quantity of air is introduced to the freezing chamber either by gravity or pump. It is then churned and quick frozen and stored until required.|$|E

50|$|One last {{story is}} told, {{revealing}} that destroying the Buick actually was discussed. However, {{they come to}} theorize that the Buick functions {{as a sort of}} regulator <b>valve,</b> <b>drawing</b> in and out between the two worlds... and that destroying it would do much more harm than good, releasing whatever malign power is maintained by it. They decide that it is safest to watch over the Buick, in the hope that whatever force that powers it will eventually dissipate and expire.|$|R
50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} the crankcase via the PCV <b>valve,</b> <b>drawing</b> fresh air into the crankcase via the breather. The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and crankcase gases then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|R
