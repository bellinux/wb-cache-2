A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalized, this is at the umpire's discretion. A jab tackle, for example, might accidentally lift the ball above <b>knee</b> <b>height</b> into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play.

So, the purpose of this study is the redesign available ergonomic laptop desks in conformity with student’s anthropometric dimensions of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences. Methods: This study experimental-applied was conducted in 1395. In this study, using simple random categorization sampling, 207 people in the first phase of the study with the objective of measuring anthropometric dimensions and 50 people in the second phase with the aim of using laptop desks of male and female students were housed in dormitories. Five anthropometric dimensions including: length of <b>knees,</b> <b>height</b> of <b>knees,</b> <b>height</b> of elbows in the sitting position, elbow-elbow breadth and length of elbow-fingers were measured for design and construction of a new laptop table and estimate the percentage proportion of laptop desks with anthropometric dimensions.

60|$|On {{the second}} day of my {{experience}} of the Galu country I came upon a bunch of as magnificent horses as it has ever been my lot to see. They were dark bays with blazed faces and perfect surcingles of white about their barrels.

If I had coveted one of the little ponies of the Kro-lu country, imagine my state of mind when I came upon these magnificent creatures!

40|$|Background and aimsBackground and Aims: MSDs {{are very}} common in public vehicle drivers. As regards, drivers spend long time to this occupation; these {{disorders}} will be chronic and results to MSDs. According to the past researches, {{one of the main}} reasons for accidents is MSDs and low back pain. In this research, we survey the relation between anthropometric indices and Musculoskeletal Disorders in public vehicle drivers. Methodsfor this descriptive and analytic study 95 bus drivers were selected. Instruments for this project were contains: body discomfort chart (BDC), digital scale, stadiometer, anthropometric calipers and chair. Drivers questioned about age, work and their past occupations. Then measuring of weight, length, hand-arm length, popliteal length and <b>height,</b> <b>knee</b> length and <b>height</b> were done. Then the data were analyzed by spearman test on Spss software program. ResultsThe statistic tests result show that: there is a relationship between drivers MSDs and its length, weight and age. That means with increasing of drivers weight and age or shortness in length, MSDs probability will be raised. ConclusionIt seems strain and stretch that driver bears for reaching to vehicle role, age rising and its effects on the person physical condition are their MSDs reasons. Consequently, our recommendation is: on examination for selecting drivers they should be selected among long, thin  and proportional (without over weight) volunteers. This measure can be an effective step toward  preventing drivers MSDs, driving crashes and accidents...|$|R

50|$|According to {{the current}} Rules of Hockey 2017 issued by the FIH {{there are only two}} {{criteria}} for a dangerously played ball. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment). The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and {{in all parts of the}} pitch: it is that a ball lifted above <b>knee</b> <b>height</b> and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous.|$|E
50|$|Because grass courts {{tend to be}} slippery, {{the ball}} often skids and bounces low while {{retaining}} most of its speed, rarely rising above <b>knee</b> <b>height.</b> In addition, there are often bad bounces. As a result, players must reach the ball faster relative to other surfaces, and rallies {{are likely to be}} comparatively brief; therefore, speed and power are rewarded on grass. On grass, the serve and return play a major part in determining the outcome of the point, increasing the importance of serving effectively, and maintaining focus in exchanges which can be heavily influenced by lapses in concentration. A grass-court favours a serve and volley style of play.|$|E

40|$|Gait {{variability}} {{may serve}} as a sensitive and clinically relevant parameter to quantify adjustments in walking and the changes with aging and neurological disease. Variability of steps preceding obstacle avoidance (approach phase) are important for efficiency in the task, especially in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, variability of gait during the approach phase to obstacle avoidance in people with PD has been rarely reported, particularly when ambulating obstacles of different heights. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of obstacle height on step-to-step variability (step-to-step variability provides information on the variation between the "equivalent steps" for all trials, and walking variability (indicates the within-step variability of each, providing information about the modulations between the steps performed. of spatial-temporal parameters during the approach phase to obstacle avoidance in people with PD and neurologically healthy older people. Twenty-eight older people; 15 with PD and 13 neurologically healthy individuals (control group), participated in the study. Participants were instructed to walk at their preferred speed until the end of the pathway and to avoid the obstacle when it was present. Each subject performed 10 trials of the following tasks: unobstructed walking, low obstacle avoidance (3 cm length, height equal ankle's height, 60 cm wide), intermediate obstacle (3 cm length, low plus high obstacle height divided by 2, 60 cm wide) avoidance and high obstacle avoidance (3 cm length, <b>knee's</b> <b>height,</b> 60 cm wide). The obstacle was positioned 4 m from to the start position. The step-to-step and walking variability of the spatial-temporal parameters (acquiring with GAITRite®) of the four steps before obstacle avoidance were analyzed. MANOVAs were used to compare the data. PD group showed the characteristic gait deficits associated with PD. The obstacle increased the spatial-temporal variability (step-to-step and walking variability) during the approach phase to the obstacle. Specifically, both groups increased i) the step-to- step variability of the step length during low obstacle avoidance when compared to the other conditions; ii) the variability during low obstacle avoidance in the last step before obstacle (n- 1) compared to higher obstacle avoidance; iii) variability during higher obstacle avoidance in further steps (n- 3 and n- 4). In conclusion, the presence of the obstacle during walking increased the variability of spatial-temporal parameters in older people with PD and the control group during the steps preceding obstacle avoidance. In addition motor planning (and motor adaptations) was initiated much earlier in the approach phase for the higher obstacle conditions compared to the low obstacle condition...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the patellar height of volunteers {{with and without}} patellofemoral pain syndrome (PPS) during maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in open kinetic chain (OKC) and closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises. METHODS: Twenty healthy women, and nineteen women with patellofemoral pain syndrome were evaluated and subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance imaging during rest and MVIC in OKC and CKC at 15 °, 30 °, and 45 ° knee flexion. The patellar height was assessed by the K-Pacs program,using the Insall-Salvati index. For each exercise and <b>knee</b> position, patellar <b>height</b> was measured three times and the procedure was repeated after seven days.
