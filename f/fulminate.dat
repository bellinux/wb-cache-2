5|$|Silver <b>fulminate,</b> AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>fulminates</b> {{was made by}} Edward Charles Howard (1774-1816) in 1800. The invention that made the percussion cap possible using the recently discovered <b>fulminates</b> was patented by the Rev. Alexander John Forsyth of Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland in 1807.|$|R

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver <b>fulminate,</b> as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
25|$|The Guadalupe River {{runs from}} the Santa Cruz Mountains (which {{separate}} the South Bay from the Pacific Coast) flowing north through San Jose, ending in the San Francisco Bay at Alviso. Along {{the southern part of}} the river is the neighborhood of Almaden Valley, originally named for the mercury mines which produced mercury needed for gold extraction from quartz during the California Gold Rush as well as mercury <b>fulminate</b> blasting caps and detonators for the U.S. military from 1870 to 1945. East of the Guadalupe River, Coyote Creek also flows to south San Francisco Bay and originates on Mount Sizer near Henry W. Coe State Park and the surrounding hills in the Diablo Range, northeast of Morgan Hill, California.|$|E
25|$|Silver nitrate is {{the least}} {{expensive}} salt of silver; it offers several other advantages as well. It is non-hygroscopic, in contrast to silver fluoroborate and silver perchlorate. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other ligands, rendering AgNO3 versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making photographic film, silver nitrate is treated with halide salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble silver halide in situ in photographic gelatin, which is then applied to strips of tri-acetate or polyester. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the <b>fulminate,</b> azide, or acetylide, through a precipitation reaction.|$|E

500|$|Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the {{official}} investigation; {{he concluded that}} Parsons had been mixing <b>fulminate</b> of mercury in a coffee can when he dropped it on the floor, causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it {{came into contact with}} other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as [...] "scrupulously neat" [...] and [...] "exceptionally cautious". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were [...] "incongruous" [...] but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as [...] "criminally negligent", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.|$|E
2500|$|The Maynard tape primer is {{a system}} {{designed}} to allow for more rapid reloading of muskets which previously relied on small copped caps that were filled with mercury <b>fulminate.</b> Dr. Edward Maynard, a dentist {{with an interest in}} firearms, embedded tiny pellets of priming material in thin strips of paper, then glued a second strip of paper on top of the first, creating a [...] "tape" [...] of primer. The tape could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, since paper was much less expensive than copper. In 1845, Edward Maynard patented his new firearm invention which in later years, would be widely used in the American Civil War.|$|E

5000|$|Recent EXAFS (Extended X-Ray Absorption Find Structure) {{analyses}} by Joannis Psilitelis {{has shown}} that <b>fulminating</b> gold is a square planar tetraamminegold(III) cation with either four or one gold atoms in the second coordination sphere. This geometry {{is supported by the}} diamagnetic character of <b>fulminating</b> gold. Since it has a d8 electron configuration and is diamagnetic, it must be have a square planar geometry.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the massive}} {{interest}} {{in the study of}} <b>fulminating</b> gold in the early and middling eras of chemistry, {{there are many ways to}} synthesize it. Interestingly, not all sythesis routes yield the same product. According to Steinhauser et al. and Ernst Weitz, a very homogeneous sample can be obtained by hydrolysis of Au(NH3)4(NO3)3with Cl^-. They have also noted that different synthetic routes, as well as using different amount of ammonia when precipitating the product, leads to different ratios of Au, N, H, and Cl. Due to its physical and chemical properties, <b>fulminating</b> gold cannot be crystallized under normal methods, making determining the crystal structure a hassle. From extensive attempts at crystallization by Steinhauser et al. and vibrational spectroscopy, it has been concluded that <b>fulminating</b> gold is an amorphous mixture of polymeric compounds that are linked via μ-NH2 and μ3-NH bridges. It has also been found that <b>fulminating</b> gold is also very slightly soluble in acetonitrile and dimethylformamide.|$|R
2500|$|A third {{step was}} the {{structure}} elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective {{of whether they}} were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who both studied a silver salt of the same composition but had different properties. Wöhler studied silver cyanate, a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated silver <b>fulminate,</b> a salt with explosive properties. The elemental analysis shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, {{but this was not}} the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by Berzelius's theory of isomers, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. [...] However, it took until 1858 before by August Kekulé formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon tetravalent ad can bind itself to carbon chains as they occur in natural products.|$|E

6000|$|... .... At the Coroner's inquest in {{the case}} of John Harvey there was {{considerable}} difficulty in ascertaining the cause of death, but as one witness testified that the deceased was pounding <b>fulminate</b> of mercury at the Powder Works just previously to his lamented demise, {{there is good reason to}} believe he was hoist into heaven with his own petard. In fact, such fractions of him as have come to hand, up to date, seem to confirm this view. This evidence is rather disjointed and fragmentary, but it is sufficient to discourage the brutal practice of pounding <b>fulminate</b> of mercury when our streets and Sunday-schools are swarming with available Chinaman who seldom hit back.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{significant}} statement, for it must be explained that although giant-powder, as dynamite is generally called in the west, as a rule merely burns more or less violently when ignited by a flame, {{it is still a}} somewhat unstable product, and now and then explodes with appalling results on apparently quite insufficient provocation. In use it is fired with a detonator, a big copper cap charged with a <b>fulminate</b> of the highest power, and when lighted in this fashion the energies unloosed by the explosion, though limited in their area, are stupendous. The detonator is almost as dangerous, for a few grains of the <b>fulminate</b> contained in it are sufficient to reduce a man to his component gases. At least, this was the case a few years ago.|$|E
