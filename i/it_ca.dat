2500|$|During the mid-to-late 1970s, Rundgren {{regularly}} {{played the}} eye-catching psychedelic Gibson SG (known variously as [...] "Sunny" [...] or [...] "The Fool"), which Eric Clapton {{had played in}} Cream. After he had stopped using <b>it</b> <b>ca.</b> 1968, Clapton gave the guitar to George Harrison, who subsequently 'loaned' it to British singer Jackie Lomax. In 1972, after meeting at a recording session, Lomax sold the guitar to Rundgren for $500 with an option to buy it back, which he never took up. Rundgren played it extensively {{during the early years}} of Utopia before retiring the instrument for a short time in the mid to late 1970s, which in that time he had the guitar restored having a lacquer finish applied to protect the paint and replaced the talpiece and bridge to stabilize tuning, bringing the guitar back out on tour during the 1980 Deface the Music tour and using it on and off throughout the 1980s until 1993 when he permanently retired the guitar, eventually auctioning it off in 1999; he now uses a reproduction given to him in 1988 by a Japanese fan.|$|E

The facade of the outer wall was niched, imitating a royal palace facade. The enclosure provides two entrances, one at the eastern corner, one at the northern corner. These entrances once consisted of massive, stone-made door jambs, the material of the door wings is unknown.|$|R

5000|$|There {{was also}} {{known to be}} a painted {{portrait}} of Whittington shown with a cat, hanging at Mercer Hall, but it was reported that the painting had been trimmed down to smaller size, and the date [...] "1572" [...] that appears there was something painted after the cropping, which raises doubt as to the authenticity of the date, though Malcolm who witnessed <b>it</b> <b>ca.</b> early 1800s felt the date should be taken in good faith. The print published in The New Wonderful Museum (vol. III, 1805, pictured above) is presumably a replica of this painting.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Robertson (1975, vol I:474) classifies it as a Roman copy, {{made before}} AD 79, needless to say, of a Greek bronze {{original}} {{of the late}} fourth or early third century BC, {{in the tradition of}} Lysippos, whose name has been invoked in connection with the sculpture since its first reappearance. Margarete Bieber classifies it as [...] "school of Lysippos" [...] and dates <b>it</b> <b>ca</b> 100 BCE. Many bronze statues posed on actual rocks must have been set up in late Hellenistic and Roman gardens, where, Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway suggests, natural boulders [...] "increased the idyllic aspect of the composition." [...] The Hermes rests his hand casually on the (restored) rock, integrating the composition.|$|E

50|$|During the Byzantine period Tephrike was an {{important}} stronghold for the dualist heretic Armenian Paulicians. Their leader, Karbeas, founded <b>it</b> <b>ca.</b> 850, and the Paulicians fortified it and used it as refuge and the capital of their state during the ninth century. It was captured by the Byzantine Empire {{during the reign of}} Emperor Basil I and was temporarily named Leontokome (after Emperor Leo VI) and made into a thema. In the early eleventh century, the town was part of the territory given to the Armenian king Seneqerim-Hovhannes of Vaspurakan in exchange for his lands in Vaspurakan. Around 1071, after the battle of Manzikert, the area was conquered by a Turkmen warrior named Mengujek Ghazi. A medieval castle, with remains mostly from the thirteenth century, is situated on top of a steep hill overlooking the town.|$|E

The locomotive was built at Ipswich Railway Workshops in 1877. It was known as an A10 class steam locomotive (or an Ipswich A10). It ran on the southern and western railway, as Locomotive 36, until 1881 when it operated on the Bundaberg Railway. In 1890 it was sold to contractors building part of the Bundaberg - Gladstone railway and in 1892 sold again to Young Brothers of Fairymead Mill, Bundaberg. It was used initially on trains at Avonside, then at the mill at North Bundaberg. Its boiler exploded at Avondale in the early 1890s. In 1935 it was replaced by a locomotive purchased from Mount Lyall in Tasmania but its remains were not disposed of until 1951." ...|$|E
