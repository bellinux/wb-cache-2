40|$|A large {{proportion}} of consumption {{of different types of}} energy by the residential sector, especially in the heating period, makes the energy efficiency of buildings without considering the loss of fuel with a significant reduction in hourly load on the generators, especially at night, already insufficient for real energy savings. Therefore in Belarus, in order to attract the consumer, electricity tariff for heating at night hours (from 11 p. m. to 6. 00 a. m.) is three times cheaper than at any other time. Significant increase of the electricity consumption of at night could be achieved by using <b>heat</b> <b>accumulators</b> for <b>heating</b> and hot water supply to the residential sector. Particularly effective are water <b>accumulators</b> of <b>heat</b> and <b>accumulators</b> of underfloor <b>heating</b> that enable to use a coolant with a temperature of 40  оC and to increase the useful supply of heat. The use of <b>heat</b> <b>accumulators</b> for daily <b>heating,</b> ventilation and hot water supply of buildings significantly reduces the cost of creating the infrastructure of the territory under construction by eliminating the necessity of running the distribution network of heat or gas supply. The use of the <b>heat</b> <b>accumulators</b> is necessary due to the increase of the time-weighted average outdoor temperature. The mentioned increase in the City of Minsk in the heating season is of about 0. 1 °C per year in average, and as for the last 20 years, the increase has led to a reduction of the required heat load on the premises by about 10 %.

From these figures the test cooler power dissipation can be calculated and this is equal to the power loss when temperatures are stabilized. From this test the actual required cooler can be calculated to reach specified oil temperature in the oil tank.

50|$|This {{structure}} also {{enables a}} 'natural ventilation' through the selective opening of windows. The 50 cm {{gap between the}} 17 cm thick floors and the glass encasing also allows for vertical ventilation, if needs be helped by opening glass hatches in the roof. And the glass allows for maximum entry of sunlight. Peutz reported after one year of use of the building, that experience had shown that the 50 cm gap was more than enough. In the early years, the gap has even been reduced in size in some places. In winter only the window flaps in the glass encasing need to be opened and the roof hatches can remain closed. During summer, on the sunny side the curtains should be closed and the hatches opened (note, though, that the south side is the one without glass). The result is a 'double wall' of glass on the outer side and curtains on the inner side, with an upward draft caused by the Sun's heat. This suffices for ventilation and the two surface ducts (as shown on the drawings) were partly intended for mechanical ventilation (with an exhauster fan), but this {{has turned out to}} be unnecessary. During winter, heating is done with a hot water installation (of course fuelled with coal) with natural circulation. The radiators along the windows now provide the heat for the circulation. The installed pumps have turned out to be unnecessary. The airtight glass walls have turned out to be better insulators than thought. Also, the mass of the concrete is such a good <b>heat</b> <b>accumulator</b> that extra time heating up the building in the morning has turned out unnecessary and there have never been any major temperature changes. This technology is being rediscovered and used, for example, by Canadian architect Chris Holmes in his energy-saving designs.|$|E

In contrast to other publications associated with calculations of latent PTHA based on the similar simplifications, the article uses such a parameter as a specific mass of phase per unit of the accumulator length (per running meter of length), as the unknown function, thereby providing the universal writing of differential equations for all the latent PTHA where the simplifications used are appropriate in their deriving.
