500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly laudatory {{reviews from}} television critics, particularly for its unusual {{departure from the}} standard Mad Men episode structure and {{is considered to be}} one of the best in the series.

[...] Sepinwall characterized [...] "Far Away Places" [...] as [...] "an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober.

[...] Todd VanderWerff of The A.V.

500|$|Wisden commented: [...] "The {{inclusion}} {{once again}} of Leyland was a move which yielded splendid results." [...] Coming in to bat at number three, Leyland shared a partnership of 382 with Len Hutton, {{at the time}} a record English Test partnership for any wicket; as of 2013, it remains England's highest partnership for the second wicket, and the highest for any wicket against Australia. As there was no time limit on the match, Leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six-and-a-half hours before he was run out. Hutton went on to score 364, at the time the highest score in Tests. England had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate the bowlers, and Cardus expressed his frustration to Leyland during an interval in play. Cardus wrote: [...] "'And even you, Maurice,' I complained, in sorrow not anger, 'even you won't hit the ball and <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> cricket.' 'Hey, wait a minute, Mr Cardus,' expostulated Leyland, as though pained at my protest, 'wait a minute—tha must remember that Ah'm playing for me place in team. England {{went on to win the}} match and level the series. Leyland's innings was his highest in Tests, but this was his final match for England. In 41 Tests, he scored 2,764 runs at 46.06 and took six wickets.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams {{returned}} to Cheltenham Town, signing on a one-month loan deal on 14 August 2008. On bringing Myrie-Williams back to the club, Cheltenham manager Keith Downing said [...] "Jennison is an exciting young player who will <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> different options. We've perhaps been lacking a bit of pace and he will give us that as well". He made his second debut for the club four days later, scoring with a header in the 80th minute to ensure Cheltenham picked up their first win of the 2008–09 season with a 2–0 win against Swindon Town. Myrie-Williams made five appearances for Cheltenham during his one-month loan spell, scoring one goal. He returned to Bristol City on 15 September 2008. Shortly after returning to his parent club, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to another League One club, this time in the form of Carlisle United. Myrie-Williams stated that the move appealed to him because of manager John Ward, who he had played under at Cheltenham Town— [...] "We have kept in contact since I was at Cheltenham. He's a good manager and I enjoyed playing for him. I heard about a possible move in pre-season which came to nothing but I'm delighted to finally be here". He made his Carlisle debut on 20 September 2008, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 2–0 home defeat to Leeds United, a result that ended Carlisle's 100% home record. His loan spell was extended for another month on 15 October 2008. His final appearance for Carlisle was in the club's FA Cup 1–1 draw with Grays Athletic, a game in which Myrie-Williams was substituted after 59 minutes. He made 10 appearances during his two months at Carlisle. Myrie-Williams was loaned out for a third time during the 2008–09 season, his fifth loan spell in total, when he joined Hereford United in January 2009. He scored his first goal for Hereford on 17 February 2009 in the club's 2–0 home victory against Leeds United, scoring with a low shot to give Hereford the lead just before half-time. He returned to Bristol City after Hereford's 1–0 home loss against Peterborough United on 21 February 2009. A month later, Myrie-Williams rejoined Hereford {{until the end of the}} season. Myrie-Williams scored his second goal for Hereford in an away draw with Yeovil Town in April 2009. He made 15 appearances over the period of the two loan spells, scoring twice, as Hereford were relegated back to League Two after finishing bottom of the table.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a decade}} of neutrality, Roosevelt knew that the change to Allied support must be gradual, {{especially}} since German Americans were the largest ethnicity in America at the time. Originally, the American position was to help the British but not enter the war. In early February 1941, a Gallup poll revealed that 54 percent of Americans {{were in favor of}} giving aid to the British without qualifications of Lend-Lease. A further 15 percent were in favor with qualifications such as: [...] "If it doesn't get us into war," [...] or [...] "If the British can <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> security for what we give them." [...] Only 22 percent were unequivocally against the President's proposal. When poll participants were asked their party affiliation, the poll revealed a sharp political divide: 69 percent of Democrats were unequivocally in favor of Lend-Lease, whereas only 38 percent of Republicans favored the bill without qualification. At least one poll spokesperson also noted that, [...] "approximately twice as many Republicans" [...] gave [...] "qualified answers as ... Democrats." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Australians were touring {{again in}} 1956 and when Len Maddocks saw Barrington he told Keith Miller [...] "This fellow looks the part; he might <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> trouble before long". England {{had a strong}} team and under Peter May's {{leadership}} they beat Australia 2–1, the West Indies 3–0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4–0 in 1958. Barrington lost his form in these seasons and could not fight {{his way into the}} England team. Stuart Surridge retired after winning five championships in his five years as captain and in 1956 May took over, winning Surrey's sixth consecutive championship in 1957 with a massive 94-point lead over all the other counties. In one area Barrington showed improvement as with Surridge gone Surrey needed another close fielder and he was made first slip. He took 64 catches in his first season in this position and as Mickey Stewart held 77 catches and Tony Lock 63 Surrey more than held onto their chances. In June 1957 Barrington's batting picked up with 12 fours and 4 sixes in his 124 not out against Gloucestershire and 103 not out against the West Indies including their famous spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. At {{the end of the season}} Barrington could afford to relax and hit three more hundreds. With no tour in sight Alf Gover offered Ken and Ann the chance to teach cricket in South Africa over the winter. They rented out their house in London, moved to Cape Town and he coached the First and Second XIs at the Roman Catholic St Joseph's College, set up a Under-11 side in his free time and met a talented Cape Coloured cricketer called Basil d'Oliveira. Back at the Oval Barrington had another poor season – making only one century – and was even dropped from the Surrey team and given the task of transporting the team kit from venue to venue. As a result, he re-worked his batting technique to get behind the ball to improve his defence against in-swing and off-spin. This was coupled with a change of attitude encouraged by Alec Bedser and Jim Laker, he forsaked the big hitting of his youth and became a stonewaller, making runs with the minimum of risk. This required endless net-practice and training at Gover's cricket school, but by 1958 Barrington emerged as one of the best batsmen in England.|$|E

2500|$|Notwithstanding {{the changes}} brought {{about in the}} course of time, Vespers still remains the great and {{important}} Office of the evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the sacrificium vespertinum of the Old Law. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the Office of the Vigil, so also {{is the end of the}} day by Vespers. It terminates, as Matins formerly terminated, and Lauds at present terminates, by a lection, or reading, from the Gospel, or canticum evangelii, which, for Vespers, is always the [...] "Magnificat". This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers, one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as in some liturgies the [...] "Magnificat" [...] is sung at Lauds (cf. Cabrol in [...] "Dict. d'arch. et de liturgie", s.v. Cantiques évangéliques). This place of honour accorded so persistently to the canticle of Mary from such remote antiquity is but one of the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Church. The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss. cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl, belong invariably to Lauds. The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the Roman Breviary also form a class apart and help to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> hints as to the symbolism of this hour. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular characteristic—they are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the Creation, according to the day of the week, thus: the first, [...] "Lucis Creator optime", on Sunday, to the creation of light; the second, on Monday, to the separation of the earth and the waters; the third, on Tuesday, to the creation of the plants; the fourth, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon; the fifth, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; the sixth, on Friday, to the creation of the beasts of the earth; Saturday is an exception, the hymn on that day being in honour of the Blessed Trinity, because of the Office of Sunday then commencing.|$|E
