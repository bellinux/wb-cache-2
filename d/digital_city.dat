In {{the first stage of}} the project, the telephone wiring of the city was replaced, changing from copper to optical fiber. An antenna, providing 4G technology, and security cameras were installed; tablets were distributed to students of the municipal school; the use of smart cars was introduced: presence sensors in a smart car parking system and a smart street lighting system were installed, reducing energy consumption. At the end of 2015, though continuing to provide services to the community, Telefônica Vivo transferred managing responsibility to the city government. The second stage begins in 2016, with the installation of interactive kiosks in public places, the training of teachers to work with new technologies, and the scheduling of medical appointments over the Internet.|$|E

40|$|Intelligent {{communities}} and cities belong to an emerging movement targeting {{the creation of}} environments that improve cognitive skills and abilities to learn and innovate. They represent environments that enable superior cognitive capabilities and creativity to be collectively constructed from combinations of individual cognitive skills and information systems that operate in the physical, institutional, and <b>digital</b> spaces of <b>cities.</b> Two academic traditions have been feeding the discussion concerning intelligent {{communities and}} cities: the literature on innovative environments and the planning of <b>digital</b> <b>cities.</b> Following an introduction {{on the meaning of}} ICs, we discuss the structuring of innovative environments such as clusters, technology districts and territorial systems of innovation, which rely on different architectures of knowledge networks enhancing product, process, and organizational innovation. Then we turn to <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> and examine their concept, architecture, and constituent elements. In the final section of the paper we describe intelligent cities as overlapping of innovative clusters and <b>digital</b> <b>cities.</b> Intelligent cities integrate knowledge-intensive activities and clusters; embedded routines of social co-operation enabling knowledge sharing and innovation; advanced communication infrastructure and digital spaces for knowledge and innovation management; and proven ability to innovate and resolve problems that appear for the first time, since the capacity to innovate and manage uncertainty are critical factors in characterizing intelligence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews {{worldwide}} {{activities on}} regional information spaces. In the US and Canada, {{a large number}} of community networks appeared in the early 1990 s. As a platform for community networks, information spaces using the city metaphor are being developed worldwide. In Europe, more than one hundred <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> have been tried. Asian countries are actively adopting the latest information technologies for city informatization. All of the above are independent activities, and thus their goals, services, and organizations differ. In parallel, local commercial portals provided by global companies are becoming very common in major cities. Unlike regional community networks and <b>digital</b> <b>cities,</b> to increase the efficiency of gathering and maintaining local information in {{a large number of}} cities, the companies often provide uniform platforms to develop local sites. As a result, local portals look homogeneous though the information is always particular to each city. Regional community networks and <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> must accept that they are in competition with global companies. However, {{it does not mean that}} the homogeneous platforms will govern the heterogeneous activities. We observe that heterogeneity of the regional information spaces is also increasing just as local commercial portals. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the issues raised}} by an ongoing <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> project, coined Gaia Global, concerning how people can learn and use information. Gaia Global main concern is to introduce a 288. 000 inhabitant’s city in Portugal – Gaia – to the information and knowledge society. The project aims to provide Gaia with a digital counterpart that represents the region in digital format. This digital representation is not only the World Wide Web but mainly the digital interaction between people and local institutions using any possible channel to help people solve their problems and needs. Among the issues related with this <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> project, one of the most challenging is to bring people together to use and take advantage of such an infrastructure to deal with information and provide them with the knowledge to know what and how to use it. As just around 34. 000 of the 288. 000 inhabitants of Gaia have some higher education degree, a true effort must be on place to introduce the <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> facilities to the main population. E-learning is seen as a strategic concept as it provides the digital tools, methods and technology to help each individual to learn and support the massive effor...|$|R
