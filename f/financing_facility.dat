In 2008 four MFFs for urban development investment programs were under way in North Karnataka (862million), Jammu and Kashmir (1,260million), Rajasthan (450million), and Uttarakhand (1,589million).

25|$|The {{position}} of Westpac's lawyers was in direct conflict {{with that of}} the Government's legal advisors on the project, Mallesons Stephen Jaques. The Government's lawyers considered that Westpac would have reasonable recourse against the Government, and its Consolidated Revenue Fund, in the event that a default occurred. One solution proposed by Clayton Utz was to enjoin the Minister for Transport as a party to the <b>financing</b> <b>facility</b> contract. However, after further significant problems arose with proposed changes by Westpac to the funding arrangements, its contract for the finance facility was terminated in August 1992.|$|E
25|$|Upon Bangladesh's independence, {{the value}} of the Bangladeshi taka was set between ৳7.5 and ৳8.0 to US$1. Except for fiscal year 1978, the taka's value {{relative}} to the US dollar declined every year from 1971 through the end of 1987. To help offset this phenomenon, Bangladesh first used the compensatory <b>financing</b> <b>facility</b> of the International Monetary Fund in fiscal year 1974. Despite the increasing need for assistance, the Mujib government was initially unwilling to meet the IMF's conditions on monetary and fiscal policy. By fiscal year 1975, however, the government revised its stance, declaring a devaluation of the taka by 56 percent and agreeing to establishing the Bangladesh Aid Group by the World Bank.|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} to the competitiveness of sustainable economic development is a country's global economic position. Small and medium industries, supposed to be drivers of economic development of a country, receive much of negative impact following the global economic uncertainty environment. This includes facing increasingly critical financial facilities. This study seeks to analyze the empirical relationship between small and medium industries and the <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in the short-run and long-run {{in the state of}} Sabah, Malaysia. The ARDL bound testing approach was applied, using annual time series data for the years between 1976 through 2005. The successes of small and medium industries have been related to availability of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Results show that the relationships between small and medium industries and <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> seem to exist in the long-run. In addition, there is a causal relation between small and medium industries and financial loan. The conclusion is that <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> {{may not be the most}} important factor in the development of small and medium scale industries, but small and medium industries on the other hand functions as the paramount important factor in the development of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> SMI, <b>Financing</b> <b>facilities,</b> ARDL, Sabah...|$|R

500|$|The 1990s {{brought an}} {{opportunity}} to expand operations in the airport management sector, as many countries privatised their airports. When Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport needed upgrading in the early 1990s, LOT Polish Airlines was unable to afford the cost, so a complex financing arrangement was established whereby a bank would pay Hochtief {{two thirds of the}} costs to upgrade the airport, while the airline assigned to the bank the revenues from aircraft using Polish airspace for a period. The company began to take responsibility for more operational aspects of projects, including service provision, <b>financing,</b> <b>facility</b> management and software development, following a concept of being a [...] "system leader", as set out by CEO Hans-Peter Keitel. These tasks were felt to be higher up the value chain, and would help the firm shake off the slowdown that had followed the initial boom of German reunification. These concepts were notably put into action during the construction of the new Athens International Airport in the late 1990s.|$|E

Findings include types of pumps; organization of import, wholesale and retail, including after-sales services; fiscal measures (import duty waiver and VAT zero rating); prices of pumps; and <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> to the farmers. The main obstacles for farmers were found to be: the highly centralized supply chain and <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in urban hubs; lack of information, also about prices, which vary significantly even for the same make and model of pump; lack of information and training about proper use and maintenance; and lack of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Zambia National Farmers Union seems best placed to remove these obstacles...|$|R

40|$|To {{encourage}} the private funding and {{provision of infrastructure}} services, governments have used specialized <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> to offer financial support to investors, often {{in the form of}} grants, soft loans, or guarantees. The authors present case studies of infrastructure <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in various stages of development in Colombia, India, and Pakistan. They also present case studies of government-sponsored <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> (not of infrastructure) in Argentina, and Moldova. They find that these facilities have often fallen short of their objectives for two main reasons. First, the environment was not conducive to private participation in infrastructure because of poor sector policies, an unstable macroeconomic environment, and inadequate financial sector policies, among other reasons. Second, the facility was faulty in design - in terms of sectors targeted, pricing of instruments, and consistency of objectives, and instruments.
