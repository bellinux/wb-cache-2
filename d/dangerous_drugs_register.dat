25|$|Adams {{was found}} guilty in a {{subsequent}} trial of 13 offences of prescription fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstructing a police search and failing to keep a <b>dangerous</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>register.</b> He {{was removed from the}} Medical Register in 1957 and reinstated in 1961 after two failed applications.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{opened a}} {{cupboard}} for the police: amongst medicine bottles were [...] "chocolates – slabs stuck – butter, margarine, sugar". While the officers inspected it Adams walked to another cupboard and slipped two objects {{into his jacket}} pocket. Hannam and Pugh challenged him and Adams showed them two bottles of morphine; one he said was for Annie Sharpe, a patient and major witness who had died nine days earlier under his care; the other said [...] "Mr Soden". He had died on 17 September 1956 but pharmacy records later showed Soden had never been prescribed morphine. Adams was later (after his main trial in 1957) convicted of obstructing the search, concealing the bottles and for failing to keep a <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Drugs</b> <b>register.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and {{the head}} of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams' house with a warrant issued (in Pugh's name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Drugs</b> <b>Register</b> – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't know what you mean. I keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial. Hannam then observed, [...] "Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 – 1/6 grains heroin tablets the day before she died." [...] Adams replied, [...] "Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself [...] Do you think it is too much?" ...|$|E

50|$|Adams was {{subsequently}} successfully prosecuted on 13 lesser charges of prescription fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstructing a police search {{and failing to}} keep a <b>dangerous</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>register.</b> He {{was removed from the}} Medical Register in 1957 and reinstated in 1961. Home Office pathologist Francis Camps, however, suspected Adams of causing the deaths of 163 patients in total.|$|E
50|$|According to Scotland Yard's {{files on}} Adams, the police {{believed}} that 163 of Adams' patients died in highly suspicious circumstances. Reporter Rodney Hallworth and historian Pamela Cullen also identify another patient, Annie Sharpe, {{as a possible}} victim {{not included in this}} number, and Cullen further identifies Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire as a probable victim.

50|$|Cannabis {{has been}} illegal in the Philippines since 1972 {{by virtue of}} Republic Act No. 6425, or the <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Drugs</b> Act of 1972.
