5|$|Among Jehovah's Witnesses the Star of Bethlehem <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a product}} of Satan, rather than a sign from God, since the star led the astrologers to Jerusalem where they met King Herod's plan to kill Jesus.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a good thing, Athshe <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E

50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a part of}} some uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{is commonly}} contrasted against phyletic gradualism, {{the idea that}} evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis).

40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an amount of matter 2. A hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a region of space 3. A building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies.

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{name for}} the town was 'Aberbrothock', {{a reference to the}} Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier Brythonic term 'Aber' for 'confluence' or 'river mouth'. The name 'Aberbrothock' can be found in numerous spelling variations. In the earliest manuscripts available, it <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> 'Abirbrothoke' (in the letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward I) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriage). In the Declaration of Arbroath, it <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> 'Abirbrothoc'. Early maps show a number of variants including Aberbrothock, Aberbrothik, Aberbrothick, and Aberbrothwick.|$|E

5|$|Although {{opinions}} {{differ on}} whether the Bala Kanda narrative of Ahalya refers to the divinity of Rama, later sources assert Rama's divine status, portraying Ahalya as a condemned woman rescued by God. The Bhakti-era poets use the episode as an archetypal example to demonstrate God's saving grace. The main theme of such narratives is her deliverance by Rama, which <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> proof of his compassion.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, {{the seat}} of the European Parliament remains controversial. The work of Parliament is divided between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a problem due to the large number of MEPs, staff, and {{documents}} which need to be moved. As the locations of the major seats have been enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other national parliaments.|$|E
