25|$|In 1957, Leigh, aged 40 {{and retired}} from {{modeling}}, {{was living in}} France. She decided to start another modeling agency, this time in France. The police and courts insisted she was running an <b>illegal</b> <b>employment</b> agency, and she was fined. After World War II, employment agencies were declared illegal. Leigh contacted the Fords about starting a legitimate modeling agency, {{the first of its}} kind in that country. She continued to run a successful agency, but in 1959 was charged in court again. After hiring a lawyer, she finally won her case. The Fords agreed to expand their modeling business into Europe, and Leigh would represent them in France as well as scout for potential models all over Europe. Leigh was so successful that she opened branches in London and Hamburg, Germany. She would trade her European models for Ford's American models and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|By {{assuming}} a small open economy, we investigate {{the effects of}} employer sanctions on <b>illegal</b> immigrant <b>employment</b> and native worker welfare. For this purpose, we assume the non-shirk model to take the possible effects of employer sanctions on illegal immigrant utilities into account. We also assume that {{the probability that the}} government will discover <b>illegal</b> immigrant <b>employment</b> hardly increases with the resources invested by it and that all the costs of employer sanctions are financed by the fines imposed on the firms that employ illegal immigrants. In this paper, we demonstrate that even under these circumstances, strengthening employer sanctions cannot only reduce <b>illegal</b> immigrant <b>employment</b> but also can increase native worker welfare...|$|R

He was supported by figures such as Michael Foot, Victor Gollancz and Lord De L'Isle, VC. On 27 August the government responded by formally announcing that the four would be tried by a British military court in Hamburg. Items in Rundstedt's indictment included: [...] "the maltreatment and killing of civilians and prisoners of war... killing hostages, <b>illegal</b> <b>employment</b> of prisoners of war, deportation of forced labour to Germany... mass execution of Jews... and other war crimes, yet to be specified." [...] On 24 September the four were moved to a military hospital in Hamburg, where {{they were allowed to}} be visited by their families. It was here that Brauchitsch died suddenly of heart failure on 18 October. This led to a renewed outcry in Britain for the trial to be abandoned. Nevertheless, Bevin was determined to press ahead, and on 1 January 1949 Rundstedt, Manstein and Strauss were formally charged. Hugo Laternser was engaged as Rundstedt's counsel, and Liddell Hart and others in Britain collected material for the defence. The Bishop of Chichester, George Bell, announced that he would bring in a motion in the House of Lords critical of the government. This was a serious threat since the Lords had the power to compel the government to produce documents.|$|E

In combination with demographic changes, i. e. the arrival of new groups of undocumented immigrants, the gap between illegal immigrants and the receiving society has widened and labour has gone further underground, resulting in unintended outcomes of the restrictive policy.

In December 1976, Acting Commissioner Horn advocated on behalf of passage of a proposed <b>Illegal</b> Alien <b>Employment</b> Prohibition Act that was being considered by a committee in the New Jersey Senate under which fines would be imposed on companies that hired undocumented workers; Horn cited data showing that the state had 360,000 people out of work and an unemployment rate of 11.3% {{that was one of the}} nation's highest, while an estimate from the federal government's Immigration and Naturalization Service found that the state had 200,000 undocumented workers, and he stated that [...] "the estimated number of illegal aliens holding jobs represent more than half of our total unemployed".

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} claims that {{employment}} in the new Russian private sector relies heavily on informal and unregistered labour agreements and that the violation of existing labour law by new private employers is driven by their need for more flexible working arrangements.

The new private sector does not rely heavily on informal or <b>illegal</b> forms of <b>employment</b> {{and there is no}} evidence that it uses labour more flexibly, in any of the usual senses of the term, than the traditional sectors of the economy. The conclusion is that there is no economic justification for the systematic violation of the existing labour legislation.

40|$|Most {{migrants}} seek {{jobs and}} {{a better life for}} themselves and their families, making perceptions about "opportunity differentials" the dominant reason for migration. Some are desperate people escaping various forms of persecution or violence. And substantial numbers are people seeking to reunite with relatives. These motivations, and the availability of low-wage jobs that virtually all high-income (and increasingly, some middle-income) countries offer, induce would-be migrants to try ever more sophisticated, creative, expensive, and often riskier means to circumvent border controls and post-entry enforcement efforts [...] creating a lucrative market for those who operate outside the law. The Migration Policy Institute's Transatlantic Council on Migration convened to explore how governments can meaningfully address this powerful market for <b>illegal</b> entry and <b>employment.</b> A series of Council reports published {{over the past few weeks}} delve into the migration "bad actors" that fuel and profit from illegality, examining practical policy solutions that can shrink the space in which they operate...|$|R
40|$|Spain {{is one of}} the European {{countries}} where immigration flows during the last decade have increased most noticeably. Spanish labor market institutions and Spanish immigration policy exhibit some peculiarities which may be relevant when analyzing the impact of immigration. This paper provides a first approximation to the labor market effects of immigrants in Spain {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s, the period in which immigration flows to Spain accelerated. By using alternative datasets, we estimate both the impact of legal and total immigration flows on the employment rates of native workers, with and without the implications of the occupational and geographical mobility of immigrants and native-born workers. Using different samples and estimation procedures, we have not found a significant negative effect of immigration on the employment rates of native workers. The corresponding estimated elasticity is around - 0. 17, when considering only legal immigrants, and is not significant when considering both legal and <b>illegal</b> immigrants.
