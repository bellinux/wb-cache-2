This idea however was luckily all before him again from the moment he crossed the threshold of the little entresol of the Quartier Marboeuf into which she had gathered, as she said, picking them up in a thousand flights and funny little passionate pounces, the makings of a final nest. He recognised in an instant that there really, there only, he should find the boon with the vision of which he had first mounted Chad's stairs. He might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more, in this place, he should know himself [...] "in" [...] hadn't his friend been on the spot to measure the amount to his appetite. Her compact and crowded little chambers, almost dusky, as they at first struck him, with accumulations, represented a supreme <b>general</b> <b>adjustment</b> to opportunities and conditions. Wherever he looked he saw an old ivory or an old brocade, and he scarce knew where to sit for fear of a misappliance. The life of the occupant struck him of a sudden as more charged with possession even than Chad's or than Miss Barrace's; wide as his glimpse had lately become of the empire of [...] "things," [...] what was before him still enlarged it; the lust of the eyes and the pride of life had indeed thus their temple. It was the innermost nook of the shrine--as brown as a pirate's cave. In the brownness were glints of gold; patches of purple were in the gloom; objects all that caught, through the muslin, with their high rarity, the light of the low windows. Nothing was clear about them but that they were precious, and they brushed his ignorance with their contempt as a flower, in a liberty taken with him, might have been whisked under his nose. But after a full look at his hostess he knew none the less what most concerned him. The circle in which they stood together was warm with life, and every question between them would live there as nowhere else. A question came up as soon as they had spoken, for his answer, with a laugh, was quickly: [...] "Well, they've got hold of me!" [...] Much of their talk on this first occasion was his development of that truth. He was extraordinarily glad to see her, expressing to her frankly what she most showed him, that one might live for years without a blessing unsuspected, but that to know it at last for no more than three days was to need it or miss it for ever. She was the blessing that had now become his need, and what could prove it better than that without her he had lost himself? ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} anticipatory and in-country individual, job, organizational, and non-work variables and their relation-ship with work, interaction, and <b>general</b> repatriation <b>adjustment</b> for U.

Although the topic of expatriate cross-cultural adjustment has received in-creased scholarly attention (e. g., Adler [1986]; Black [1988]; Mendenhall & Oddou [1985]; Tung [1988]), the related area of adjustment after an overseas assignment (repatriation adjustment) has received relatively little systematic investigation.

40|$|In a {{claim for}} loss of support by the spouse of the {{deceased}} breadwinner, the claim will {{be influenced by the}} probable remarriage of the surviving spouse. In light of the recent extension of the traditional concept of family and ‘husband and wife’, the wider term ‘re-partnering’ is suggested, instead of remarriage. If the widow has already entered into a new relationship {{during the course of the}} trial, it is taken into account as a proven fact and not as a contingency, according to the theory on compensating advantages. The right to {{a claim for}} loss of support is not automatically lost due to the re-partnering. The income and life expectancy of the new partner will be taken into account in calculating the extent of the claim. In three Australian jurisdictions, the Northern Territories, Victoria and Queensland, the legislature has promulgated legislation forbidding the use of remarriage as a contingency deduction in a claim for loss of support, irrespective of whether the re-partnering is a reality or just a probability. In general it can be stated that South African courts tend to over-emphasize the influence of probable re-partnering by a widow. In contrast to this, the manner in which re-partnering as a contingency is handled in Australian case law can be recommended as realistic and appropriate. In the recent decision in De Sales v Ingrilli, 1 the High Court of Australia held that in cases where remarriage has not yet occurred, it should only be taken into consideration as part of the ‘standard’ <b>adjustment</b> (<b>general</b> contingency <b>adjustment)</b> for uncertain future events, and could no longer be applied as a specific contingency, which tends to be higher than the mentioned <b>general</b> contingency <b>adjustment.</b> The court determined that the <b>general</b> contingency <b>adjustment,</b> which incorporated the remarriage of the widow, should only be five percent...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To explore {{patterns}} {{of change in}} positive affect, <b>general</b> <b>adjustment</b> to lower limb amputation, and self-reported disability from rehabilitation admission to 15 months post-discharge; to examine whether goal pursuit and goal adjustment tendencies predict either initial status or rates of change in these outcomes, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Design: Prospective cohort study with four time points (T 1 = on admission; T 2 = 6 weeks post-discharge; T 3 = 6 months post-discharge; T 4 = 15 months post-discharge). Setting: Inpatient rehabilitation. Participants: Consecutive sample of 98 persons aged 18 years and over with major lower limb amputation. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Positive affect subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS); <b>general</b> <b>adjustment</b> subscale of Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales-Revised (TAPES-R); World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule Version 2. 0 (WHODAS 2. 0). Results: Positive affect decreased from T 1 to T 4 for the overall sample, while <b>general</b> <b>adjustment</b> increased; self-reported disability scores remained stable over this period. Stronger goal pursuit tendencies were associated with greater positive affect at T 1, stronger goal adjustment tendencies were associated with more favourable initial scores on each outcome examined. With regard to rates of change, stronger goal pursuit tendencies buffered against decreases in positive affect and promoted decreases in self-reported disability over time, while stronger goal adjustment tendencies enhanced increases in <b>general</b> <b>adjustment</b> to lower limb amputation. Conclusions: Greater use of goal pursuit and goal adjustment strategies appears to promote more favourable adjustment to lower limb amputation over time {{across a range of}} important rehabilitation outcomes...|$|E

This study is a relational research. The sample of the study consisted of 257 bank workers who were working in 34 branches in the centre of Eskiï¬‚ehir.

The findings revealed that the emotional exhaution, the deparsonalization, and the personal accomplish- ment levels of the bank workers were significant predictors of their personal, social and ge- neral adjustment levels. Also, the emotional exhaution sub-dimension was the best predic- tor of personal, social and <b>general</b> <b>adjustment</b> levels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{expatriate}} adjustment researches in search of a theoretical framework for studies of teachers' cross-cultural experiences, which have not been explored much in past researches and have not received theoretical considerations. Based on Mendenhall's (1996) observation that there are significant parallels between expatriate managers and foreign TAs at American graduate schools, who share a variety of common grounds with teachers engaging in teaching at overseas schools, I expected that some aspects of expatriate adjustment studies would give insights into researches on such teachers. Although a theoretical confusion exists among expatriate researches concerning the definition of the concept of adjustment, it is common practice that expatriate adjustment is treated as a multi-faceted phenomenon, including work, interaction and <b>general</b> <b>adjustments.</b> For each adjustment, there are antecedents including individual, organizational, and contextual variables. These concepts may be utilized in future researches on teachers' overseas teaching experiences.
