The author considers a matter of style-based control model for a multi-fingered robot hand grasping an object with a known geometric characteristics.

The author applied Simulink/SimMechanics, Support package Arduino and Inventor software packages to facilatate and integrated the design of contact force gripper systems. The advance of PID control is used to control dynamics motions of the five <b>fingered</b> <b>gripper</b> systems. The multifunction finger’s gripper is developed to handle the various components. Contact force between fingertips and object surface is computed using the Hooke law concept. The analysis of experiment result shows the optimum of contact forces are achieved to hold the object.

The performance of three famously used membership functions is compared to identify their behavior in lifting a defined object shape.

40|$|Most {{parts in}} this {{research}} are dedicated to control of multi <b>finger</b> <b>grippers</b> with emphasis on the finger tips or finger joints. By controlling a multi <b>finger</b> <b>gripper,</b> vye enable the gripper to handle an object; in another words, controlling a multi <b>finger</b> <b>gripper</b> can be viewed in terms of controlling an object's pose and the forces between the object and its environment. Hence, an object pose controller with feedback from an object pose sensor suits multi <b>finger</b> <b>gripper</b> control. Also due to the non-linear dynamic system behavior in the joints of most multi <b>finger</b> <b>grippers,</b> an effective, easily-adaptable joint controller is employed. The paper discusses the object pose controller with great detail in a new joint controller.

The performance {{and stability of}} the proposed control scheme is verified through mathematical derivations and computer simulation. These verifications indicate that the direct-drive VR <b>finger</b> <b>gripper</b> control has robustness despite certain parameters variations and modelling uncertainties. A novel two-finger gripper based on VR driving principle is also introduced. This kind of gripper has certain advantages over the conventional permanent magnet voice coil gripper, the most notable advantages are the ease of construction, high robustness and very low cost. The work described {{is the first of}} its kind in carrying out passivity based control for a direct-drive VR actuator. In the study, the flux and torque behaviour of a mutually-coupled VR gripper was investigated, and its state dynamic equations were derived. Then its flux and torque models were constructed. A similar two-finger VR gripper was fabricated and its characteristics were measured. The PBC controller is designed to regulate the flux linking through the magnetic circuit of the VR <b>finger</b> <b>gripper.</b> Computer simulation and hardware implementation were carried out.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} devising a high speed single gripper which can provide all necessary gripping tasks required to assemble a gas regulator. This is novel in {{that the creation of}} a single gripper that can be precisely controlled to grasp a range of engineering components of widely different handling characteristics has not, to the author's knowledge, been previously studied. A novel feature of the investigated high speed gripper is the inclusion of a prismatic sliding element {{at the end of each}} fmger to facilitate the handling of large and small compliant components typically found in the assembly products such as a domestic gas regulator. Also, a unique vacuum system on the fingertips griper was created to pick up quite small engineering components such as a support plastic component, and 'O'rings. The fmgers are to be controlled in a manner which mimics the kinematics and dynamics of the thumb, middle finger and index finger of a human hand. This mimicry is required to design the correct motions and tactile forces necessary to grasp delicate and non-delicate engineering components. The design of the dexterous gripper finger is validated in simulation results as proof that this gripper fmger design can achieve the best performance. The grasping control method was extended to control of the trajectory gripper, the prismatic sliding elements and vacuum system. So the methods could be used in future research.

40|$|For {{the last}} ten years a {{miniaturisation}} process has spread in many different technical fields. This trend moved from the pressure of the electronic industry that crated a series of new products. These products present a set of novel problems to be solved for their manufacturing, handling and assemblying. Microassembly is one of the topic under a deep study and the research to automate the assembly operations would reduce its costs allowing a wide diffusion of these microproducts. This work focuses on the study and characterisation of 3 different mechanical grippers: a 2 <b>fingers</b> <b>gripper,</b> and two 3 fingers one, the first is a planar one while the second works in an out-of-plane condition. This last gripper is the more complex and requested for an analytical and FEM study of its capability of performing a forced peg-in-hole operation. The work continued by designing the supports and interfaces for all the grippers and in several tests to evaluate the hysteresis of the devices. All the grippers have been controlled via stepper motors, whose control has been developed within this thesis. Concerning the planar grippers the force is transmitted by using bowdens/wires, while the out-of-plane gripper is actuated by driving belt and two pulleys and srew-die coupling. In conclusion, the planar 2 and 3 <b>finger</b> <b>grippers</b> demonstrated a good compliance, particularly interested for peg-in-hole with clearance, while the out-of-plane gripper was able to supply a high force, particularly important in forced peg-in-hole operations...|$|R

Programming by Demonstration is a means to let users program robots simply by demonstrating a task like putting a table or composing an object to a system that observes, interprets and then maps the performed user action to a given manipulator.

After the demonstration, the system interprets and stores the recorded actions segmenting them into meaningful parts like grasps of objects or sticking objects to others. Due to sensor errors and the complexity of the problems, the system puts queries concerning grasp types or object positions. A robot should then be able to perform the same actions in a likewise environment. So far, execution has shown good results in simulation.

The first measurement method was based on the post factum image processing of video recordings, while the second and the third method used devices that were attached to the finger and equipped with analogue and digital sensors, which is similar to a miniature goniometer with a computer interface. The results showed that people only use 79 - 82 % of the active range of motion of phalangeal articulations. Additionally, there was a 6 % difference between the current measurement results and the data available from previously reported measurements.
