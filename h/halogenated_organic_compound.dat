Most methyl iodide sources derive from biological activity in oceans and soils with very few abiotic mechanisms proposed in the literature. In this study we report that synthetic manganese oxide (birnessite δ-MnO 2) can catalyze the formation of methyl iodide in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and iodide. Methyl iodide formation was only observed at acidic pH (4 – 5) where iodide is oxidized to iodine and NOM is adsorbed on δ-MnO 2. The effect of δ-MnO 2, iodide and NOM concentrations, nature of NOM and ionic strength was investigated. High concentrations of methyl iodide were formed in experiments conducted with the model compound pyruvate. The Lewis acid property of δ-MnO 2 leads to a polarization of the iodine molecule, and catalyzes the reaction with natural organic matter.

The present day synthesis of organophosphorus compounds is a multi-step process in which P[subscript 4] is first chlorinated to generate PCl[subscript 3], which in turn is functionalized by reaction with an appropriate Grignard or organolithium reagent, or by treatment with a <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> and a powerful reducing agent.

In this work, a couple of flow injection systems were developed and optimized for the potentiometric determination of fluoride to monitor a rotating biological contactor (RBC) bioreactor and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with offline and online sampling. Both the RBC and the SBR bioreactors were set up for the biodegradation of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> 2 fluorophenol and, as fluoride was a degradation byproduct, the process was monitored by following up its concentration.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of mixed waste matrices contained at Department of Energy sites that require treatment preclude a single, universal treatment technology {{capable of handling}} sludges, solids, heterogeneous debris, aqueous and organic liquids and soils. Versatility of the treatment technology, volume reduction and containment of the radioactive component of the mixed waste streams are three criteria to be considered when evaluating potential treatment technologies. The ChemChar thermolytic detoxification process being developed under this R and D contract is a thermal, chemically reductive technology that converts the organic portion of a mixed waste stream to an energy-rich synthesis gas while simultaneously absorbing volatile inorganic species (metals and acid gases) on a macroporous, carbon-based char. The latter is mixed with the waste stream prior to entering the reactor. Substoichiometric amounts of oxidant are fed into the top portion of the cylindrical reactor generating a thin, radial thermochemical reaction zone. This zone generates all the necessary heat to promote the highly endothermic reduction of the organic components in the waste in the lower portion of the reactor, producing, principally, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The solid by-product is a regenerated carbon char that, depending on the inorganic loading, is capable for reuse. The in situ scrubbing of contaminants by the char within the reactor coupled with a char filter for final polishing produce an exceptionally clean synthesis gas effluent suitable for on-site generation of heat, steam or electricity. Despite the elevated temperatures in the thermochemical reaction zone, the reductive nature of the process precludes formation of nitrogen oxides and <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> by-products...|$|E
30|$|Nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) {{have been}} widely used in various studies for the {{decontamination}} of water. It was recognized to be an auspicious adsorbent in the treatment of water contaminated with Cr (VI) (Singh et al. 2011), As (V) (Du et al. 2014), Cd (II) (Boparai et al. 2011), nitrate (Singh et al. 2012 a) and PO 43 − (Almeelbi and Bezbaruah 2012) and <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> (Xu et al. 2013). Low-cost, low noxious, small footprint and easy to get are some of the advantages of material which can fulfill the requirements for environmental remediation application. The techniques of NZVI are very effective in treatment of both organic and inorganic contaminants (Sleiman et al. 2016; Liu and Lowry 2006). In situ and ex situ applications, iron nanoparticles provide enormous flexibility and were also proved as a sensitive material in permeable reactive barriers. However, there are still some problems associated with practical applications of nanoparticles such as nanoparticles tend to aggregate and suffer from the absence of robustness under oxic conditions and mechanical strength (Sleiman et al. 2016). In addition, without any proper supportive materials, a direct use of NZVI in water remediation application causes iron pollution in water as well as also loses its efficiency due to its tiny particle size. Hence, in order to avoid these issues, {{it is very important to}} load NZVI onto proper supporting materials for the treatment of contaminated water (Zhu et al. 2009). Large surface area, high surface reactivity, and pore size distribution make activated carbon as widely used adsorbent for water and advanced wastewater treatment. When activated carbon modified by iron, it can be an excellent adsorbent and also exhibit magnetic behavior. Due to this ability, under an external magnetic field, these are easily separable from the liquid phase (Lv et al. 2012). To prepare activated carbon supported NZVI (AC/NZVI) and analyze its effectiveness in PO 43 − removal from water were the objectives of this study. Activated carbon was chosen as supporting materials for NZVI because of its porous structure and excellent properties in mechanical strength.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to aid in the}} development of Remedial Extraction And Catalytic Hydrodehalogenation (REACH), a green remediation technology used to remove and destroy <b>halogenated</b> hydrophobic <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> from soil. REACH has no secondary waste streams, uses an environmentally benign solvent, and aims to catalytically destroy rather than transfer the organic contaminants into a different phase. In this thesis, a bench-top semicontinuous model of the proposed remediation technology was constructed and used to extract the model contaminant, 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene, from soil and to convert it to an acceptable end product, cyclohexane. Palladium was used as a catalyst for hydrodehalogenation, which converted the tetrachlorobenzene to benzene. Rhodium was used to catalyze the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. A novel method, ultraviolet solvent treatment, was proposed to mitigate catalyst deactivation that occurs because of extracted chemicals contained in the contaminated soil. The goal of this treatment is to degrade organic matter that is suspected of causing catalyst deactivation. The REACH process was found to successfully extract TeCB from the soil, but only partial conversion from TeCB to cyclohexane occurred. Catalyst deactivation was the suspectedcause of the low amount of conversion observed. Hydrogen limitation was also tested as a cause of limited conversion, but was not found to be a contributor. Ultraviolet solvent treatment was tested as a means of mitigating catalyst deactivation. However, the treatment was not effective in making a profound difference in stopping the catalyst from deactivating.

The goal of the project was to investigate the catalytic activity of the material for its effectiveness in the degradation of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and it is the first investigation of this new photocatalyst with halogenated compounds. Model compounds dichloromethane, 1 -chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, and trifluoroacetic acid in aqueous solutions were tested with the photocatalyst under ultraviolet light irradiation, using a batch photolysis reactor system. An improved process for preparing the photocatalysts was developed, which is more effective, faster, and less wasteful for rinsing the catalysts with a solvent exchange done in five hours instead of the original 6 days. The porous material was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption surface area analysis (BET), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The project also involved researching a practical way to follow the reaction progress using the product concentrations of Cl- and F- in solution. Photo degradation kinetics was followed via titration, ion selective electrodes, ion chromatography, and total organic carbon analysis. In a mixture of the three chlorinated compounds, about 84 % of the chlorine present in the compounds was released as chloride ions after 8. 0 hours of irradiation with the catalyst. This was concomitant with a decrease in the pH of the solution. Loss of samples via vaporization and escape into the air was responsible for incomplete photolyzation.
