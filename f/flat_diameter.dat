40|$|This article {{analyses}} the density, spatial distribution, and diameter {{structure of}} two neotropical tree species, Dipteryx odorata (Aubl.) Willd. and Copaifera reticulata Ducke, in undisturbed forests, logged forests, and forests {{used for the}} extraction of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). Both species are commercially harvested for timber and non-timber products which can fetch high prices on national and international markets. In undisturbed forests, both species display a low tree density, a random adult tree distribution pattern and a <b>flat</b> <b>diameter</b> structure, or one biased towards larger trees. The random spatial distribution pattern did not vary in {{the three types of}} forests analysed, whereas individual density and diameter structure did. The NTFP extraction areas exhibited the highest population densities for both species. In the logged forests, there was a lower density of very large D. odorata trees, while the areas used for D. odorata seed extraction showed a drastic reduction in the frequency of young trees. The results of this study seem to suggest that oil extraction from C. reticulata does not have any effect on the regeneration of that species, whereas D. odorata seed collection could affect the viability of populations.

40|$|Controversy exists {{about the}} timing of surgery in {{neonates}} and infants with congenital anomalies such as refluxing and/or obstructing megaureters and ectopic ureteroceles. Discussion acuminates to the fact whether or not early reconstruction causes irreversible damage to the urodynamic properties of the bladder. Between 1986 and 1992, 49 neonates and infants with obstructing or refluxing megaureters and 23 neonates and infants with ectopic ureteroceles have been operated in our hospital with a mean follow-up of 7. 3 years. Reimplant surgery consisted of a modified Politano Leadbetter procedure, ureterocele surgery consisted of complete excision of the ureterocele, including the urethral part, with reconstruction of the urethra, bladder neck and bladder base combined with ureteral reimplants. Urodynamically no unexpected changes or deteriorisation have been seen in any of the patients. Bladder capacity for age, especially in the reflux group, averages 200 %. Two of the ureterocele patients needed clean intermittent catheterisation for several years. Results of reflux cure in megaureter surgery were disappointing in ureters with a <b>flat</b> <b>diameter</b> between 6 and 9 mm's that were not recalibrated leading to the conclusion that in young children recalibration of the distal ureter should be done from 6 mm's upwards. No post-operative ureteral obstruction was observed in any of the cases. The conclusion is that early major reconstructions of the lower urinary tract causes no specific harm to the urodynamic properties of the bladder and pelvic floor, provided that the surgery is performed by specialised pediatric urological surgeons. The reported urodynamic problems in this patient group are probably related to lack of experience to deal with dysfunctional voiding habits that are quite common in these children, also after successful surgery. These micturation problems are not related to the surgical procedures, they are the result of pre-existing urodynamic changes of bladder function in these childre...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by diverse assemblages {{of plant and animal}} species compared to temperate forests. Corollary to this general rule is that most tree species, whether valued for timber or not, occur at low densities (< 1 adult tree ha(- 1)) or may be locally rare. In the Brazilian Amazon, many of the most highly valued timber species occur at extremely low densities yet are intensively harvested with little regard for impacts on population structures and dynamics. These include big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), ipe (Tabebuia serratifolia and Tabebuia impetiginosa), jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril), and freijo cinza (Cordia goeldiana). Brazilian forest regulations prohibit harvests of species that meet the legal definition of rare - fewer than three trees per 100 ha - but treat all species populations exceeding this density threshold equally. In this paper we simulate logging impacts on a group of timber species occurring at low densities that are widely distributed across eastern and southern Amazonia, based on field data collected at four research sites since 1997, asking: under current Brazilian forest legislation, what are the prospects for second harvests on 30 -year cutting cycles given observed population structures, growth, and mortality rates? Ecologically `rare` species constitute majorities in commercial species assemblages in {{all but one of the}} seven large-scale inventories we analyzed from sites spanning the Amazon (range 49 - 100 % of total commercial species). Although densities of only six of 37 study species populations met the Brazilian legal definition of a rare species, timber stocks of five of the six timber species declined substantially at all sites between first and second harvests in simulations based on legally allowable harvest intensities. Reducing species-level harvest intensity by increasing minimum felling diameters or increasing seed tree retention levels improved prospects for second harvests of those populations with a relatively high proportion of submerchantable stems, but did not dramatically improve projections for populations with relatively <b>flat</b> <b>diameter</b> distributions. We argue that restrictions on logging very low-density timber tree populations, such as the current Brazilian standard, provide inadequate minimum protection for vulnerable species. Population declines, even if reduced-impact logging (RIL) is eventually adopted uniformly, can be anticipated for a large pool of high-value timber species unless harvest intensities are adapted to timber species population ecology, and silvicultural treatments are adopted to remedy poor natural stocking in logged stands.

40|$|During {{defeat of}} high {{velocity}} bullets and fragmentation, large deformations {{have been shown}} to occur on the inside of non-metallic helmet shells. If these deformations contact the underlying head there is the potential to cause injury, termed as Behind Helmet Blunt Trauma (BHBT). A method of assessing BHBT is required to fully understand the protective capability of a helmet system. Existing methods using synthetic head models are limited in their ability to predict injury outcome {{as a result of a}} lack of available injury criteria. The aim of this study was to improve the prediction of cranial fracture outcomes associated with BHBT, focusing on the effect of impact curvature and <b>flat</b> face <b>diameter.</b> Representative impact curvatures and <b>flat</b> face <b>diameters</b> were derived from helmet back face deformation measurements in free-air. An instrumented projectile was used to deliver a repeatable impact to a Bovine Scapula Model (BSM); the BSM being a fracture analogue for the cranium. Cranial fracture risk curves were developed using BSM fracture outcomes. These were developed for the different curvatures and <b>flat</b> face <b>diameters</b> tested, using the parameters of peak impact force, impact velocity, bone thickness considered in conjunction with impact velocity, and the Blunt Criterion (BC). It was concluded that <b>flat</b> impact <b>diameter</b> and radius of curvature should be measured within BHBT assessment to improve the accuracy of cranial fracture prediction. To support application of the risk curves to BHBT assessment methods, it was recommended that fracture outcome should be investigated in terms of the effect of using a rigid projectile when compared to helmet deformation. BHBT assessment methods should consider how to achieve consistent and representative stand-off. Testing should also be completed on full helmet systems as opposed to flat material samples...|$|R
