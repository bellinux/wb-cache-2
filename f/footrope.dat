25|$|The {{vertical}} {{opening of a}} trawl net is created using flotation on the upper edge ("floatline") and weight on the lower edge ("footrope") of the net mouth. The configuration of the <b>footrope</b> varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the <b>footrope</b> configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a closed-off tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary sources}} of impact are the doors, which can weigh several tonnes and create furrows if dragged along the bottom, and the <b>footrope</b> configuration, which usually remains {{in contact with}} the bottom across the entire lower edge of the net. Depending on the configuration, the <b>footrope</b> may turn over large rocks or boulders, {{possibly}} dragging them along with the net, disturb or damage sessile organisms or rework and re-suspend bottom sediments. These impacts result in decreases in species diversity and ecological changes towards more opportunistic organisms. The destruction has been likened to clear-cutting in forests.|$|E
25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the <b>footrope</b> can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.|$|E
5000|$|An {{optional}} {{final stage}} for the permanent protection of [...] "served" [...] rope is to paint the outer layer of twine {{with a mixture of}} tar, varnish and black paint. This needs renewing periodically, and going aloft to paint <b>footropes,</b> shrouds, stays, and other served rigging is one of the regular maintenance tasks on many tall ships.|$|R
5000|$|The single-strand stopper knot is...variety of knob knots. Generally it is tied as a {{terminal}} knot {{in the end}} of a rope, where it forms a knob or bunch, the general purpose of which is to prevent unreeving. It is found in the ends of running rigging. It secures the end of a sewing thread; it provides a handhold or a foothold in bell ropes and <b>footropes.</b> It adds weight {{to the end of a}} heaving line, and it is often employed decoratively, but it should not be used to prevent unlaying and fraying except in small cord, twine, and the like, as a whippingis in every way preferable for large and valuable material.

5000|$|Square rig {{features}} sails {{set square}} to the mast from a yard, a spar running transversely {{in relation to}} the hull (athwartships). In ships built using older designs of the square rig, sailors would have to climb the rigging and walk out on <b>footropes</b> under the yard to furl and unfurl the sails. In a modern square rigged design the crew can furl and unfurl sails by remote control from the deck. Some cruising craft with fore-and-aft sails will carry a small square sail with top and bottom yards that are easily rigged and hauled up from the deck; such a sail is used as the only sail when running downwind under storm conditions, as the vessel becomes much easier to handle than under its usual sails, even if they are severely reefed (shortened). A modern version of this rig is the German-engineered DynaRig which has its yards fixed permanently in place on its rotating masts and has twice the efficiency of operation of the traditional square rig.|$|R
60|$|He broke two of {{his nails}} before he {{finished}} his task and dropped from the <b>footrope</b> to the Tyee's deck, and the liner had sunk to a gleaming white blur and a smoke-trail {{on the rim of}} the sea before they had reefed the foresail and once more got way on her. Then Prescott grinned at Jimmy as he glanced toward the fading smear of vapor.|$|E
60|$|But {{they must}} secure the main gaff, and {{clutching}} at the boom above his head, he swung {{himself up and}} worked along to its outer end, which stretched over the stern. A <b>footrope</b> ran below the spar; one could balance oneself by its help and he vaguely distinguished somebody close by. It was, no doubt, Wyndham, because his clothes looked white. There was no use in shouting. The uproar drowned one's voice; besides, their job was plain. They must get a rope round {{the end of the}} gaff and lash it fast.|$|E
6000|$|Half-dazed and sullenly savage Black {{had still}} sense enough {{to reflect that}} it would be little use to expect that the harassed mate would listen to reason then. Clawing his way up the ratlines he laid his chest upon the main-topsail-yard and worked his way out to {{the lower end of the}} long {{inclined}} spar. Here, still faint and dizzy, he hung with the <b>footrope</b> jammed against his heel, as he felt for the gasket that held the canvas to the yard. Swinging through the blackness across a space of tumbling foam he felt a horrible unsteadiness. There were other men behind him, for he could hear them swearing and coughing until a black wall of banging canvas sank beneath him when somebody roared: [...] "Sheet her home!" ...|$|E
50|$|Fish {{was caught}} {{by means of the}} seine net, which {{together}} with the curing at the fish pallices had been introduced by English settlers in the period. Two boats, the seine boat and the so-called “follower” were used. The seine boat, a large boat pulled by perhaps a dozen or more oars, carried the net, which was often 300-400 yards long. An experienced fisherman acted as a “huer” by directing fishing operations from suitable points of vantage. From high land, the huer could see the shoals of pilchards clearly, and he directed the “skipper” of the seine boat, by suitable signs to the location of a likely shoal. On a given signal, the net was shot around the shoal by the seine boat, and in the meantime, the free end of the net was picked up by the “follower”, with a crew of perhaps five or six, and the two ends of the net were brought together. Weighted pieces of timber were placed to prevent the fish from escaping. The escaping <b>footropes</b> of the net were gradually drawn up until the fish were completely enclosed, and by means of baskets the fish were transferred from the net to the boat, and fishing continued until no more fish could be managed, or if catches were poor. The pilchards were preserved with salt in the “pallices” or occasionally smoked.|$|R
60|$|The Tyee was {{comparatively}} fast, and, {{under all}} the sail they could pile on to her, excepting the main gaff-topsail, she drove {{along with a}} wide curl of foam under her lee bow and the froth lapping high and white on her side. Then by degrees the long roll of the Pacific heaved itself up into steep, blue-sided seas with tops of incandescent whiteness, and as she lurched over them the spray whirled in filmy clouds from her plunging bows. Still the breeze freshened, and by noon they hove her to with jibs aback while they hauled two reefs down in her mainsail, and it became necessary for somebody to crawl out {{to the end of}} its tilting boom, which stretched a good fathom beyond her stern. Prescott was a little too old for that work; Tom Wheelock held the wheel; and the Siwash deck-hand was busy forward. Jimmy laughed as he swung himself up to the <b>footrope.</b>|$|E
50|$|The very lightest {{bridges of}} this type consist of a single <b>footrope</b> and nothing more. These are tightropes and slacklines, and require skill to use. More commonly, the <b>footrope</b> is {{accompanied}} by one or two handrail ropes, connected at intervals by vertical side ropes. This style is used by mountaineers. A slightly heavier variation has two ropes supporting a deck, and two handrail ropes. Handrails are necessary because these bridges are prone to oscillate side to side and end to end. Rarely, the <b>footrope</b> (or <b>footrope</b> plus handrails) is combined with an overhead rope similar to a zip-line (see also Ropeway).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{deckhand}} {{standing on}} both the main <b>footrope</b> and the Flemish horse.|$|E
50|$|The Flemish horse, {{being at}} the outer end of the yard, often made of thinner rope and {{attached}} only at its ends, is somewhat unstable compared with the main <b>footrope.</b> This, together with the requirement to step off the main <b>footrope</b> {{in order to get}} onto it means that a place on the Flemish horse is generally reserved for the more experienced sailors working on a yard.|$|E
5000|$|Sailors {{get onto}} the footropes from the ratlines up the mast. Lower down, where {{everything}} is bigger, {{there may be a}} small length of <b>footrope</b> bridging the gap between ratlines and yard; this is especially necessary on the windward side when the yards are braced hard round, as the gap becomes quite large. Because the yard must be free to move, this <b>footrope</b> is rather loose and hence unstable. Higher up the gap is small enough to step across, though it may be a stretch when hard-braced. Since the <b>footrope</b> will react to the extra weight placed on it, the practice on some ships is to call [...] "stepping on port" [...] (or starboard) before getting on, to warn those already using it.|$|E

50|$|Each yard on {{a square}} or gaff rigged sailing ship is {{equipped}} with a <b>footrope</b> for sailors to stand on while setting or stowing the sails.|$|E
5000|$|Once on the yard, modern sailors {{are able}} to clip their {{harnesses}} onto a safety wire that runs along it (on most ships they will have been unsecured until this point) - in the past, crews enjoyed no such protection. The sailors will now edge out along the <b>footrope</b> until they are spread evenly along the yard. Leaning forwards over the yard helps with balancing on the <b>footrope,</b> but where the buntlines {{come down to the}} yard it is necessary to lean back or crouch down to get around them. The outermost member of the crew must step off the <b>footrope</b> (calling [...] "stepping off starboard" [...] (or port) if that is the practice) across a small gap onto the flemish horse in order to reach the end of the yard where the clew of the sail is to be hauled up or let go.|$|E
50|$|A Flemish {{horse is}} a <b>footrope</b> on a square rigged sailing ship that is {{found at the}} extreme outer end of the yard. The main <b>footrope</b> runs along the whole length of the yard, but because of its length the angle upwards to where it is {{attached}} is quite shallow, and thus it is too high to stand on for some distance inwards. Sailors on {{this part of the}} yard stand on the Flemish horse instead, which being shorter hangs down more and hence is low enough to stand on.|$|E

5000|$|In French, a {{rudimentary}} simple suspension bridge is known {{by one of}} three names, depending on its form: pont himalayen ("Himalayan bridge": a single <b>footrope</b> and handrails on both sides, usually without a deck); pont de singe ("monkey bridge: a <b>footrope</b> with overhead rope); and tyrolienne ("Tyrolean": a zip-line). [...] Zip-lines can be traversed by hanging below, or walked (by individuals with exceptional balance). A more developed version of the pont himalayen, provided with a deck between a pair of main cables, {{is known as a}} passerelle himalayenne (French, [...] "Himalayan footbridge"). [...] Examples of this type include two bridges at Lac de Monteynard-Avignonet in the French Alps; these bridges are exceptionally long, for bridges of this type.|$|E
50|$|Trawling is {{controversial}} {{because of its}} environmental impacts. Because bottom trawling involves towing heavy fishing gear over the seabed, it can cause large-scale destruction on the ocean bottom, including coral shattering, damage to habitats and removal of seaweed.The primary sources of impact are the doors, which can weigh several tonnes and create furrows if dragged along the bottom, and the <b>footrope</b> configuration, which usually remains {{in contact with the}} bottom across the entire lower edge of the net. Depending on the configuration, the <b>footrope</b> may turn over large rocks or boulders, possibly dragging them along with the net, disturb or damage sessile organisms or rework and re-suspend bottom sediments. These impacts result in decreases in species diversity and ecological changes towards more opportunistic organisms. The destruction has been likened to clear-cutting in forests.|$|E
50|$|Because the <b>footrope</b> {{provides}} a rather narrow area to stand on, {{it can cause}} sore feet after a while. Modern sailors joining a tall ship are advised to take footwear with a solid sole that will spread the load, rather than the flexible deck shoes and seaboots used on yachts.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, the <b>footrope</b> was {{the rope}} sewn along {{the lower edge}} of a square sail, and the rope below the yards was called the horse or Flemish horse. These terms will be {{encountered}} when reading the classic 18th and 19th century sailing manuals, and may still be used today when referring to older ships.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the term is not clear. There is some {{evidence}} that at one time all footropes were known as [...] "horses" [...] (e.g., in German, the <b>footrope</b> is to this day called [...] "Fußpferd", i.e. [...] "foot horse"). It has been suggested that Flemish horses (i.e. animals from Flanders in Belgium) were regarded as being more unruly than most, and hence the unstable outer [...] "horse" [...] acquired this name.|$|E
5000|$|The diamond knot (or knife lanyard knot) is a knot for {{forming a}} {{decorative}} loop {{on the end}} of a cord such as on a lanyard. [...] A similar knot, also called the diamond knot, is a multistrand stopper knot, that is similar in appearance (although the <b>footrope</b> knot is really more similar, but it is simply an upside down diamond knot). To avoid confusion, it is advisable to call this knot the knife lanyard knot. This knot is a four strand diamond knot implemented in two strands. The knife lanyard knot is, [...] "tied alike," [...] the Chinese button knot, [...] "but they are worked differently." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} set and stow the square sails, the crew must climb aloft {{and spread out}} along the yards. To do this, they stand in footropes {{suspended}} beneath the yard and balance themselves between that and the yard itself. The person working {{on the end of}} the yardarm has a separate <b>footrope</b> known as the flemish horse. Jackstays run along the top of the yard - the sail will be bent on to one of them, but a second one is often provided (particularly on larger yards) for the crew to hold on to. These are usually steel rods, but stiff cordage stretched between the yardarms was used in the past.|$|E
50|$|Scottish seining, {{sometimes}} called fly dragging, has the net attached to two long ropes usually made of leaded polypropylene and around 3 km in length. The net is deployed in a triangular fashion {{with the first}} rope attached to a marker buoy, the dhan, to which the boat returns to complete the set. Both ropes are then winched in as the boat steams ahead slowly. Winch speed is gradually increased as the net gets closer to keep the net moving forward and also to herd the fish into the net. Like the trawl, floats and weighted <b>footrope</b> keep {{the mouth of the}} net open and in contact with the seabed. This method of fishing takes place on grounds on the continental shelf and not in deep sea. Seine netting is for all forms of whitefish.|$|E
50|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer.

5000|$|Although square sails {{are mostly}} worked from the deck, {{in order to}} be {{properly}} stowed (and released from this stowage) they must be folded by hand and tied to the yard with gaskets. This requires sailors to go aloft, during which time they stand on the footropes. The ropes are made of either fibre or wire, and are almost always protected from wear by being wormed, parcelled and served, so that the visible outer coating is of tarred thin line. They are attached to the yard via the jackstays or [...] "handrails" [...] to which the sails are also fastened, tied on with many turns of thin line. The inner parts of the <b>footrope</b> are held up towards the yard by vertical lines called stirrups; one of these is visible in the picture on the right. Also visible is the flemish horse that the outermost sailor stands on; because this yard is quite small the flemish horse actually extends fairly close to the centre.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{returning}} to Indefatigable, Hornblower {{is involved with}} a mission planned by Captain Pellew to take the French corvette Papillon. Hornblower is set to command Indefatigables jolly boat. His job in the raid is to board Papillon after the other boats do, climb the mast and loose the main topsail so Papillon can sail out to meet Indefatigable. Before setting out, Hornblower practises his task on Indefatigable to try and calm his nerves. While reviewing his men prior to shoving off, a man named Hales mentions to Hornblower that he feels [...] "a bit queer-like." [...] After the boat crews depart, Hales begins having an epileptic seizure. Because {{of the necessity of}} silence, Hornblower strikes Hales with the tiller of his boat. On boarding the ship Hornblower and his men are frustrated by the absence of a <b>footrope</b> along the yardarm. Hornblowers fear of heights and poor balance cause him to freeze, until he reminds himself that he acted decisively enough when laying out Hales; to withdraw now would be an act of extreme cowardice. Motivated by this act of emotional self-flagellation Hornblower runs unaided along the yardarm and looses the topsail. During the fighting the jolly boat is lost, with Hales still aboard, but Papillon is taken as a prize of Indefatigable. Hornblower feels bad about the loss of Hales, without whom Hornblower believes he would never have found the courage to complete his task. Jackson claims that Hales would have never made a decent seaman anyway. Given the success of their mission Hornblower realises the loss of the jolly boat will not be held against him, but still regrets the inevitable death of Hales.|$|E

To estimate survey trawl capture efficiency for red king crab, an experiment was conducted with an auxiliary net (fitted with its own heavy chain-link <b>footrope)</b> that was attached beneath the trawl to capture crabs escaping under the survey trawl <b>footrope.</b> Capture probability was then estimated by fitting a model to the proportion of crabs captured and crab size data.

40|$|Three {{aspects of}} a survey bottom trawl performance— 1) trawl {{geometry}} (i. e., net spread, door spread, and headrope height); 2) <b>footrope</b> distance off-bottom; and 3) bridle distance off-bottom—were compared among hauls by using either of two autotrawl systems (equal tension and net symmetry) and hauls conducted with towing cables of equal length and locked winches. The effects of environmental conditions, vessel heave, crabbing (i. e., the difference between vessel heading and actual vessel course over ground), and bottom current on trawl performance with three trawling modes were investigated. Means {{and standard deviations of}} trawl geometry measures were not significantly different between autotrawl and locked-winch systems. Bottom trawls performed better with either autotrawl system as compared to trawling with locked winches by reducing the variance and increasing the symmetry of the <b>footrope</b> contact with the bottom. The equal tension autotrawl system was most effective in counteracting effects of environmental conditions on <b>footrope</b> bottom contact. <b>Footrope</b> bottom contact was most inf luenced by environmental conditions during tows with locked winches. Both of the autotrawl systems also reduced the variance and increased the symmetry of bridle bottom contact. Autotrawl systems proved to be effective in decreasing the effects of environmental factors on some aspects of trawl performance and, as a result, have the potential to reduce among-haul variance in catchability of survey trawls. Therefore, by incorporating an autotrawl system into standard survey procedures, precision of survey estimates of relative abundanc...|$|E
40|$|The knots {{used to make}} fishing nets are {{asymmetric}} which, in {{most cases}} for trawls, means they present either a positive or negative angle of attack (AOA) in horizontal panels, producing hydrodynamic side forces and changes in system geometry. The extent of associated displacement and drag were quantified in a flume tank using four, full-scale penaeid (shrimp/prawn) trawls with the same generic design, but with all possible combinations of knot orientation in {{the top and bottom}} panels. All four trawls had the same distance between the <b>footrope</b> and flume-tank floor at the wing end during a flow of 1. 2 ms− 1, but the trawl with both panels at a positive AOA had a significantly greater <b>footrope</b> height at the centre (by up to 13 mm). Further, compared to both trawls with their top panels orientated to have a positive AOA, the two with their top panels producing a negative AOA had up to 27 % lower headlines and 10 % less total drag. Differences were also observed among vertically partitioned drag at the wing ends—depending on knot orientation in the bottom panel, which led to greater force on the headline or <b>footrope</b> when at negative or positive AOAs, respectively. The magnitudes of observed variations in <b>footrope</b> and headline heights and drag are likely to affect the catching and engineering performances of penaeid trawls, and so knot orientation should be considered during attempts at improving selectivity and reducing drag. The results also reiterate a need for consistency among knot orientations to avoid confounding effects during fishery-dependant/independent surveys. © 2016 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of U. S. west coast bottom-trawl effort in relation to areas of prime habitat for rockfish Sebastes spp. were evaluated between 1992 and 2001. Prime trawlable rockfish habitat (PTRH) was defined based on the {{spatial distribution of}} high rockfish catches from logbook data for 1992 – 1995. Bottom-trawl effort was sharply reduced within PTRH after the establishment of maximum trawl <b>footrope</b> diameter restrictions in 2000.
