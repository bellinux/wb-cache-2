30|$|The {{conclusion}} {{from the}} models in Figs.  19 and 20 {{is that the}} highest recovery factor from the reservoir will be realized when the well pattern is drilled first and wells remain capped until all wells are drilled to ensure the sweep and oil-withdrawal patterns are balanced when the production starts. This approach {{will result in the}} highest recovery factor. If wells are switched on before the <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> is completed (e.g., Fig.  19), these will require different rates for optimum production when the <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> is expanded and repeated over a larger area (e.g., Fig.  20).|$|E

However, maintaining delamination free and high productivity in the machining of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) can be a challenge due to the excessive thrust force or the relative low feedrate.

The developed Boundary Element Method (BEM) formulation in calculating the productivity of well or clusters of wells located arbitrarily in an irregularly shaped reservoir was employed in this study to detennine the total oil production for each operator that share a single reservoir. In this example application, two operators of equal area shared one circular oil reservoir. Different operator or section of the reservoir is assigned with different <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern.</b> The section that is developed with a four-spot <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> produces 19 % more oil compared to the section developed with a five-spot pattern.

30|$|Our {{analytical}} streamline simulator {{is based}} on a series of complex potentials which are closed-form solutions for the respective flow elements. The simulator has been validated by comparison with an independent streamline tracing method based on nonlinear differential equations (Weijermars et al. 2016). The analytical simulator can account {{for a wide range of}} initial states, boundary conditions, and transient processes that affect the parameters controlling the fluid flow path during waterflooding. The number of wells and/or geometry of the well patterns, injection and production profiles, and spatial variations in reservoir properties (e.g., heterogeneities, discontinuities) are only limited by computing power. The simulator can visualize waterflooding patterns using any conceivable <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> and variable injection rates. There is no practical constraint for the finite number of wells. Possible flow barriers such as an impervious fault (for example, rendered impermeable due to clay smear and fault gauge) can also be included. We have modeled elsewhere the impact on waterflood sweep of discrete discontinuities like abrupt jumps in reservoir permeability and due to impervious fault barriers in unbounded reservoirs (Weijermars et al. 2016) and in bounded reservoirs (Nelson et al., submitted).|$|E
40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{are fundamental}} {{operations in the}} mining cycle and consti tute {{an important component of}} the mining costs. Rock fragmentation can in principle be managed by means of two options: by increasing or reducing the specific consumption of explosives, or by modifying the <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern.</b> The choice of one or other type of control depends on the relationship between the unit costs of drilling and explosives, and on technical restrictions or regulations imposed by different reasons. It is then necessary to identify the link between the blast design and some factors affecting the downstream processing of the product. This paper analyzes the theoretical basis aimed at evaluating the main parameters involved when organizing a production blast in open pit quarries. In particular, a method developed through the analysis of the results in a large number of limestone open pit quarries in Italy is described and commented.

The usage, problems, processing and efficiency of this system in a mining environment is also explored. It also looks at the level of accuracies provided by this system. Before the introduction of RTK GPS into the blasting process, the current blast fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to crushers on the Mine and an unfriendly floor conditions resulting in excessive sheeting of digging floor to prevent tyre damage. It was decided to use RTK GPS to improve the fragmentation through accurate drill depth and design pattern in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/hr, a 5 % increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50 % decrease in rock breaker hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheeting costs respectively.

Various factors influence the blast vibration being produced from the blasting practices such as the pattern of blasting, <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{quality and quantity of}} explosives being used, delay pattern etc. Also the vibration which is being generated by the blasting practices is comprised of two types of waves, body and surface waves. Some of the after blast features are also required to be studied {{in order to determine the}} safe blasting practices. Three types of adverse effects are generally associated with the blasting practices, Air blast, Fly rock and Ground vibration, However the amplitude, frequency and duration of the ground vibration is determined by the non-controllable(local geology, rock characteristic and distances of the structure from blast site) and controllable parameters(Charge weight, Delay interval, Type of explosive,Direction of blast progression, Coupling, confinement, Spatial distribution of charges, Burden, spacing and specification and specific charge). For the purpose of determination of the safe Charge per Delay a number of researchers have given various theories and equations. The feasibility of the CMRI equation is studied in this report.

Although the original objectives were to focus on methane cycling, the authors pursued an opportunity to study sulfur cycling in aquifer systems, a process of much greater importance in microbial activity and survival, and in the mobility of metals in the subsurface. Furthermore, sulfur cycling is pertinent to the Subsurface Science Program`s study at Cerro Negro, New Mexico. The study combined field and laboratory approaches and microbiological, molecular, geochemical, and hydrogeological techniques. During drilling operations, sediments were collected aseptically and assayed for a variety of microorganisms and metabolic capabilities including total counts, viable aerobic heterotrophs, total anaerobic heterotrophs, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfate reduction activity (in situ and in slurries), methanogens, methanotrophs, and Fe- and S-oxidizers, among others.

There are numerous parameters that can be altered to deliver downstream benefits – the key is to determine which changes are appropriate for the rock body in question. A project is currently underway at Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine (Northern Province, South Africa) to improve the operational efficiency through attention to the blasting operation. Previous research suggests changing fragmentation will have an effect on mining efficiency, but no definitive model has been developed directly linking the two. Using data collected during the project, the author developed a sensitivity analysis tool, which defines the effect of changing fragmentation on overall mine efficiency. This prediction model was based partly on theory and partly on empirical information gathered from mine databases and personnel. Over the course of this project, this model was validated through the practical implementation of the theory behind its development. This involved decreasing powder factors through increasing the <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern,</b> thus changing the resulting fragmentation of the muckpile. Subsequently, downstream effects on mining efficiency were monitored and these results were recorded in the model. The proven model was then used to identify areas of opportunity for improvement. In this report two areas are discussed, firstly, the implementation of a doped emulsion replacing ANFO across the mine, and secondly the introduction of electronic detonators. The second option would require further test work to develop confidence in the assumptions made in the model, concerning the effect of timing accuracy on fragmentation.

40|$|Integration {{of dynamic}} data is {{critical}} for reliable reservoir description and has been an outstanding challenge for the petroleum industry. This work develops practical dynamic data integration techniques using streamline approaches to condition static geological models to various kinds of dynamic data, including two-phase production history, interference pressure observations and primary production data. The proposed techniques are computationally efficient and robust, and thus well-suited for large-scale field applications. We can account for realistic field conditions, such as gravity, and changing field conditions, arising from infill <b>drilling,</b> <b>pattern</b> conversion, and recompletion, etc., during the integration of two-phase production data. Our approach is fast and exhibits rapid convergence even when the initial model {{is far from the}} solution. The power and practical applicability of the proposed techniques are demonstrated with a variety of field examples. To integrate two-phase production data, a travel-time inversion analogous to seismic inversion is adopted. We extend the method via a 'generalized travel-time' inversion to ensure matching of the entire production response rather than just a single time point while retaining most of the quasi-linear property of travel-time inversion. To integrate the interference pressure data, we propose an alternating procedure of travel-time inversion and peak amplitude inversion or pressure inversion to improve the overall matching of the pressure response. A key component of the proposed techniques is the efficient computation of the sensitivities of dynamic responses with respect to reservoir parameters. These sensitivities are calculated analytically using a single forward simulation. Thus, our methods can be orders of magnitude faster than finite-difference based numerical approaches that require multiple forward simulations. Streamline approach has also been extended to identify reservoir compartmentalization and flow barriers using primary production data in conjunction with decline type-curve analysis. The streamline 'diffusive' time of flight provides an effective way to calculate the drainage volume in 3 D heterogeneous reservoirs. The flow barriers and reservoir compartmentalization are inferred based on the matching of drainage volumes from streamline-based calculation and decline type-curve analysis. The proposed approach is well-suited for application {{in the early stages of}} field development with limited well data and has been illustrated using a field example from the Gulf of Mexico...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have been {{following}} 5 grouting rounds at Cyberport shaft and 4 grouting rounds at Sandy Bay shaft. There were some communication problems between the grouting team and the geologists, resulting in missing water inflow measurements. The rock quality was very poor (Q-value 0. 1 – 1), with coarse ash tuff as the most common rock mass in Cyberport, and rhyolitic tuff as the most common rock mass in Sandy Bay. The Q-values were below 1, with Cyberport just a bit higher than Sandy Bay. The rock mass was highly fractured, which was indicated by a low RQD value. Sand and silty infill was found in both shafts. Sandy bay hit a fault zone at grouting 3, with a very jointed rock at various orientations, often clay infill on joints. Micro cement with super plasticizer was the primary grouting material. Water to cement ratio 1 was mostly used. The ratio was sometimes dropped down to 0. 8 and 0. 6 after {{a certain amount of}} micro cement w/c 1 had been pumped. Polyurethane was used to block leakages. Pressure at 40 bar was mostly used as stop criteria. 5 out of 5 grouting rounds in Sandy Bay were with 40 bar as stop criteria, and 6 out of 9 in Cyberport. 60 bar pressure as stop criteria was only used twice, in round 3 a and 5 c at Cyberport. Grouting was normally stopped by overpressure, which means that the pressure exceeded 40 bar. If the stop criteria had been 60 bar, higher amounts of micro cement would most likely have been pumped into the rock mass. The <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> followed a standard description mentioned in the method statement. Every contour hole was placed 1 m from each other, forming the outer circle. Ten holes were placed {{in the middle of the}} shaft. 5 m overlap between the different grouting screens was set as minimum. The water level sometimes fell to alarm level, measured from the piezometer. When this happened, grouting was immediately started to increase the water level, and it worked. Water level started increasing just hours after grouting was started. Material costs were low for both shafts. This is directly related to the small amount of material that was pumped into the rock mass. Infill of sand and silt might be the reason to this. Labour costs are roughly estimated to around 308 000 NOK per day. Delay and deviation from the planned time usage, when it comes to grouting works, will cost the project around 1 130 000 NOK, for the grouting rounds mentioned in this thesis. Sandy Bay only needed one extra grouting round, this at grouting number 2. Cyberport on the other hand, needed four extra grouting rounds, this at grouting number 3, 4 and 5. </p...|$|E
40|$|A common adage in the Explosives Industry goes {{by saying}} that "Blasting is not bombing". One of the key {{differences}} between the two employs of explosive energy lays in the same gap existing between the application of acoustic energy that differentiates noise from music: timing and the distribution of energization in time. While timing in blasting is widely accepted to influence blast induced vibrations, it is still not completely investigated when related to rock fragmentation and downstream benefits. This paper shows a research about this topic, developedon two phases: 1) test blasts at the Experimental Mine of the Research Center of Responsible Mining of the University of São Paulo; 2) development project for large-scale production blasts in an open-cast mine. The first phase of the research was performed attempting to increase the productivity of the experimental mine, by lowering production costs and improving the quality of the product. Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were established to monitor the results. A new blast design method and a more appropriate initiation sequence were designed according to the principles of: i) decomposition of the blast; ii) taking advantage of the free surfaces to favor the movement of the blasted material; iii) simultaneous holes firing as far away as possible, to avoid undesired cooperation of charges that may induce the explosive energy to work with shear effect instead of producing fragmentation. The results show that the proper selection of delay timing leads to significant benefits for rock fragmentation, downstream processes and the quality of final walls. The second phase of the study was a research and development (R&D) project in an open-cast mine with the goal to achieve an average P 80 of 300 mm (11, 8 ") in the run-of-mine (ROM) product without altering the existing budget. The project included several variables in the blast design that were not previously taken into account, such as the orientation of natural joint sets in the rock mass, specific energy of the explosive and firing sequence. The new blast design method considered the directions of natural joint sets and determined the <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> and the firing sequence accordingly to favor the movement of the blasted rock along its preferential direction, to reduce its confinement. At the end of the project, it was achieved an average P 80 of 304 mm (12 ") in the ROM, 50 % lower than the one {{at the beginning of the}} project. The final blast of the project showed a reduction of 3 % of the drill and blast cost, employing the same powder factor and the same drill pattern size used at the beginning of the project.

40|$|Drilling and Blasting is {{a common}} {{technique}} of tunnel driving, either for mining or civil purposes, at least for lengths shorter than 3 - 4 km. The technology is surely "mature", hence it offers a huge variety of cases to be analyzed. The report deals with {{the subject of the}} compliance of the actual blasting results with the design requirements (contour and pull). Three factors are obviously involved: explosive, rock and drilling; the main objective of the report is to asses in some simple cases the relative importance of each of them, and to describe a simple methodology to do that. A number of rounds in mine drifting operations, covering a variety of rock-drilling system-explosive assortments have been carefully surveyed; rock shows important differences from one site to another with respect to the quality class; drilling is performed with manually steered jumbo in some drifts, with computerized jumbo in other drifts; the general blasting pattern is not different from one site to another, but at places pipe charges are used in contour holes, at places fully coupled charges. The evaluation of the influence of the rock on the excavation difficulty is another objective of the study. Difficulty can be inferred from specific drilling work consumption, specific explosive consumption or from both. Drilling consumption, which means the relative fineness of explosive distribution in the rock-mass required in order to obtain a satisfactory blast, has been assumed to be a reliable criterion {{on the basis of the}} narrower dispersion of the data, with respect to explosive consumption. Being the study aimed to classify by relative difficulty the rock types, rather than the operations, the effect of the cross section (whose influence on specific consumption by far exceeds the one of rock type) has to be accounted for by normalizing consumptions, i. e. by defining a normal cross section v/ specific consumption correlation, to be used as a reference line. Rock classes are related to difficulty classes; a wide dispersion is still observable, which indicates that the rock designation criterion based on lithological type should be improved by adding at least a second descriptive element. Anyhow, the simple lithological designation provides a first approximation ranking of the rocks to the intended purpose. The sensitivity of the pattern performances to drilling precision is analyzed in the same way. Tolerance standards for drilling machinery related to <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> features are proposed. Data collected to establish the quality of the results of the blasts are: the overbreak value, the efficiency (actual pull/design pull ratio), the half cast factor of the contour holes. The relationships linking these indicators of quality to the features of the rock, of the drilling system and of the charging are analyzed and discussed. The statistical basis of the study is provided by data collected from a large number of cases, obtained from technical literature and from on site inspections. Analysis has been carried out on rounds of variable cross sections (from few to 160 m 3), with either parallel or inclined hole cuts, blasted using a wide range of explosives and ignition systems. A general methodology to establish the main reasons of observed inaccuracies and to foresee the consequences of changes in the drilling and blasting practice is presented in the conclusion...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{drilling}} is {{a popular}} and cost-effective method of introducing new, more productive pasture species into existing pasture on farms in New Zealand. The technique conserves both time and money, reduces moisture loss {{and the risk of}} soil erosion and offers some management benefits in intensive agricultural systems. Seed drills in New Zealand commonly used for pasture establishment sow seeds in rows at 150 mm centres. While this is an acceptable row spacing for cereal crops, eg. barley and wheat, closer row spacing has been proposed for establishing pastures. However, little research has been carried out to determine optimal row spacing or seeding rates. The benefit of cross-drilling with two passes of the drill, which is a practice thought to overcome the perceived inadequacies of 150 mm row spacing, is also uncertain. This study was designed to investigate the effects of row spacing and cross-drilling, and the relative importance of plant population per unit area and per unit length of drill row on pasture establishment and development. Single pass sowing, at both 150 and 75 mm row spacings together with cross-drilling were compared in an autumn sown field experiment. Two species of contrasting establishment vigour, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and two seeding rates (12 and 23 and 17 and 31 kg ha- 1 for perennial ryegrass and tall fescue respectively) were also compared. The trial was grazed by dairy cattle throughout the measurement periods. Emergence of 84 and 71 % of sown perennial ryegrass and tall fescue seed respectively, resulted in establishment of approximately 400 - 500 and 700 - 800 seedlings m- 2 for medium and high seeding rates respectively for both species. Two years after sowing, medium to high seeding rates offered no advantage in terms of weed suppression or yield compared with low seeding rates. Cross-drilling offered no advantage for either species. Total herbage yield and the proportion of sown species was the same for perennial ryegrass and tall fescue established in either cross-drilled or 150 mm rows. This was the most important result, as far as the farmer is concerned, with potential cost savings of up to $ 100 per hectare by not carrying a second pass of the seed drill required for cross-drilling. The establishment performance of tall fescue in terms of herbage mass and suppression of weeds in the sward was initially improved with closer row spacing. These benefits were not apparent for perennial ryegrass. The advantage gained for fescue from reduced row spacing declined with time and by the second spring after sowing no difference was apparent between 150 and 75 mm row spacing treatments. Thus, overall, drilling method had only a minor influence on botanical composition. Tall fescue was slower establishing and had more clover and weed in the sward compared with perennial ryegrass. This contrast in growth revealed the subtle influences of drilling method and seeding rate on pasture composition. A second trial, sown in the subsequent autumn, investigated the use of nitrogen with tall fescue at the time of sowing in both single pass and cross-drilling. The results supported those found for the effects of <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> in the first trial. The use of nitrogen fertiliser in the damp, cool conditions of late autumn did not benefit sward development. Emergence of tall fescue was poorer at this time. In contrast to the results of Trial 1, increasing the seeding rate resulted in increases in initial seedling population and improved the performance of tall fescue. There was a higher proportion and herbage mass of sown species in the sward sown at the higher seed rate. This suggests that higher seeding rates may be required for tall fescue as conditions at sowing become cooler. However, the early advantage from the higher seeding rates was not apparent 10 months after sowing. Clover emergence was low at 46 and 52 % of sown viable seed for the first and second trials respectively. However, a clover seedling population in excess of 150 plants m- 2 was established in both trials which proved to be an adequate population for development of productive pasture. Drills designed for sowing aggressive species such as perennial ryegrass need not incorporate the option of reducing row spacing from the common 150 mm with the subsequent cost disadvantages. However, the option of reduced row spacing may be appropriate for drills designed for sowing less vigorous alternative species such as tall fescue. Increased seeding rates and cross-drilling should not be necessary for successful establishment of a productive pasture sward of temperate species. This leads to improvements in efficiency of seed drill operation in the field...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} on {{junior high school}} English classes based on the Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories (FIAC) system and its revised versions [10, 11] revealed that more than eighty percent of classroom activities are teacher and pupil talk, that the main flow of verbal interaction between teacher and pupils shows a <b>drill</b> <b>pattern,</b> what types of verbal events tend to occur before and after {{a particular type of}} events, etc. Various calculated ratios, based on the category frequencies, also permitted us to infer the tendencies involved in some aspects of the teacher-pupil interaction. The above studies were concerned only with verbal interaction between teacher and pupils. The importance of nonverbal behavior in the English classroom, however, was suggested in my recent study. By including in the data nonverbal behavior as well as implicit speech acts, implicit {{in the sense that they}} are superficially absent but the speaker and the hearer are fully aware of them and by using Mary Canice Johnson's discourse structure rules, we would expect a clearer understanding of some aspects of English classroom interaction which were not considered in our previous research...|$|R
40|$|Sublevel stoping is an {{underground}} mining method {{which has a}} low level of production cost. As well main part of the production cost is related to choosing of the drilling method in each stope. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} generate a model for identification of the best drilling choice in each case. In order to developing a mathematical model, 150 stopes has been designed by hypothesized dimensions and <b>drilling</b> <b>patterns.</b> In each case production cost was calculated based on extracted ore unite. The out puts come from through calculation of the hypothesized designing on account of different thicknesses of the ore body and heights of the production blocks. A mathematical model has been developed through non-linear regression technique on the basis of the out puts. The generated model is able to define dissimilar production cost per extracted ore unit based on each production drilling method. Therefore the best choice is the drilling method which has the lowest rate of dissimilar production cost. Verification of the model has been carried out on some random data. Accordingly the result of verification has been acceptable by reason of a suitable adaptation ratio...|$|R

2500|$|After the {{battleship}} USS Maine exploded at Havana, Cuba in February 1898, a [...] "war fever" [...] against Spain swept through America with the cry: [...] "Remember the Maine!" [...] On March 4, 1898, a highly charged war rally {{was held at}} the Avilla Methodist Church. Three attorneys gave rousing speeches to the packed house, fueled with patriotic songs from a ladies choir. As a result, fifty-three young men immediately volunteered for military service in a new company that would be known as the Avilla Zouaves. These units were characterized by colorful uniforms and/or precision <b>drilling</b> <b>patterned</b> after the French Zouaves, and were very stylish in the 19th century military. The Avilla youth would be designated in the US Army as Company G, 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Two months later, the new Avilla unit was escorted by flag-bearing GAR members to the Carthage Train Depot, and with music from the Light Guard Band were ceremoniously sent off for battle in the Spanish–American War. The fighting in Cuba was over quickly and the 5th Missouri Infantry was mustered out on November 9, 1898, before the Avilla Zouaves saw any action. Although they did not fight in the war, this event illustrates the raw patriotic spirit of Avilla, Missouri still present in 1898.|$|R
