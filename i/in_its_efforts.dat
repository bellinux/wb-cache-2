5|$|German {{forces in}} Stalingrad {{soon began to}} run out of supplies, some {{soldiers}} were forced to live on horse meat. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler's insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> to cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would begin in the middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts.</b> Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that {{the idea for the}} {{application}} of Marinus was suggested to Boris I by Formosus of Portus. Formosus and Marinus were friends and close associates. Marinus was an influential diplomat who participated in many missions between Rome and Constantinople.

With his decision the Pope underestimated the ambitions of Boris I for independent church policy, which led to the alienation of the Bulgarian ruler from Rome and indirectly helped the Patriarchate of Constantinople <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> to influence the events in Bulgaria.|$|E
