500|$|The lyric to [...] "Photograph" [...] is centred around lost love, {{with the}} singer having {{only a single}} picture by which to {{remember}} his absent lover. The eponymous photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that [...] "you're not coming back any more". Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an [...] "unusual" [...] aspect in the lyrics' [...] "absence of any hope that love might be rekindled". Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds, in the lines [...] "Now you're <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to live without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to".|$|E
500|$|According to McIlwain, {{the episode}} {{represents}} the series' ultimate [...] "coalescence of science, religion, and metaphysics". It {{is one of}} the few episodes in which Scully sets aside her empirical reasoning to save Mulder's life. Scully, representing the more rational one [...] "who must anchor herself in the certainty of scientific facts", discovers the alien shards and deduces that they hold the key to [...] "every question that has ever been asked". Mulder, on the other hand, represents the one who [...] "seeks the truth among a realm of possibilities too fantastic and beyond the realm of scientific validity" [...] and possesses the needed tool—his immunity—to solve the puzzle. The episode also explores the moral side of The Smoking Man and his affinity for evil. Kenneth Silber of Space.com notes that The Smoking Man's [...] "enticing blandishments confirm he is a highly dangerous foe, one whose Machiavellian creativity borders on the Satanic." [...] Timothy Dunn and Joseph J. Foy note in [...] "Moral Musings on a Cigarette Smoking Man" [...] that The Smoking Man's evil deeds have little to do with his mission in the Syndicate, instead reflecting his desire for [...] "completely gratuitous" [...] evil. The two cite his line [...] "Aren't you <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to sprout vampire fangs?" [...] as evidence that The Smoking Man is aware of his crimes but casually shrugs them off.|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{as though}} <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to speak. I shrugged my shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] he sneered, looking about. [...] "Do you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to {{call this}} place home? Do you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to hang about this scrubby hole to be disciplined by your Voices?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t remember. You {{said very}} little about it; you seemed to make a kind of mystery. I knew of course you <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to live here, but I didn’t know you <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to like it.” ...|$|R
50|$|I {{expect you}} to help, and you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to help.|$|R
60|$|She broke off, {{as though}} <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to say something, and I {{felt a little}} awkward.|$|E
60|$|I {{laughed a}} little bitterly. I knew quite {{well that he}} was <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to continue, and I did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose she's {{somewhat}} {{anxious about}} your father, and I dare say is <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to hurry," [...] returned the master pointedly.|$|E

5000|$|Vicki: [...] "I {{make my own}} rules, so don't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to follow}} yours." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD. I do. And I {{suppose you}} will <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to {{accompany}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you call}} yourselves {{religious}} men!" [...] I remarked {{when they had}} finished their story {{and looked at me}} <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to say something.|$|E
6000|$|He paused again, as if <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to say something. After {{the words}} he had just spoken, what could I say? what could I think? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps you are <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to {{come down}} with the lunch and {{compliment}} you all upon your prowess." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. But we are--aren't we? You couldn't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to keep quiet, {{under the}} circumstances.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Rubelle waited, quietly {{arranging}} her nosegay, {{as if she}} <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to say something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor do I, Matteo; but I must go, nevertheless. Pisani {{knows how}} long it will take me to get to Chioggia and return. He will allow an hour or two for me to reconnoitre, and will then be <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> back. As it is, I shall be two hours after the time when he will be <b>expecting</b> <b>me,</b> for he knows nothing about the boat being carried across this island, and will make no {{allowance}} for that. Moreover, Polani and his daughters will be anxious about me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Billy Towler," [...] exclaimed Katie, with animation; [...] "yes, I remember; you {{are right}} in <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to be {{interested}} in him. Let me hear all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose I {{shall have}} to give in," [...] she sighed. [...] "I am taking it for granted, you see, that you are <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to dine with you." ...|$|E
60|$|I did wish. But I {{saw that}} he <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to say No--so I said it.|$|R
6000|$|... "They sure do! And what do {{you suppose}} the folks at home <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to do?" [...] went on Jack, seriously. [...] "They <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to hold those twins in. Why! a fellow could no more do that than hold in a pair of wild horses. You've seen a little of what Andy can do. Well, his jokes aren't a patch to those Randy {{occasionally}} gets off." ...|$|R
60|$|I will {{inform you}} later, when I know definitely, {{about the time}} to <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> in Copenhagen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{like to be}} by themselves, of course,' said Tom; 'and I {{came away}} so naturally, that I have no doubt they are <b>expecting</b> <b>me,</b> every moment, to return. That's capital!' ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. Look here, Clare; {{you don't}} mean you're <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> {{to put up}} with the {{position}} of a man who's neither married nor unmarried? That's simple purgatory. You ought to know.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at me--she was seated at the wide, carved writing-table, I {{standing}} by her side--as if <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to say more. As I left my utterance there, she frowned perplexedly.|$|E
60|$|<b>Expect</b> <b>me</b> at eight. And {{believe me}} to be ever, my dearest Madam, yours most entirely, SYLVANDER.|$|R
60|$|Add to this, {{anxieties about}} my wife, and maddening letters from creditors--and don't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to write reasonably.|$|R
60|$|THE YOUNG LADY. It {{has been}} a very {{unpleasant}} surprise to me to find that nobody <b>expects</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{prediction}} {{seems almost}} vague {{enough to have}} been uttered by an ancient oracle," [...] said I, observing that he waited, after repeating the verses, as if <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to say something.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is not <b>expecting</b> <b>me,</b> as it happens," [...] Draconmeyer lied smoothly. [...] "I {{told her}} that I might be dining at the Villa Mimosa. I {{have to be there}} later on." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{answered}} nothing, {{but looked}} askance at me, {{as if he}} were <b>expecting</b> <b>me</b> to laugh. [...] "Urge it strongly," [...] he said in a moment. [...] "Say it's my duty--that I must." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are either}} an astonishingly ingenuous person, Mr. Laverick," [...] his visitor declared, [...] "or you're too subtle for me. You do not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe that}} you are in this with your eyes blindfolded? You do not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe that you}} do not know what is in that sealed envelope? Bah! It is a child's game, that, and we play as men with men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} general relentlessly, [...] "that {{you have never}} {{attempted}} any defence. That has been to your credit with me. It inclined me to overlook your unwarranted course in writing to my daughter, when you told her you would never see her again. What did you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to think, after that, of your coming back to see her? Or didn't you <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to know it?" ...|$|R
60|$|He so evidently <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to scold that I took especial {{pleasure}} in exaggerating the calmness of my attitude.|$|R
