It adopts several techniques/guidelines from the existing regulations in order to consider comprehensively the spatial pattern in Lahat District. The research uses three major criteria, which are: physic/environment, economic and social in order to formulate spatial pattern of regional expansion. The analysis of of spatial pattern based on the physical/environmental criteria produces two regions of expansion, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>region</b> I (9 sub-districts), and region II (10 sub-districts); the analysis on spatial analysis based on the economic criteria produces 2 regions, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>region</b> I (8 sub-districts) and region II (11 sub-districts); the analysis on spatial pattern based on the social criteria produces 3 regions, <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>region</b> I (6 sub-districts), region II (6 sub-districts), and region III (7 sub-districts); the analysis on the combination of three criteria (physical/environmental, economic, and social criteria) in the overlay produces 2 regions, <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>region</b> I (8 sub-districts) and region II (11 districts); the analysis on comparison based on the analysis of spatial pattern which regards the physical/environment, economic and social criteria indicates that the policy has more weaknesses than the research result...|$|E

40|$|Understanding of the {{structure}} and the origin of genetic variation patterns in the laboratory inbred mouse provides insight into {{the utility of the}} mouse model for studying human complex diseases and strategies for disease gene mapping. In order to address this issue, we have constructed a multistrain, high-resolution haplotype map for the 99 -Mb mouse Chromosome 16 using ∼ 70, 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from whole-genome shotgun sequencing of five laboratory inbred strains. We discovered that large polymorphic blocks (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> where only two haplotypes, thus one SNP conformation, are found in the five strains), large monomorphic blocks (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> where the five strains share the same haplotype), and fragmented blocks (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> of greater complexity not resembling at all the first two categories) span 50 %, 18 %, and 32 % of the chromosome, respectively. The haplotype map has 98 % accuracy in predicting mouse genotypes in two other studies. Its predictions are also confirmed by experimental results obtained from resequencing of 40 -kb genomic sequences at 21 distinct genomic loci in 13 laboratory inbred strains and 12 wild-derived strains. We demonstrate that historic recombination, intra-subspecies variations and inter-subspecies variations have all contributed to the formation of the three distinctive genetic signatures.

In addition to not being known which sensors are active or inactive, the sensor measurements are also obtained in random unknown order.

This labeling problem extends classic image segmentation, since it allows multiple labels (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>region</b> overlapping).

Using Markov Random Field (MRF) energy terms for the simultaneous segmentation of the images together with histogram consistency requirements using the squared L 2 (rather than L 1) distance, after linearization and adjustments, yields an optimization model with some interesting combinatorial properties. We discuss these properties which are closely related to certain relaxation strategies recently introduced in computer vision. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed approach. 1...|$|E

Results indicate that regional and local environmental filters concurrently sort bacte-rial species, suggesting that spatial configuration of epilithic biofilms resembles patterns of larger organisms in floodplain ecosystems. Along the hierarchical organization of fluvial sys-tems, floodplains constitute a vector of maximum environmental heterogeneity and conse-quently act as a major landscape filter for biofilm species. Thus, river basins and associated floodplains may simply reflect very large scale ‘patches ’ within which environmental condi-tions select for community composition of epilithic biofilms...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{availability}} of complete sequences for numerous closely related bacterial genomes opens up new challenges in comparative genomics. Several {{methods have been}} developed to align complete genomes at the nucleotide level but their use and the biological interpretation of results are not straightforward.

Description Here we present recent developments on MOSAIC, a generalist comparative bacterial genome database. This database provides the bacteriologist community with easy access to comparisons of complete bacterial genomes at the intra-species level. The strategy we developed for comparison allows us to define two types of regions in bacterial genomes: backbone segments (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> conserved in all compared strains) and variable segments (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>regions</b> that are either specific to or variable in one of the aligned genomes).

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel deep {{architecture}} to address multi-label image recognition, a fundamental and practical task towards general visual understanding. Current solutions for this task usually rely on an extra step of extracting hypothesis regions (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>region</b> proposals), resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. In this work, we achieve the interpretable and contextualized multi-label image classification {{by developing a}} recurrent memorized-attention module. This module consists of two alternately performed components: i) a spatial transformer layer to locate attentional regions from the convolutional feature maps in a region-proposal-free way and ii) an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) sub-network to sequentially predict semantic labeling scores on the located regions while capturing the global dependencies of these regions. The LSTM also output the parameters for computing the spatial transformer. On large-scale benchmarks of multi-label image classification (e. g., MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC 07), our approach demonstrates superior performances over other existing state-of-the-arts in both accuracy and efficiency.

Thus, we investigate the traffic dynamics on a network with a rectangle wavepacket generation rate. It is found that the critical delivering capacity parameter beta(c) (which separates the congested phase and the free phase) decreases significantly with the duty cycle r of the rectangle wave for package generation. And, in the congested phase, more collective generation of packets (smaller r) is helpful for decreasing the packet aggregation rate. Moreover, it is found that the congested phase can be divided into two regions, <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>region</b> 1 and region 2, where the distributions of queue lengths are nonlinear and linear, respectively. Also, the linear expression for the distribution of queue lengths in region 2 is obtained analytically.

40|$|NA chips (i. e., microarrays) {{biotechnology}} is a hybridization (i. e., matching of {{pairs of}} DNA) -based process that makes possible {{to quantify the}} relative abundance of mRNA of two distinct samples by analyzing their fluorescence signals. This technique requires robotic placement (i. e., spotting) of thousands of cDNAs (i. e., complementary DNA) in an array format on glass microscope slides. The spotted cDNAs are the hybridization targets for the mRNA samples. The two different samples of mRNA, usually labeled with Cy 3 and Cy 5 fluorochromes, are cohybridized onto each spotted gene. After hybridization, one digital image is acquired for each fluorochrome wavelength. Then, {{it is necessary to}} recognize each gene by its position in the array and to estimate its signal (i. e., hybridization information).

Dogs infected with B. rossi have varied clinical manifestations that can be categorized as uncomplicated (with a good prognosis) or complicated (with a poor prognosis). One hundred twenty-one blood samples were collected from dogs presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital and diagnosed with babesiosis {{by the use of}} a thin blood smear. An additional 20 samples were obtained from Babesia-infected dogs from private clinics around the Onderstepoort, Johannesburg, Durban, White River, and Cape Town areas.

40|$|Hill-type muscle {{models are}} often used in muscle {{simulation}} studies {{and also in the}} design and virtual prototyping of functional electrical stimulation systems. These models have to behave in a sufficiently realistic manner when recruitment level and contractile element (CE) length change continuously. For this reason, most previous models have used instantaneous CE length in the muscle’s force vs. length (F-L) relationship, but thereby neglect the instability problem on the descending limb (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>region</b> of negative slope) of the F-L relationship. Ideally CE length at initial recruitment should be used but this requires a multiple-motor-unit muscle model to properly account for different motor-units having different initial lengths when recruited. None of the multiple-motor-unit models reported in the literature have used initial CE length in the muscle’s F-L relationship, thereby also neglecting the descending limb instability problem. To address the problem of muscle modelling for continuously varying recruitment and length, and hence different values of initial CE length for different motor-units, a new multiple-motor-unit muscle model is presented which considers the muscle to comprise 1000 individual Hill-type virtual motorunits, which determine the total isometric force. Other parts of the model (F-V relationship and passive elements) are not dependent on the initial CE length and, therefore, they are implemented for the muscle as a whole rather than for the individual motor-units. The results demonstrate the potential errors introduced by using a single-motor-unit model and also the instantaneous CE length in the F-L relationship, both of which are common in FES control studies...|$|E

In Poland, the obligation to monitor the concentration of the finer fraction of particles smaller than 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter was introduced only in 2010. Consequently, data on PM 2. 5 concentration refer to a shorter period, i. e. 2009 / 10 – 2014 / 15, and were obtained from 23 stations.
