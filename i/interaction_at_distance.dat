40|$|The {{ground state}} of a bilayer quantum Hall system at ν_ T= 1 with model pseudopotential is {{investigated}} by the DMRG method. Firstly, pseudopotential parameters appropriate for the system with finite layer thickness are derived, and {{it is found that}} the finite thickness makes the excitonic phase more stable. Secondly, a model, where only a few pseudopotentials with small relative angular momentum have finite values, is studied, and it is clarified how the excitonic phase is destroyed as intra-layer pseudopotential becomes larger. The importance of the intra-layer repulsive <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> <b>distance</b> twice of the magnetic length for the destruction of the excitonic phase is found.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} EEG correlates of social <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> <b>distance</b> between twenty-five pairs {{of participants who}} were not connected by any traditional channels of communication. Each session involved the application of 128 stimulations separated by intervals of random duration ranging from 4 to 6 seconds. One of the pair received a one-second stimulation from a light signal produced by an arrangement of red LEDs, and a simultaneous 500 Hz sinusoidal audio signal of the same length. The other member of the pair sat in an isolated sound-proof room, such that any sensory interaction between the pair was impossible. An analysis of the Event-Related Potentials associated with sensory stimulation using traditional averaging methods showed a distinct peak at approximately 300 ms, {{but only in the}} EEG activity of subjects who were directly stimulated. However, when a new algorithm was applied to the EEG activity based on the correlation between signals from all active electrodes, a weak but robust response was also detected in the EEG activity of the passive member of the pair, particularly within 9 – 10 Hz in the Alpha range. Using the Bootstrap method and the Monte Carlo emulation, this signal was found to be statistically significant...|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} role of hydrophobic {{interactions in}} nature and technology has motivated decades long research aimed at measuring the distance-dependent hydrophobic force and identifying its origin. This quest has nevertheless proved more elusive than anticipated {{and the nature of}} the <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> <b>distances</b> shorter than 2 - 3 nanometers, or even its sign, have never been conclusively determined. Employing an ultra-high resolution frequency-modulation atomic force microscope (FM-AFM) we succeeded in measuring the <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> all <b>distances</b> and discovered that the commonly observed attraction at 3 - 10 nanometer distances turns into pronounced repulsion below 0. 3 - 3 nanometers, depending on the hydrophobicity of the AFM tip and the surface. This generic short-range repulsion disproves the prevailing dogma that hydrophobic <b>interactions</b> are attractive <b>at</b> all <b>distances,</b> hence bearing on practically all biological and technological hydrophobic phenomena. The short-range repulsion, as well as the mid-range attraction, are traced by experiment and theory to the prevalent air accumulation near hydrophobic surfaces.

40|$|I {{summarize}} {{the motivation for}} the effective field theory approach to nuclear physics, {{and some of its}} recent accomplishments. 1 Why effective field theory, why nuclear physics? Low energy data is generally insensitive to the details of <b>interactions</b> <b>at</b> short <b>distance.</b> It is therefore difficult to learn about short range interactions; yet by the same token, complete knowledge of the physics <b>at</b> short <b>distances</b> is not required for an accurate understanding of experiments. Effective field theory exploits this fact. The effects of nonlocal <b>interactions</b> <b>at</b> short <b>distance</b> may be represented in terms of local operators in a derivative expansion — the effective Lagrangian. The higher an operator’s dimension, the smaller the effect it has on low energy physics, and hence one can obtain a useful phenomenological theory by retaining operators only up to some dimension, fitting their coefficients to data. Some effective theories are quite useful, such as chiral perturbation theory; some are wildly successful, such as the standard model of particle physics.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{effective}} interaction between two ellipsoidal particles at the interface of two fluid phases which are mediated by thermal fluctuations of the interface. In this system the restriction {{of the long}} [...] ranged interface fluctuations by particles gives rise to fluctuation [...] induced forces which are equivalent to interactions of Casimir type and which are anisotropic in the interface plane. Since the position and {{the orientation of the}} colloids with respect to the interface normal may also fluctuate, this system is an example for the Casimir effect with fluctuating boundary conditions. In the approach taken here, the Casimir interaction is rewritten as the interaction between fluctuating multipole moments of an auxiliary charge density [...] like field defined on the area enclosed by the contact lines. These fluctuations are coupled to fluctuations of multipole moments of the contact line position (due to the possible position and orientational fluctuations of the colloids). We obtain explicit expressions for the behavior of the Casimir <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> large <b>distances</b> for arbitrary ellipsoid aspect ratios. If colloid fluctuations are suppressed, the Casimir <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> large <b>distances</b> is isotropic, attractive and long ranged (double [...] logarithmic in the distance).

40|$|Introduction The {{problem of}} <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> a <b>distance</b> was raised {{for the first}} time more than 300 years ago by Newton in the first edition of his book, Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, and has not lost its {{relevance}} today (see e. g.

The question as to the choice of one or another conception of <b>interaction</b> <b>at</b> a <b>distance,</b> namely [...] -Newton instantaneous long-rang interaction (NILI) or Faraday-Maxwell short-rang interaction (FMSI) [...] -seems finally to have been resolved in favour of the latter. But lately, many authors (see e. g. [2 - 4, 6, 7 - 12]) have repeatedly resorted to NILI, a concept which was given up by contemporary physics long ago. The necessity of introducing NILI (or, at least, making allowance for it) is based either on the possible incompleteness of Maxwell theory [3, 12] or possible inaccuracies of the main theses of Special Relativity Theory (SRT) [2, 6]. At the same time, a number of authors have indicated an incompleteness in Maxwell theory without referring...|$|R
