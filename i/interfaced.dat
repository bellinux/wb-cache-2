The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed.

A modem is <b>interfaced</b> into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ending}} of the Gupta Dynasty in {{northern}} India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) <b>interfaced</b> between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.|$|E

25|$|Thinking theoretically, Kirchhoff went {{a little}} further, and pointed out that this implied that the {{spectral}} radiance, {{as a function of}} radiative frequency, of any such cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium must be a unique universal function of temperature. He postulated an ideal black body that <b>interfaced</b> with its surrounds in just {{such a way as to}} absorb all the radiation that falls on it. By the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of such a body would pass unimpeded, directly to its surrounds without reflection at the interface. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the thermal radiation emitted from such a body would have that unique universal spectral radiance as a function of temperature. This insight is the root of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment.

Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have <b>interfaced</b> with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner.

30|$|Network <b>interface</b> {{identification}} (NI-ID) (12 bits): This is an identifier {{assigned to}} each <b>interface</b> of either the MAC address of a network <b>interface</b> on the edge router or the {{virtual local area network}} (VLAN) ID of a virtual <b>interface</b> if the edge router uses VLAN <b>interfaces.</b> The NI-ID specifies which subnet a traffic flow comes from. Currently, a router can equip 802.1 Q VLAN <b>interfaces,</b> which means that multiple virtual <b>interfaces</b> can be used on one physical network <b>interface.</b> Although VLAN <b>interfaces,</b> which share one physical <b>interface,</b> have the same MAC address, each VLAN <b>interface</b> has a unique VLAN ID so that a router distinguishes VLAN <b>interfaces</b> by their VLAN IDs. If a network <b>interface</b> is a VLAN <b>interface,</b> a NI-ID is assigned to its VLAN ID instead of the MAC address shared with another VLAN <b>interface.</b> A 12 -bit NI-ID, expressed in the range from 0 to 4, 095, is sufficient to represent all possible network <b>interfaces</b> and VLANs on an edge router. An edge router keeps an NI-ID table and numbers the <b>interfaces</b> from 0 to 4, 095. Each NI-ID table entry consists of an NI-ID and the MAC address of a network <b>interface</b> card. If VLAN <b>interfaces</b> are used, then the entry in the NI-ID table consists of an NI-ID and a VLAN ID.

25|$|It was {{not long}} before major {{corporations}} started taking an interest in computer graphics. TRW, Lockheed-Georgia, General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. Ralph Baer, a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. David C. Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation's computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked {{for the next five years}} as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they <b>interfaced</b> with people. In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest.

500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were <b>interfaced</b> into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so the two of them together are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E
