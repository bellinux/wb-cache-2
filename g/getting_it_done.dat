Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, stated that {{in the interest of}} <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done,</b> the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital are now in a state of decay and are being demolished.|$|E

500|$|The {{financial}} {{failure of}} Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, {{which made the}} studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giants production considerably. [...] "Three-quarters" [...] of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff {{that there would be}} a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented [...] "They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> on time and doing stuff that was good." [...] Bird regarded the trade-off as having [...] "one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule," [...] but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as [...] "fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can." [...] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; [...] "we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees," [...] said production designer Mark Whiting.|$|E

500|$|... "You Really Got Me", a Ray Davies song, {{influenced}} by American blues and the Kingsmen's version of [...] "Louie Louie", was recorded on 15 June 1964 at Pye studios with a slower and more produced feel than the final single. Ray Davies wanted to rerecord the song with a lean, raw sound, but Pye refused to fund another session; Davies took an adamant stand, so the producer, Shel Talmy, broke the stalemate by underwriting the session himself. The band used an independent studio, IBC, {{and went in}} on 15 July, <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> in two takes. The single was released on August 1964, and, supported by a performance on the television show Ready Steady Go! and extensive pirate radio coverage, it entered the UK charts on 15 August, reaching number one on 19 September. Hastily imported by the American label Reprise Records, it also made the Top 10 in the United States. The loud, distorted guitar riff and solo on [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was played by Dave Davies and achieved by a slice Dave Davies made in the speaker cone of his Elpico amplifier (referred to by the band as the [...] "little green amp")— helped with the song's signature, gritty guitar sound. [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal", and as an influence on the approach of some American garage rock bands. After its release, the group recorded most of the tracks for their debut LP, simply titled Kinks. Consisting largely of covers and revamped traditional songs, it was released on 2 October 1964, reaching number four on the UK chart. The group's fourth single, [...] "All Day and All of the Night", another Ray Davies hard rock tune, was released three weeks later, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, and number seven in the United States. The next singles, [...] "Set Me Free" [...] and [...] "Tired of Waiting for You", were also commercially successful, the latter topping the UK singles chart.|$|E

On November 6, 1967, she became {{secretary and}} executive assistant to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and served in that capacity until December 31, 1972. Duffield likened this job to working for Oppenheimer at Los Alamos: [...] "There was the same close feeling of a group of people in a strange land, ... {{a group of people who}} were isolated from the rest of the world and trying to do something special." [...] Duffield said that moving to the Weston site evoked memories of the esprit de corps at Los Alamos, and [...] "that did really make it a frontier." [...] She also recalled The feeling of independence and adventure in those early days on the Weston site. [...] "We had a flagpole and a big fancy colorful tent was put alongside the house" [...] As she explained, [...] "It was a place to sit and have a meeting: but it also [...] "was a symbol." [...] And at both labs, [...] "everyone did sort of everything—there was a crisis every day." [...] Duffield emphasized: [...] "Bob managed to give people the feeling of tremendous urgency, of getting the thing done and <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> fast and <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> cheap." [...] Later, secretary Barb (Rozic) Kristen recalled that many new employees considered it hard to know just what to do in those early days, but Duffield, unlike everyone else, knew exactly what was needed and how to get things done.|$|E

The former {{is based on the}} sequel to Disch's novella while the latter is a brand new story. While reuniting most of the cast, they had a new director and crew, and were released out of chronological order. Rees noted that the original film was made out of pure love and not thought of as a kid's film or a product, and that he had heard the new approach was a more commercial venture. Deanna Oliver felt that despite Ramirez being a talented director who handled the franchise with care, instead of [...] "film" [...] and [...] "character driven", the project seemed more about <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> because it could be made.
