5|$|Having {{satisfied}} {{himself as}} to the advantages of screw propulsion, Brunel wrote to the company directors to persuade them {{to embark on a}} second major <b>design</b> <b>change,</b> abandoning the paddlewheel engines—already half constructed—for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on the dime once he died, stating that Reagan was as iconic to conservatives as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a <b>design</b> <b>change,</b> but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 2017, {{a heavily}} {{modified}} version of Petya was used for a global cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine. This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another <b>design</b> <b>change,</b> it is also unable to actually unlock a system after the ransom is paid; this led to security analysts speculating that the attack {{was not meant to}} generate illicit profit, but to simply cause disruption.|$|E

5|$|The primary <b>design</b> <b>change</b> {{between the}} earlier F-5E and the F-5G {{was the use}} of a single General Electric F404 engine that was {{originally}} designed for the F/A-18 Hornet. The new engine provided 60% more thrust than the combined output of the F-5E's two General Electric J85s. This improved the aircraft's thrust-to-weight ratio from 1.0 to 1.13. The new engine gave a speed of over Mach2.0, a ceiling over 55,000ft (16,800m), an initial climb rate of 52,800ft per minute (16,100m/min).|$|E
5|$|Due to cost increases, several {{features}} of the subway were cut back soon after construction started. Notably, the 72nd Street Station was truncated from a three-track, two-platform design to a two-track, single island platform design, paired with a simplification of the connection to the Broadway Line spur. This <b>design</b> <b>change</b> was done before the actual construction started. The MTA also pushed back its completion date to 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA further postponed completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA rescheduled it again to 2016.|$|E
5|$|Engine supply {{problems}} {{complicated the}} construction of the aircraft. Production of the ATsN superchargers could not be organized in any systematic way and only the first four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Factory No. 124 shut down its Pe-8 production line at the beginning of 1940 while alternative engines were evaluated. Somewhere in the massive Soviet chain of command, {{the decision was made to}} proceed without the superchargers. The unavailability of the Klimov M-100 engine of the ATsN-2 installation required a <b>design</b> <b>change,</b> although this modification allowed a commander and radio operator to be carried in its place. Then, to compound the problem further, the production of AM-34FRNV engines ended in the second half of 1939. Only two or four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Eighteen of the aircraft produced by the end of 1940 were fitted with AM-35A engines.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>changes</b> {{have always}} been an innate feature of the {{construction}} industry. Despite the various project management techniques, many building construction projects still fail to achieve their time and cost objectives. This paper aims to focus on <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> as {{a major cause of}} time delays and cost overruns. It seeks to discuss the causing factors of <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> in building construction projects and highlighting the resulting rework that is detrimental to project performance. Hence, this paper also aims to present a conceptual framework which was developed to better manage <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> through clued-up management decision to avoid future claims and disputes. Recent and current literature is examined and reviewed. The review approach was based on related literature to identified themes. The existing literature is summarised into five discrete themes of “design changes”, “rework”, “time and cost overruns”, “communication” and “decision-making”. The synthesised literature is subsequently utilised in the development of conceptual map which provided the direction for designing the conceptual framework. Extensive review of preceding studies on causes of time and cost overruns reveals that <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> is identified as one of the significant factors. However, there are limited studies in this domain. The discussion presents a knowledge gap of linking <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> and rework with decision-making in project management. This finding suggests the need for further empirical study. The framework stresses the importance of communication and management decision as the control mechanism. Researchers and practitioners in construction management field will find this study useful in understanding the causing factors of <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> and its detrimental impacts to project performance which risk the project to claims and disputes. The conceptual framework presents an imperative outcome to encourage further research in developing conceptual causal model of <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> which shows the key causal variables and their feedback loops...|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire. A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast, making the building consist solely of condominium units. The <b>design</b> <b>change</b> altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the original plan. Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the original plan, instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.|$|E

50|$|As {{construction}} of CVN-78 progresses, the shipbuilder is discovering first-of-class type <b>design</b> <b>changes,</b> {{which it will}} use to update the model before the follow-on ship construction. To date, several of these <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> have related to EMALS configuration changes, which have required electrical, wiring, and other changes within the ship. Although the Navy reports that these EMALS-related changes are nearing completion, it anticipates additional <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> stemming from remaining advanced arresting gear development and testing. In total, over 1,200 anticipated <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> remain to be completed (out of nearly 19,000 planned changes). According to the Navy, many of these 19,000 changes were programmed into the construction schedule early on—a result of the government’s decision at contract award to introduce improvements during construction to the ship’s warfare systems, which are heavily dependent on evolving commercial technologies.|$|R

25|$|Because, {{especially}} in digital signal processing, switching frequencies {{have continued to}} rise, the demand for high frequency decoupling or filter capacitors increases. With a simple <b>design</b> <b>change</b> the ESL of a MLCC chip can be reduced. Therefore, the stacked electrodes are connected on the longitudinal side with the connecting terminations. This reduces the distance that the charge carriers flow over the electrodes, which reduces inductance of the component.|$|E

A paddle steamer's engines drive a shaft that is positioned above the waterline, with the cylinders positioned below the shaft.
