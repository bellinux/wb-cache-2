For example, the satirist John Bird is quoted as saying, I {{was a member of}} something called the Socialist Party of Great Britain at school for a while.

500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes!' he exclaimed. 'I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> patronize! but a step beyond, {{and it is}} all {{the same}} with you as with the rest--you despise the jewel without the setting.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do the rest. Well, {{it is like}} a romance. A woman couldn't {{have such}} an {{adventure}} as that!" [...] sighed the girl.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is no occasion. She <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not be spared. It {{was done}} on the 10th, and she will soon walk better than she has done all these years.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh no, of course; oh yes, I see. Sure. I can see how----Say, Gertie, I {{never did}} <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> look so grown-up. I suppose now you'll never play with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{from what}} you tell me, Ronald, the {{evidence}} against you was stronger than against any one else, and yet I cannot think how any one who <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have believed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do the job, {{if it was}} in {{the power}} of any one, my boy. After making the capture, single-handed, it would have been strange if you had failed at the last minute." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Truth, Sir Archie, she's a {{woman and}} wilful, and she just laughed and said that you would <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not keep her in order yourself, and could not {{therefore}} expect me to rule her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} matter?" [...] she exclaimed with feeling. [...] "I'm very angry with them. I can't {{let you go}} without saying that I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not have done what you have been wickedly accused of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{only a day}} or two's notice, {{and there}} wasn't time to arrange matters properly. But it's {{hard to imagine that}} people who <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be such credulous fools. I mustn't say {{anything}} stronger of your relatives." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he said, [...] "that may answer. But {{there is}} no harm in bearing in mind that persuasion is not {{necessarily}} a passive force. Without going the length of removing him yourself, you <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put temptation in his way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{have been}} true, have acted nothing," [...] said Colonel Keith, [...] "and that is best of all. No one who really <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> mistake your feelings.
