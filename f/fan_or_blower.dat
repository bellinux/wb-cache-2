The partial vacuum is due to the Bernoulli effect, and is similar to water aspirators used in chemistry labs. This partial vacuum can be used to move the process gas through the venturi as well as through the facility's process system. In the case of explosive or extremely corrosive atmospheres, the elimination of a fan in the system can avoid many potential problems.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{residential}} and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation, {{and can be}} described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides. Air is moved by a centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>or</b> <b>blower,</b> (usually driven by an electric motor with pulleys known as [...] "sheaves" [...] in HVAC terminology, or a direct-driven axial fan), and a water pump is used to wet the evaporative cooling pads. The cooling units can be mounted on the roof (down draft, or downflow), or exterior walls or windows (side draft, or horizontal flow) of buildings. To cool, the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit's sides and through the damp pads. Heat in the air evaporates water from the pads which are constantly re-dampened to continue the cooling process. Then cooled, moist air is delivered into the building via a vent in the roof or wall.|$|E
40|$|T H E {{therapeutic}} {{action of}} "radiant-heat sources " {{is based on}} the absorption of electromagnetic radiation and its transformation into heat in the body tissues. The majority of the radiation is absorbed in the skin, and most experi-ments on intact human beings (as opposed to animal experiment) have shown only negligible rises in temperature in muscle or deep tissues. The radiation pain threshold is about 46 Â° C. (Whyte, 1951), and this is an obvious limiting factor. A technique which would allow an increase in energy incident on the skin surface might be expected to produce increased depth effects so far as tempera-ture rise was concerned. A technique of applying radiant heat used in Calcutta is to combine this heating with a <b>fan</b> <b>or</b> <b>blower,</b> which moves air at room temperature over the heated part and apparently prevents beads of sweat forming.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper examines the effect of a non-uniform airflow velocity distribution on the air pressure drop through the fin passages of a single row fin-tube heat exchanger. Water flow rate through the tubes and its temperature are taken as constant. Maldistribution of the airflow increases the average pressure drop with respect to that of a uniform flow. As a result of this, the pumping power required by the <b>fan</b> <b>or</b> <b>blower</b> will also increase. The increase of the pumping power is calculated by means of a discretization technique and it is analyzed with respect to the non-uniform distribution statistical moments of probability density function, i. e., the mean, standard deviation, skew and kurtosis. The analysis reveals that the increase of pumping power is dependent on the exchanger NTU, standard deviation and skew of the velocity distribution. Kurtosis has no effect on the pressure drop. Correlations have been developed to predict this increase of pumping power from known statistical moments and resulting air temperatures. These can then be used as design tools to optimize the sizing of the heat exchanger within the air-conditioning unit, hence giving the best energy efficiency performance...|$|E

40|$|In Air {{conditioning}} {{air blowers}} are working {{at full speed}} although the conditional area at set temperature. Tins situation consumed considerable amount of energy to drive the <b>fan</b> <b>or</b> <b>blower</b> and running the refrigeration cycle itself The amount of energy {{which is used to}} drive the air blower and refrigeration cycle of the air conditioning system can be considered as loss of energy. This loss can be minimized by introducing the Variable Speed Drive (VSD) to drive the air blower or fan by sensing the conditional area temperature etc. Cost of the VSD is very high in the local market, and it creates long pay back period for investment of installing a VSD for air conditioning system. Also electricity tariff in Sri Lanka is very high and has a trend of increasing. Therefore by introducing VSD the electrical energy used for Air conditioning can be minimized. By considering the above facts low cost VSD is useful for the local market. In this project low cost Micro controller has been used as the motor control unit. Micro controller generates PWM to drive IGBTs in power module. The method used to vary the speed of induction motor is varying the voltage and frequency by keeping voltage/frequency ratio constant. Micro controller senses the variable voltage created by the potential meter or controller.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent research}} {{funded by the}} U. S. Department of Defense Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) intended to improve the cost-effectiveness of systems to protect building occupants from subsurface radon gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors. Standard practice for sub-slab depressurization (SSD) uses a <b>fan</b> <b>or</b> <b>blower</b> to create a measurable vacuum below the building and has not changed in a few decades. ASTM E- 2121 - 13 specifies a minimum target vacuum of 6 to 9 Pascals (Pa) everywhere below the building floor slab, but this {{can be difficult to}} measure compared to baseline fluctuations (a signal-to-noise challenge). A key variable that is not usually measured is the permeability of the material below the floor. If granular fill is below the floor (as specified in most building codes), high flow velocities can be generated with small pressure gradients, which can protect occupants via sub-slab ventilation (SSV). Alternatively, if the floor is well sealed, the venting system may be able to capture all of the available mass of VOCs or radon at a modest flow rate, in which case mass flux might be the most important metric. Using vacuum as the only performance metric will often result in an over-designed system that is not energy efficient because it draws an excessive amount of conditioned indoor air across the floor slab for discharge above the roofline and requires excessive electricity to power fans or blowers. Research was conducted at a 64, 000 ft 2 (5, 950 m 2) commercial building with an existing SSD system comprised of 27 suction points connected to 9 fans to demonstrate and validate new methods and criteria for system optimization and monitoring, including transient and steady-state pneumatic testing and mathematical modeling using the Hantush-Jacob model, sub-slab tracer testing, building depressurization testing, trichloroethene (TCE) mass flux monitoring, and confirmatory indoor air sampling and analysis. The results of this study demonstrate that the number of SSD extraction points can be reduced substantially and still maintain health-protective indoor air quality...|$|E

40|$|Tonal noise {{propagating}} in ducts and {{radiating from}} their outlets {{is a common}} problem in situations where a fan or a blower is used to drive exhaust gases through the exhaust duct out to the environment. It is also {{a problem in the}} exhausts of large diesel engines such as those used to power large marine vessels. One way of attenuating tonal noise propagating in ducts is to use one or more side branch resonators, each of which is specifically designed for optimal performance at a particular frequency. One of the major problems {{associated with the use of}} side branch resonators is that any slight change in excitation frequency decreases the effectiveness of the resonators. The change in excitation frequency can be caused by a change in the speed of the engine, <b>fan</b> <b>or</b> <b>blower,</b> or change in temperature in the duct, which changes the speed of sound, and hence the wavelength of the noise. Resonators incorporating a provision for altering their geometry in real - time in order to adapt to environmental or operating condition changes is one approach that has been used by previous researchers. In particular, adaptive Helmholtz resonators have received considerable attention in the literature. Previous work has involved the use of one or more pressure sensors located in the duct downstream of the resonator to provide a cost function to be minimised by an electronic control system which alters the geometry of the resonator. However, in many cases, especially where the duct serves as a passage for exhaust gases to be driven out to the environment, it is not desirable to mount microphones in the duct. Also, microphones located remote from the resonator introduce wiring problems as well as the need to mount the microphones at the correct location in the duct, which will change as the wavelength of the tonal noise in the duct changes as a result of changes in operating or environmental conditions. It is highly desirable to have a completely self - contained Helmholtz resonator (HR) which can be attached to the duct and for which the only external wiring needed is the power supply. The work described in this thesis is concerned with the development of a self - contained adaptive HR which can be optimally tuned by using signals from two microphones located in the cavity and neck of the resonator, respectively. The primary focus of the work is the development of a novel cost function, which can be used by an electronic controller to optimally tune the HR. The scope of the analysis has been restricted here to the ' no mean flow ' condition. The theoretical and numerical analysis of the duct - HR system is first conducted using the well known transfer matrix method and finite element analysis (FEA) software package ANSYS, respectively. The net acoustic power transmission in the duct downstream of the HR is estimated by using the two - microphone method. Analysing the duct - HR system with the transfer matrix method mandates the incorporation of three end - correction factors which are related to the unflanged open end of the duct, neck - cavity interface and neck - duct interface. However, because of the complexity in estimating the end - correction factor of the neck at the neck - duct interface due to the generation of a complex sound field in the vicinity of the neck opening, the transfer matrix method only approximates the in - duct net acoustic power transmission. This implies that changing the value of the neck - duct interface end - correction factor changes the calculated frequency at which the maximum reduction of in - duct net acoustic power transmission downstream of the HR occurs. On the other hand, ANSYS does not require the inclusion of any kind of end - correction factors apart from the actual physical dimensions of the system, and is thus much more accurate than the transfer matrix method. To minimise the in - duct net acoustic power transmission downstream of the HR, a number of different cost functions that were related to the net acoustic power transmission were investigated theoretically, numerically and experimentally. These all involved either the acoustic pressure at the top of the closed end of the cavity of the HR or at the neck wall of the HR close to the neck - duct interface or the amplitude of the pressure transfer function between two microphones located in the resonator. The two potential cost functions which were initially considered to be maximised for indicating the minimisation of the in - duct net acoustic power transmission downstream of the resonator were : (a) the pressure at the top of the closed end of the cavity, and (b) the amplitude of the pressure transfer function between the pressure at the top of the closed end of the cavity and the pressure at the neck wall close to the neck - duct interface. It was found that the location of the microphone in the neck was extremely important, with the best location being at the centre of the duct adjacent to the neck opening. However, this location was not considered practical because a microphone in the duct can obstruct the mean flow of gas in the duct. The best location for mounting the microphone in the neck was found to be at the neck wall as close as possible to the neck - duct interface. The results are shown in two different ways : (1) broadband analysis, whereby the in - duct net acoustic power transmission downstream of the HR, the pressure at the top of the closed end of the cavity and the pressure transfer function between the pressure at the top of the closed end of the cavity and at the neck wall close to the neckduct interface are plotted as a function of frequency, and (2) single frequency analysis, whereby all the aforementioned results are plotted as a function of the cylindrical cavity length (for a fixed cavity diameter) for a single, tonal frequency. For broadband analysis, the numerical (ANSYS) results showed that the frequency at which the maximum reduction of in - duct net acoustic power transmission downstream of the HR occurs differs from the frequencies which correspond to the maximum responses of cost functions (a) and (b) described above. For single frequency analysis, when trying to optimise the performance of a duct - mounted HR at a particular frequency by altering its volume, the optimal dimensions of the HR required to attain the maximum reduction of in - duct net acoustic power transmission at that frequency differ from the dimensions of the HR which correspond to the maximised responses of the cost functions (a) and (b). These results were validated experimentally using a 3 m long circular duct of 0. 1555 m diameter with an attached cylindrical HR. During the experimental work, only plane waves were propagating down the duct and there was no mean flow in the duct. Instead of only focusing on the amplitude of the pressure transfer function between the pressures at the top of the closed end of the cavity and the pressure at the neck wall close to the neck - duct interface, the phase difference between the same locations in the HR was also considered. It was found that the phase difference depends on the quality factor (or damping) of the entire acoustic system. Experiments were conducted with varying dimensions of the HR and two novel cost functions were empirically derived. Both cost functions, which does not include any kind of measurement remote from the HR, are based on the damping (or the quality factor) of the duct - HR system and the phase difference between the pressure at the top of the closed end of the cavity and the pressure at the neck wall close to the neck - duct interface. The effectiveness and performance of both cost functions were found to be excellent for minimising the in - duct net acoustic power transmission downstream of the HR. However, the second cost function is preferred because the procedure involved for measuring the system damping is more convenient from the practical point of view than the procedure for the first one. The quality factor of the duct - mounted HR, at the frequency at which noise needs to be attenuated, was determined by tuning the length of the cavity of the HR so as to maximise the amplitude of the pressure transfer function of the HR. This estimated quality factor was found to be directly related to the transfer function phase which corresponds to the minimum in - duct net acoustic power transmission at the tonal frequency. Once this optimum transfer function phase is known, an active control system can be used to drive a motor to adjust the cavity length of the HR to achieve the optimum phase. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

40|$|This {{paper and}} {{discussion}} presents the summary and results of energy audits or assessments {{conducted by the}} University of Louisiana Lafayette Industrial Assessment Center, which {{is sponsored by the}} US Department of Energy, for the first four years of operation. To insure the confidentiality of our clients, the results are generalized and summarized by industry type and recommendation type. Where the assessment finding and recommendations have been implemented, the implementation rate is shown. For recommendations that have the most significant savings and a high implementation rate, we will show the summarized implementation cost and payback period. The Industrial Assessment Center of the University of Louisiana Lafayette began operation in FY 01 and conducted its first industrial energy assessment in December 2000. In this paper we present the results of this energy assessment and those of 112 more through August 2004. By industrial type, these assessments were for: Oilfield Equipment Manufacturing (23 %), Food and Food Processing (18 %), Petrochemical Manufacturing and Refineries (13 %), Other (non-Oilfield) Equipment Manufacturing (12 %), Ship Building and Repair (8 %), Woodworking, Clothing and Wire Manufacturing (6 %), Paper, Cardboard, Boxes and Bag Manufacturing (5 %), Machining (4 %), Building and Building Materials (4 %), Printing (4 %), and Glass and Ceramics Manufacturing (3 %). The distribution of manufacturers for the State of Louisiana is weighted much higher in the Petrochemical Manufacturing and Refineries, however because of limitations on the amount of energy consumed (restrictions for the Industrial Assessment Centers), many of these are beyond the scope for Industrial Assessment Centers. For most of the recommendations we make, we try to keep the installation cost (parts and labor) within a one-year payback period. However, we have occasionally looked at longer payback periods when suggested by the client. The recommendations for each industry type are summarized in the following ten categories: air leaks and operating compressed air pressure (includes methods to lower cost by lowering the operating air pressure), replace air tools with electric tools (includes grinders, chippers, wrenches, and <b>fans</b> <b>or</b> <b>blowers</b> to replace air horns), installation of insulation (on hot or cold equipment, pipes and buildings), lighting (photo sensors, reductions, occupancy sensors, and LED exit signs), recycling, combustion efficiency and CHP, steam leaks and traps, heating and cooling (people and space), alternative fuels and operations, and productivity improvements (including preventive maintenance and group lighting replacement) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study into {{the application of}} a 100 -V, 50 -kHz high-frequency ac (HFAC) network for powering automotive electrical auxiliaries. The study is focused on motor-actuated loads and is divided into two sections. First, the investigation indicates the benefits of replacing low-torque dc motors with lighter and more efficient 400 -Hz ac machines for applications such as electric <b>fans,</b> fuel pumps, <b>or</b> <b>blower</b> motors. A comparative examination of commercially available machines indicates space and weight reduction of more than 60 %, and efficiency savings between 25 % and 100 % are possible. Second, the inquiry evaluates the viability of replacing existing dc/ac inverters with HFAC/ ac converters for high-torque ac machines as employed, for example, in electric- power-assisted steering (EPAS) or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Based on experimental and simulation results for a column-assist EPAS application employing a three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous motor, this paper shows that an HFAC drive is expected to reduce the voltage harmonic content below 50 kHz by at least 10 % compared with the dc/ac inverter. However, the disadvantages of the former drive make it less attractive than the existing dc/ac circuit. Specifically, the EPAS motor torque ripple is expected to be approximately 2 % higher compared with the dc counterpart drive. Further drawbacks of the HFAC/ac drive include high metal-oxide-semiconductor field- effect transistor (MOSFET) conduction losses, higher voltage harmonics above 50 kHz, and complex control requirements of the inverter. Conclusively, significant HFAC advantages for motor loads can only be attributed to machines with a nominal torque capability that is limited to 2 N Â·m. However, given the number of such devices within a typical vehicle, this translates into a possible vehicle mass saving of 30 kg and a potential reduction in fuel consumption by 0. 8 L/ 100 k...|$|R
