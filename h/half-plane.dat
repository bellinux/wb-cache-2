5|$|In graph theory, a book {{embedding}} is a {{generalization of}} planar embedding of a graph to embeddings into a book, {{a collection of}} half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the edges are required to stay within a single <b>half-plane.</b> The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E

25|$|In {{the other}} direction, from this dessin, {{described}} as a combinatorial object without specifying {{the locations of the}} critical points, one may form a compact Riemann surface, and a map from that surface to the Riemann sphere, equivalent to the map from which the dessin was originally constructed. To do so, place a point labeled ∞ within each region of the dessin (shown as the red points in the second figure), and triangulate each region by connecting this point to the black and white points forming the boundary of the region, connecting multiple times to the same black or white point if it appears multiple times on the boundary of the region. Each triangle in the triangulation has three vertices labeled 0 (for the black points), 1 (for the white points), or ∞. For each triangle, substitute a <b>half-plane,</b> either the upper <b>half-plane</b> for a triangle that has 0, 1, and ∞ in counterclockwise order or the lower <b>half-plane</b> for a triangle that has them in clockwise order, and for every adjacent pair of triangles glue the corresponding half-planes together along the portion of their boundaries indicated by the vertex labels. The resulting Riemann surface can be mapped to the Riemann sphere by using the identity map within each <b>half-plane.</b> Thus, the dessin d'enfant formed from f is sufficient to describe f itself up to biholomorphism. However, this construction identifies the Riemann surface only as a manifold with complex structure; it does not construct an embedding of this manifold as an algebraic curve in the complex projective plane, although such an embedding always exists.|$|E

By using these potentials as Green's functions we have reduced the problem of crack and/or holes existing in either of these <b>half-planes</b> to an integral equation along the cracks or holes. The advantage of the method is that the integral equation along the interface between the two <b>half-planes</b> (y= 0) is canceled out. Thus, the numerical evaluation {{of the state of}} stress is considerably reduced and simplified. The respective integral equations corresponding to some characteristic cases of bimaterial plates were derived.

40|$|An {{automatic}} 3 D reconstruction method {{based upon}} coplanar and region constraints is proposed for synthesising piecewise 3 D planar models of a real-world scene portrayed {{in a sequence}} of digital images. Significantly, the reconstruction process requires no prior knowledge about the scene and the camera parameters. The proposed modelling method comprises three steps. Firstly, the corresponding feature points and lines are extracted {{from a series of}} images of the world scene. Secondly, the extracted corresponding points and lines are filtered in accordance with region and coplanar constraints and are used to identify the possible <b>half-planes</b> of real-world planes. Finally, a complete 3 D planar model is constructed by identifying the correct <b>half-planes</b> in the world scene enlarging these <b>half-planes</b> to their full extent, and then merging all the extended <b>half-planes</b> which from part of the same world plane. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by reconstructing 3 D planar models of three real-world scenes containing objects with multiple planar facets...|$|R

25|$|More generally, a (topological) {{surface with}} {{boundary}} is a Hausdorff topological {{space in which}} every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of {{the closure of the}} upper <b>half-plane</b> H2 in C. These homeomorphisms are also known as (coordinate) charts. The boundary of the upper <b>half-plane</b> is the x-axis. A point on the surface mapped via a chart to the x-axis is termed a boundary point. The collection of such points is known as the boundary of the surface which is necessarily a one-manifold, that is, the union of closed curves. On the other hand, a point mapped to above the x-axis is an interior point. The collection of interior points is the interior of the surface which is always non-empty. The closed disk is a simple example of a surface with boundary. The boundary of the disc is a circle.|$|E

An outerplanar graph is a graph that has a planar embedding in which all vertices belong to the outer face of the embedding.

(An articulation point of the graph will necessarily appear more than once in the cyclic ordering of vertices around the outer face, but only one of those copies {{should be included in the}} book embedding.) Conversely, a one-page book embedding is automatically an outerplanar embedding. For, if a graph is embedded on a single page, and another <b>half-plane</b> is attached to the spine to extend its page to a complete plane, then the outer face of the embedding includes the entire added <b>half-plane,</b> and all vertices lie on this outer face.|$|E
