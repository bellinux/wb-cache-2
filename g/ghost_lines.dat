50|$|In September 1966, {{the line}} was singled and all {{intermediate}} stations became unstaffed halts. From this point onwards, it became a deteriorating <b>ghost</b> <b>line.</b> In {{the last few years}} before closure, the line became a long siding providing a skeleton passenger service which was very cheap to run and with no level crossings of any importance. Once staff had been withdrawn, access to the station was via a side gate rather than through the booking hall which was locked out of use. The station closed on 4 May 1970 The goods yard closed on 6 November 1967.and the next day Lowestoft North signal box also closed, the last Norfolk & Suffolk box still in use at the time.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, Zernike was {{conducting}} research into spectral lines {{and discovered that}} the so-called <b>ghost</b> <b>lines</b> that occur {{to the left and}} right of each primary line in spectra created by means of a diffraction grating, have their phase shifted from that of the primary line by 90 degrees. It was at a Physical and Medical Congress in Wageningen in 1933 that Zernike first described his phase contrast technique in microscopy. He extended his method to test the figure of concave mirrors. His discovery lay {{at the base of the}} first phase contrast microscope, built during World War II.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} source of opacity in exoplanet atmospheres at short visible and near-UV wavelengths is Rayleigh scattering of light on molecules. It {{is accompanied by a}} related, albeit weaker process [...] Raman scattering. We analyze the signatures of Raman scattering imprinted in the reflected light and the geometric albedo of exoplanets, which could provide information about atmospheric properties. Raman scattering affects the geometric albedo spectra of planets in following ways. Firstly, it causes filling-in of strong absorption lines in the incident radiation, thus producing sharp peaks in the albedo. Secondly, it shifts the wavelengths of spectral features in the reflected light causing the so-called Raman <b>ghost</b> <b>lines.</b> Raman scattering can also cause a broadband reduction of the albedo due to wavelength shifting of a stellar spectrum with red spectral index. Observing the Raman peaks in the albedo could be used to measure the column density of gas, thus providing constrains on the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. Observing the Raman <b>ghost</b> <b>lines</b> could be used to spectroscopically identify the main scatterer in the atmosphere, even molecules like H$_ 2 $ or N$_ 2 $ that do not have prominent spectral signatures in the optical wavelength range. If detected, <b>ghost</b> <b>lines</b> could also provide information about the temperature of the atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the effects of Raman scattering in hydrogen- and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. We analyze the feasibility of detecting the signatures of Raman scattering with the existing and future observational facilities, and of using these signatures as probes of exoplanetary atmospheres.

40|$|Echo-planar {{spectroscopic imaging}} (EPSI) {{can be used}} for fast spectroscopic imaging of water and fat {{resonances}} at high resolution to improve structural and functional imaging. Be-cause of the use of oscillating gradients during the free induc-tion decay (FID), spectra obtained with EPSI are often degraded by Nyquist ghost artifacts arising from the inconsistency be-tween the odd and even echoes. The presence of the spectral <b>ghost</b> <b>lines</b> causes errors in the evaluation of the true spectral lines, and this degrades images derived from high-resolution EPSI data. A technique is described for reducing the spectral ghost artifacts in EPSI of water and fat resonances, using echo shift and zero-order phase corrections. These corrections are applied during the data postprocessing. This technique is dem-onstrated with EPSI data acquired from human brains and breasts at 1. 5 Tesla and from a water phantom at 4. 7 Tesla...|$|E

2500|$|Peter Dinklage {{originally}} voiced {{the character}} Ghost {{in the base}} game. The character {{did not have any}} lines in the two expansions of Year One. Nolan North replaced Dinklage for The Taken King and also re-recorded all of <b>Ghost's</b> <b>lines</b> from the original game, as Bungie wanted [...] "to create a consistent storytelling experience from beginning to end". North was excited to put his mark on the role and hopes to evolve the character in future Destiny releases. He said that he did not listen to any of Dinklage's recordings, as he did not want any preconceived notions to influence his performance. According to Bungie, the actor change was made due to Dinklage's availability. David Cross was hired to write jokes for the character Ghost but none of his work was used in the final game.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{explored}} co-receptor {{usage and}} prediction of V 3 genotyping algorithms in HIV- 1 subtype B' from paid blood donors experienced anti-retroviral therapy in Chinese central province {{in order to}} design effectively therapeutic regimen. Methods HIV- 1 strains were isolated in treatment HIV- 1 infections and treatment-naïve HIV- 1 infections, then co-receptor usage of HIV- 1 strains was identified based on <b>Ghost</b> cell <b>lines</b> using flow cytometry. HIV- 1 V 3 region was amplified and submitted into web-server (WebPSSM and geno 2 pheno) to predict HIV- 1 co-receptor usage. The feasibility of prediction HIV- 1 usage with Web-server assay was analyzed by comparing prediction of V 3 genotyping algorithms with HIV phenotype assay based on <b>Ghost</b> cell <b>line.</b> Results 45 HIV- 1 strains and 114 HIV- 1 strains were isolated from HIV- 1 infections exposed anti-retroviral therapy and treatment-naïve, respectively. 41 % clinical viruses from ART patients and 18 % from treatment-naïve patients used CXCR 4 as co-receptor. The net charge in the V 3 loop was significantly difference in both groups. The sensitivity and specificity for predicting co-receptor capacity is 54. 6 % and 90. 0 % on 11 / 25 rule, 50. 0 % and 90 % on Web-PSSM x 4 r 5, 68. 2 % and 40. 0 % on Geno 2 pheno [co-receptor]. Conclusion Dual/mixed/X 4 co-receptor utilization was higher in ART patients than treatment-naïve patients. It is should paid attention to predicting HIV- 1 co-receptor usage based on V 3 genotyping algorithms in HIV- 1 subtype B' from paid blood donors experienced anti-retroviral therapy in Chinese central province. </p...|$|R

50|$|On a Tetris-like {{board the}} player drops blocks {{consisting}} of Ghosts, Blocks, Pac-Man, and one Fairy (if the Fairy Meter is full) to the ground. The {{objective is to}} not let the blocks overflow, let Pac-Man eat the <b>ghosts,</b> and make <b>lines</b> to shorten the amount of blocks on the board. When Pac-Man eats a ghost, the Fairy Meter goes up. Once full, a fairy will eventually be dropped. Once the fairy {{comes to a stop}} by landing on anything, it waves its wand and every ghost in the eight lines below it will disappear, often resulting in numerous lines being completed and simplifying the board. Once the fairy disappears, the score bonus is given, and gameplay continues.|$|R

40|$|The {{transmembrane protein}} of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus {{contains}} two heptad repeats that are predicted to form amphipathic α-helices that mediate the conformational change necessary for membrane fusion. To analyze the relative {{sensitivity of the}} predicted hydrophobic face of the N-terminal heptad repeat to the insertion of uncharged, polar, and charged substitutions, mutations that introduced alanine, serine, or glutamic acid into positions 436, 443, 450, and 457 of the envelope protein were examined. Novel systems using Tat protein and the <b>GHOST</b> cell <b>line</b> were developed to test and quantitate {{the effects of the}} mutations on Env-mediated fusion and infectivity of the virus. While no single amino acid change at any of the positions interfered significantly with the synthesis, processing, or transport to the plasma membrane of glycoprotein complexes, 9 of the 12 nonconservative mutations in these residues completely abolished fusion activity and virus infectivity. Mutations in the central positions (443 and 450) of the heptad repeat region were the most detrimental to Env function, and even single alanine substitutions in these positions dramatically altered the fusogenicity of the protein. These results demonstrate that this N-terminal heptad repeat plays a critical role in Env-mediated membrane fusion and highlight the key function of central hydrophobic residues in this process and the sensitivity of all positions to charge substitutions...|$|R
