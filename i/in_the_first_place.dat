5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} an apparently unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Clal Center {{was the target}} of criticism. Some critics decried the {{decision}} to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School in order to build the project <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> Others pointed out that the style and height of the building were incompatible with typical low-rise Jerusalem architecture in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from {{the first edition of}} the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, completely different from the board game that had inspired the computer game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion.

5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
30|$|International ports have {{witnessed}} stable patterns of growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last decades. However, the 2008 credit crunch {{and the subsequent}} economic crisis reversed this picture [8]. At EU level, the port activity started to decline from {{the second half of}} 2008. Greece is listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>places</b> regarding <b>the</b> most substantial decreases [10]. Especially the port of Piraeus shows a negative trend in main categories of shipping cargoes (containers and bulk) between the years 2002 – 2010. Apart from that, the freight traffic of the other major Greek ports (Thessaloniki, Patra), remain until now, at the low levels of the recent years.|$|R

This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E

5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration.

The Senate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

30|$|To {{analyze the}} quality of the recommendations, we {{recorded}} the maximum of both task-difficulty and resolution-time associated with those SAD documents recommended by our tool. The set of recommended documents for a given user are those ranked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>places</b> (i.e., high similarity values), and the size of that set is determined by the k value. For example, if the system recommended N documents to a particular user, and they were linked to high-difficulty tasks, we categorized the recommendations as potentially useful. On the other hand, if the N sections were linked to tasks requiring little time to be solved, the recommendations were considered not as useful as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous case.|$|R
