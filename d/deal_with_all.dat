5|$|Kogălniceanu's {{term was}} {{confirmed}} by the 1869 election, after which {{he was able to}} persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without expressing his consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu's main supporters in the chamber. Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E

She then began training in Japan, learning the Japanese wrestling style, as well as Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing. She eventually signed a three-year <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>All</b> Japan, which made her the first non-Japanese wrestler to do so. In addition, she worked for the TWA, feuding with Luna Vachon, whom she faced in a Hair vs Hair Mixed Tag Team match in September 1991. Miceli and her partner Eddie Gilbert defeated Vachon and Cactus Jack, which resulted in Vachon having her head shaved.|$|E

25|$|Debra (née Whelan) Barone (Patricia Heaton) is Raymond's wife, {{and mother}} of Ally, Michael and Geoffrey. As a housewife, Debra claims she is {{frequently}} overworked, under-appreciated and stressed out. This leads to her yelling, largely because she has to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the housework and her three rambunctious children with almost no assistance or support from Raymond; she constantly puts up with Marie's intrusiveness and criticism. On frequent occasions this frustration boils over and is vented towards Raymond.

25|$|In 1866, {{following}} the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian {{defeat in the}} Austro-Prussian War, the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Magyar nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore {{the power of the}} Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian élites.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

25|$|By 1916, Einstein {{was able}} to generalize this further, to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> states of motion {{including}} non-uniform acceleration, which became {{the general theory of}} relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind of illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time {{in the vicinity of the}} mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the Cosmic microwave background radiation — a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.|$|E

The character {{is a member of}} the Trill species, and is formed of both a host and a symbiont – referred to as Dax. Ezri was introduced to the series following the death of the previous Dax host, Jadzia (Terry Farrell) at the end of [...] It had been the producers' intention to introduce a new female character bearing the symbiont in order to ensure that Nana Visitor as Kira Nerys was not the only female member of the main cast. There were difficulties in casting initially, and the character changed from one who was intended to be [...] "spooky" [...] to one that was struggling to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> her previous personalities as a result of unexpectedly taking on the Dax symbiont. De Boer was not considered for the part until co-producer Hans Beimler suggested that she should submit an audition tape, which resulted in her invitation to meet with the producers in Los Angeles and in her gaining the role.|$|E

500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{cited the}} example of coin {{redistribution}} in the game, which meant that [...] "You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place", when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, IGN's Peer Schneider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Mini Bowsers, who all take their turns {{at the same time}} in [...] "Story" [...] mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by GameSpot, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note [...] "If you bought Mario Party 4 last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.", noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in Mario Party 5, although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with GameSpy commenting that [...] "the sheer volume can keep you compelled.

500|$|And Yet It Moves is {{the first}} video game {{developed}} by Broken Rules, an independent game developer based in Vienna. The game began as a bachelor project held by the Department for Design and Assessment of Technology at the Vienna University of Technology. The four computer science students involved wanted to design a game that gave the player more freedom than possible in normal 2D games; a side-scrolling platform game {{with the ability to}} rotate the entire game world was chosen. A prototype of the game took half a year to develop using the Torque game engine, and the name And Yet It Moves was chosen for its ambiguity and [...] "it hints at world rotation," [...] an allusion to Galileo Galilei's famous (but apocryphal) remark [...] "Eppur si muove". The prototype was showcased at various independent game development festivals and garnered positive feedback; it was a winner in the Student Showcase category of the 2007 Independent Games Festival and a nominee for the 2007 Europrix Top Talent Award. The interest in the title inspired the students to develop a full game, which took approximately two years. Broken Rules was founded when it was realized that [...] "it was a necessity [...] to better <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the organizational, financial and juridical hassles that are involved when making business." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} the movie would be broadcast in February 1978, with weekly episodes following, broadcast in an 8pm EST timeslot on Saturday nights. Gary Nardino, who was placed {{in charge of the}} new network, said that [...] "Star Trek was absolutely the lead horse of the new network. Because the advertisers recognised the strength of Star Trek in the syndicated market." [...] Prior to commencing production on the new series, Roddenberry took a two-week vacation in order to rid himself of negative feelings about the way that production on the feature film had gone. He described his concerns saying {{that he did not want}} to [...] "drag a corpse of anger, defeats and double-crossing behind me" [...] onto the new show. Robert Goodwin was placed in charge of developing the feature films that would follow each week's episode of Star Trek, and the movie-length pilot as well. Roddenberry wanted to meet him, and despite Goodwin's lack of Star Trek background, he was convinced to be a producer on the series instead. Roddenberry described him as the [...] "producer producer", in that Goodwin would <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the technical aspects of the production. For the screenwriting aspect of the production, Harold Livingston was recruited, who recalled that the technical/screenwriting split of the executive producer role was innovative for the time. Like Goodwin, Livingston had not previously worked on Star Trek, but had worked on , a different Desilu Productions television series.|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} episode, Rhimes put an {{emphasis}} on the character of O'Malley, detailing his relationships with both Stevens and Torres. On the topic, Rhimes elabroated, [...] "The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he knows what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." [...] Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. [...] Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, [...] "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me." [...] Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former [...] "off the hook" [...] for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. [...] "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women.
