40|$|The authors' aim in {{this study}} was to {{consider}} the functional equivalence of internal imagery, external imagery, and action execution. Sixteen elite gymnasts imaged and performed a complex <b>gymnastic</b> <b>vault.</b> Ten performers imaged from an internal perspective, and 6 used an external perspective. Although the results revealed that the time to image the entire motor task did not significantly differ from the time required to physically perform it, irrespective of the imagery perspective used, the temporal organization of the action was different within the imagery conditions {{than it was in the}} physical condition. The results do not provide support for the principle of temporal functional equivalence. The authors discuss the results in light of recent findings from the cognitive neuroscience and psychology literatures. ...|$|R

2500|$|The first escape {{occurred}} in October 1943 in the East Compound. Conjuring up a modern Trojan Horse, kriegies (prisoners) constructed a <b>gymnastic</b> <b>vaulting</b> horse largely from plywood from Red Cross parcels. The horse {{was designed to}} conceal men, tools and containers of soil. Each day the horse was carried out to the same spot near the perimeter fence and while prisoners conducted gymnastic exercises above, a tunnel was dug. At {{the end of each}} working day, a wooden board was placed over the tunnel entrance and covered with surface soil. The gymnastics disguised the real purpose of the vaulting horse and kept the sound of the digging from being detected by the microphones. For three months three prisoners, Lieutenant Michael Codner, Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams and Flight Lieutenant Oliver Philpot, in shifts of one or two diggers at a time, dug over [...] of tunnel, using bowls as shovels and metal rods to poke through the surface of the ground to create air holes. No shoring was used except near the entrance. On the evening of 19 October 1943, Codner, Williams and Philpot made their escape. Williams and Codner were able to reach the port of Stettin where they stowed away on a Danish ship and eventually returned to Britain. Philpot, posing as a Norwegian margarine manufacturer, was able to board a train to Danzig (now Gdańsk) and from there stowed away on a Swedish ship headed for Stockholm, from where he was repatriated to Britain. Accounts of this escape were recorded in the book Goon in the Block (later retitled The Wooden Horse) by Williams, the book Stolen Journey by Philpot and the 1950 film The Wooden Horse.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Despite {{the huge}} amount of force exerted by both {{the upper and lower}} {{extremity}} musculature in <b>gymnastic</b> <b>vaulting,</b> there is scant research investigating the benefits that plyometric training can induce. The handspring vault is of paramount importance for a gymnast’s vaulting development, and requires both technical skill and power production to achieve success. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects that plyometric training can have when added to habitual training on handspring vault performance variables in female adolescent gymnasts. Methods: Twenty female competitive gymnasts (mean ± SD: age 12. 5 ± 1. 7 years; stature 1. 46 ± 0. 11 m; mass 40. 5 kg ± 9. 7 kg) volunteered to partake in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to two independent groups. The experimental plyometric training group (PT) pursued a six-week plyometric program, consisting of two additional 45 minute sessions a week, alongside their habitual training. The control group (CG) continued their regular habitual training only. Videography was used (120 Hz) in the sagittal plane, both pre and post training intervention, to assess key performance indicators attributed to the technical performance and competence required to execute a successful handspring vault. In addition, participants completed a countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) as an assessment of lower body power. Results: Significant improvements (P < 0. 05) were found for the PT in comparison to CG for run-up velocity, take-off velocity, distance from take-off to springboard, duration of foot contact on board, duration of hand contact on vault, duration of post flight and CMJ height. However, no significant differences were found between groups for first flight time, shoulder angle or hip angle on the vault. Furthermore, the CG demonstrated no significant improvement for handspring vault measures or CMJ height. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that the implementation of plyometric training led to improvements of several key variables which are associated to successful handspring vault performance. It can be suggested that implementing plyometric training can improve handspring vault performance in adolescents, appropriately preparing gymnasts for the development and progression of vaulting in the future...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Vaulting is a discipline in Men's and Women's Artistic Gymnastics. While the springboard contact is not judged, {{the success of the}} rest of the vault is underpinned by it. The purpose of this study was to develop an understanding of the mechanics of the springboard contact phase of <b>gymnastic</b> <b>vaulting.</b> An analysis of hopping in place, forward hopping and running jumps on a force platform showed that the force-mass centre displacement relationship during ground contact approximated that of a mass rebounding on a linear spring. Subsequently, two mass-spring models were developed using a symbolic mathematics package. Both models represented the gymnast as a rigid cylinder, with personalized linear and angular inertia characteristics, connected at its mass centre to a linear spring. A one spring model combined the springiness of the gymnast and the springboard in a single linear spring, while a two spring model treated them as separate linear springs. Handspring vaults performed by an elite male gymnast at a range of approach speeds and springboard settings were analysed to provide model inputs. Springboard properties were empirically determined and revealed that the springboard stiffness varied appreciably depending upon feet contact position. Given the touchdown kinematics and takeoff angle of the gymnast, the models estimated spring stiffness and linear and angular takeoff velocities, the spring stiffness and takeoff vertical velocity estimates showing some sensitivity to spring angle at touchdown. Simulations in which the touchdown kinematics and spring stiffnesses were systematically adjusted, identified their influence on takeoff kinematics and provided an insight into the mechanics of springboard. contact. Estimated (leg) spring stiffnesses were consistent with those reported in the literature for other activities and'simulation results showed that simple rebounds accounted for the majority of the takeoff velocities. Spring angle at touchdown was found to be most effective at modifying each of the takeoff variables, however to produce a selective effect on takeoff required a combination of adjustments to the touchdown. In proposing strategies for gymnasts, their ability to control each of the touchdown variables has to be considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeIn {{the late}} 1990 s {{a period of}} {{shortage}} of radiotherapy capacity caused long waiting times in The Netherlands. Investments in treatment <b>vaults,</b> <b>equipment</b> and training capacity were made. The developments since then are described and the actual situation is compared with the predictions throughout the years. Method and materialsData are based on annual surveys on production, personnel and equipment of all 21 Dutch radiotherapy centers. ResultsAn annual increase in patients, radiotherapy treatments and a corresponding increase in equipment and personnel was seen, on average 3. 5 – 4 % per year. After an initial shift to more 3 D conformal treatments, a subsequent change from 3 D conformal to intensity modulated and image guided techniques was observed. There has been no {{increase in the number}} of radiotherapy centers and the average size of a Dutch department in 2010 was 5. 7 linacs, 10. 4 fte radiation oncologists, 4. 8 fte physicists and 45. 8 fte technologists. ConclusionsThe number of linacs increased as anticipated. The increase in staffing was in balance with the need, resulting in only a limited number of vacancies. In 2010 there were virtually no waiting lists, and no overcapacity. The predicted need and the actual number of radiotherapy treatment series per year correspond very well. A national program for a planned increase of radiotherapy capacity is feasible. Expansion of existing departments instead of increasing the number allows for a more rapid introduction of new technologies and sufficient subspecialization of the staff...|$|R

40|$|Judging time-to-contact with {{a target}} is an {{important}} criterion for avoiding harm in everyday walking and running tasks, and maximizing performance in high-velocity sporting tasks. The information-based regulation of step length and duration during target-directed locomotion was examined in relation to gait mode, approach velocity, target task, expertise, and sporting performance during a series of four experiments. The first three experiments examined novice performers (Each n= 12, 6 males, 6 females), whilst the last experiment examined expert gymnasts (n= 5). Two reference strips with alternating 50 cm black and white intervals were placed {{on either side of}} the approach strip for all of the experiments. One 50 Hz-panning video camera filmed the approach from an elevated position. In Experiment 4, two stationary 250 Hz cameras filmed the post-flight performance of the <b>gymnastic</b> <b>vaults</b> and, in addition, two qualified judges provided a performance score for each vaulting trial. The panning video footage in each experiment was digitized to deduce the gait characteristics. In Experiment 4, the high-speed video footage was analyzed three-dimensionally to obtain the performance measures such as post-flight height. The utilization of visual stimulus in target-directed locomotion is affected by the observer 2 ̆ 7 s state of motion as characterized by the mode of locomotion and also often the speed of locomotion. In addition, experience plays an important role in the capacity of the observer to utilize visual stimulus to control the muscular action of locomotion when either maintaining or adjusting the step mechanics. The characteristics of the terrain and the target also affect the observer 2 ̆ 7 s movement. Visual regulation of step length decreases at higher approach speeds in novice performers, where as expert performers are capable of increasing visual regulation at higher approach speeds. Conservatism in final foot placement by female participants accounts for the observed increase in distance from the critical boundary of the obstacle relative to toe placement. Behavioural effects of gender thus affect the control of final foot placement in obstacle-directed locomotion. The visual control of braking in target-directed locomotion is described by a tau-dot of- 0. 54. When tau-dot is below - 0. 54 a hard collision with the obstacle will occur, however, when tau-dot is above - 0. 54, a soft collision with the target will occur. It is suggested that the tau-dot margin defining the control of braking reveals the braking capacity of the system. In the target-directed locomotion examined a tau-dot greater than - 0. 70 would possibly exceed the braking capacity of the system, thus, leading to injury if performed. The approach towards the take-off board and vaulting horse in gymnastics is an example of target-directed locomotion in sport. Increased visual regulation of the timing and length of each step is a requirement for a fast running approach, a fundamental building block for the execution of complex vaults in gymnastics. The successful performance of complex vaults in gymnastics leads towards a higher judge 2 ̆ 7 s score. Future research suggestions include an investigation of visual regulation of step length in curved target-directed locomotion...|$|R
