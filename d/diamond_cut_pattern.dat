25|$|In {{order to}} best use a diamond gemstone's {{material}} properties, {{a number of}} different <b>diamond</b> <b>cuts</b> have been developed. A <b>diamond</b> <b>cut</b> constitutes a more or less symmetrical arrangement of facets, which together modify the shape and appearance of a diamond crystal. Diamond cutters must consider several factors, such as the shape and size of the crystal, when choosing a cut. The practical history of <b>diamond</b> <b>cuts</b> {{can be traced back to}} the Middle Ages, while their theoretical basis was not developed until the turn of the 20th century. Design creation and innovation continue to the present day: new technology—notably laser cutting and computer-aided design—has enabled the development of cuts whose complexity, optical performance, and waste reduction were hitherto unthinkable.|$|R
50|$|Less than 1% of the world's <b>diamonds</b> are <b>cut</b> to {{hearts and}} arrows optical {{symmetry}} precision. This is {{in large part}} due to the greater amount of rough diamond that necessitates additional polishing to create diamonds with this precise optical symmetry. Diamond polishers take up to three times longer to <b>cut</b> <b>diamonds</b> of this <b>cut</b> quality, with much greater waste of the original diamond rough material.Using specialized tooling and high quality cutting wheels and in some cases 100X magnification, factories must employ careful analysis through every stage of production. <b>Diamonds</b> <b>cut</b> in this way are more expensive than average <b>cut</b> <b>diamonds.</b>|$|R
