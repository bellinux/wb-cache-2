5|$|Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains {{immobile}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> all day {{due to a}} hernia {{which causes}} excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains immobile in his seat well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron {{out to the car}} on his office chair to bring him to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5|$|In January 1629, Charles {{opened the}} second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a {{moderate}} speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies {{in light of the}} case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to their protest.|$|E

5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead he sat <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
5|$|Vincent and the WRO {{launch a}} {{full-scale}} assault on Deepground's headquarters in Midgar. While Reeve's team battles the Deepground soldiers {{and attempt to}} destroy the Mako reactors which serve {{as a means to}} revive Omega, Vincent heads to Deepground's centre of operations to confront Weiss. He is surprised to find Weiss slumped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> dead. However, as Omega begins to manifest itself, Weiss seems to revive, and confronts Vincent. It is revealed that Weiss is possessed by Hojo; before Hojo was killed in the Mako Cannon three years earlier, he uploaded his consciousness into the Worldwide Network, then took possession of Weiss's body while he was online attempting to find a cure for the virus with which the Restrictors had infected him. Hojo/Weiss and Vincent battle to a standstill. However Nero, who had been defeated earlier by Vincent, emerges from the Lifestream and destroys Hojo. Nero then merges with Weiss in order to help him fuse with Omega, just as Vincent is fused with Chaos.|$|E
25|$|Frees narrated many {{live action}} films and {{television}} series, including Naked City (1958–1963). Paul Frees also provided {{the voice of}} the eccentric billionaire John Beresford Tipton, always seated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{with his back to the}} viewer while talking to his employee Michael Anthony (fellow voice-artist Marvin Miller), on the dramatic series The Millionaire.|$|E
50|$|Herring {{moved from}} {{knitting}} Mylar to video and participatory performances <b>in</b> 1998. <b>His</b> videos were primarily stop motion. When {{he was sitting}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> knitting <b>chair</b> for hours on end, knitting, his mind would wonder and his stop motion videos expressed <b>his</b> thoughts. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> video Exit, he starts out <b>in</b> <b>his</b> knitting <b>chair,</b> than through stop motion he bounds out {{of it in a}} flight of fancy. He flies from <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> into the air in a jerky movement. The next scene he has long white hair, still flying through the air.|$|R

On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from the living room, and when she heard no response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped over <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
25|$|Wellington died at Walmer Castle in Deal on 14 September 1852. This was his {{residence}} as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Walmer Castle {{was said to}} have been his favourite residence. He was found to be unwell on that morning and was aided from his military campaign bed (the same one he used throughout his historic military career) and seated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> where he died. His death was recorded as being due to the aftereffects of a stroke culminating in a series of seizures. He was aged 83.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, leaning back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing {{that is going on}} around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 1935, {{the eminent}} {{theoretical}} physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, Heisenberg's doctoral advisor at the University of Munich, achieved emeritus status. However, Sommerfeld stayed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> during {{the selection process}} for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty's selection {{and that of the}} Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of Deutsche Physik, which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.|$|E
25|$|John Beckett {{had visited}} Ann in Dublin {{on a regular}} basis and more {{frequently}} when she became ill; after she had died, he could not be persuaded to return to Ireland and declined to attend a reunion of the Beckett family in Dublin. He died, sitting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> on the morning of his 80th birthday, 5 February 2007 and was cremated at Lewisham Crematorium 11 days later following a simple ceremony consisting of Japanese music for the shakuhachi (an end-blown flute), which he had requested to be played at his funeral.|$|E
25|$|The Hotel Manager and a porter are organising the {{departure}} of the last guests, the Polish family among them. Aschenbach inquires as to their time of departure, then leaves to sit on the deserted beach where Tadzio and another boy, Jaschiu, are playing. The game becomes rougher and Jaschiu dominates, pushing Tadzio's face into the sand. In an attempt to assist, Aschenbach tries to get up but is too weak. Jaschiu and the other children run away, leaving Tadzio on the beach alone with Aschenbach. Tadzio beckons the author, but he slumps <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> Tadzio continues walking far out to sea.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|As she {{approaches}} the castle, the Beast is watching her movements through {{the reflection of}} his drink. As she comes into the castle the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast {{sits in a chair}} (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she is sitting on.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, May 3 around 8:50p.m. Virgil was {{relaxing}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> in {{the sitting}} room just off of the kitchen and bedroom with a heating pad on his back. He was listening to his favorite radio program and reading the Friday, May 3 edition of the Texarkana Gazette when he was shot from a closed double window, which faced the highway, three feet behind him. He was shot {{in the back of the}} head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral, which his recovering wife could not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives. He was buried in Hillcrest cemetery on Highway 67 West; same cemetery as Paul Martin. He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.|$|E

500|$|Shaken by the {{reversal}} of his financial fortunes and {{the growing popularity of}} movies over live stage shows, he becomes seriously ill. Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of The Ziegfeld Follies. But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this. In the final scene in his apartment overlooking the Ziegfeld Theatre, in a half-delirium, he recalls scenes from several of his hits, exclaiming, [...] "I've got to have more steps, higher, higher", before slumping over dead <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
500|$|Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who {{was sitting}} beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> wouldn't eat his food and licked his plate. The Tsarina's {{expectation}} was unreasonable, said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, a distant cousin of the imperial family. [...] "Olga cannot deal with him", {{he wrote in his}} diary on March 18, 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still [...] "she had the ways of a flapper", referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play.|$|E
