40|$|Cellular {{material}} such as aluminium foam {{has been}} considered as a potential material for energy absorption upon impact and blast loadings. One {{of the most important}} properties that contribute to this feature is the <b>densification</b> <b>strain.</b> At high impact velocity, prediction of the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> from quasi-static engineering stress-strain curve has been found inadequate. Furthermore, theoretical prediction using the equation proposed by Reid et al. always over-predicts the dynamic crushing stress. Formation of the shock wave at high impact velocity is believed to further increase the densification level of the foam. However, this effect is disregarded when determining the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> quasi-statically. The present study aims to address this issue by determining the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> experimentally from impact tests. Forty cylindrical aluminium foams with three different lengths were used as projectiles and were fired towards a rigid load cell by using a gas gun. The peak forces generated from the impact were recorded and analysed. The experimental densification strains were determined physically by measuring the deformation of the foam projectiles after the tests. It is concluded that, at high impact velocity, the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> varies with the initial impact velocity. Therefore an appropriate value of <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> needs {{to be used in the}} equation of dynamic crushing stress for a better approximation...|$|E

40|$|Cellular solids are {{characteristically}} excellent energy absorbers due {{to their}} capacity to store large amounts of energy through compression. A bioinspired design approach identified the Pomelo fruit (Citrus Maximus) as a biological role model for energy absorption. Fruit peels’ biologically most important functions lies in {{the need to provide}} protection of the seeds from mechanical damage or other negative environmental influences. This qualifies such biological structures as role models for the development of novel structures that protect commodities from damage. The main structural principle extracted from the Pomelo is a density graded strategy. With maturing additive manufacturing (AM) technologies allowing unprecedented control over structural topology, controlled lattice structures can now be investigated. Using a class of AM, selective laser sintering (SLS), lattice structures were fabricated out of polypropylene and subjected to static and dynamic compressive loadings. The lattices were designed to determine the influence of the biomimetic density grading, cell shape and cell size in 3 distinct lattice configurations. Quasi-static simple compression results are compared to analytical micro-mechanical models, finite element method simulations and digital image correlation. Dynamic impact data is assessed using high-speed camera images and evaluated with an analytical momentum analysis. Data analysis is discussed and it is concluded that the density grading strategy beneficially influences the energy absorption. This is attributed to a combination of local plasticity manipulation and higher <b>densification</b> <b>strains</b> in static regime.

The densification behaviour and forming limits of sintered iron– 0. 35 % carbon steel preforms with different aspect ratios, during cold upsetting with two different lubricating constraints namely nil/no and graphite lubricant were investigated experimentally and is presented in this work. Powder preforms having initial theoretical density value of 84 %, with two different aspect ratios were prepared using a suitable die-set assembly on a 1 MN capacity hydraulic press. Sintering operation was carried in an electric muffle furnace at the temperature of 1200 °C for a holding period of 1. 5 h.

40|$|AbstractOne-dimensional {{models for}} {{compaction}} of cellular materials exhibiting strain hardening are proposed for two different impact scenarios. The models reveal the characteristic features of deformation under {{the condition of}} decreasing velocity during the impact event. It was established that an unloading plastic wave of strong discontinuity propagates in the foam {{and it has a}} significant dynamic effect on the foam compaction and energy absorption. The proposed models are based on the actual experimentally derived stress strain curves. The compaction mechanism in three aluminium based foam materials, two of them with relatively low density – Alporas and Cymat with 9 % and 9. 3 % relative density, respectively and a higher density Cymat foam with 21 % relative density, is analysed. Numerical simulations were carried out to verify the proposed models. The predictions of the proposed models are compared with published analytical models of compaction of cellular materials which assume a predefined <b>densification</b> <b>strain.</b> It is shown that the approximation of a cellular material with significant strain hardening by the Rigid Perfectly-Plastic-Locking (RPPL) model can lead to an overestimation of the energy absorption capacity for the observed stroke due to the non-uniform strains along the compacted zone of the actual material in contrast to the predefined constant <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> in the RPPL model.

40|$|Technology and {{economic}} development {{has led to the}} growth of megacities and urban centres with populations in the millions. Such population expansion and <b>densification</b> increases the <b>strain</b> on wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which has been largely based on an end-of-line centralised model. However, in megacities new challenges arise, because provision of suitable sanitation is expensive and it requires infrastructure expansion through construction of extensive sewer networks and larger capacity wastewater treatment plants, which consume more energy. Alternative disposal techniques for solid and liquid waste generated during the treatment process are required, because disposal solutions are decreasing as landfill costs rise and environmental standards are tightened, the latter reducing opportunities for land reuse. Additionally, mass wastewater discharge can have a detrimental impact on the ecology of water bodies and on the health of downstream populations, and requires suitable treatment before disposal. These challenges have the potential to offset the savings that the economies of scale offered by the traditional wastewater collection and treatment systems can impart. The need for affordable and effective wastewater systems in megacities requires the re-evaluation of traditional systems and the re-engineering of water and wastewater transport and resource concepts. Alternative concepts in wastewater collection and treatment, such as decentralised treatment, allied with innovative solutions using current and new technology could play a role in providing affordable and sustainable solutions to deal with the wastewater issue. This paper investigates the scope that integrated wastewater treatment and localised water reuse (in-line treatment, sewer mining), resource recovery (biogas, biosolids), operational changes (timed discharge of sewers, vacuum sewers) and biotreatment (e. g. vermiculture, faecal coliform removal) can play to guarantee the longevity of wastewater infrastructure in megacities. These alternatives offer increased treatment efficiency, recovery of value-added products, and reduce infrastructure cost, whilst maintaining health standards and reducing environmental discharge. G.

FE models are constructed for such honeycomb structures based on Voronoi diagrams with {{different degrees of}} cell shape irregularity and cell wall thickness non-uniformity. The plateau stress, the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> energy and the initiation strain are determined using the FE models. Simulation results reveal that the “X” and “V” shaped deformation modes evident in a perfectly ordered honeycomb at low or moderate impact velocities are disrupted as cell shapes become irregular and/or cell wall thickness gets non-uniform. The “I” shaped deformation mode is clearly seen in all honeycomb structures at high impact velocities. Both the plateau stress and the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> energy are found to decrease as the degree of cell shape irregularity or the degree of cell wall thickness non-uniformity increases, with the weakening effect induced {{by the presence of}} non-uniform cell wall thickness being more significant. When the two types of imperfections co-exist in a honeycomb structure, the interaction between them is seen to exhibit a complicated pattern and to have a nonlinear effect on both the plateau stress and the <b>densification</b> <b>strain</b> energy. It is also found that stress waves propagate faster in a honeycomb structure having irregular cell shapes and slower in a honeycomb structure having non-uniform cell wall thickness than in a perfectly ordered honeycomb.

However, the strain rate effect is not well quantified as {{it is not unusual}} for strain rate to vary during high speed compression. Moreover, according to previous research, aluminium foams, especially ALPORAS® foams, behave differently at low and high strain rates. Therefore, different plastic deformation mechanisms are expected for low and high strain rate loadings as a result of micro-inertia of cell walls.

For such applications, three key material properties are the crushing stress, plateau stress and <b>densification</b> <b>strain.</b> The difficulties associated with obtaining these mechanical properties from dynamic/impact tests are outlined. The results of an experimental investigation of the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties of two types of cellular {{materials are}} reported.

The use of the elementary wave theory is shown to give satisfactory results for frequencies of up to approximately 15 kHz, 8 kHz and 30 kHz for the 20 mm and 40 mm diameter PMMA bars and the 23 mm diameter Magnesium bars respectively.

However, a dynamic enhancement of the crushing stress and plateau stress was revealed for balsa wood and Rohacell- 51 WF. In contrast, the plateau stresses of the Rohacell- 110 WF specimens are lower for SHPB than quasi-static tests. From the DI tests, it is shown that compaction waves have negligible effect on the stresses during dynamic compaction of along and across the grain balsa wood at impact speeds between approximately 20 - 100 m/s. Alternatively, the proximal end stresses of both Rohacell- 51 WF and 110 WF foams increase with increasing impact velocity, following the quadratic trend predicted by 'shock theory'. This indicates that compaction waves are important for the case of Rohacell foam, even at low impact velocities. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
