500|$|Because {{of their}} soft, {{gelatinous}} bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils {{that have been}} interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about [...] in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, {{far more than the}} 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a <b>folded</b> <b>edge</b> that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.|$|E
60|$|The celebrated sculptor, Mr. Woolner, informs me of {{one little}} {{peculiarity}} {{in the external}} ear, which he has often observed both in men and women, and of which he perceived the full significance. His attention was first called to the subject whilst at work on his figure of Puck, {{to which he had}} given pointed ears. He was thus led to examine the ears of various monkeys, and subsequently more carefully those of man. The peculiarity consists in a little blunt point, projecting from the inwardly folded margin, or helix. When present, it is developed at birth, and, according to Prof. Ludwig Meyer, more frequently in man than in woman. Mr. Woolner made an exact model of one such case, and sent me the accompanying drawing. (Fig. 2). These points not only project inwards towards the centre of the ear, but often a little outwards from its plane, so as to be visible when the head is viewed from directly in front or behind. They are variable in size, and somewhat in position, standing either a little higher or lower; and they sometimes occur on one ear and not on the other. They are not confined to mankind, for I observed a case in one of the spider-monkeys (Ateles beelzebuth) in our Zoological Gardens; and Mr. E. Ray Lankester informs me of another case in a chimpanzee in the gardens at Hamburg. The helix obviously consists of the extreme margin of the ear folded inwards; and this folding appears to be in some manner connected with the whole external ear being permanently pressed backwards. In many monkeys, which do not stand high in the order, as baboons and some species of macacus (32. See also some remarks, and the drawings of the ears of the Lemuroidea, in Messrs. Murie and Mivart's excellent paper in 'Transactions of the Zoological Society,' vol. vii. 1869, pp. 6 and 90.), the upper portion of the ear is slightly pointed, and the margin is not at all folded inwards; but if the margin were to be thus folded, a slight point would necessarily project inwards towards the centre, and probably a little outwards from the plane of the ear; and this I believe to be their origin in many cases. On the other hand, Prof. L. Meyer, in an able paper recently published (33. 'Uber das Darwin'sche Spitzohr,' Archiv fur Path. Anat. und Phys., 1871, p. 485.), maintains that the whole case is one of mere variability; and that the projections are not real ones, but are due to the internal cartilage {{on each side of the}} points not having been fully developed. I am quite ready to admit that this is the correct explanation in many instances, as in those figured by Prof. Meyer, in which there are several minute points, or the whole margin is sinuous. I have myself seen, through the kindness of Dr. L. Down, the ear of a microcephalous idiot, on which there is a projection on the outside of the helix, and not on the inward <b>folded</b> <b>edge,</b> so that this point can have no relation to a former apex of the ear. Nevertheless in some cases, my original view, that the points are vestiges of the tips of formerly erect and pointed ears, still seems to me probable. I think so from the frequency of their occurrence, and from the general correspondence in position with that of the tip of a pointed ear. In one case, of which a photograph has been sent me, the projection is so large, that supposing, in accordance with Prof. Meyer's view, the ear to be made perfect by the equal development of the cartilage throughout the whole extent of the margin, it would have covered fully one-third of the whole ear. Two cases have been communicated to me, one in North America, and the other in England, in which the upper margin is not at all folded inwards, but is pointed, so that it closely resembles the pointed ear of an ordinary quadruped in outline. In one of these cases, which was that of a young child, the father compared the ear with the drawing which I have given (34. 'The Expression of the Emotions,' p. 136.) of the ear of a monkey, the Cynopithecus niger, and says that their outlines are closely similar. If, in these two cases, the margin had been folded inwards in the normal manner, an inward projection must have been formed. I may add that in two other cases the outline still remains somewhat pointed, although the margin of the upper part of the ear is normally folded inwards--in one of them, however, very narrowly. [Fig.3. Foetus of an Orang(?). Exact copy of a photograph, shewing the form of the ear at this early age.] The following woodcut (No. 3) is an accurate copy of a photograph of the foetus of an orang (kindly sent me by Dr. Nitsche), in which it may be seen how different the pointed outline of the ear is at this period from its adult condition, when it bears a close general resemblance to that of man. It is evident that the folding over of the tip of such an ear, unless it changed greatly during its further development, would give rise to a point projecting inwards. On the whole, it still seems to me probable that the points in question are in some cases, both in man and apes, vestiges of a former condition.|$|E

The draw sheet {{may or may not be}} tucked into the sides of the bed. When a draw sheet is used to move patients, it is sometimes known as a lift sheet. Nursing manuals recommend that, when a plastic or rubber draw sheet is used, a cotton drawsheet is placed over it. If a folded sheet is used as a draw sheet, the <b>folded</b> <b>edge</b> of the sheet is positioned at the person's upper body.

40|$|Low energy {{electron}} beam irradiation of {{the edges of}} graphene can lead to rearrangement of the carbon atomic structure. We demonstrate the ability to distinguish intrinsic edges of graphene from edges formed by back folding based upon atomic structure and their susceptibility to sputtering. We examine how the atomic structure of the edges of graphene and few layer graphene sheets influences their stability under {{electron beam}} irradiation at a low electron accelerating voltage of 80 kV using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrate that edges of few layer graphene produced by back folding are extremely robust against electron beam induced sputtering as compared to intrinsic edges that are naturally formed. The stability of the <b>folded</b> <b>edges</b> in few layer graphene is shown to increase with increasing number of layers.

Objectives: Spinal cords and spinal nerves from young and adult horses in relation with transformation of the facet joints from the cervical vertebral column. Methodes: Equine cervical articular process joints (APJ) from 10 foals and 10 adult horses, ranging from cervical vertebra 3 (C 3) to thoracal vertebra 2 (T 2) bilaterally were used in this study. The articular process joints were dissected and the cranial and caudal facets were macroscopically described. The spinal cord and outgoing spinal nerves are histological reviewed. Results: Foals: 25 % of the foal facets have a concave shape, 93, 8 % of the convave shape facets are located at the cranial part of the facets. 8, 2 % of the facets had an upstanding edge, 24, 2 % had a beveled edge and 39, 1 % had a <b>folded</b> <b>edge.</b> Adult: 0, 8 % of the adult facets have a concave shape, 4. 3 % of the facets had an upstanding edge, 1, 6 % had a beveled edge and 11, 3 % had a <b>folded</b> <b>edge.</b> Conclusions and potential relevance: In this study, no relation is observed between facet transformations and damage in the spinal cord/ nerves.

30|$|Midbrain {{dopamine}} neurons {{exhibit a}} novel type of bursting {{that we call}} “inverted square wave bursting” when exposed to Ca 2 +-activated small conductance (SK) K+ channel blockers in vitro. This type of bursting has three phases: hyperpolarized silence, spiking, and depolarization block. We find that two slow variables are required {{for this type of}} bursting, and we show that the three-dimensional bifurcation diagram for inverted square wave bursting is a folded surface with upper (depolarized) and lower (hyperpolarized) branches. The activation of the L-type Ca 2 + channel largely supports the separation between these branches. Spiking is initiated at a saddle node on an invariant circle bifurcation at the <b>folded</b> <b>edge</b> of the lower branch and the trajectory spirals around the unstable fixed points on the upper branch. Spiking is terminated at a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, but the trajectory remains on the upper branch until it hits a saddle node on the upper <b>folded</b> <b>edge</b> and drops to the lower branch. The two slow variables contribute as follows. A second, slow component of sodium channel inactivation is largely responsible for the initiation and termination of spiking. The slow activation of the ether-a-go-go-related (ERG) K+ current is largely responsible for termination of the depolarized plateau. The mechanisms and slow processes identified herein may contribute to bursting as well as entry into and recovery from the depolarization block to different degrees in different subpopulations of dopamine neurons in vivo.|$|E
