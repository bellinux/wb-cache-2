Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 13, 460 adult (≥ 18 yrs) ED visits between April 1 2006 and March 30 2007 at a tertiary care teaching hospital with two ED sites in which the mode of disposition was admission to ICU, surgery or inpatient wards. We defined ED <b>Admission</b> <b>Delay</b> as ED time to decision to admit > 12 hours. The primary outcomes were IP LOS, and total IP cost. Results Approximately 11. 6 % (n = 1558) of admitted patients experienced <b>admission</b> <b>delay.</b> In multivariate analysis we found that <b>admission</b> <b>delay</b> was associated with 12. 4 % longer IP LOS (95 % CI 6. 6 % - 18. 5 %) and 11. 0 % greater total IP cost (6. 0 % - 16. 4 %).

The QoS architecture uses an admission control technique that limits link utilisation for real-time traffic flows {{in order to reduce}} queuing <b>delay.</b> <b>Admission</b> control uses a 2 -phase commit protocol for handling QoS negotiation and adaptation. We also present a mechanism for deploying QoS-enabled dependable TCP services in this network.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the role of first contact emergency departments and ambulances on transport duration, pain-to-balloon time, door-to-balloon time and first contact-to-balloon time in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Methods: The study was a prospective and observational investigation. A total of 374 AMI patients initially admitted to primary coronary intervention (PCI) incapable centers were included in this study. Patients were classified according to initial presentation site (daily clinic, public hospital or private hospital) and transport manner (public or private ambulance). All groups were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests statistically according to their characteristics, transport duration and pain-to-balloon time. Results: A majority of the patients were initially admitted to public (40. 1 %) or private hospitals (47. 1 %). The average door-to-balloon time was 45. 0 ± 18. 5 min and the mean pain-to-balloon time was 310. 6 ± 160. 8 min. Nearly half of the patients initially admitted to daily clinics were first transported to PCI-incapable centers, leading to <b>delayed</b> <b>admission</b> to PCI-capable centers and increased pain-to-balloon and first contact-to-balloon times (361. 7 ± 194. 5 min, p= 0. 01 and 279. 7 ± 158. 2 min, p< 0. 001). Patients admitted to private hospitals experienced shorter average pain-to-balloon and first contact-to-balloon times (277. 5 ± 148. 6 min, p= 0. 01 and 157. 4 ± 83. 1 min, p< 0. 001). Patients transported by private ambulances also experienced shorter waiting times and shorter pain-to-balloon times (107. 4 ± 70. 4 and 270. 1 ± 150. 4 min, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Physicians and healthcare professionals in first contact emergency departments and ambulance type appear to be factors in the increased pain-to-balloon time.

The purposes of this study were: (1) to describe the delay between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission of patients with CVT, and (2) to identify the variables that influence that delay. We registered the interval (days) between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission in 91 consecutive patients admitted to 20 Portuguese hospitals between June 1995 and June 1998. We also studied the impact of <b>admission</b> <b>delay</b> on treatments (prescription of anticoagulants and the number of days elapsed between the onset of symptoms and start of anticoagulation and <b>admission).</b> Median <b>admission</b> <b>delay</b> was 4 days. Twenty-two (25 %) patients were admitted within 24 h. Two thirds of the patients were admitted within 7 days and 75 % within 13 days. In multiple logistic regression analysis, admission within 24 h was positively associated with mental status disorder (delirium or abulia; OR = 4. 59; 95 % CI = 1. 41 - 14. 89) and negatively associated with headache (OR = 0. 03; 95 % CI = 0. 00 - 0. 32). Presentation as isolated intracranial hypertension was associated with <b>admission</b> <b>delay</b> of more than 4 days (OR = 2. 63; 95 % CI = 0. 97 - 7. 14).

There was no association between <b>admission</b> <b>delay</b> and the proportion of anticoagulated patients. The interval between onset of symptoms and start of anticoagulation was shorter in patients admitted earlier (p = 0. 0001, for either admission within 24 h, 4 or 13 days).

40|$|Cobra bites {{are quite}} rare in European {{countries}} as these snakes are not native there.

A case of a male patient bitten by a thai cobra in the left index finger is presented. Antitoxin administration was delayed due to secondary patient admission. Progressive tissue necrosis made radical debridement necessary, resulting in the need for plastic surgical defect coverage with a flap. While a radical debridement to prevent toxic necrosis due to lytic enzymes in cobra venom has been favoured beforehand, large case studies led to a more restrained initial surgical intervention. However, antitoxin administration should be first line therapy in management of these cases. If severe necrosis is present as it might occur in <b>delayed</b> <b>admission,</b> a plastic surgical management of the patient might be advantageous...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Attending {{physician}} {{judgment is}} the traditional standard of care for emergency department (ED) admission decisions. The extent to which variability in admission decisions affect cost and quality is not well understood. We sought to determine the impact of variability in admission decisions on cost and quality. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of patients presenting to a university-affiliated, urban ED from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. The main outcome measures were admission rate, fiscal indicators (Medicaid-denied payment days), and quality indicators (15 - and 30 -day ED returns; <b>delayed</b> hospital <b>admissions).</b> We asked each attending to estimate his/her inpatient admission rate and correlated his personal assessment with actual admission rates.   Results: Admission rates, even after adjusting for known confounders, were highly variable (15. 2 %- 32. 0 %) and correlated with Medicaid denied-payment day rates (p= 0. 038). There was no correlation with quality outcome measures (30 -day ED return or <b>delayed</b> hospital <b>admission).</b> There was no significant correlation between actual and self-described admission rate; the range of mis-estimation was 0 % to 117 %.   Conclusion: Emergency medicine attending admission rates at this institution are highly variable, unexplained by known confounding variables, and unrelated to quality of care, as measured by 30 -day ED return or <b>delayed</b> hospital <b>admission.</b>  Admission optimization represents an important untapped potential for cost reduction through avoidable hospitalizations, with no apparent adverse effects on quality.
