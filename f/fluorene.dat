These investigations used acetic acid as the solvent and demonstrated that sodium acetate behaves as a base under these conditions. [...] This observation is consistent with Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory (published in 1923) but cannot be explained under older Arrhenius theory approaches. Later work with George Wheland and extended by William Kirk McEwen looked at the properties of hydrocarbons as very weak acids, including acetophenone, phenylacetylene, <b>fluorene</b> and diphenylmethane.

2500|$|Commercial {{creosote}} {{will contain}} substances from six groups. The two groups {{occur in the}} greatest amounts and are {{the products of the}} distillation process—the [...] "tar acids", which distill below 205°C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205° and 255°C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255°C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenapthene, and <b>fluorene.</b> Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote will contain several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the [...] "tar bases" [...] and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans. Lastly, creosote will contain a small number of aromatic amines produced by the other substances during the distillation process and likely resulting from a combination of thermolysis and hydrogenation. The tar bases are often extracted by washing the creosote with aqueous mineral acid, although they're also suggested to have antiseptic ability similar to the tar acids.|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of extracellular plaques comprised of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. Soluble oligomers of the Aβ peptide underlie a cascade of neuronal loss and dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. Single particle analyses of Aβ oligomers in solution by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were used to provide real-time descriptions of how spin-labeled <b>fluorenes</b> (SLFs; bi-functional small molecules that block the toxicity of Aβ) prevent and disrupt oligomeric assemblies of Aβ in solution. Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of untreated Aβ shows a continuous, progressive change over a 24 -hour period, while the spectrum of Aβ treated with SLF remains relatively constant following initial incubation. These findings suggest the conformation of Aβ within the oligomer provides a complementary determinant of Aβ toxicity in addition to oligomer growth and size. Although SLF does not produce a dominant state of secondary structure in Aβ, it does induce a net reduction in beta secondary content compared to untreated samples of Aβ. The FCS results, combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and CD spectroscopy, demonstrate SLFs can inhibit the growth of Aβ oligomers and disrupt existing oligomers, while retaining Aβ as a population of smaller, yet largely disordered oligomers...|$|R

In the batch-reactor experiment, each reactor contained a surfactant solution and West Texas Crude oil, while the control reactors contained distilled-deionized water and the crude oil. Using a temporal-monitoring scheme, the reactors were sacrificially sampled to determine the water-accommodated fraction (WAF). The phenanthrenes, <b>fluorenes,</b> pyrenes, and chrysenes showed significant increases in their aqueous-plus-micellar-phase concentrations in the presence of surfactants; the increase was greater for the biosurfactant compared to the synthetic surfactant. The enhancement in "solubility" was also more significant for the highly-substituted aromatics, when compared to their parent compounds.

The Cycloclasticus strains isolated in this study could grow on crude oil and degraded PAH components of crude oil, including unsubstituted and substituted naphthalenes, dibenzothiophenes, phenanthrenes, and <b>fluorenes.</b> To deduce the role of Cycloclasticus strains in a coastal zone oil spill, propagation of this bacterial group on oil-coated grains of gravel immersed in seawater was investigated in beach-simulating tanks that were 1 m wide by 1. 5 m long by 1 m high. The tanks were two-thirds filled with gravel, and seawater was continuously introduced into the tanks; the water level was varied between 30 cm above and 30 cm below the surface of the gravel layer to simulate a 12 -h tidal cycle. The number of Cycloclasticus cells associated with the grains was on the order of 103 cells/g of grains before crude oil was added to the tanks and increased to 3 × 106 cells/g of grains after crude oil was added. The number increased further after 14 days to 108 cells/g of grains when nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers were added, while the number remained 3 × 106 cells/g of grains when no fertilizers were added. PAH degradation proceeded parallel with the growth of Cycloclasticus cells on the surfaces of the oil-polluted grains of gravel.

A set of enzyme activities involved in immune defence mechanisms and detoxification processes, i. e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catecholase-type phenoloxidase (PO), laccase-type PO and lysozyme were analysed in different oyster tissues, i. e. the gills, digestive gland and mantle, and in the plasma and the haemoycte lysate supernatant (HLS) of the haemolymph. Results indicated that total PAH body burdens were 2. 7 times higher in the presence than in the absence of the chemical dispersant. After 2 days of exposure to chemically dispersed oil, alkylated naphthalenes accounted for 55 % of the total PAH body burden, whereas alkylated <b>fluorenes</b> and alkylated dibenzothiophenes accounted for 80 % when the chemical dispersant was absent. Importantly, a higher number of enzyme activities were modified when oil was chemically dispersed, especially in the plasma and gills. Moreover, independently of the presence or absence of chemical dispersant, oil exposure generally inhibited enzyme activities in the gills and plasma, while they were generally activated in the mantle and haemocytes. These results suggest that the gills and plasma constitute sensitive compartments in C. gigas, and that mantle and haemocytes may play an important role in protection against xenobiotics. Among the six enzyme activities that were analysed in these body compartments, five were modulated in the chemical dispersion (CD) treatment while only half of the enzyme activities were modulated in the mechanical dispersion treatment. Furthermore, CD treatment effects were often observed following exposure, but also during depuration periods.

Both the morphology of the macro remains and microscopic examination of isolated plant cuticles reveal species typical of coastal swampy palaeoenvironments, mainly the fern Weichselia reticulata. After isolation of the plant remains, preliminary characterisation of the fossil organic matter was carried out using cross-polarization, magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13 C NMR) spectroscopy and Curie point analytical pyrolysis. The 13 C NMR results suggested a type III kerogen from predominantly terrestrial material which was subjected to intense diagenetic and catagenetic changes.

A multi-phase bioremediation project was initiated raphics. following the rupture of several oil and gas pipelines during extensive flooding of the San Jacinto River near Houston, Texas, in October of 1994. A small cove and its associated wetlands were set aside for petroleum bioremediation studies. Phase I began in December of 1994 and monitored sediment toxicity associated with intrinsic petroleum degradation. Acute toxicity was evaluated using the Microtox 100 % Test on sediment elutriates from 21 plots around the study site over a period of 7 months. Sediment toxicity was elevated near the mouth of the cove and decreased to non-detectable levels within 4 months. Acute toxicity was correlated with sediment total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) target saturate concentrations. Phase 11 began in March 1996 with the controlled application of weathered oil and selected nutrient amendments to evaluate their effects on bioremediation. The amendments evaluated were inorganic nutrients and inorganic nutrients plus an alternate electron acceptor. The effects of treatments on sediment toxicity and mutagenicity were assessed using Microtox 100 % and Solid-phase Tests and amphipod, cytochrome P 450 Reporter Gene System (RGS), Toxi-ChromoPad and Salmonella/microsome assays. Significant toxicity was detected (Microtox*) in all plots that were oiled followed by a rapid decrease that was correlated to petroleum losses. Amphipod mortality was initially high for all oiled sediments and decreased significantly over time. However, a significant increase in mortality was observed in plots receiving nutrient amendments after 140 days, possibly due to elevated ammonia levels. The Toxi-chl. omol 3 adTM and Salmonella assays were not sensitive to petroleum addition. Significant correlations were identified between Microtox and GC-MS target analyse levels in total sediment extractions. Subsequent GC-MS analyses of sediment elutriates revealed that Microtox toxicity was strongly correlated with <b>fluorenes,</b> naphthalenes, phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes. In conclusion, significant toxicity was detected in oiled sediments that decreased to near background levels within months. The addition of treatments did not consistently alter sediment-associated toxicity {{with the exception of the}} amphipod assay. The Microtox, amphipod and P 450 RGS assays were sensitive to weathered oil. However, the Toxi-ChromoPad and Salmonella assays were not sensitive under the experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The unifying {{theme of}} most of {{optoelectronic}} devices revolves around the charge carrier mobility of the organic materials used in the conductive layers, which {{is a measure of}} how easily the electron/hole moves in a particular pi conjugated organic material. When pi conjugated materials are incorporated in these devices, molecules are generally layered in random orientation. Consequently, the efficiency of charge transport in the conducting layers of these devices is governed not only by the intramolecular electron/hole transport through the backbone of the molecule but also by the intermolecular electron/hole transport between the molecules and hence packing of these molecules plays a critical role in the efficiency of these devices. Although significant {{progress has been made in}} understanding the charge transport mechanisms in various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the usefulness of such materials in functional devices remains limited; hence design and synthesis of new PAHs to better understand the charge transport mechanisms remains an active area of research. A novel series of methoxydibenzochrysenes was designed and synthesized utilizing ferric chloride mediated oxidative cyclodehydrogenation as a key step. We have also shown that numerous 9, 10 -diarylphenanthrenes and dibenzo[g,p]chrysenes can be prepared from a readily available tetraarylethylenes using 1 and 2 equivalents of 2, 3 -dichloro- 5, 6 -dicyano- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (DDQ), respectively. A similar oxidative cyclodehydrogenation strategy was used for synthesizing a highly soluble, larger derivative of hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC), where twelve carbon-carbon bonds are formed in a single step. Deployment of <b>fluorenes</b> at the periphery of the HBC core not only imparts solubility to the structure, but also allows the new PAHs to be functionalized further to make bigger PAHs. X-ray crystal structure determination of octamethoxydibenzochrysene cation radical and 1, 4, 5, 8 -tetramethoxyanthracene dimer cation radical, in addition to their neutral structures, allowed us to delineate the effect of electron removal on their bond length changes. Definitive X-ray crystallographic evidence is obtained for a single hole to be uniformly distributed on the three equivalent 1, 2 -dimethoxybenzenoid (or veratrole) rings in the hexamethoxytriptycene cation radical. This conclusion is further supported by electrochemical analysis and by the observation of an intense near-IR transition in its electronic spectrum, as well as by comparison of the spectral and electrochemical characteristics with the model compounds containing one and two dimethoxybenzene rings. A new class of intervalance cation radicals from p-diaryloxybenzenes was also studied...|$|R
