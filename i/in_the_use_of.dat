5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence.

The present study examines ethnic differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> interactive uncertainty reduction communication [...] self-disclosure, interrogative strategies, non-verbal immediacy, and other's self-disclosure [...] and their inter-relationships with attributional confidence (uncertainty reduction). A total of 1163 college students from the United States, representing African-, Asian-, Hispanic-, and Euro-American ethnicities participated in a survey soliciting information on <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty reduction strategies with a same-sexed, same-ethnic, equal-status acquaintance. Significant differ-ences were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty reduction strategies among the various ethnicities. Self-disclosure had a pan-cultural effect on attributional confidence but the other types of uncertainty reduction communication appeared to be more culture-specific, contributing significantly to attributional confidence only for certain ethnic groups. Explanations for these differences are explored and future research directions suggested...|$|R

Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> weapons.
