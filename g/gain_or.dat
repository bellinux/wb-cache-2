5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters <b>gain</b> (<b>or</b> sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E
50|$|Non-operating income, in {{accounting}} and finance, is <b>gains</b> <b>or</b> losses from sources {{not related to}} the typical activities of the business or organization. Non-operating income can include <b>gains</b> <b>or</b> losses from investments, property or asset sales, currency exchange, and other atypical <b>gains</b> <b>or</b> losses. Non-operating income is generally not recurring and is therefore usually excluded or considered separately when evaluating performance {{over a period of time}} (e.g. a quarter or year).|$|R

5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} have full valence {{electron}} shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.|$|E

5|$|The SS owned {{experimental}} farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, {{clothing and}} uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls. According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal <b>gain,</b> <b>or</b> took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market.|$|E
5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Tennessee {{started its}} drive from its 20-yard line. On the second {{play of the}} possession, Crompton {{completed}} a 40-yard pass to wide receiver Denarius Moore. The play gave Tennessee its first plays inside Virginia Tech territory, and the Volunteers capitalized on the field position. After two rushing plays were stymied for no <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> losses, Crompton completed a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones. Crompton was sacked on the next play, but two plays later completed a 20-yard throw to Jones, who ran out of bounds at the Tech 4-yard line, giving Tennessee another first down. Two plays later, running back Montario Hardesty ran forward four yards into the end zone, halving Virginia Tech's lead. After the extra point, Virginia Tech still led, 14-7, with 6:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight <b>gain</b> <b>or</b> loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E
