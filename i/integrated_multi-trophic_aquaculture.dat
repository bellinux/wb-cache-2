40|$|Coastal protection, {{nutrient}} cycling, erosion control, water purification, {{and carbon}} sequestration are ecosystem {{services provided by}} salt marshes. Additionally, salt ponds offer coastal breeding and a nursery habitat for fishes and they provide abundant invertebrates, such as amphipods, which are potentially useful as a resource in aquaculture. Fishmeal and fish oil are necessary food resources to support aquaculture of carnivorous species due to their omega- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 LC-PUFA). Currently, aquaculture depends on limited fisheries and feed with elevated n- 3 LC-PUFA levels, but {{the development of more}} sustainable food sources is necessary. Amphipods appear to be a potential high quality alternative feed resource for aquaculture. Hence, a nutritional study was carried out for several main amphipod species—Microdeutopus gryllotalpa, Monocorophium acherusicum, Gammarus insensibilis, Melita palmata and Cymadusa filosa—in terrestrial ponds in the South of Spain. These species showed high protein content (up to 40 %), high n- 3 PUFA and phospholipid levels, and high levels of phophatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and triacylglycerols (TAG), the latter being significantly high for M. acherusicum. M. gryllotalpa and M. acherusicum showed the highest proportion of lipids (19. 15 % and 18. 35 %, respectively). Isoleucine, glycine and alanine were the dominant amino acids in all species. In addition, amphipods collected from ponds showed low levels of heavy metals. Furthermore, the biochemical profiles of the five species of amphipods have been compared with other studied alternative prey. Therefore, pond amphipods are good candidates to be used as feed, and are proposed as a new sustainable economic resource to be used in aquaculture. G. insensibilis may be the best for intensive culture as an alternative feed resource because it shows: (1) adequate n- 3 PUFA and PL composition; (2) high levels of glycine, alanine, tyrosine, isoleucine and lysine; (3) high natural densities; (4) large body size (≥ 1  cm), and (5) high concentration of calcium. Moreover, a combined culture of amphipods and fishes in these marsh ponds seems a promising and environmentally sustainable way to develop <b>Integrate</b> <b>Multi-Trophic</b> <b>Aquaculture</b> (IMTA) in these ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntegrated <b>multi-trophic</b> <b>aquaculture</b> (IMTA) is a {{promising}} {{direction for the}} sustainable development of aquaculture. Microalgae have good potential to be integrated with recirculating aquaculture systems because they can use the nitrogen excreted from fish and share the same optimal pH value as in aquaculture. As a byproduct, the microalgae biomass {{can be used for}} fish feed or biofuel. However, the recirculating fish-microalgae IMTA system is under constant threat from fish pathogens and phytoplankton-lytic bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to apply proper disinfectants as prophylaxis or treatment which are effective against these threats, but safe to fish and microalgae. For this purpose, peracetic acid (PAA) is a valid option because it is highly effective against fish pathogens and bacteria at low concentrations and degrades spontaneously to harmless residues. In the present study, we exposed the culture of a marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii once per day for four days to four PAA products with differing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) /PAA proportions at two concentrations (1 and 2 mgL− 1 PAA). The H 2 O 2 solutions at equivalent total peroxide (H 2 O 2 +PAA) concentrations were tested in parallel. The results show that the growth and photosynthesis of T. chuii were not affected by three of the PAA products (Wofasteril® E 400, Wofasteril® E 250 and Applichem® 150) and equivalent H 2 O 2 solutions at both concentrations. In contrast, Wofasteril® Lspez and an equivalent H 2 O 2 solution at both concentrations caused irreversible culture collapse, photosynthesis dysfunction and irreversible cell damage. In conclusion, PAA products with low proportions of H 2 O 2 are optimal disinfectants for fish-microalgae IMTA systems...|$|R

Caprellids could potentially be an important exploitable resource in aquaculture due to their high levels of beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids, fast growing nature and widespread distribution.

Despite this, {{there is a lack}} of experimental studies to: (i) test inexpensive diets for caprellids, such as detritus, (ii) develop sustainable caprellid culture techniques and (iii) include caprellids in IMTA systems. The main aim of this study was to determine whether detritus (D) in the form of fish faeces provided an adequate diet for caprellids in comparison to other traditional diets, such as Artemia nauplii (A) or phytoplankton (P). Adult survival rate was shown to be significantly higher for caprellids fed with D. Conversely, hatchlings had the highest survival rate with A, although the juvenile growth rate and number of moults was similar in the three diets. With regard to lipid composition, caprellids fed with A had higher concentrations of Triacylglycerols (TAG) and Phosphatidylcholine (PC) while those fed with P or D were richer in polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially 22 : 6 (n- 3) (DHA). Interestingly, caprellids fed with D were also a rich source of 18 : 2 (n- 6) (LA), considered to be an essential fatty acid in vertebrates. It was found that detritus based mainly on fish faeces and uneaten feed pellets can be considered an adequate feed for adult caprellids, providing a source of both omega- 3 (DHA) and omega- 6 (LA) fatty acids. Hatchlings however seem to require an additional input of TAG and PC during juvenile stages to properly grow...|$|R

Analyzing {{the quality and quantity}} of material exiting the farms and its uptake by surrounding invertebrates highlights the effectiveness of muti-trophic, co-culturing systems where waste from one species is recycled as food for adjacent species. This thesis describes organic throughput of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) land-based tanks and uptake of organic constituents by invertebrates surrounding Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms. [...] The land-based tank output showed significant lipid and fatty acid increases in outflow compared to inflow (p< 0. 020) for the breakdown indicator free fatty acid (FFA), the markers of zooplankton and subsequent indicators of the feed, 20 : 1 ω 9 and 22 : 1 ω 11, and the essential fatty acid DHA(docosahexaenoic acid, 22 : 6 ω 3). Scaling to an 1880 tonne Atlantic cod farm showed 3170 ± 870 kg/day particulate dry weight and 4. 7 ± 1. 7 kg/day DHA exiting the farms. Based on the amount of DHA required per mussel, the scaled amount of DHA could theoretically support 1400 tonnes of mussels assuming optimal consumption of the available DHA. This relates to mussels' role in multi-tropic co-culturing systems as they could assimilate valuable compounds that would otherwise be lost. [...] Regression analysis of particle uptake by invertebrates surrounding multiple aquaculture sites in coastal British Columbia showed a decrease in wet weight for mussels with increasing distance from the farm. There was also an increase in DHA in molluscs combined as well as mussels alone. Principal components analysis showed a similar trend with DHA being higher in molluscs further away from the farm. In addition, bacterial fatty acid markers were higher in molluscs further from the farm except for the individual bacterial fatty acid, 18 : 1 ω 7, which remained higher closer to the farm for molluscs combined, mussels and whelks, and mussels alone; however, not for limpets alone.

The distribution of the NBSS was linear at all stations (R 2 values: 0. 87 - 0. 93) but dome-shape features appeared related to phytoplankton cell distribution which are responsible for a large fraction of microbial respiration. Generally, the region showed an autotrophic budget south of the archipelago due to gross primary production (GPP) values up to 2804 mg C m- 2 day- 1, where salps could significantly contribute to the carbon export flux. Contrastingly, higher CR rates (. 1000 mg C m- 2 day- 1) were found at the northern stations due to a higher phytoplankton respiration activity associated with increasing sea water temperatures and a higher presence of heterotrophic organisms (microheterotrophs, chaetognaths and copepods) resulting in a net heterotrophic metabolic state (GPP/CR < 1). © 2014 The Author.
