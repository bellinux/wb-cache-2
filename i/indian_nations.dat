5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> {{were under}} increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
50|$|Many tribes {{within the}} Pacific Northwest receive per capita {{payments}} from their tribes but the Quinault <b>Indian</b> <b>Nation</b> currently does not. The economy for Quinault <b>Indian</b> <b>Nation</b> is mainly {{derived from the}} Quinault Beach Resort and Casino, timber, and various fishing entities (Quinault Pride Seafood, etc.).

5000|$|The Montaukett <b>Indian</b> <b>Nation</b> is an unrecognized {{tribe of}} {{individuals}} who claim descent from historic Montaukett people. The Montaukett <b>Indian</b> <b>Nation</b> did not become extinct but have [...] "their own government in the position and administration of Chief Robert Pharaoh." [...] Additionally, the nation has over 600 members on its original tribal roll." [...] The nation claims a relation to the language {{and culture of the}} now federally recognized Shinnecock <b>Indian</b> <b>Nation</b> in neighboring Southampton.|$|R
5|$|In 1830, President Andrew Jackson {{had signed}} the Indian Removal Act, which {{authorized}} {{the government to}} remove any <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> east of the Mississippi River across to the western side and offer land in exchange. As northern Wisconsin was not then under pressure for development by white settlers, as occurred in the Southeast, the Ojibwa were not among the first targets of the act. They watched closely as the government used the territorial claims defined by tribes in 1825 to force numerous tribes in Indiana, southern Michigan and southern Wisconsin to move west to Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. These included the Odawa and Potawatomi, two Anishinaabe tribes closely related to and allied with the Ojibwa.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} {{lobbying}} for {{a permit to}} build an eagle sanctuary {{in order to be}} able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{call for}} an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for {{non-native}} schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell <b>Indian</b> <b>Nations</b> University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors.|$|E

5|$|In the French sources, one {{important}} discussion {{has centered on}} the question of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|When explorers, early trappers {{and hunters}} and gold miners visited {{and settled in}} Colorado, the state was {{populated}} by American <b>Indian</b> <b>nations.</b> Westward expansion brought European settlers to the area and Colorado's recorded history began with treaties and wars with Mexico and American <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> to gain territorial lands to support the transcontinental migration. In {{the early days of}} the Colorado gold rush, Colorado was a Territory of Kansas and Territory of Jefferson. On August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted as a state, maintaining its territorial borders.|$|E

25|$|The Reconstruction Era {{played out}} {{differently}} in Indian Territory and for Native Americans {{than for the}} rest of the country.

25|$|Finally, {{the arrival}} of the Portuguese on the Indian subcontinent in the sixteenth century likely {{influenced}} Cochin politics.

25|$|Chief Justice John Marshall {{laid out}} in this opinion that the {{relationship}} between the <b>Indian</b> <b>Nations</b> and the United States is that of nations. He reasoned that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the rights of Great Britain as they were held by that nation. Those rights, he stated, include the sole right to deal with the <b>Indian</b> <b>nations</b> in North America, to the exclusion of any other European power. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those {{are in the hands of}} the federal government, and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs. Georgia's statute was therefore invalid.|$|E
