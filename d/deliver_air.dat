500|$|Inert gas systems <b>deliver</b> <b>air</b> with {{an oxygen}} {{concentration}} {{of less than}} 5% by volume. As a tank is pumped out, {{it is filled with}} inert gas and kept in this safe state until the next cargo is loaded. [...] The exception is in cases when the tank must be entered. Safely gas-freeing a tank is accomplished by purging hydrocarbon vapors with inert gas until the hydrocarbon concentration inside the tank is under about 1%. Thus, as air replaces the inert gas, the concentration cannot rise to the lower flammable limit and is safe.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} or its complications such as {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome {{may cause}} lungs to lose compliance (stiffen), so higher pressures {{may be needed to}} give normal amounts of air and oxygenate the blood adequately. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which delivers air at a given pressure {{at the end of the}} expiratory cycle, can reduce edema and keep alveoli from collapsing. [...] PEEP is considered necessary with mechanical ventilation; however, if the pressure is too great it can expand the size of the contusion and injure the lung. When the compliance of the injured lung differs significantly from that of the uninjured one, the lungs can be ventilated independently with two ventilators in order to <b>deliver</b> <b>air</b> at different pressures; this helps avoid injury from overinflation while providing adequate ventilation.|$|E

50|$|Simple {{two-stroke}} engines with ported inlet and exhaust {{cannot be}} supercharged since the inlet port always closes first. For this reason, two-stroke Diesel engines usually have mechanical exhaust valves with separate timing to allow supercharging. Regardless of this, two-stroke engines require scavenging at all engine speeds and so turbocharged two-stroke engines must still employ a blower, usually Roots type. This blower may be mechanically or electrically driven, {{in either case}} the blower may be disengaged once the turbocharger starts to <b>deliver</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
50|$|Supercharged {{piston engines}} {{typically}} use many cylinders arranged in-line {{and one or}} two superchargers. Superchargers <b>deliver</b> <b>air</b> at a relatively constant rate, while cylinders demand it in a varying manner, as the valves open and as piston speed varies through the stroke. Simple direct ducting would give problems where the nearest cylinders received more airflow. The pulsating demand from the cylinders would also show problems of either pressure waves in the duct, or a shortage of inlet air {{towards the end of the}} inlet phase.|$|E

50|$|The Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device or HABD (also {{known as}} a HEED or SEA http://www.aviationsurvival.com/HEEDS-III-Air_c_11.html) {{is a piece of}} {{military}} survival gear which was adopted in order to increase the chances of survival for embarked troops and aircrew trapped in an aircraft which has ditched (crashed into a body of water.) Similar in function to SCUBA gear, it consists of a small cylinder pressurized with atmospheric air and first stage regulator worn in a pouch on the user's flotation vest; a pressure gauge; an air hose and a special second-stage regulator (the part that <b>delivers</b> <b>air</b> via the user's mouth). The regulator is on-demand (it only <b>delivers</b> <b>air</b> when the user breathes in) and is designed to be highly rugged in order to survive impacts associated with emergency ditchings.|$|R
