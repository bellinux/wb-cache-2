5|$|Johnson was {{contracted}} {{to finish the}} edition in 18 months but as the months passed, his pace slowed. He told Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £40. The debt was soon repaid by Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish the work; this motivated Johnson to finish the edition to repay the favour. Although <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|The Sword of Shannara is a 1977 epic fantasy {{novel by}} American writer Terry Brooks. It {{is the first}} book of the Original Shannara Trilogy, {{followed}} by The Elfstones of Shannara and The Wishsong of Shannara. Brooks was heavily influenced by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and began writing The Sword of Shannara in 1967. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> seven years to complete, as he was writing the novel while attending law school. Ballantine Books used it to launch the company's new subsidiary Del Rey Books. Its success boosted the commercial expansion of the fantasy genre.|$|E

5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{made his}} debut on 23 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Gillingham at The Darlington Arena. He scored his first goal for Darlington in a 2–1 win against Port Vale on 13 September. Manager Dave Penney praised Burgmeier {{for the start}} he made to the club, both as a goal scorer and creator, which also helped him to play {{his way into the}} {{affections}} of the club's supporters. When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in the two months since he joined Darlington. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see him play at the Millennium Stadium. His next cap clashed with Darlington's FA Cup first round replay with Conference North-side Droylsden, in which they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann flew {{his first}} combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they {{encountered}} 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed {{by the idea}} of scoring his first success, opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, {{but by the end of}} 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-scoring aces, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005, Johnson again {{moved on}} loan this time {{returning}} to Crewe Alexandra in a six-month deal. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> eight games to score his first goal which {{came in a}} 1–1 draw with Plymouth Argyle on 13 September 2005. Three more goals followed {{by the end of}} 2005 including one on Boxing Day against Hull City, who then offered him a permanent deal. Hull and Manchester United agreed a fee for Johnson but he decided to extend his loan deal at Crewe {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. It was not until the last game of the season against Millwall that he scored another to bring his tally to five from 22games. Having failed to make an impact at Manchester United, Johnson was among seven United players given a free transfer at the end of the 2005–06 season. He was offered a contract at Crewe, but also attracted interest from Barnsley and Bradford City, the latter of whom he joined on a two-year deal in June 2006.|$|E

5|$|In November 1941, the 2nd Division {{participated in}} Operation Crusader and {{conducted}} offensive operations towards the Sidi Azeiz area. Kippenberger enjoyed early successes in this campaign, with his battalion engaged in several battles. At one stage, {{he responded to}} an attack in the battalion's rear with a frontal assault resulting in the capture of 300 prisoners. Later {{on the night of}} 25 November, along with the 18th Battalion, he was tasked with the night-time capture of Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh. As the units moved to its positions, he made a navigational error which resulted in his headquarters company becoming separated from the other companies of the battalion. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> until daylight for him to re-establish contact with the remainder of the battalion which, when he located it, was in its expected position having taken the hill with few losses. He was wounded by machine gun fire when he carelessly exposed himself while assessing the battalion's situation. Evacuated to a dressing station, he was captured by elements of the 15th Panzer Division three days later. Still on Belhamed, the 20th Battalion was destroyed in a counterattack, an action observed by a distressed Kippenberger through field glasses.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} his Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly {{and needed to be}} corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{also felt}} the {{pressure}} of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered {{earlier in the year}} with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> seven games before he scored his first goal {{as a member of the}} Flames. He scored 34goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.|$|E

5|$|On {{the final}} {{weekend of the}} 2007–08 season, Del Piero scored a brace against Sampdoria in a 3–3 draw. These two goals were crucial, as <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to 21 goals for the season, thus winning him the Capocannonieri prize in Serie A {{for the first time}} in his illustrious career, beating the likes of {{teammate}} David Trezeguet (20 goals) and Marco Borriello (19 goals), also matching his highest seasonal tally in Serie A since the 1997–98 season. He became only the second Italian ever to win consecutive Capocannoniere titles in two different leagues – former Juventus and 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi being the other. (Coincidentally, Rossi also won the Capocannoniere titles like Del Piero – first in Serie B and then in Serie A). On 26 July, Del Piero was awarded the Scirea Award. Juventus finished the 2007–08 Serie A season in third place, which allowed them to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{selected}} Humber {{with the}} third overall selection in the 2004 MLB draft. During his minor league career, he underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, before making his MLB debut with the Mets. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> several years to regain his ability to throw with the same velocity that he had prior to the injury. After being included in a trade to the Twins for Johan Santana, Humber struggled to establish himself. He spent a year with the Royals organization and was briefly {{a member of the}} Oakland Athletics organization, before being claimed on waivers by the White Sox in 2011, getting an opportunity to pitch in the White Sox' starting rotation. On April 21, 2012, Humber pitched the 21st perfect game in MLB history, defeating the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
5|$|While Fingal was {{discharging}} her cargo, Bulloch went to Richmond {{to confer}} with Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Navy.

He returned to Savannah on 23 November and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal. He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December, but it proved impossible to do as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah, aided by their occupation of Tybee Island {{at the mouth of the}} Savannah River. Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe some other way.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, Moore's {{father was}} again elected MP for Mayo {{and the family}} moved to London the {{following}} year. Here, Moore senior tried, unsuccessfully, to have his son follow a career in the military though, prior to this, he attended the School of Art in the South Kensington Museum where his achievements were no better. He was freed from any burden of education when his father died in 1870. Moore, though still a minor, inherited the family estate that was valued at £3,596. He handed it over to his brother Maurice to manage and in 1873, on attaining his majority, moved to Paris to study art. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> several attempts to find an artist who would accept him as a pupil. Monsieur Jullian, who had previously been a shepherd and circus masked man, took him on for 40 francs a month. At Académie Jullian he met Lewis Weldon Hawkins who became Moore's flatmate and whose trait, as a failed artist, show up in Moore's own characters. He met many of the key artists and writers of the time, including Pissarro, Degas, Renoir, Monet, Daudet, Mallarmé, Turgenev and, above all, Zola, who was to prove an influential figure in Moore's subsequent development as a writer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two Tests, Hutton shared three {{consecutive}} century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced {{the impression that he}} was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. The Sydney Morning Herald criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsillitis, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. Wisden noted that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.|$|E
5|$|Ngwat-Mahop contributed {{greatly in}} his club's season opener, as he scored the fourth goal and {{assisted}} the sixth, in Red Bull Salzburg's 6–0 home devastation against SV Mattersburg. A {{few days later}} he added two more to his tally, as his club won Armenian club Banants by a 7–0 scoreline at home, for the first Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. He once again scored in his club's first leg match for the second Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, against Lithuanian club FK Sūduva. He continued his scoring trends three days later for {{the first round of}} the ÖFB-Cup, in a 1–4 away win against Pasching. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> almost a month to find the net again, as he scored the last goal in his club's 4–2 home win against Vöcklabrucker for the 2nd round of the ÖFB-Cup. A week later he managed to score the opening goal, in Red Bull Salzburg's 2–2 away draw against Sturm Graz. Until the end of the season he featured regularly in his team's matches, although mostly as a substitute, and only managed to score one more goal in a 4–1 home win against Austria Kärnten. At the end he counted 36 appearances with Red Bull Salzburg, of which 27 in the Bundesliga, six in the UEFA Cup and three in the ÖFB-Cup. Out of these matches he scored a total of eight goals, of which three in the Bundesliga, three in the UEFA Cup and two in the ÖFB-Cup.|$|E
