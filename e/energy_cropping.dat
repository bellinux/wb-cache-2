In order to limit the use of fertile agricultural land for producing bioenergy, low quality agricultural land, as well as degraded or drastically disturbed soils have been proposed for the cropping of bioenergy cultivars. Our work aimed at assessing the dynamics of soil invertebrate diversity after plantation of perennial energy crops on metal polluted soils. The results were compared with invertebrate diversity dynamics in soils of other plots, representative either for the dominant land occupancies in the study area, or for unpolluted soil situations. We investigated taxonomic, compositional and functional dimensions of diversity in soil- and surface-dwelling communities. Changes in land use from annual crops to perennial energy crops led to a higher number of individuals in soil. No or few changes in taxonomic richness were recorded with an increasing age of <b>energy</b> <b>cropping.</b> Regarding functional diversity, the proportions of resident invertebrates tended to vary with the age of <b>energy</b> <b>cropping,</b> but neither the trophic composition nor the body spectra were modified. Our findings highlighted an increase of soil carrying capacity after perennial energy crop plantation on metal polluted soils, but effects on invertebrate diversity were limited...|$|E
40|$|Despite various {{options in}} <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> for the {{diversification}} of agricultural land use, {{such as the}} introduction of new crops, in practice, there is a one-sided orientation toward the use of maize as biogas feedstock in Germany. One reason, why they are not yet introduced in practice, is that for most of them neither the agricultural feasibility nor their ecological and economic benefit could be clearly shown to the farmers up to now. As part of the research projects “Site-adapted Cropping Systems for Energy Crops” (EVA), and “Optimized <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> systems for the sustainable biogas production (Upscaling) ” the effects of three new energy crops have been tested under real farm conditions in two different regions {{in the northern part of}} Germany.

The trail has been investigated regarding the following effects: α-diversity at the plot scale, contribution to the β-diversity among the crops and species composition. The results suggest that the integration of the new perennial energy crop might contribute to an essential weed diversity enhancement.

In this study, we have modelled the environmental influences (e. g. : hydrology and sediment) of scenarios of increased biodiesel cropping (Jatropha curcas) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a northern Indian river basin. SWAT has been applied to the River Beas basin, using daily Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation and NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) meteorological data to simulate the river regime and crop yields.

The production of woody energy crops could help to facilitate such revegetation, with examples including the cropping of mallee eucalypts in Western Australia and poplar and willow in Europe. This thesis seeks {{to add to the}} existing knowledge around woody energy crops for revegetation by exploring the applicability of these ideas to the Central West region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This includes analysis of the potential social, economic and environmental impacts of <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> in this region and the development of policy measures to guide the use of woody energy crops for revegetation. The results of two case studies in the NSW Central West are presented, one in the Central Tablelands and another farther west in the wheat and sheep belt around the town of Condobolin. These two regions have much in common, but also possess notable differences in land use, climate, topography, demographic trends and natural resource management priorities. The case study results suggest that different strategies are likely to be required for bioenergy-based agroforestry in each region. Woody energy crops appear closer to being competitive with typical agriculture in the Central Tablelands, where large-scale bioenergy options such as electricity generation or liquid fuel production may be viable due to the presence of existing timber industry residues. At Condobolin, <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> appears less competitive at present, but small-scale options involving wood pellets, briquettes or electricity may be viable for small groups of landholders with high levels of interest in mallee cropping. Recommendations are also presented on policy options {{that could be used to}} guide the development of bioenergy-based agroforestry in a sustainable manner. Policy development of this nature requires consideration of the differing issues, benchmarks and policy measures employed across the revegetation, plantation and bioenergy sectors. Key policy recommendations include measures to support landholders in the establishment of energy plantations, the tailoring of renewable energy incentive programs to promote bioenergy that contributes to revegetation goals and the use of land use planning regulations to mitigate negative land use impacts...|$|E

We compared digestate from biogas production with a commercial mineral NPK-fertilizer and an unfertilized control for a whole growth-period under outdoor conditions, with individual plants growing in large microcosms. To further increase independency from synthetically produced N-fertilizers, the legume plant Medicago sativa was intercropped to fix atmospheric N 2 into the cropping system and to produce additional biomass. NPK fertilization resulted in rapid growth in the first months after planting compared to the organic digestate application, but the latter extended the vegetation period of sida by 20 days. Both fertilization treatments showed a clearly increased biomass production compared with the control plants without any fertilization. Intercropped legume plants fixed additional N into the cropping system and could increase biomass production even though they reduced the yield of sida. We conclude that marginal lands with soil characteristics that do not meet the requirements for conventional crops can be used for biomass production using perennial energy-crops such as Sida hermaphrodita in specially adapted production systems...|$|E

Corn production for ethanol (additive to petrol) for instance resulted in nutrient pollution of the Mississippi basin and the Gulf of Mexico. The growing demand of transport biofuels in Europe can only be met by increasing imports. This contributes to the conversion of grasslands, savannahs and forests in the tropics, losses of biodiversity and additional green house gas emissions.

In on-farm experiments in three different regions of Germany (Thuringian Basin, East Brandenburg and the Lake District of Mecklenburg) between 2008 and 2010, we investigated if and how the cultivation of sorghum affects weed abundances and biodiversity aspects under real farming conditions. Energy maize was used as reference crop for the comparisons with sorghum. Special regard was given to test the hypothesis that differences in the weed flora between both crops can be explained by structural and temporal characteristics of the crop stands. In the field experiments, we found crop stands of sorghum and maize to have varying temporal (sowing time, growth dynamism) and structural traits (crop stands height and coverage). Hence, although sorghum shows a growth habit similar to that of maize, it is differing mainly in: i) the at least 3 - 4 week delayed sowing time, ii) a slow development during early growth stages, iii) a higher crop stand density and more intense shadowing at the end of the growing period. According to these particularities, we found sorghum to be very sensitive to early weed infestations. The height of early weed infestation level were in dependence of the weather conditions.

40|$|Concerns {{about climate}} change related to fossil fuel carbon dioxide {{emissions}} require the development of alternative energy resources. In most scenario studies on future energy supply, bio-energy {{is one of the}} dominant renewable alternatives foreseen. Apart from the use of residues and wastes, the cultivation of dedicated energy crops will be necessary. Especially in densely populated regions such as the Netherlands, energy crop introduction is strongly hampered by lack of available land, related to the low valued added of energy crops compared to e. g. agriculture. A strategy that may help overcome these problems is multiple land use: combining the production of energy crops to other targets on the same tract of land. If a plot not only generates biomass, but also serves other functions such as nature management, more income may be generated, and overall land use efficiency may increase. Central question in this thesis is whether, and to what extent, multiple land use can improve opportunities for energy crops in the Netherlands, in comparison with <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> as single land use. We specified this question into three criteria: (1) multiple land use energy farming options should be biophysically feasible; (2) such combinations should lead to lower biomass production prices compared to single land use; (3) the combinations should open up an area for <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> significant to the national renewable energy targets. The first research topic was to further identify and specify the concept of multiple land use, and develop an operationalisation procedure. Subsequently, specific options for combination of energy crop cultivation with another function were elaborated. In a relatively simple and qualitative way, we analysed four options with willow as an energy crop: combination with drinking water production (on two levels), with traditional willow coppice management, and with an ecological corridor function. We executed more detailed studies on two combination options: willow in hydrological buffer zones around nature reserves, and willow as a breeding bird habitat. Most studied options of combining willow SRC with another function into a multiple land use type appeared to be biophysically feasible. The effect on financial competitiveness of introducing willow SRC in Multiple Land Use varies per combination: in some cases, like the option in groundwater protection areas, competitiveness remains unchanged, while in others, such as the buffer zones, a significant competitiveness increase can be obtained. However, the price reductions are not in the order of magnitude that the price of energy crops draws near to the current prices of biomass residues, the only resource currently applied for bioenergy. The total of land potentially suitable for the investigated options adds up to ca. 100, 000 ha, while the area with improved financial competitiveness is ca 30, 000 ha in total. Given the projections on required area for meeting the national renewable energy objective, MLU areas with improved financial competitiveness will only partly meet this area claim. Therefore, multiple land use will enhance opportunities for energy crop introduction in the Netherlands, but it will not be the panacea for large-scale introduction of competitive energy farming. Potential areas remain limited, as well as financial benefits compared to single land use, and several implementation problems may hamper introduction in practice. This limited perspective on the short term may be altered by long-term developments, such as technical innovations, and developments in the EU Common Agricultural Policy and in the global climate policy...|$|E

However, increase and intensification of biomass production for energetic use has already shown adverse impacts on agro-ecosystems (e. g., biodiversity losses, nitrate leaching, and erosion). <b>Energy</b> <b>cropping</b> and related conversion systems should be improved in terms of their efficiency and environmental impact in future. Modern agroforestry systems offer an alternative agro-ecological approach to a sustainable intensification of energy crop production. The present study was part of the joint research project “BEST – Strengthening Bioenergy Regions“ (2010 ? 2014) and analyzed the energetic potential of a young alley cropping system of grassland and fast-growing willows grown on a 3 to 6 year rotation. The study was conducted on an experimental area in Central Germany from 2011 – 2013. Two different grassland mixtures were established in a split-plot randomized block design with three replications, and intercropped with rows of willows. The woody biomass was converted to wood chips for thermal combustion. For the grassland biomass, three types of energetic conversion were evaluated: integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB), anaerobic digestion and hay combustion. Overall, the three year old agroforestry system achieved a total gross energy yield of 96 MWh ha- 1 by applying the IFBB procedure to the understory biomass. Grassland as pure stand achieved 133 MWh ha- 1 and a single willow stand achieved 51 MWh ha- 1 in 3 years after establishment.

As part of the research project “Site-adapted Cropping Systems for Energy Crops ” (EVA), the effects of factor reductions have been analysed in a crop rotation context. The trial consisted of three different crop rotations with three levels of factor reduction: 1 - no reduction, 2 - reduced nitrogen application by 30 kg/ha per crop, 3 - reduced nitrogen application and no weed management. The whole trial was replicated with one year time difference. In order to show effects of input reduction on subsequently grown cash crops, the last crop in the rotation was winter wheat for grain production in which no input reduction was performed over all plots. The field trial has been investigated regarding the effects of: Levels of fertilization and weed control, crop rotation, crop species and year of investigation on weed cover and species composition as target variables. The results suggest that the reduction of weed control efforts showed the main effect on the weed flora. Energy crops, like maize and sorghum, seemed to be highly sensitive to reduced weed control especially during early development stages; they showed the greatest differences between the factor levels. The reduction in fertilization resulted in no or only slight differences in the weed flora.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a broad overview of the potential environmental impacts of biomass <b>energy</b> from <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> [...] particularly the cellulosic <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> current under development. For this discussion, the term <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> refers to a crop grown primarily to create feedstock for either making biofuels such as ethanol or burning in a heat or electricity generation facility. Cellulosic <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> are designed to be used in cellulose-based ethanol conversion processes (as opposed to starch or sugar-based ethanol conversion processes). As more cellulose can be produced per hectare of land than can sugar or starch, the cellulose-based ethanol conversion process is a more efficient sue of land for ethanol production. Assessing the environmental impacts of biomass <b>energy</b> from <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> is complex because the environmental impact of using biomass for energy must be considered in the context of alternative energy options while the environmental impact of producing biomass from <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> must be considered in the context of alternative land-uses. Using biomass-derived energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or increase them; growing biomass <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> can enhance soil fertility or degrade it. Without knowing the context of the biomass energy, one can say little about its specific environmental impacts. The primary focus of this paper is an evaluation of the environmental impacts of growing cellulosic <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> especially at the landscape or regional scale. However, to set the stage for this discussion, the authors begin by comparing the environmental advantages and disadvantages of biomass-derived energy relative to other energy alternatives such as coal, hydropower, nuclear power, oil/gasoline, natural gas and photovoltaics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews European {{land and}} {{bioenergy}} potential studies to 1) identify shortcomings related {{to how they}} account for agricultural intensification and its associated environmental effects, and sustainability constraints, and 2) provide suggestions on how these shortcomings can be improved in future assessments. The key shortcomings are:The environmental impacts of intensification are nearly always ignored in the reviewed studies, while these impacts should be accounted for if intensification is required to make land available for <b>energy</b> <b>cropping.</b> Future productivity developments of crops and livestock, and the associated land-use and environmental effects are currently limited to conventional intensification measures whereby the proportion between inputs and outputs is fixed. Sustainable intensification measures, which increase land productivity with similar or lower inputs, are ignored in the reviewed studies. Livestock productivity developments, livestock specific intensification measures and their environmental effects are poorly {{or not at all}} covered in the reviewed studies. Most studies neglect sustainability constraints other than GHG emissions in the selection of energy crops. This includes limitations to rainfed energy crop cultivation, a minimum number of crop species, the structural diversity within cropping areas and the integration of energy crops in existing or new crop rotations, while simultaneously considering the effects on subsequent crops. These shortcomings suggest that the identification of sustainable pathways for European bioenergy production requires a more integrative approach combining land demand for food, feed and energy crop production, including different intensification pathways, and the consequent direct and indirect environmental impacts. A better inclusion of management practices into such approach will improve the assessment of intensification, its environmental consequences and the sustainable bioenergy potential from agricultural feedstocks...|$|E

Differences in geomorphology, climate, landscape structure, and biotope inventories are regarded as the main causes of this variation. We present a methodological approach for identifying regional re-sponses in land use type to large-scale changes and the implications {{for the provision of}} habitat for farmland birds. The methodological innovations of this approach are (i) the coupling of impact assessments with econom-ic models, (ii) the linking of cropping techniques at the plot scale with the regional distribution of land use, and (iii) the integration of statistical or monitoring data on recent states. This approach allows for the regional differentiation of farmers ’ responses to changing exter-nal conditions and for matching the ecological impacts of land use changes with regional environmental sensi-tivities. An exemplary scenario analysis was applied for a case study of an area in Germany, assessing the im-pacts of increased irrigation and the promotion of <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> on farmland birds, evaluated as a core indica-tor for farmland biodiversity. The potential effects on farmland birds were analyzed based on the intrinsic habitat values of the crops and cropping techniques. The results revealed that the strongest decrease in habitat availability for farmland birds occurred in regions with medium-to-low agricultural yields. As a result of the limited cropping alternatives, the increase in maize pro-duction was highest in marginal regions for both examined scenarios. Maize production replaced many crops with good-to-medium habitat suitability for birds. The declines in habitat quality were strongest in regions that are not in focus for conservation efforts for farmland birds...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels {{are thought}} {{to be one of the}} options to {{substitute}} fossil fuels and prevent global warming by the greenhouse gas (GHG) effect as they are seen as a renewable form of energy. However, biofuels are almost solely subjected to criticism from an energy and global warming point of view. Since biofuels are produced by agriculture of which environmental impacts are known, it is odd that other environmental impacts are hardly addressed. Many environmental impacts by agricultural production are related to the nitrogen cycle. Humans have already increased nitrogen fertilizer input to the nitrogen cycle to a level beyond natural flows by agriculture. Therefore, from an environmental point of view there is a need for understanding the relation between nitrogen cycle and producing biofuels on a global scale. The main goal of this research is to show the impact of <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> on the nitrogen cycle and to compare this to natural flows. The following main research question has been formulated: what will be the global nitrogen requirement for increased biofuel production? To answer this question a literature study has been performed: biofuel production systems, energy crops, nitrogen requirement of crops and energy and GHG balances of various biofuels. The values found in literature have been compared and used to calculate a global nitrogen requirement for biofuel production. Nitrogen is mostly present in the atmosphere as N 2, which is a very stable molecule. While the whole nitrogen cycle consists of many processes, for this study the most important flux is nitrogen fixation, which is the formation of reactive N out of N 2. As N 2 is very stable it is only reactive nitrogen that actually cycles until eventually N 2 is formed again. The average rate at which nitrogen is fixed has already more than doubled due to anthropogenic processes. This has resulted in an environmental burden since the presence of too much reactive N can result in a range of environmental impacts like: loss of biodiversity, eutrophication, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, air pollution and toxicity. For the feasibility of the analysis a selection was made among energy crops based on several criteria. At first, substitutes for both gasoline and diesel had to be included. Secondly, various crops were selected based on regional aspects. Thirdly, the major biofuel crops of today have proven to be successful and reliable data is available. At last also a non-food crop has been selected. These criteria have resulted in the following <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> systems: biodiesel from rapeseed, ethanol from corn, sugarcane and timber. Some cropping systems are more complex than others. For example sugarcane and timber biofuel systems have only outputs in the form of energy, ethanol and electricity. However, rapeseed and corn biofuel systems also yield material byproducts. Producing solely electricity from timber also has been included in the analysis to compare fuel and electricity production. Analysis of the production of the various crops showed that yields and nitrogen requirements are quite different. Sugarcane cropping has the highest yield, while rapeseed is produced with the lowest yield. However, rapeseed production also has the highest nitrogen requirement. Corn production also requires a high nitrogen input almost equal to that of rapeseed. Timber cropping has the lowest nitrogen requirement, but has a lower yield than sugarcane production. The energy and GHG balances for 1 kg of fuel produced by the various systems showed large differences. Ethanol from sugarcane and timber has a relatively much higher net output than fuel produced from rapeseed or corn even if energy credits for non-energy byproducts are included. The GHG balances show a similar picture. Timber shows the highest GHG reduction per kg fuel compared to conventional fuel. Sugarcane also shows a high reduction, while corn and rapeseed biofuels result in only minor GHG emission reductions compared to conventional fuels. Relating net energy output and GHG reduction to nitrogen input increases the difference between the various cropping systems even further. Low yields, high nitrogen application rates and unfavorable energy and GHG balances result in a low output and GHG reduction per kg N for rapeseed and corn derived biofuels. Sugarcane and timber show a net output and GHG reduction 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher. These numbers have been used to calculate global nitrogen requirement for the substitution of all conventional fuels or to eliminate all GHG emissions in transportation. Timber and sugarcane ethanol can replace conventional fuels and reduce GHG emissions without adding more than another quantity of nitrogen equal to the global natural fixation rate. The amount is still significant, though, 0, 3 - 0, 5 times the natural flow. Using rapeseed or corn biofuel, would have a substantial effect on the global nitrogen cycle, resulting in a requirement of nitrogen over 10 times higher than the natural input. Electricity from timber has about 2 times the net energy output and reduction per kg N than that of timber ethanol. This research has led to three main conclusions. Firstly, from a nitrogen perspective we should mainly use timber and sugarcane instead of corn and rapeseed, if one of these energy crops is going to be used on a large global scale. The second conclusion is that current <b>energy</b> <b>cropping</b> systems need significant nitrogen inputs. Biofuel production will have an impact on the nitrogen cycle in the same order of magnitude as agricultural production so far. The third conclusion is that electricity from timber is far more efficient in reducing GHG emissions. All in all, producing biofuels on a substantial scale will have a significant impact on the nitrogen cycle. ...|$|E

The former provides county-level estimates of suitable acres, yields, and farmgate prices of <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> (switchgrass, hybrid poplar, willow) for all fifty states.

For the purposes of this assessment, ORIBAS has been used to estimate farmgate and delivered switchgrass prices in 11 states (AL, FL, GA, IA, M N, MO, ND, NE, SC, SD, and TN).
