Using documentary sources and fieldwork, I show how neo-liberal initiatives have differentially reconstructed relationships between forensic scientists and the police.

Neo-liberal reform of forensic science has, however, exposed actors to new <b>risks,</b> <b>culminating</b> in the UKGovernment’s announcement to close the Forensic Science Service. Yet, rather than representing the end of ‘marketization’, debates concerning the organization of forensic science have entered a new phase.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore children’s labor as a complex {{phenomenon}} <b>encompassing</b> <b>risk</b> factors {{on one hand and}} possible positive outcomes on the other. Based on the theory of resilience and on literature review that details children’s own experiences of work, we show that children who are inserted in envi-ronments which are poor in social and physical resources may report labor as pathways to ensure their own resources to overcome adversity. Understanding children’s subjective accounts of their experience permits us to see children’s labor as a culturally-embedded construction. Though exploitation of children is not {{in the best interest of}} children, there is evidence that children use whatever opportunities are available, including labor, to search for the resources they need and negotiate for an identity as resilient. Implications for public policies and practices are discussed...|$|R

The merits of the various epidemiological study designs as tools to estimate the risk of illness from rainwater exposure are discussed. The MRA framework enables a systematic estimation of health risk as a consequence of potable tank rainwater contamination and has important implications for the setting of microbial standards for potable rainwater...|$|R

Furthermore, this impact appears to be related to the relative strictness of the regulatory regime. At the same time the model also confirms the particular importance of the expected return on bank capital and productive efficiency in explaining capital augmentation. ...|$|R

It {{can be an}} isolated lesion, for which the term extramedullary plasmacytoma is used, or a representation of multiple myeloma. The upper respiratory tract {{is the most common}} site for an extramedullary plasmacytoma. Sinonasal plasmacytomas cause different symptoms depending on the sites of origins and the areas of involvement. The treatment of choice for extramedullary plasmacytoma is local radiotherapy. Although it is generally accepted that plasmacytomas are radiosensitive, there are reports of cases that do not respond to radiotherapy.   Case Report: A case of a 24 -year-old male diagnosed with radioresistant extramedullary plasmacytoma of the maxillary sinus, who responded to surgical treatment, is reported.   Conclusion:  It is reasonable to consider an interdisciplinary approach in the management of extramedullary plasmacytoma.

To {{be able to}} assess a possible health risk, noroviruses should be quantified and fluctuations identified. In 2001, norovirus concentrations in the river Meuse displayed a seasonal distribution with high peaks during wintertime as determined by RT-PCR on serially diluted RNA. An intensified day-by-day sampling scheme {{in the winter of}} 2002 / 2003 revealed that the winter peak consisted of several peaks of varying duration and magnitude, possibly due to contamination events in the catchment. The highest estimated concentration was 1700 PCR-detectable units per litre (95 % CI 250 - 8000), which if coinciding with failing treatment could lead to significant numbers in drinking water. Adaptive dynamic filtering was shown to adequately predict subsequent sample concentrations.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of {{a number of}} vascular morbidities. Furthermore, serum levels decrease following GH replacement in GHD adults, though it remains unclear if levels are significantly elevated in untreated individuals. Design: A cross-sectional case-control study. Methods: We measured fasting serum VEGF. MMP 2, and MMP 9 in 27 patients with GHD, 24 with partial GHD (CHI), and 25 sex- and age-matched controls. Results: GHD (483 +/- 334 vs 326 +/- 180 ng/l, P = 0. 04), but not all (354 +/- 192 vs 326 +/- 180 ng/l, P = n/s) adults had significantly elevated VEGF levels compared with controls. Neither MMP 2, nor MMP 9 levels were elevated in the patient groups. Serum VEGF levels correlated positively with LDL-cholesterol (R = 0. 34, P = 0. 004) and serum MMP 9 values (R = 0. 36, P = 0. 002), and negatively with IGF-I values, however, no correlation was observed with MMP 2.

40|$|Faced with {{incomplete}} and often contradictory information, people perceive {{the world through}} fundamentally different ‘risk filters’, which influences the way issues are defined and preferences {{as to how they}} should be handled. Therefore, scientific or objective arguments alone cannot settle disputes about the acceptability of the risks we impose on our fellow human beings. This relativistic view on acceptable risk to others is often also extended to <b>encompass</b> <b>risk</b> to future generations, with widely diverging views on such risks deemed equally valid. In this article, however, it is argued that acceptable risk to future generations cannot be interpreted as widely as acceptable risk to our contemporaries. Although people may differ widely in their attitudes towards risk, society has already institutionalized a certain general standard of conduct as being acceptable for handling risks to others, for example in tort law. Although this general standard of conduct may differ from society to society and from time to time, intergenerational justice requires future generations to be treated according to these same standards...|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{continue}} {{to be interested in}} opportunities for value added production through further processing. New Generation Cooperatives (NGCs) offer member commitment through up-front capital contributions on the part of members. For a potential start-up NGC, one of new and novel issues that face the management of an NGC is making project commitments against the total capital available, both equity and debt capital. Because of the up-front capital commitment by members, NGCs invite managers to make commitments in phases, rather than one initial go or no-go decision. Thus, the capital decision is complex and requires managerial vision in terms of an uncertain world beset by constant shifts in prices, interest rates, consumer tastes, and technology. This paper considers a novel means of evaluating this investment decision, one that <b>encompasses</b> <b>risk</b> components mentioned above. When the outcome of an investment is least certain, real options analysis has the greatest potential analytic value. As time goes by and prospects for an underlying investment become clearer, the value of an option diminishes.

40|$|Caves are not colonised by all taxa {{present in}} the surface species pool, due to absence of light and the {{tendency}} to food limitation when compared to surface communities. Under strong species sorting during colonisation and later by the restrictive environmental filter, traits that are not adaptive in subterranean habitats may be filtered out. We tested whether cave communities were assembled by the restrictive regime propitiated by permanent darkness or by competitive exclusion due to resource scarcity. When compared to surface communities, the restrictive subterranean regime would lead to lower functional diversity and phenotypic clustering inside the caves, and the opposite should be expected {{in the case of}} competitive exclusion. Using isopods (Oniscidea) as model taxa, we measured several niche descriptors of taxa from surface and cave habitats, used a multivariate measure of functional diversity, and compared their widths. We found phenotypic overdispersion and higher functional diversity in cave taxa when compared to surface taxa. On the one hand, the dry climate outside of caves hampered the survival of several taxa and their ecological strategies, not viable under severe desiccation <b>risk,</b> <b>culminating</b> in the clustering of functional traits. In contrast, this restriction does not occur inside of caves, where isopods find favourable conditions under lower predation pressures and more amenable environmental parameters that allow occupation and subsequent diversification. Our results showed that, at least for some taxa, caves may not be such a harsh environment as previously thought. The high functional diversity we found inside caves adds an additional reason for the conservation of these sensitive environments...|$|R

The Report starts with an introduction on the nature and structure of poverty. This opening chapter focuses on the multidimensional character of poverty which, in addition to income and consumption, also <b>encompasses</b> <b>risk,</b> vulnerability and powerlessness, as the poor themselves strongly assert whenever they {{have a voice in}} the matter. This is why the Report attaches great importance to the perceptions and experiences of the poor. The multidimensional character of poverty includes norms and values, the referents of which vary according to the societies. Furthermore, it is necessary to base these policies on the communities themselves and to take ethical and faith values into account. Despite variations according to the societies in question, the poor themselves express series of commonalities, as in the declarations of the international community, both in terms of reflection on values as well as strategies for empowerment, security and opportunity. These different dimensions are not easy to translate into indicators. Some of them emerge as lead indicators, such as health, education, decision-making, consumption and income, risk and vulnerability. In the first part, mention is made of the concepts and definitions of poverty as analyzed by the social sciences and the poor themselves.

Melanoma is a serious illness with potential intensive influence on the patient’s {{quality of life and}} psychological state. In total, 240 participants were included in this study: 120 patients suffering from melanoma and 120 participants in the control group. Melanoma patients were divided into two groups: patients with melanoma thinner than, and thicker than 1 mm Breslow thickness. Following questionnaires were used in this study: General data questionnaire, Sun behaviours questionnaire and Brief Illness perceptions questionnaire for all participants, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, Subjective quality of life, Becks Depression Index, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Negative life events scale, Coping with stress questionnaire and Eysencks personality questionnaire for melanoma patients only. The aims of this study <b>encompassed</b> <b>risk</b> factors for melanoma, sun behaviour patterns and perception of melanoma among all participants and comparison of their results. Quality of life and psychological characteristics of melanoma patients were also investigated, and results of patients with melanoma less and over 1 mm Breslow thickness were compared. Finally, the aim was to investigate significant predictors of quality of life. Patients in this group showed responsible sun behaviour patterns, but with significant differences between melanoma and control group. Patients suffering from melanoma spend less time in the sun, are more careful about using sun protection and have a milder perception of melanoma than the control group. In the melanoma group there are more fair tanned people, more people with more than 50 moles and with more sunburn during childhood. Patients suffering from melanoma have high quality of life and melanoma has a mild influence on their quality of life.

40|$|This {{experimental}} economics study through brain imaging {{investigates the}} risk-ambiguity distinction {{in relation to}} source preference (Fox and Tversky, 1995) in which identically distributed risks arising from different sources of uncertainty often engender distinct preferences among decision makers, contrary to classical economic thinking. This enabled sharper tests {{of the implications of}} Chew and Sagi's (2008) axiomatization of source preference of a decision maker having distinct attitudes towards risks from different sources. Using fMRI, brain activation were observed when subjects make 48 sequential binary choices between lotteries based on whether the trailing digits of closing stock prices are odd or even. Subsequently, subjects rate familiarity of the stock symbols. When contrasting brain activation from more familiar sources with those from less familiar ones, regions appearing to be more active include the putamen, the medial frontal gyrus, and the superior temporal gyrus. ROI analysis showed that the activation patterns in the familiar-unfamiliar and unfamiliar –familiar conditions were similar to those in the risk-ambiguity and ambiguity-risk conditions reported by Hsu et al. (2005). This supports the conjecture that the risk-ambiguity distinction can be subsumed by the source preference hypothesis. Our odd-even design has the advantage of inducing the same "unambiguous " probability of for each subject in each binary comparison. Our finding supports the implications of the Chew-Sagi model and rejects models based on global probabilistic sophistication, including rank-dependent models derived from non-additive probabilities, e. g., Choquet expected utility and cumulative prospect theory, as well as those based on multiple priors, e. g., α-maxmin. The finding in Hsu et al (2005) that orbitofrontal cortex lesion patients display neither ambiguity aversion nor risk aversion offers further support to the Chew-Sagi model.

Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country <b>risk</b> <b>encompasses</b> both political <b>risk</b> and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|R
