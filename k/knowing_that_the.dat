5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared a stand of 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. Passed over for the vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence of <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E
5|$|However, after Detroit's {{first round}} {{loss to the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the {{following}} season, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rival Colorado Avalanche would {{be looking for a}} goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.|$|E
5|$|Petrović {{worked for}} a number of landlords {{throughout}} Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman janissaries. It is said that as they were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović's father began to have second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire family would be put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E

Furthermore, Parthiepan claimed to have been signed for forty days, whilst his segment lasted up to 140 days.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. They took the portcullis down, but could not find boats to cross the Doubs, so some soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the {{two sides}} had called a truce. Despite the truce, both sides planned for war. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany {{priority}} over Italy as a theater of war. The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies would be expected to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E
5|$|Further tragedy soon {{followed}} when Victoria's son, George, died of bone cancer the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother's tears. In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and {{spent some time}} at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces. She {{spent most of her}} time reading and worrying about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years {{at the height of the}} war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> position would be dangerous and difficult. He accepted anyway.|$|E

5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|Lusa is a pampered {{black bear}} {{living in the}} Bear Bowl, a zoo in Canada. Despite <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{wilderness}} is harsh, Lusa has dreams about one day escaping and living outside. Her father, King, once lived in the wild and is strongly against Lusa's idea. One day, Toklo's mom is brought into the Bear Bowl. She talks with Lusa about how much she regretted abandoning her cubs, {{but that it was}} too late and that she couldn't find them. Hearing this, Lusa decides to bring a message to Toklo about how sorry his mother is. Although Lusa succeeds in escaping, she realizes the dangers of the wild. At the end of the story, Ujurak and Toklo meet up with Lusa.|$|E

The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups.

The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} parthenogenesis occurring, which would have killed those who had taken the pill, and {{the remainder of the}} young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young Adipose because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion Martha Jones made him more human.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera's son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By {{this time}} the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, continuing his support towards a military operation.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front led by General Chernyakhovsky, {{surrounded}} {{the capital city}} of East Prussia, Königsberg. The 3rd Panzer Army and around 200,000 civilians were trapped inside the city. In response to this, General Georg-Hans Reinhardt, commander of the Army Group Center, warned Hitler of the imminent Soviet threat, but the Führer refused to act. Due to the rapid approach of the 2nd Belorussian Front led by General Rokossovsky, Nazi authorities in Königsberg decided to send trains full of refugees to Allenstein, without <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> town had already been captured by the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps.|$|E

5|$|Phase 2: <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine {{army was}} {{focusing}} on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left center, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center struck at the Byzantines left center at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had {{at the start of}} the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologists {{identifying}} Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius {{who report}} that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his Aegyptiaca. Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates {{the duration of}} Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Up till now, the Muslim {{army had}} adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy, but <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now {{decided to take}} the offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All the cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of this cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi-ur-Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry.|$|E
