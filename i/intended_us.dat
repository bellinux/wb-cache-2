25|$|TVNZ OnDemand is Television New Zealand's on-demand {{streaming}} platform, TVNZ OnDemand {{was launched}} March 20, 2007, {{and is available}} on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 via the TVNZ app on PlayStation Network for New Zealanders. It is also available on FreeviewPlus, iOS, Android, Xbox One and Windows 10. The content uses geotargeting for New Zealand only connections via a US-based Brightcove media company using the Akamai RTMP network, with some local content being made available to an international audience via their YouTube channel. At the end of 2012, the contract with Brightcove was expanded to include streaming to iOS devices via the Akamai HLS network. From 2012, TVNZ OnDemand began uploading episodes of select shows prior to their airing on TVNZ channels and usually within a day of their original overseas airings (although sometimes this was weeks or months after their international airing). In September 2014, {{it was announced that}} episodes of seventeen shows would be uploaded within a day of their airings in the US, coinciding with the 2014-2015 season. One of the shows, Manhattan Love Story was cancelled by the US network ABC, but episodes continued to be uploaded to TVNZ OnDemand in line with their <b>intended</b> <b>US</b> airings, making TVNZ the de facto original broadcaster of the series. On May 1, 2016 (01.06 am), when TVNZ Kidzone (channel version) closed it is now on TVNZ OnDemand with lot of the shows to watch (it is still use the former channel programs).|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} reasons for these inaccuracies. Some {{are due to}} errors in the copying of manuscripts (before the age of printing) or {{mistakes}} by typesetters of later editions. Others are due to conscious attempts to [...] "correct" [...] the text, and yet others to Christian censorship (in countries under its control). In addition, Maimonides himself frequently edited the text of his own autograph copy, such that manuscripts copied from his own book did not preserve his later corrections.

If omniscient and omnipotent, God must be held to have intended whatever occurs, but no such God is assumed in M.

60|$|I {{know not}} whether the {{following}} {{version of her}} story will retain any portion of its pristine character; but, as Zenobia told it wildly and rapidly, hesitating at no extravagance, and dashing at absurdities which I am too timorous to repeat,--giving it the varied emphasis of her inimitable voice, and the pictorial illustration of her mobile face, while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the thoughts, as they came bubbling out of her mind,--thus narrated, and thus heard, the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair.

If we knew that every colored stone we saw was natural, certain questions, conclusions, interests, would force themselves upon us without any effort of our own; but we have none of us time to stop in the midst of our daily business, to touch and pore over, and decide with painful minuteness of investigation, whether such and such a pillar be stucco or stone. And the whole field of this knowledge, which Nature <b>intended</b> <b>us</b> to possess when we were children, is hopelessly shut out from us. Worse than shut out, for the mass of coarse imitations confuses our knowledge acquired from other sources; and our memory of the marbles we have perhaps once or twice carefully examined, is disturbed and distorted by the inaccuracy of the imitations which are brought before us continually.|$|E

60|$|From {{this point}} onward Mortimer Sturgis proved {{the truth of}} what I said to you about the perils of taking up golf at an {{advanced}} age. A lifetime of observing my fellow-creatures has convinced me that Nature <b>intended</b> <b>us</b> all to be golfers. In every human being the germ of golf is implanted at birth, and suppression causes it to grow and grow till--it may be at forty, fifty, sixty--it suddenly bursts its bonds and sweeps over the victim like a tidal wave. The wise man, who begins to play in childhood, is enabled to let the poison exude gradually from his system, with no harmful results. But a man like Mortimer Sturgis, with thirty-eight golfless years behind him, is swept off his feet. He is carried away. He loses all sense of proportion. He is like the fly that happens to be sitting {{on the wall of the}} dam just when the crack comes.|$|E
6000|$|Critics cannot {{in general}} be too punctilious in their respect for an incognito. If an author <b>intended</b> <b>us</b> {{to know his}} name, he would put it on his title-page. If he does not choose to do that, we have no more right to pry into his secret than we have to discuss his family affairs or open his letters. But every rule has its {{exceptional}} cases; and the book which stands first upon our list is surely such. All the world, somehow or other, knows the author. His name has been mentioned unhesitatingly by several reviews already, whether from private information, or from the certainty which every well-read person must {{feel that there is}} but one man in England possessed at once of poetic talent and artistic experience sufficient for so noble a creation.

Has He not meant us to use them? He has given us wife and child. Did He mean us not to love them, after He has made us love them, we know not how or why? You say that God is a jealous God. Yes, jealous He may be of our worshipping false gods, and idols, saints, or anything or person save Himself,-- jealous of our doing wrong, and ruining ourselves, and wandering {{out of the path}} of His commandments, in which alone is life; but jealous of our loving our fellow creature as well as Himself, never. That sort of jealousy is a base and wicked passion in man, and dare we attribute it to God?
