40|$|Abstract- Bridge Weigh-in-Motion {{systems can}} be used to {{estimate}} vehicle parameters such as velocity, axle loads, or the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>axles</b> without affecting the traffic. These parameters and the classification of vehicles are necessary to determine vehicle overload and hence may help to reduce risks for road users and road infrastructure and allow optimized planning of maintenance work. The Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system developed is based on a crack displacement sensor with intelligent data processing algorithms: In a first step, the number of axles, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>axles,</b> and the velocity of the vehicle is obtained from the crack displacement signal by means of wavelet decomposition. In a subsequent step, the axle loads are found by means of optimizing the weights for axle loads that the measured crack displacement signal can be approximated by a superposition of (shifted and extended/compressed) ‘Lines of Influence’. Intensive test runs have been performed to verify results of the Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system...|$|E

Especially when the load is dynamic, the response can be amplified with respect to static loads. Three different truck loads were employed to examine this parameter; partially (83 %) loaded HS 15 - 44 truck (SP- 17), fully loaded H 15 - 44 truck (SP- 0), and fully loaded HS 20 - 44 truck (SP- 14).

The bulk density also increased with number of tractor passes, but with less percentage increasing.

40|$|This thesis treats {{traffic load}} effects in road bridges and in {{particular}} bending moment and shear force in different types of bridges. All traffic load effects are {{described in terms of}} statistical distribution functions for annual extreme values. The statistical distributions are based on measurements of real traffic, made in Sweden during 2002 - 2003. The measurements are managed by the Swedish Road Administration and accounted for in Vägverket (2004 b). The data base contains information about 280000 vehicles out of which approximately 31000 are classified as heavy vehicles. Only vehicles that are defined as heavy are decisive for the design of bridges. The data base contains information about the time when the vehicles passed the measuring station, the number of axles on the vehicle, the mutual <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>axles</b> and weight of every single axle. With such information it is possible to determine section forces in different types of bridges very accurately. Information about when vehicles pass the measuring station is used to verify assumptions regarding for example the mutual distance between two consecutive heavy vehicles. This is of interest when section forces in longer bridges are studied. For variable loads the characteristic value is used to define the load. Codes used to design bridges, usually define the characteristic value as the 98 th percentile of the annual maximum distribution, i. e. a 50 year return period. The data material used here is collected during 51 days at 8 different locations in Sweden. Using the measured vehicles as input the statistical distribution functions for traffic load effects in different types of bridges are determined. The information of interest here is to describe the maximum load effects during the reference period, so called extreme value distributions. Collecting the necessary amount of data to determine extreme value distributions directly would be too costly and time consuming. Instead some kind of extrapolation method must be applied. In this thesis the POT-method, (Peaks Over Thresholds) and simulations are used to determine the extreme value distributions for traffic load effects. The POT-method implies that only the section forces which exceed a certain level (threshold), are fitted to a standard distribution. From that distribution the extreme value distributions for the section forces are determined. The advantage of using this method is {{that it is possible to}} determine the extreme value distributions and the characteristic values at different traffic intensities in an easy way. This report contains tools to determine the extreme value distributions for section forces in bridges with different traffic intensity. In probability based analysis of structures statistical information about all the basic variables in the limit state function must be available, i. e. the statistical distribution functions must be known. The most dominating variable load on bridges is the load generated by traffic; see e. g. Das (1997) and Bailey (1996). These loads affect the result of the bridge analysis to a great extent and accurate information about these loads is therefore very important. When a new bridge is designed the consequence of using too high loads is in most cases negligible, i. e. the extra cost for a larger cross section is manageable. In contrast, if the safety level in an existing bridge is considered too low, the load level is of major importance. Strengthening or in the worst case replacement of the bridge is very expensive. Evaluation of existing bridges are often based on a deterministic analysis where the loads are taken from some bridge code, e. g. Vägverket (2004 a), i. e. the actual traffic load for the specific bridge is not taken into account. The traffic loads in deterministic codes are generally very conservative because they are intended to cover all types of bridges. Instead of using deterministic methods to determine the safety level of an existing bridge, more sophisticated methods that can account for specific information about a bridge should be applied. Probability based methods are very applicable in these cases. An advantage with probability based methods is that specific information about the bridge can be included in the analysis. An example of such information is measurements of the material properties in the bridge. Another possibility more seldom used is to determine the traffic load effects based on the traffic intensity at the actual bridge site. The traffic intensity is measured by the Swedish road administration on many locations on the Swedish road net. With the methods described in this report it is possible to determine the extreme value distributions for the section forces with the traffic intensity as input. Two case studies are used to illustrate the method. Of course, a probability based method is not the whole solutions to bridges with insufficient safety. The method shall be seen as one out of several possible ways to evaluate the condition of a bridge. Every bridge that can be saved for a new period of time by use of more sophisticated methods implies substantial saving of money...|$|E

50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire contact patches to the ground.

The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor shaft-mounted pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>axles</b> and the chassis.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new level I damage {{identification}} method for short span statically indeterminate bridges using the information provided by a Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system. Bridge Weigh-In-Motion systems measure the bridge deformation due to the crossing of traffic to estimate traffic attributes, namely <b>axle</b> weights and <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>axles</b> for each vehicle.

50|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of casters is flutter. A common example of caster flutter is on a supermarket shopping cart, when one caster rapidly swings side-to-side. This oscillation, {{which is also}} known as shimmy, occurs naturally at certain speeds, and is similar to speed wobble that occurs in other wheeled vehicles. The speed at which caster flutter occurs is based on the weight borne by the caster and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the wheel <b>axle</b> and steering axis. This distance is known as trailing distance, and increasing this distance can eliminate flutter at moderate speeds. Generally, flutter occurs at high speeds.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of vehicle dynamics, {{commercial}} software can aid the designer during the conceptual and detailed design phases.

This scenario {{is the case with}} tire wear, which depends on the frictional work developed by the tire-road contact. In this study, an approach is proposed to estimate the tire-road friction during steady-state longitudinal and cornering maneuvers. Using this approach, a qualitative formula for tire wear evaluation is developed, and conceptual design analyses of cornering maneuvers are performed using simplified vehicle models.

30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, braking on outside wheels on axles {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than on rear axles. (2) To prevent understeering, braking on the inside wheels on axles after the CG point can generate better effects than braking on the front axles. (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by braking on each wheel are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the <b>axles</b> and CG position. (4) In terms of braking wheel, when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kamm’s Circle, braking wheels on the rear axle need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, braking on front axles is a better choice.|$|R
30|$|Mining {{vehicles}} {{are an important}} underground device for the transportation of minerals and staff. Recently, higher requirements on their isolation vibration performance have been demanded. However, the vehicle body often experiences continuous and excessive vibrations owing to harsh working conditions. This can lead to discomfort and seriously affect the {{physical and mental health}} of staff [1]. Moreover, the long longitudinal <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>axles</b> and large load change in mining vehicles can aggravate the vehicle body pitch motion under continuous upslope and downslope roads in the mines. The severe pitch motion is the primary source of the longitudinal vibration to be experienced at points above the center of gravity (CG) of the vehicle body. Simultaneously, it intensifies the load transfer between the front and rear wheels, resulting in a safety accident. To improve the carrying capacity and reduce the maintenance cost, leaf spring suspension has been used as the typical suspension system for mining vehicles, but it cannot effectively suppress the vehicle body vibration.|$|R

Single vehicle and multiple vehicles on reinforced concrete T beam bridge were studied with variable surface roughness profiles. The effects of six different surface roughness profiles (very good, good, measured, average, poor, and very poor) were investigated for vehicle-bridge interaction. The values of the Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) were obtained for single and multiple vehicles on T Beam Bridge for different surface roughness profiles, along with the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the <b>axles</b> of heavy vehicle. It was observed that when the bridge has very good, good, measured, and average surface roughness, the DAF values for the single vehicle over the bridge were observed to be within acceptable limits specified by AASHTO.
