25|$|There, {{he thought}} about the case of a uniformly {{accelerated}} box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks {{at the top of a}} box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.|$|E

These eventually produced a system with 100kW of laser energy <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> about [...] long, known as a diode array. In a LIFE design, these arrays would replace the less dense diode packaging of the Mercury design.|$|E

500|$|On August 5, 1921, Forbes Field was {{the site}} of the first live radio {{broadcast}} of a Major League Baseball game in the United States. Harold W. Arlin announced the play-by-play action between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies over KDKA <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> seat next to the first-base dugout. [...] Regular broadcasts began in 1936 by A. K. ′′Rosey′′ Rowswell, a local humorist and friend of owner Bill Benswanger. [...] Rowswell is quoted as describing his broadcasting with, [...] "It's not just play-by-play that matters. [...] It's what you say in between the pitches that counts." [...] His style influenced junior partner Bob Prince, who began broadcasting in 1948. Rowswell broadcast games at Forbes Field until his death in 1955.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} a live-action segment featuring characters {{from the show}} as puppets and a guest appearance from singer Katy Perry as herself.

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Clapton's {{chocolate}} addiction. He derived the title and much of the lyrics <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home. Many of the confectionery names used in the song are authentic; others, such as cherry cream, coconut fudge and pineapple heart, were Harrison's invention, based on the flavours listed inside the lid of the box. For the lyrics to the second of the song's middle eight sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records. In keeping with the theme of Harrison's composition, Taylor drew inspiration from the title of the American counterculture film You Are What You Eat, which was itself titled after a fashionable macrobiotic slogan.|$|E

The name was favoured for its political (Red) connotations – Toulson-Clarke describes the band members as 'Student Activists'. He was also attracted to the notion of square (Box) being an old North American Indian term for 'white man' (circle being the term for 'man' before Europeans were encountered), a concept which would be explored further on the debut The Circle & the Square album in the song [...] "Heart of the Sun", a line from which gave the album its title.|$|E

2500|$|The [...]22-250 {{is similar}} to, but was {{outperformed}} {{by the larger}} [...]220 Swift cartridge. However, it is in much wider use and has a larger variety of commercially available factory ammunition than the Swift. This makes it generally cheaper to shoot. The smaller powder load also contributes to more economical shooting for users who load their own ammunition. Despite common myths regarding longer barrel life on a 22-250 vs the Swift or other calibers, that {{is directly related to}} shooter habits, allowing the barrel to cool between volleys and the speed of the bullet, an important factor for high-volume shooters. Both the Swift and the 22-250 shoot at very similar velocities and bullet weights so barrel wear when used and cooled equally is identical between the two calibers. Due to its rimless case the 22-250 also feeds <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> magazine with ease.|$|E
