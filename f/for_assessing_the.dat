5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure <b>for</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning categorical ratings {{to a number}} of items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible <b>for</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> conservation status of species.

None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E

25|$|The EPA has {{established}} guidance <b>for</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> cumulative risk for multiroute exposures to pesticide groups {{determined to have}} a common mechanism of toxicity. The Agency has also published guidance on determining whether chemicals share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e., whether they can be assessed as a common mechanism group. The risk calculation is based on dose addition, where individual pesticide exposure levels are scaled by their relative potency and then summed. Some key uncertainties in this approach include the possibility that relative potency changes with dose, {{and the potential for}} toxicological interactions (dose addition assumes no toxicological interactions). Another caution is that the resulting risk assessments are not complete environmental health evaluations of all chemical exposures, but only represent risks from those common mechanism pesticides.|$|E
