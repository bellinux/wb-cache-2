In France, Philippe le Bon {{patented}} a <b>gas</b> <b>fire</b> in 1799 and demonstrated street lighting in 1801. Other demonstrations followed in France and in the United States, but, it is generally recognized that the first commercial gas works was built by the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company in Great Peter Street in 1812 laying wooden pipes to illuminate Westminster Bridge with gas lights on New Year's Eve in 1813. In 1816, Rembrandt Peale and four others established the Gas Light Company of Baltimore, the first manufactured gas company in America. In 1821, natural gas was being used commercially in Fredonia, New York. The first German gas works was built in Hannover in 1825 and by 1870 there were 340 gas works in Germany making town gas from coal, wood, peat and other materials.|$|E

The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: [...] "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [...] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the aspirator... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillow—black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down... We felt his pulse... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbsorption cooling {{technologies}} have been researched for many years. The <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption chiller is stable and high-efficient but has high gas consumption. The solar hot water driven absorption chiller {{is clean and}} energy saving but hard to work steady and continuously. In this paper, a system for cooling and heating based on an absorption chiller that can be driven by both <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> and solar hot water was proposed and built. The system is a hybrid capable of solar cooling in single effect and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> cooling in double effect and also thus a combination. It has the advantages of both solar driven and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption systems. This system works in solar driven mode (single effect) when the solar energy is enough. It works in <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> mode (double effect) when solar energy is not enough or solar hot water temperature is low. The design and operation strategy is to use solar at first and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> as a backup, thus fossil energy saving is obvious. Year round operation of the system was recorded and analyzed in a commercial 5 star hotel. Compared with the <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption system, the gas/solar driven absorption system can save 49. 7 % of the gas consumption...|$|R

It appeared to him indisputable that Mr. Bessel {{must have gone}} violently mad {{in the midst of}} his experiment in thought transference, but why that should make him appear with a sad white face in Mr. Vincey's dreams seemed a problem beyond solution. He racked his brains in vain to explain this. It seemed to him at last that not simply Mr. Bessel, but the order of things must be insane. But he could think of nothing to do. He shut himself carefully into his room, lit his fire--it was a <b>gas</b> <b>fire</b> with asbestos bricks--and, fearing fresh dreams if he went to bed, remained bathing his injured face, or holding up books in a vain attempt to read, until dawn. Throughout that vigil he had a curious persuasion that Mr. Bessel was endeavouring to speak to him, but he would not let himself attend to any such belief.|$|E

In the last twelve hours, since he had gone out across the park to his momentous talk with Lady Sunderbund, it seemed to him that his life had passed through its {{cardinal}} crisis and come to its crown and decision. The spiritual voyage that had begun five years ago amidst a stormy succession of theological nightmares had reached harbour at last. He was established now in the sure conviction of God's reality, and of his advent to unify the lives of men and to save mankind. Some unobserved process in his mind had perfected that conviction, behind the cloudy veil of his vacillations and moods. Surely that work was finished now, and the day's experience had drawn the veil and discovered God established for ever.|$|E
