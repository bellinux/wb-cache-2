50|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>laminate</b> construction, simple FRP {{with glass}} mats, or a {{combination}} of unidirectional filament winding are common.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>dual</b> <b>laminate,</b> ETFE can be bonded with FRP as a {{thermoplastic}} liner {{and used}} in pipes, tanks, and vessels for additional corrosion protection.|$|E
50|$|<b>DUAL</b> <b>LAMINATE</b> : A {{thermoplastic}} lining material, preferably 3mm to 5mm {{thick sheet}} {{functions as a}} corrosion barrier. This thermoplastic liner is not considered to contribute mechanical strength. FRP which is constructed over this lining provides the strength requirements for materials to withstand design conditions like pressure, vacuum, hydrostatic load, etc. The choice of thermoplastic {{is based on the}} chemical corrosion requirement of the equipment. PP, PVC, PTFE, ECTFE, CPVC, PVDF are used as common thermoplastic liners.|$|E
40|$|Strains in a <b>dual</b> <b>laminate</b> fiber {{reinforced}} plastic cylindrical vessel are measured when the internal pressure increases up to 0. 96 MPa (140 psig). Laminate theory was used successfully in calculating the strains. Reason-able agreement was obtained between experimental and theoretical results. A new formulation is developed to calculate optimal winding angles such that the ratio of strains along different directions is minimum. This would provide efficient strain limited designs...|$|E
30|$|Plasma {{enhanced}} fluorocarbon treated single, dual and tri-laminate surgical gowns {{have been}} used to study their suitability for antiviral surgical gowns. Pore size of plasma treated polypropylene nonwoven is smaller than untreated polypropylene, thereby influencing antibacterial resistance. Both the tri-laminate and dual layer plasma treated PTFE gowns passed in viral penetration analysis whereas plasma treated single layer surgical gown and dual laminated plasma polypropylene with polyester failed in viral penetration analysis due to absence of PTFE film. Impact penetration of Plasma treated single and dual layer gown offers level 1 protection and plasma tri-laminate gown has level 2 protection. Hydrostatic resistance of plasma treated tri-laminate gown offers level 2 protection. Tri-laminate plasma gown has better impact and hydrostatic resistance as compared single and <b>dual</b> <b>laminate</b> gowns. MVTR of plasma treated tri-laminate gown decreased by 21 % in comparison with untreated nonwoven gown. The developed plasma enhanced fluorocarbon treated surgical confirms level 4 protection according to AAMI barrier classifications.|$|E
40|$|Equipment and {{components}} {{made of plastics}} and composites are widely used in highly corrosive environments in the processing industry. Examples are the storage tanks, pumps and pipes for chemical transport and stacks in combustion plants. The demand for reliable nondestructive testing of plastic process equipment has increased significantly in recent years. Glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP) is a common construction material for process equipment in the chemical industry. It can be used both as structural bearing in a <b>dual</b> <b>laminate</b> with a thermoplastic material as a corrosion barrier or as a solid GRP. In the latter case, the laminate is generally built up with a resin rich corrosion barrier (about 2. 5 to 5 mm thick) with a low content of glass closest to the chemical. The glass fiber in this layer is usually a surface veil and chopped strand mats (CSM), i. e. it has no general fiber orientation. Outside this is the structural bearing layer with much higher glass content, usually wound fiber and / or woven fiber mats with a preferential fiber direction. The corrosion barrier is not load bearing and corrosion of this layer can be allowed. However, no corrosion can be permitted in the structural support layer. Because of this {{it is important to}} measure the thickness of the corrosion barrier for quality control but also to determine how far an attack has reached in the corrosion barrier. Today there is no non-destructive testing method that can answer this. Instead destructive sampling (often a drill core) must be made. This is difficult, expensive and sometimes impossible. There is thus a great interest in a method that, preferably at any time during operation, can provide answers to these questions. Due to the heterogeneity of the GRP material in terms of amount, type and direction of the fibers, conventional algorithm for ultrasound imaging will not work. One aim of our work is thus to develop new signal processing methods to handle this heterogeneity. In addition we are also looking at the possibility to use optical fibers and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for corrosion monitoring of GRP structure...|$|E
