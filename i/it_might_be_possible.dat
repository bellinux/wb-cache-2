5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium. His calculations suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Therefore, whereas <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 c lies at {{the inner}} edge of the system's {{habitable}} zone. While the prospects for life on gas giants are unknown, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> for a large moon of the planet to provide a habitable environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system. In addition {{it is unclear whether}} such moons could form in the first place.|$|E

5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society {{in the town of}} Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1961, {{conferences}} {{were held}} at Coquilhatville (modern-day Mbandaka) and later in Antananarivo, Madagascar to attempt to broker a peaceful reconciliation between the secessionist factions and the central government {{in the face of}} a rebel government in the Eastern Congo led by Antoine Gizenga. It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to create a federal constitution that could reconcile the three parties. The agreements instead led to more uncertainty. The ousting of Ngalula, the chief organiser of the South Kasai state, in July hastened internal collapse.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The {{hope was that}} such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that {{the laws of physics}} appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} to lobby for and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to start construction in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated {{that the government would}} support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane solution would be chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E
