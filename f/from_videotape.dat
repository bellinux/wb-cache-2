40|$|In many Chinese cities, pedestrian's road {{crossing}} behavior {{is different from}} that of pedestrians in developed countries. This paper presents a pedestrian model for traffic system micro-simulation in China. Considering the high rate of signal non-compliance, we classify pedestrians into two types: law-obeying ones and opportunistic ones. Opportunistic ones decide whether to violate traffic signal during red man, depending on the states of some external factors (like policeman, vehicle flow and other pedestrians' behaviors). Questionnaires were used to determine the proportions of these two types of pedestrians under different circumstances. In addition, a time gap distribution extracted <b>from</b> <b>videotape</b> were used to determine the criterion for pedestrians to decide whether to walk or wait when they conflict with vehicle flows. However, simulation results deviate from the data extracted <b>from</b> <b>videotape</b> in some degree. By adjusting the parameters on the basis of analyzing the occurrence of the deviations, the simulation results agree with the field results better. This model has represented the high rate of pedestrians' red light running and the mixed characteristics of traffic flows in Chinese cities, and it may be applicable in the micro-simulation of traffic system in other developing cities. ...|$|E

Visually impaired infants demonstrated fewer periods of positive vocalization and positive responses to the mother, fewer social initiations to the mother, more negative vocalizations, more periods of negative affect, and more ignoring of the mother than did the controls. Mothers of visually impaired infants demonstrated less en-facing positioning, fewer positive vocalizations, and more periods of neutral vocalizations than did the mothers of nonhandicapped children...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} ability to predict dynamic foot posture from static measurements. Methods: Arch height and arch height ratio measurements were obtained <b>from</b> <b>videotape</b> images of the medial aspect of the foot during standing, walking, and jogging in 5 male and 13 female asymptomatic subjects. Results: Arch height and arch height ratio measurements taken in standing explained 66 % to 83 % of the variance associated with these measurements at midstance during walking and running. Arch height and arch height ratio demonstrated high reliability as static and dynamic measures. Conclusions: The {{results of this study}} support the use of arch height and arch height ratio measurements taken statically in the clinical assessment of the foot and may assist the clinician in estimating foot posture during dynamic activity in patients with lower-limb injuries...|$|E

Furthermore, children tended to mirror each others' emotional displays at the end but not the beginning of the preschool year. In addition, gleeful taunting, a form of emotional aggression, more strongly predicted negative peer nominations and teacher ratings than anger, suggesting that anger may be a more socially accepted form of emotional expression during conflicts among preschool-age children.
