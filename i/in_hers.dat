5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both Matthews and Cuthbert {{won their}} heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5seconds <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b> Cuthbert broke that {{record in the}} {{following}} heat {{with a time of}} 11.4seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her and pulled out a little extra to win Australia’s first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson’s Olympic record. Mathews was third again.|$|E
500|$|Currently ranked 2144th in Movies and Television on Amazon.com and 1713th in Film and Television on Amazon.co.uk, the box set {{received}} mixed reviews. Kelly West of Cinema Blend {{noted that}} the [...] "seriously extended episodes" [...] were not significantly expanded, only adding {{a few minutes of}} extra footage, which don't influence the storyline. She also noted a [...] "weakness" [...] in the audio commentary provided by four of the actresses, who she deemed to have been fantastic during the series, describing the features as [...] "random chit-chats". However, she praised Sandra Oh's commentary, noting that she put the most effort <b>in</b> <b>hers</b> by {{trying to come up with}} interest topics, while being [...] "amusing and worth listening to". She described the bonus features as [...] "mildly entertaining", emphasizing Dempsey's interview about his passion for racing cars, which she regarded useless. USA Today had a positive perspective on the box set, by calling it [...] "scintillating" [...] and [...] "addictive".|$|E

500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b> Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E
500|$|British {{critics were}} {{especially}} enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg's direction. In {{the view of}} Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look Now put him [...] "right {{up at the top}} as film-maker". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined [...] "that handful of names whose appearance {{at the end of the}} credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: [...] "Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection." [...] American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of [...] "those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading [...] "makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [...] Scott and [...] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is [...] "a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions", while Pauline Kael labelled him [...] "chillingly chic" [...] <b>in</b> <b>hers.</b> Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to [...] "maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it".|$|E
2500|$|Collins {{was born}} the eldest of five {{siblings}} in Seattle, Washington, where she spent the first ten years of her life. Her father, a blind singer, pianist and radio show host, took a job in Denver, Colorado, in 1949, and the family moved there. Collins studied classical piano with Antonia Brico, making her public debut at age 13, performing Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos. Brico took a dim view, both then and later, of Collins' developing interest in folk music, which {{led her to the}} difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands <b>in</b> <b>hers,</b> looked wistfully at her fingers and said, [...] "Little Judy—you really could have gone places." [...] Still later, Collins discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing jazz and ragtime piano (Singing Lessons, pp.71–72). In her early life, Collins had the good fortune of meeting many professional musicians through her father.|$|E
