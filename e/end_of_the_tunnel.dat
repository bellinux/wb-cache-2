5|$|While {{plans to}} {{construct}} the bypass existed as late as 1985, the connection to the Queens Boulevard line at Northern Boulevard was built {{as an alternative to}} the bypass. A bellmouth was built at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> should construction on the bypass ever commence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater {{in the middle of}} the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, <b>the</b> eastern <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> located {{underneath}} Manhattan, employed cut {{and cover}} construction methods.|$|R
25|$|One in <b>the</b> Rilly-la-Montagne railway <b>tunnel</b> was {{attacked}} by the British with Tallboy earthquake bombs on July 31 collapsing both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{upper and}} lower levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> are used as exhaust and intake air ducts. One hundred foot {{ventilation}} towers on both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> enable air exchange once every 90 seconds.|$|R
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The light at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, {{in an attempt to}} nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|At {{the western}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> Highway58 {{emerges as a}} divided highway in Thorold. It meets an {{interchange}} with Pine Street; the eastbound on-ramp from Pine Street features a stop sign and no merging lane prior to entering the Thorold Tunnel. West of Pine Street, the route passes beneath a Trillium Railway line and curves slightly southwest. It encounters an interchange with Collier Street, gradually curving to the northwest and passing beneath Richmond Street. Highway58 ends at a complicated interchange with both St. Davids Road as well as Highway406 {{on the edge of}} the Niagara Escarpment.|$|E
5|$|As {{operations}} continued {{throughout the}} month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical {{and the decision}} was made to disband some of the 3rd Division's battalions and use them to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction of the strength of division's infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division's final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These came around the St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the mopping up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> that ran under the canal.|$|E

25|$|The sign {{illustrated}} (left) {{was displayed}} at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and stressed <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> only using <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> in any one direction at particular times. There are reported instances of fines levied for non-compliance with these rules.|$|R
50|$|The area is {{a popular}} tourist destination, {{particularly}} as the Hope Valley Line railway from Sheffield to Manchester runs through it, from <b>the</b> western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Totley <b>Tunnel</b> near Grindleford to <b>the</b> eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cowburn <b>Tunnel</b> near Edale.|$|R

25|$|Between 1934 and 1945, {{a signal}} cabin was located at Tunnel Junction, {{on the eastern}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> for {{managing}} {{the transition from the}} tunnel's single line to the dual lines of the system.|$|E
25|$|Fictional catastrophe: Unlike real disasters, catastrophes {{which are}} only made up or solved in one's mind might be humorous, {{as can be}} seen in the quotation: The light at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> is only muzzle flash.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{provides}} a quick link between <b>the</b> two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> as before <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> vehicles had to detour through Kowloon City {{to reach the}} other end. Kai Tak Tunnel is currently managed by Greater Lucky (H.K.) Company Limited.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> were {{sealed in}} <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> 1861. <b>The</b> similar Murray Hill <b>Tunnel</b> on <b>the</b> New York and Harlem Railroad was built as an open cut around 1836, roofed over around the 1850s, {{and is now}} in use for {{automobile}} traffic.|$|R
50|$|J.Q. Jamieson was Assistant Engineer {{in charge}} from <b>the</b> {{commencement}} <b>of</b> work until October 23, 1887, {{when he was}} succeeded by Edwin Harrison McHenry (later chief engineer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Pacific), who continued in charge until <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> snowsheds and sidetracks at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|R
25|$|He {{produced}} two music albums for entertainer and actress Grace Lee Whitney: Light at the <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tunnel</b> in 1996, and Yeoman Rand Sings! in 1999.

25|$|Sergeant Joe DeLisio {{ran through}} the intense German gunfire and Lt. Karl H. Timmermann and the others {{followed}} him. Bratge tried to organize a counterattack to throw the Americans back across the bridge, but the American tanks' shell fire stopped him. He looked for Scheller and found he had already escaped out the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Work at {{the western}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{continued}} with traditional drill and blast methods. The profile of the western end, which had been round to accommodate the TBM, was changed to a horseshoe shape to better suit conventional tunnelling procedure. By the time the tunnel was finished, around 48% {{of the length of}} the tunnel had been bored using conventional methods.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> Wheeling <b>Tunnel</b> sits between exits 1A and 1B on Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250, which run {{concurrent}} through <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Wheeling. <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{cuts through}} Wheeling Hill, {{and has two}} travel lanes in each tube. Due to <b>the</b> closeness <b>of</b> exit 1A to <b>the</b> western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> <b>the</b> tunnels' right lanes function as acceleration and deceleration lanes. [...] Through traffic is restricted to the left lane in each tunnel and lane changes are prohibited.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> grew about 18 inches each day, {{with both}} sides moving toward the center. On December 21, 1832 the workmen broke through the final barrier and {{connected}} <b>the</b> two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> There was much celebration with speeches and toasts. <b>The</b> full <b>tunnel</b> excavation was completed in April 1833.|$|R
25|$|Reasonable {{progress}} was made from the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> once the TBM had been reassembled there in April 1972. Though the wear on the machine caused by its use at the western end caused some mechanical problems, progress of up to 15 m per 8 hour shift was achieved, though this was considerably reduced in wet areas. With up to 600 m³ of water flowing through the tunnel walls, continuous pumping was required to avoid flooding.|$|E
25|$|Force India's big updates {{were showing}} {{improvements}} as Adrian Sutil came 6th {{in the first}} session, while in the second session Sutil came 6th again while Giancarlo Fisichella showed a bit of form {{when he came in}} 8th. BMW Sauber were still struggling as they came 12th and 15th. But Robert Kubica was hopefully showing a light at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> as he came 7th in the second session, splitting the two Force Indias.|$|E
25|$|In 1872 - 1873 the Hugo pit became productive; {{it was in}} high land above West Wemyss, and an {{inclined}} tunnel was dug, down which hutches of coal were lowered on {{a double}} track rope worked inclined plane, of 25 inches gauge. At the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> the plane reached the small harbour of West Wemyss, already reached by the Victoria and Barncraig hutch tramways. An enlargement of West Wemyss Harbour was made at this time too, starting in 1872 and completed in September 1873.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{were finally}} joined on June 19, 1933 and <b>the</b> Tanna <b>Tunnel</b> was opened to rail traffic on March 10, 1934. It was <b>the</b> second longest <b>tunnel</b> in Japan at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> its completion, having been surpassed by <b>the</b> Shimizu <b>Tunnel</b> {{before it was}} completed.|$|R
