2500|$|The oft-expressed {{view in the}} {{literature}} that the heath arose in the Middle Ages {{as a result of}} the demand for wood by the [...] Lüneburg salt pans is incorrect. The Lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt, but they did not appear until around 1000 AD, by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years. The amount required, even in the heyday of production, could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50km2 in area, yet the heath covers over 7000km2. In any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath, but via the waterways, especially from Mecklenburg up the Elbe and from the area of the Schaalsee. Transportation overland would have been far too expensive (apart from the River Ilmenau which was navigable at the time, no rivers flow from the main areas of heathland to Lüneburg), as can be seen not only from some of the <b>delivery</b> <b>notes</b> which still survive, but also from the fact that there are still large woods around Lüneburg itself, such as the Göhrde. Finally heathland has frequentely developed in areas where there are no salt pans, such as the sheep-grazing regions on the coasts of Norway to Portugal and in Scotland and Ireland.|$|E

The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller's <b>delivery</b> <b>note)</b> is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the <b>delivery</b> <b>note</b> or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.|$|R

This definition is sometimes stretched in the U.S. medical billing industry, where hospital corporations may blur the definitions of [...] "admission" [...] and [...] "observation" [...] because of reimbursement rules under which healthcare payors pay less for the care if an [...] "admission" [...] was involved.|$|E

Invoice is the {{evidence}} of product or service sale generally used by those selling product. The invoice preparation plays {{a very important part}} in supporting the office activity because the printed invoice can serve as evidence of product releasing, product delivery evidence, as {{the evidence}} of collection, as the evidence of archive when some time an inspection is conducted and as the evidence of product return. To get a good invoice preparation, a good procedure is required as well. With the good procedure, the invoice preparation process could be implemented well. This final project aimed to describe and to explain the procedure of invoice preparation as the means of collecting receivable accounts in PT. Tirta Investama Distribution Center Solo. This observation was conducted using descriptive qualitative type of observation, the one describing or depicting the procedure of invoice preparation in the form of sentences and based on the facts. The data source derived from information, event or activity. Techniques of collecting data used were direct observation, interview. The result of observation conducted in Finance division of PT.

40|$|The {{following}} {{article presents}} a small-scale qualitative {{study in which}} the student learning experiences from service user and carer (SUAC) involvement in social work, mental health nursing and social welfare courses at an English university were evaluated for any effects on student perceptions, knowledge, skills and practice.

Recommendations for meaningful SUAC involvement in higher education are made regarding the need to involve SUACs across the whole duration of a course; the need for the preparation of both students and presenters regarding boundaries; the fit of presentations with intended learning outcomes; more partnership delivery in classrooms between academics and SUACs (possibly with a differentiation between theoretical and practice inputs); the opportunities for SUACs to present their own situations as real rather than hypothetical case studies for students and the possibilities that may result from introducing a ‘buddying’ system between students and SUACs throughout their studies.

40|$|Allowing {{for obvious}} changes {{with regard to}} form, {{although}} perhaps less significant changes with regard to content, one of the usual items of expenditure in medieval towns and villages which has survived to our own day was the hiring of beasts of burden that either the local officials or private individuals appointed by them used in order to travel on business outside the municipal boundaries. In the medieval town of Tàrrega, regular comings and goings between the town itself and various parts of Catalonia on {{the authority of the}} municipal council was common practice. Among the <b>delivery</b> <b>notes</b> from the period that have survived to this day, under the heading lloguer de besties (animal hire) several entries contain specific details of the sums of money paid by the council to the owners of animals thus used. In some documents dating {{from the end of the}} 15 th century, members of the Jewish community are listed alongside Christians suppliers of animals. In the country, on those occasions when more than one animal was needed for work in the fields, it was customary for the poorer peasant farmers to lend each other their animals. Ownership of several animals was restricted to the financially better off. So, who were the Tàrrega Jews who, in the years immediately before their expulsion, were able to earn enough money to be in a position to hire out their animals to the local council as a means of transport? One of the columns in the table contained in the Appendix lists the names of Jewish animal owners from whom the town council hired animals. Although it is almost impossible on the basis of the data available today to restore the missing name and identify with absolute certainty the six individuals in question, the author attempts to provide the maximum biographical detail concerning each of the animal owners. The sums of money paid varied from year to year and even, occasionally, within a given year, the minimum amount being one solidus and three denarii per day and the maximum being two solidi per day, as shown in the table corresponding to the years 1480 - 1489. A comparison of these figures with the amounts paid to Christians in Tàrrega for the same service reveals that there was no appreciable difference between payments to Christian and Jewish for the hire of animals, as demonstrated by the above-mentioned documents. With one or two exceptions, there was no difference in the sum paid, irrespective of the type of animal hired, whether mule, ass or nag. Most of the documents also give the name of the person to whom the town council had entrusted the out-of-town business. On two occasions, it is stated that the emissary is a Tàrrega Jew. One of these official errands on behalf of the town council was in connection with an affair involving a local Jew: at the beginning of November, 1484, one Bellsom was assaulted and robbed as he was going along the road; soon afterwards, it came to the attention of the Tàrrega town council that the thief responsible was being held prisoner in Sant Cugat. Since the Tàrrega authorities wished to try the thief in the municipality, it took steps to ensure that the prisoner be transferred «swiftly and without delay» to Tàrrega...|$|E
