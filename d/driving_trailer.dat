5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
25|$|All the South Eastern Trains 4Vep {{units have}} now been withdrawn. One <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> from unit 3568, and another from 4Vep 3545, have been claimed by the National Railway Museum, and the former 4TC <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> from unit 3582 have been preserved.|$|E
25|$|South Eastern Trains {{operated}} the largest fleet of 4Vep units. The franchise was originally operated as Connex South Eastern, which lost the franchise in 2003. The fleet contained several unusual units, included no. 3473, which contained a <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> with the compartments removed, and no. 3582, which contained former 4TC <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> 76275.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} Class 311 unit, {{which were}} {{almost identical to}} the Class 303s, was preserved at Summerlee Heritage Park in Coatbridge, although one <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> has since been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|<b>Driving</b> <b>trailer</b> – a DBSO was {{purchased}} in 2006 {{for use with}} the train to allow {{a greater degree of}} flexibility in its use. This was finally delivered in the summer of 2009.|$|E

2500|$|All cars' toilets were removed. There were {{originally}} nine five-car and three four-car sets. The first sets to enter service had the locomotive {{at the north}} end, but later ones were marshalled with the locomotive at the south end; the earlier sets were then turned on the triangle at Limerick Junction to standardise the position. However, the number of available <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> declined due to a spate of fires (at one stage, a [...] "spare man" [...] travelled in each <b>driving</b> <b>trailer's</b> generator compartment to detect and extinguish fires) and the fatal collision at Gormanston in 1974. There were only six <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> available by 1982; conventional locomotive haulage was, thus, often substituted for push–pull operation.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{has built}} several coaches to {{accommodate}} wheelchair users, starting with <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> coach 105 (heavily re-built after extensive accident damage in 1993 and later named Marjorie) followed by 601 Elsie, then 602 Winn and 603 May.|$|E
25|$|Following its {{decision}} to build the Tawa Flat deviation to replace the original ex-Wellington & Manawatu Railway North Island Main Trunk alignment out of Wellington, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) decided to convert the remaining 10.49km of track between Wellington and Johnsonville into an electrified suburban branch line. Six two-car trains comprising one driving motor car and one <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> were ordered from English Electric in 1936 to work the future Johnsonville Line, which formally 'opened' as a branch line on 2 July 1938 with the new electric trains inaugurating the service. The new trains were allocated as the DM class (driving motor cars) and the D class (non-motored <b>driving</b> <b>trailer).</b>|$|E
25|$|Almost all the push–pull {{vehicles}} were scrapped at Mullingar or Dundalk. One, <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> 6111 (the former railcar 2624), was {{set aside for}} possible preservation. It remained at Inchicore in a derelict condition until 7 February 2015, when it was purchased by {{and moved to the}} Downpatrick and County Down Railway.|$|E
5000|$|Thirty motor {{coaches and}} 30 <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> were {{built by the}} Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Co. Ltd. in 1911. Each motor coach had four [...] Winter Eichberg motors. A further 26 <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> were built at the LBSC's Lancing Carriage Works. In 1912, four {{additional}} motor and trailer pairs were delivered by MAC&W’s successor, the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Lancing Works built eight more trailers the following year.|$|R
50|$|Third {{field of}} use are the car {{shuttles}} through (old) Lötschberg Tunnel. A total of 9 <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> is available for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|... some NPZ RBDe 560 EMUs with NPZ <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> and EW 1 or EW 2 {{intermediate}} coaches (exact {{number is}} unknown but variable) ...|$|R
25|$|From 1983-1984 {{the fleet}} was refurbished. Work {{involved}} replacing all compartments with open saloons, and the fitting of gangways between vehicles within a unit. The first-class seating was also {{moved from the}} trailer to the non-brake <b>driving</b> <b>trailer.</b> During this period, units were renumbered under the TOPS system to 307101-307132.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} three {{different}} formations: the first (2-car), had a motor car with first-class seating (could be converted to second class) and a second-class trailer; the second (2-car), had second-class seating only; and the third (4-car), a motor car with driver's cab, a trailer, a motored trailer and a <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> without motor.|$|E
25|$|Other, less {{numerous}} intermediates, confusingly {{interspersed with}} the other type within the 63xx series, were converted from railcar powered intermediates and, thus, had a gangway at each end and no cab. These vehicles could be marshalled between a <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> or connector car and an intermediate of the first type to give a five-car set.|$|E
50|$|To replace U sets on {{stopping}} services between Gosford and Newcastle, {{the sets}} with <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> were remarshaled as two-car sets from October 1996.|$|R
50|$|Standard Gauge. Like the metre {{gauge the}} {{standard}} gauge lines are operated on an hourly timetable and again with electric units and <b>driving</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first, {{fourth and}} the fifth, eighth cars(if applicable)(i.e. the <b>driving</b> <b>trailers)</b> {{of the train}} in NSW TrainLink {{services}} are designated [...] "Quiet Carriages".|$|R
25|$|It {{was decided}} to convert the {{vehicles}} from the many redundant Class 307 vehicles that were stored at various locations around the country. In 1994, two vehicles were rebuilt as prototype PCV vehicles, and underwent an extensive testing procedure. In the period 1994-1996, a further 40 redundant <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> vehicles were rebuilt by Hunslet-Barclay in Kilmarnock.|$|E
25|$|Following withdrawal, {{large-scale}} scrapping of {{the class}} was delayed as {{it was intended to}} rebuild the units as Class 300 parcels units. This plan was dropped in favour of building new Class 325 units. However, many of the <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> vehicles were eventually rebuilt as Propelling Control Vehicles (see below). The redundant intermediate trailers and motor vehicles were eventually scrapped.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, a £1 million {{interior}} refurbishment {{was carried out}} on two vehicles of the same unit - <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> standard open 77021 and motor standard open 62682. The interiors were refurbished in a Metro style layout and provided a direct contrast to the 3+2 and 2+2 seating in use on {{the remainder of the}} unit. Trials to test the reaction of passengers commenced with Greater Anglia in mid-2014.|$|E
50|$|For the CCE&HR, 150 {{cars were}} built, also by American Car and Foundry. Sixty were driving motors, fifty were <b>driving</b> <b>trailers,</b> and forty were trailers.|$|R
5000|$|Nambu Line: 6-car 205-0 (x31) (including 4 sets with 205-1200 <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> {{which were}} {{converted}} from 205-0 series intermediate trailers) (1989 - 9 January 2016) ...|$|R
50|$|The Matterhorn-Gotthard-Bahn (MGB) has {{numerous}} <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> {{for almost}} all types of motive power. They work regional trains and car shuttle trains through the Furka Base Tunnel.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, {{with the}} general {{run-down}} of slam door trains, {{it was decided to}} reform some of the 4Vop units by swapping one <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> with that from a standard unit. The new hybrid units were reclassified as Class 423/8 (or 4Vip) and renumbered in the range 3813-3844. This was to give all units some 1st-class seating, thus making diagramming of units easier. But in the event only eight units were reformed, namely nos. 3813/14/21/22/41-44.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 four pre-series sets (each {{consisting}} of a motor car and a <b>driving</b> <b>trailer)</b> were delivered. Ordered in 1981, they originally bore the RBDe 4/4 designation and road numbers 2100-2103. All four trainsets (RBDe 560 + Bt) were delivered in different color schemes, {{one of which was}} the livery used for the main series (blue over white sides, yellow doors, and red faces). The striking contrast to the green color scheme of previous SBB passenger stock led to the name Kolibri (Hummingbird), which is, however, rarely used. Nearly all the RBDe 560 sets have been named after smaller municipalities along the lines served by these trainset received the appropriate coat of arms.|$|E
500|$|A {{complete}} six-car trainset {{consists of}} an identical twin set of one <b>driving</b> <b>trailer</b> (DT) and two motor cars (M1 and M2) permanently coupled together.|$|E
50|$|The CIÉ 8100 {{class were}} the first {{electrical}} multiple units used on the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) system. Built by GEC and Linke-Hofmann-Busch in 1983, they are two-car units, and were the only units used on the DART {{before the arrival of}} the 8200 Class. 40 two car sets were delivered, numbered 8101/8301 to 8140/8340. 81XX units are power cars while 83XX units are unpowered <b>driving</b> <b>trailers.</b> The <b>driving</b> cabs are full width, with the inner ends connected by gangways. Power cars always head North, while <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> head South.|$|R
25|$|So far two {{complete}} units (highlighted {{in table}} below) and two individual <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> have been preserved. In addition the former 4TC driving vehicle from set 3582 has been preserved.|$|R
50|$|To operate {{services}} on the newly electrified Riverstone to Richmond line from August 1991, all 10 <b>driving</b> <b>trailers</b> {{and a number}} of Series 1 power cars were fitted with headlights.|$|R
