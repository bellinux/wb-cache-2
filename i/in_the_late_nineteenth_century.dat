5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Isdud was {{described}} as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick. There were two main sources of water: a pond and a masonry well. Both were surrounded by groves of date-palm and fig-trees.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{the need}} to build an {{underground}} transportation system in Buenos Aires began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> alongside the tramway system, {{which was one of the}} most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis exacerbated by the monopolisation of the lines, which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> King Leopold II {{started to}} receive {{criticism}} for {{his treatment of}} the natives in Congo Free State.

They would report the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger Casement, would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> {{a bounty}} was levied on J.lagostoma {{in order to}} reduce its numbers.

The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered.|$|E

5|$|The journal had {{an archaeological}} and {{historical}} focus, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> that naturally meant that epigraphy (the study of inscriptions as writing {{rather than as}} literature) {{would be one of}} the principal subjects covered in its pages. Indeed, the Antiquary was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the Epigraphia Indica, was published as a quarterly supplement to the Antiquary between 1892 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{interpreted the}} amendment narrowly.

A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white groups also suppressed black participation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations for the work of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in {{the early twentieth}} century.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> several {{attempts}} were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The school {{eventually}} outgrew {{its original}} site.

By a further Act of Parliament, the City of London School Act 1879, it was empowered to move to a new site at Blackfriars on the Victoria Embankment overlooking the Thames (still in the City of London). The school moved in 1883 and the new building was opened by the Prince of Wales, (the future King Edward VII).|$|E
