5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E
2500|$|For Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anderson {{wanted him}} to play a [...] "really simple, uncomplicated, caring character". The actor {{described}} his character as someone who [...] "really takes pride {{in the fact that}} every day he's dealing with life and death circumstances". With Julianne Moore in mind, the director wrote a role for her to play a crazed character using many pharmaceuticals. According to the actress, [...] "Linda doesn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> or what she's feeling and can only try to explain it in the most vulgar terms possible". For William H. Macy, Anderson felt that the actor was scared of big, emotional parts and wrote for him, [...] "a big tearful, emotional part".|$|E
2500|$|Long a level-headed {{character}} who sacrifices her own desires {{for those of}} her friends, she gradually abandons these priorities to be more independent and please herself. She is often shown making choices that allow her to acquire power or knowledge and avoid emotional conflict. The story arc of Willow's growing dependence on magic was noted by Marti Noxon as the representation of [...] "adult crossroads" [...] and Willow's inability and unwillingness to be accountable for her own life. Willow enjoys power she is unable to control. She steals to accomplish her vocational goals and rationalizes her amoral behavior. This also manifests itself in a competitive streak and she accuses others who share their concerns that she uses magic for selfish purposes of being jealous. No longer {{the conscience of the}} Scooby Gang, Willow cedes this role to Tara then revels in breaking more rules. After Tara leaves Willow, Willow divulges to Buffy that she does not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and doubts her worth and appeal—specifically to Tara—without magic. Contradicting the characterization of Willow's issues with magic as addiction, Buffy essayist Jacqueline Lichtenberg writes [...] "Willow is not addicted to magic. Willow is addicted to the surging hope that this deed or the next or the next will finally assuage her inner pain." ...|$|E

"No, {{she did not}} {{use those}} words, at least, not that I can remember; {{but it was not}} necessary, I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> I have seen the {{sketches}} in your book, and there were several of them on the walls of your room. Of course I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> speaking of, though she did not, so far as I can remember, use your name." ...|$|R

2500|$|After Alfie {{returns from}} Germany, Jean {{tells him to}} buy scented candles as Kat used one while he was away. He asks Kat where she got it from and she lies that {{it was from the}} local shop but he discovers they do not sell them. He then finds out Kat closed the pub early one night because it was [...] "quiet" [...] but worries it may have been for another reason. He then finds the ring that Kat pawned and asks Jean if she or Charlie lent Kat money, but they did not, and the {{pawnbroker}} refuses to tell him who bought it. The next day, he is suspicious when Kat leaves the pub and tells Michael that she is untrustworthy. Michael says Kat would not cheat again, revealing he knew about the affair, but he does not know who Kat was seeing. Alfie is in turmoil when Michael advises him not to pursue his suspicions. Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) finds a key on the bar and leaves it in a glass, but Alfie later notices it has gone. As he hides a Christmas present in Kat's jewellery box, he finds the key hidden there with the ring. He then leaves, claiming he will be away overnight, and asks Jean and Roxy to look after the bar so Kat can have the night off. Roxy tells the three Branning brothers that Alfie is away, and shortly after, Kat receives a phone call. She heads out, unaware that Alfie is watching. Alfie watches Kat enter the bedsit and kicks the door open, where he sees lit candles and rose petals. He looks for Kat's lover but she is alone. He demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seeing, reminding her that she claimed her lover lived miles away. Kat insists this was her only lie and says the affair is over but her lover kept pestering her and threatening to tell Alfie. Alfie brings out Kat's mother's ring and asks how her lover knew about it if she had not seen him. Kat reveals she had not seen him alone, so Alfie realises it is someone he knows. Alfie decides to stay until he arrives, but then sees a rental agreement. Kat quickly sets fire to it, but Alfie sees the name Mr Branning. She tells Alfie she refused to let the man in while he was in Germany, and refuses to reveal which brother it is. Alfie says she makes him sick and goes to The Queen Victoria to find out the truth. While Kat searches for her phone in the bedsit, all three Branning brothers deny everything to Alfie. Kat then phones one of them and Alfie answers. Kat panics and runs to the pub. Alfie then returns the phone to its owner, Max, and attacks him. Kat stops Alfie, saying he has the wrong person. Alfie asks who it is, and Kat points at a smug Derek.|$|E
2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E

6000|$|... "But," [...] I protested, [...] "it {{is absurd}} {{for him to}} speak to her. Does he <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is?</b> The Princess Isobel of Waldenburg! Their little kingdom is small enough, but they play at royalty there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much {{doubt about}} that," [...] he answered; [...] "look at her guns. The odd {{part of it}} is, too, she is flying no flag. We shall <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in a minute or two, though." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{last time}} she saw him, he looked quite bewildered. Around that time, Margaret Doughty, née McKechnie met him a last time, walking on the Edinburgh streets.

6000|$|But we have {{no space}} for a {{description}} of this eternal proboscis. Suffice it that its existence is a standing menace to society, a threat to civilization, and a danger to commerce.

But have you any reason to suppose that he will not receive her? Did he refuse at first to undertake the charge of the child? Does he even know that she is alive?
