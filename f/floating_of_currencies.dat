40|$|We {{identify}} the Asian financial crisis {{to be the}} result of the instabilities of short-term capital flows, inadequate prudential supervision in the financial markets of the developing countries, mistaken commitments to the fixed exchange rate regime, lack of international coordination in the regulation of international financial markets, absence of an international mechanism for the orderly working out of international debt, and inappropriate "rescue" packages imposed by the IMF. We recommend 30 policy reforms to make the international economy more resilient to financial turmoil, and to reduce the costs of such turmoil. We conclude that there is little particularly "Asian" about the Asian financial crisis. Even though official Washington, led by the IMF, proclaimed the crisis to be one of Asian capitalism, the more generic character of the crisis became all too clear during 1998, as the crisis spread to Russia, South Africa, and Brazil. Rather than an Asian crisis, the world is experiencing a type of global crisis that reflects the rapid arrival of global capitalism, in a world economy not yet used to the integration of the advanced and developing countries. Because we see no justification for the monopoly position of the IMF as the sole international institution on monetary affairs, we advocate the formation of regional monetary bodies to provide mutual support in the event of a financial crisis hitting one or another member country. We also advocate that an international bankruptcy system be established in order to accelerate an orderly workout of international debts when a developing country falls into an extreme indebtedness crisis. Existing key international organisations like the IMF have performed poorly, and they must be reformed to render them more transparent in their operations, and more democratic in their governance. Developing countries must have a greater role in designing future rescue packages extended to financially distressed countries so that rescue packages will no longer be biased toward the interests of the creditor countries. The new global financial architecture should have generalised <b>floating</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> as its mainstay. The bad debts of the financial and corporate sectors in Pacific Asia to be quickly resolved by the infusion of public money, and the takeover of some large domestic banks by foreign banks. Furthermore, the revival of the corporate sectors in Asia requires international creditors to write-down the value of their loans, and to convert part of their loans into equity participation. There is a serious mismatch in Pacific Asia, particularly in most of southeast Asia, between investment in physical hardware - factories and machinery - and investment in the social software - scientific research centers, administrative and judiciary systems, and growth of civil society. In a world of growing international competitiveness, when foreign direct investors are courted not just by Asia but Central Europe and Latin America, the concerns over governance are bound to grow, and to weigh increasingly heavily on the unreformed countries of Asia. The long-term competitiveness of Asia rests as much on "getting its institutions right" as on "getting the prices right. ...|$|E

This study undertakes a study of capital flight as it applies to the Nigerian environment {{in the face of the}} current episodes of financial globalisation and capital outflows out of the economy. It adopts paired sample and the ordinary least square techniques with the main variables of exchange rates, Kaopen, investment and others to perform its analyses. The main finding is that the Nigerian capital flight has not been significantly increased by the financial globalisation process but it also indicates that Kaopen (an index of financial globalisation) is significant in the process of acquisition of external assets and might therefore, jeopardise the country's ability to retain capital within the economy for development purposes. Exchange rates and domestic investment show significance and thus are impacted by the process.

Liberalization of capital accounts proceeded very gradually in Japan from {{the adoption of a}} system of general prohibition of foreign exchange and capital transactions in 1949 through the shift to a generally liberalized system in 1979.

In response to the massive short-term capital flow {{in and out of the}} country caused by these shocks, Japan, which was generally headed for the liberalization of the capital accounts, was frequently forced to resort to foreign exchange and capital control measures to stabilize the market. These experiences by Japan seems to give valuable implications to China, for which significant enhancement of the flexibility of its exchange rate movement under the recently revised formal exchange rate regime and the liberalization of capital accounts continue to be important policy agenda in the years to come. liberalization, capital accounts, peg, float system, Japan, China...|$|R

The study consists, firstly, of a literature survey in the fields of pricing and export management, drawing on some 600 sources. Primary data were collected through a small number of depth interviews with export executives and a postal questionnaire survey of 250 medium-sized exporting manufacturers in the North of England, drawn from the Clothing. Furniture, Chemicals and Scientific Instrumentation industries. The theory of export strategy is reviewed, particularly in the context of key market concentration, as the foundation for export policies, including export pricing on which attention is focussed here. Challenges are offered to the arguments and empirical evidence on which the key market philosophy is founded and an alternative strategy proposed: market spreading. Empirical evidence is produced to show the existence of both concentration and spreading strategies in practical exporting, and to assess the underlying logic of market spreading as an alternative to market concentration, together with the situational cues associated with each. From general pricing theory and methods, attention is directed to the more specialised problems of export pricing. Consideration is given to the relationship between domestic market and export prices and pricing methods, and the existence and form of discriminatory pricing in exporting. The emphasis placed on price in the export marketing programme is analysed in the context of the debate on price versus non-price aspects of competition in international markets. Lastly, arising out of export pricing policy is the key issue <b>of</b> pricing <b>currency,</b> particularly as the mediator of the impact of floatation on the exporter.

5000|$|The Nixon Shock {{has been}} widely {{considered}} to be a political success, but an economic mixed bag in bringing on the stagflation of the 1970s and leading to the instability <b>of</b> <b>floating</b> <b>currencies.</b> The dollar plunged by a third during the '70s. According to the World Trade Review's report [...] "The Nixon Shock After Forty Years: The Import Surcharge Revisited", Douglas Irwin reports that for several months, U.S officials could not get other countries to agree to a formal revaluation <b>of</b> their <b>currencies.</b> The German mark appreciated significantly after it was allowed to float in May 1971. Further, the Nixon Shock unleashed enormous speculation against the dollar. It forced Japan’s central bank to intervene significantly in the foreign exchange market to prevent the yen from increasing in value. Within two days August 16-17, 1971, Japan’s central bank had to buy $1.3 billion to support the dollar and keep the yen at the old rate of 360 Yen to the dollar. Japan’s foreign exchange reserves rapidly increased: $2.7 billion (30%) a week later and $4 billion the following week. Still, this large-scale intervention by Japan’s central bank could not prevent the depreciation of US dollar against the yen. France also was willing to allow the dollar to depreciate against the franc, but not allow the franc to appreciate against gold (Page 14 Douglas). Even much later, in 2011, Paul Volcker expressed regret over the abandonment of Bretton Woods: [...] "Nobody's in charge," [...] Volcker said.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the correlation between}} the annual fluctuations of the terms of trade of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. The period under analysis is 1980 - 2001 and the main findings are that the four countries have a high to moderate synchronization of their export prices, a moderate to low synchronization of their import prices, and a low synchronization of their terms of trade. The small positive correlation between the growth rates of the terms of trade of Brazil and Argentina (0. 24) support exchange rate coordination between the two countries, provided that their bilateral real exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate temporarily to accommodate possible differences between the intensity of shocks across them. For instance, given an adverse shock to Brazil, both the Brazilian and Argentine real exchange rates against {{the rest of the world}} (domestic good per unit of foreign good) should increase to avoid a reduction, or smooth the variation, of their trade balances, but the Argentine currency should appreciate against the Brazilian currency in real terms because Argentina tends to be less affected by the shock. The observed correlations indicate that, through a joint and flexible managed <b>float</b> <b>of</b> their <b>currencies,</b> Argentina and Brazil may be able to share the benefits and costs of terms-of-trade shocks without imposing major macroeconomic disruptions on each other. In such an arrangement and also based on the observed correlations, Uruguay may either follow Argentina, when the terms-of-trade shock is more intense to Brazil, or do nothing, when the shock is more intense to Argentina. In contrast, Paraguay should follow Brazil, when the terms- of-trade shock is more intense to Argentina, or do nothing, when the shock is more intense to Brazil. Because of the low correlation between the terms-of-trade fluctuations of Brazil and Argentina, the best form of exchange-rate coordination for the near future seems to be a Mercosur version of the European Monetary System of 1979 - 98, that is, a wide interval of fluctuation for the regional currencies around a common and competitive real exchange rate against the rest of the world.
