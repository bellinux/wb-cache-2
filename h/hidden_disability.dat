Since 2000, demographic changes tell us this trend is continuing at an alarming rate. The academic library worker is one segment of the workforce that may be dealing with the stresses of <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and creates an imperative for us {{to address the issue of}} <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities</b> for our profession. These trends also indicate a significant portion of our workers will need access to in house disability services. In order to address these issues we must create an environment that eliminates myths and stereotypes, and answer a few questions surrounding this social diversity. Are we prepared to face the truth about visible and <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities?</b> Is there a comfort level for those with disabilities that promote a positive job performance? Why should we commit to establish a work environment where every library staff can develop their professional potential without fear? These questions and others will be answered as we research and analyze data that will help us understand interaction of co-workers, as well as customers, and identify best practices on recruitment and retention of library staff with <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities...</b>|$|R
40|$|More {{students}} with disabilities are accessing the tertiary sector with many disabilities not easily observed (or hidden), {{because there are no}} physical indicators. These “hidden” disabilities affect a variety of cognitive processes and may be developmental or acquired. To ensure {{students with}} <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities</b> can enrol, engage in and benefit from tertiary education, universities generally provide a range of supports. Typically these supports and any reasonable adjustments are negotiated with students taking into account a number of factors including, where available, any supporting documentation that {{they might be able to}} provide. This case study reports efforts within one large Australian university to support higher education students with <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities</b> on campus. Perceptions on the use of and barriers to support available were collected from seven undergraduate students who self-identified as having <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities</b> and from eight support staff.

The definition of disability will be deconstructed and by reference to both legal and non-legal sources, key fault areas within the constitution of disability will be identified and critically evaluated.

To examine how graduate students negotiate their disability or illness in the classroom context, I conducted three interviews with graduate instructors addressing how they communicate their disability in the classes they teach. I learned that these instructors often do not explicitly discuss their conditions with their students. Rather, they performed hidden disabilities in both verbal and nonverbal messages.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{perception}} of the physicality of disabilities. The review of literature in this project shows {{that there is a}} large number of disability related studies in the field of communication that focus primarily on physical and/or visible disabilities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to incorporate research on <b>hidden</b> and/or invisible <b>disabilities,</b> specifically deafness. The literature in the field of communication relating to <b>hidden</b> <b>disabilities</b> is limited and much more limited in deaf related research. There are an estimated two thousand deaf individuals in El Paso. Their participation and integration in the community is hindered by societal barriers and attitudes. This is due in part to a lack of recognition that the Deaf culture does exist and a misunderstanding of language versus disability. Therefore, this research paves a way into the culture and specifically looks at sign language and bilingualism on the border. Through ethnography and interviews, this project addressed the following questions: 1) How does the Deaf community in the El Paso borderland region create identities and culture? The framework that supplemented this project was symbolic interactionism, the idea that through language, ourselves and identities are developed. Seven deaf participants were interviewed and based on their responses, there were four themes that emerged from this study: language as identities, situational languages, hidden culture and education as a change agent. ...|$|R

Therefore, we simultaneously estimate reverse substitution, that is, <b>hidden</b> <b>disability</b> in UI. To this end, we employ a sample of firms in the Dutch AVO database from the period 1993 - 2002. Using instrumental variables in a bivariate Tobit specification, we identify the hidden components in both respective schemes. The estimation results indicate that about 3 % of all dismissals took place through DI, which implies that about one quarter of the DI enrolments observed in our sample in fact consists of hidden unemployment. We find no evidence for reverse substitution of disabled persons ending up in UI...|$|E

The study at hand is qualitative and was conducted as a virtual city tour which allowed the subjects to share their experience of accessibility. Labov's theory of narrative structure was used to analyse the data. The samples of narrative were collected from people who suffer from mental fatigue after a mild traumatic brain injury. The results show that stimuli intense environments increase the use of spatial strategies and complicate the accessibility as well as the interaction with others. The study finds that people with mental fatigue should fall under the protection of the availability impact act and therefore have a legal right to accessibility promoting actions...|$|E

30|$|Dyslexia is a {{disability}} that causes difficulties {{in reading and}} writing despite average intelligence. This <b>hidden</b> <b>disability</b> often goes undetected since dyslexics are normal and healthy in every other way. Electroencephalography (EEG) {{is one of the}} upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and cons of existing EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia and recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework’s (1) data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3) analysis and (4) classification methods. A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented for the improvement in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks. It was uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only simple tasks, and those unwanted artefacts caused by body movements in the EEG signals during reading and writing activities could be minimised using artefact subspace reconstruction. Further, support vector machine is identified as a promising classifier to be used in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia.|$|E

It makes a significant contribution to <b>hidden</b> <b>disability</b> as many affected patients have long delays in getting a diagnosis or are never diagnosed at all. Doctors involved in the care of babies and children have a unique opportunity to identify children exposed to alcohol in utero, but evidence suggests this is an opportunity frequently missed.
