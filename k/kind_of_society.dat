25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of economics {{begins with the}} identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger’s analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and {{as a means to}} escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.|$|E

A second memorial service, on September 28, the Sunday following the shootings, was held, with the President and students attending. Three members of the congregation lit a further eleven candles (one for each killed, including Saari) at the service.

In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristics—their race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poor—and therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society {{they are about to}} form.|$|E

2500|$|Hayek {{disapproved of}} the notion of 'social justice'. [...] He {{compared}} the market to a game in which 'there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust' and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content'; likewise [...] "the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning". He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: [...] "the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{questions}} {{signal a}} marked break from then-current ideas about human diversity, which assumed {{that some people}} have a history, evident in a historical (or written) record, while other people, lacking writing, also lack history. For some, this distinction between two different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> explained the difference between history, sociology, economics and other disciplines that focus on people with writing, and anthropology, which was supposed to focus on people without writing. Boas rejected this distinction between <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>societies,</b> and this division of labor in the academy. He understood all societies to have a history, and all societies to be proper objects <b>of</b> anthropological <b>society.</b> In order to approach literate and non-literate societies the same way, he emphasized the importance on studying human history through the analysis of other things besides written texts. Thus, in his 1904 article, [...] "The History of Anthropology", Boas wrote that ...|$|R
