Aim: The study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude and practice of FGM among doctors and nurses/midwives practising in public secondary and tertiary hospitals in Bayelsa state. Methods: One hundred and ninety seven (197) structured questionnaires were administered to all available doctors and nurses/midwives in the study hospitals for self-completion. Epi-Info version 3. 5. 1 was used to analyse data. Results: All the respondents were aware of FGM. A higher proportion of nurses/midwives than doctors had ever been asked and had ever treated patients with complications of FGM. More than 90 % of respondents said {{it was not a good}} practice. Out of the 70 female respondents, 19 (27. 1 %) said they were circumcised. Only one nurse/midwife admitted to performing FGM presently.

40|$|Introduction. Female genital cutting (FGC) is a <b>harmful</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>{{practice}}</b> that violates women’s {{rights and}} threatens their health. Although much {{work has been}} done to tackle this practice in Ethiopia, the prevalence remains very high in Somali and Harari regions. This study aims to investigate the attitude towards FGC of young people (boys and girls) in Somali and Harari regions of Eastern Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional quantitative study was carried out in Somali and Harari regions from October to December 2015. Two districts were purposely selected from the two regions, and a stratified random sampling technique was employed to select 480 subjects from the randomly selected schools. Results. Out of 480 questionnaires distributed, 478 (99. 6 %) respondents filled the questionnaires and returned them. The finding of the study reveals that 86 % of study participants condemn the practice of FGC. Almost 59 % of male participants from both study areas preferred to marry uncircumcised girls. Being a female and being a Muslim are significantly associated with the support toward the continuation of the FGC (P< 0. 05). Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{practice}} of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), a deeply-rooted tradition in 28 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, carries important negative {{consequences for the}} health {{and quality of life}} of women and children. Migratory movements have brought this <b>harmful</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>practice</b> to our medical offices, with the subsequent conflicts related to how to approach this healthcare problem, involving not only a purely healthcare-related event but also questions of an ethical, cultural identity and human rights nature. Methods The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the perceptions, degree of knowledge, attitudes and practices of the primary healthcare professionals in relation to FGM. A transversal, descriptive study was performed with a self-administered questionnaire to family physicians, paediatricians, nurses, midwives and gynaecologists. Trends towards changes in the two periods studied (2001 and 2004) were analysed. Results A total of 225 (80 %) professionals answered the questionnaire in 2001 and 184 (62 %) in 2004. Sixteen percent declared detection of some case in 2004, rising three-fold from the number reported in 2001. Eighteen percent stated that they had no interest in FGM. Less than 40 % correctly identified the typology, while less than 30 % knew the countries in which the practice is carried out and 82 % normally attended patients from these countries. Conclusion Female genital mutilations are present in primary healthcare medical offices with paediatricians and gynaecologists having the closest contact with the problem. Preventive measures should be designed as should sensitization to promote stands against these practices. </p...|$|E
40|$|Violence and {{exploitation}} remain a harsh {{reality in the}} lives of many children around the word.   Millions of boys and girls around the world are subject to violence, exploitation and abuse. Some are forced to work under harmful conditions. Others face violence or abuse in their homes, their schools, their communities or in institutional care. In some places children are targets for illegal recruitment by armed groups and armed forces or are forced to flee their homes due to conflict or natural disaster. And millions, especially girls, are subject to sexual violence and abuse as well as harmful traditional practices. This edition of Progress for Children, the eighth in the series that monitors progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), is a compendium of data that serves as a report card on global and national efforts {{to protect the rights of}} children. The report gathers together for the first time data on a range of issues that impact on children, including sexual abuse and trafficking, child marriage, physical punishment of children, child labour, birth registration, the <b>harmful</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>practice</b> of female genital cutting, and attitudes toward violence against women inside marriage. The report finds: More than half of the children in detention worldwide have not been tried or sentenced More than 150 million children between 5 and 14 years of age are engaged in child labour. More than half of woman and girls in developing countries think that wife-beating is acceptable. During the past decade, the number of children in conflict with the law has increased in nearly all countries in East Asia and the Pacific. The report also offers a strategy to improve child protection, identifying five areas of activity that are needed to improve protective environments for children: 1) Improving child protection systems; 2) Promoting social change; 3) Enhancing child protection in emergencies; 4) Strengthening partnerships for greater impact; 5) Collecting reliable data and using such data to achieve concrete results for children.

40|$|The <b>harmful</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>practice</b> {{of child}} {{marriage}} {{remains one of}} the main challenges towards the full realization and enjoyment of children's rights in Africa. In the sub-Saharan Africa alone, countries such as Malawi are faced with the problem of child marriage where as high as 40 % of the women are married as children. Malawi has a substantive legal framework that affords protection and prohibits the harmful practice of child marriage. However, child marriages remain prevalent in Malawi where harmonisation of the laws is problematic. This has the effect of robbing the girl child of her childhood, access education and health among other rights that she is entitled. Addressing this problem in Malawi as a matter of urgency is crucial for the promotion, protection and realisation of children's rights, especially to the girl child. This study therefore conducts an analysis of the legal framework and contextual practice of child marriage in Malawi based on desk research of various laws in Malawi and literature. This analysis is premised on the understanding that human rights law within a legal framework plays a major role towards ensuring that young girls are protected from child marriage and its attendant consequences. This study has found that the laws of Malawi are not synchronised with each other especially with the Malawi Constitution with regard to protecting the rights. The case in point for instance is the recent passing of the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Act which reflects international and regional human rights standards, but is inconsistent with the Constitution of Malawi. It is recommended that Malawi should through the law address the practice of child marriage by amending the Constitution to remove any ambiguities. In this regard, creating a protective legal framework must not be done in vain. This should be supported by effective implementation of national development plans that aim to realise the rights of children, especially the girl child...|$|E

It is associated with health complications and human rights violations. Research on intention for the continuation of FGM and the social determinants underpinning this practice are scarce. Therefore, this study intended to assess the intention of women toward the continuation of FGM among Bale Zone reproductive-age women. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design supplemented by qualitative methods was conducted in 2014. A total of 634 reproductive-age women {{were involved in the}} quantitative part of the study. The respondents were drawn from five randomly selected districts of Bale Zone. The total sample was allocated proportionally to each district {{based on the number of}} reproductive-age women it has. Purposive sampling method was used for qualitative study. Then, data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows version 16. 0. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to examine the existence of a relationship between intentions for the continuation of FGM and selected determinant factors. Results: This study revealed that 26. 7 % of the respondents had intention for the continuation of FGM. Religion, safeguarding virginity, tradition, and social values were the major reasons for the perpetuation of this practice. Circumcised respondents and those who were not able to read and write were ~ 3 (adjusted odds ratio =  2. 89, 95 % confidence interval = [1. 33, 6. 20]) and 7. 58 (adjusted odds ratio =  7. 58, 95 % confidence interval = [3. 47, 16. 54]) times more likely intending the continuation of FGM than uncircumcised and those who attended secondary-level education and above, respectively. Conclusion: The study shows that the intention toward the persistence of the practice is high in Bale Zone.

By tracking the reference values established in former research conducted between 2009 and 2011, the objectives of this study are to explore trends and to measure and assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding FGM/C among health care professionals (HCPs) in The Gambia. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed to collect and analyze data from an overall stratified sample consisting of 1, 288 HCPs including health professionals and students throughout the six regions of The Gambia. Data were collected by the implementation of a self-administered written knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire between 2012 and 2014. Results: The results of this study showed that 76. 4 % of HCPs are eager to abandon FGM/C, and 71. 6 % of them regard it as a harmful practice with negative consequences on life and health. HCPs reported more knowledge and favorable attitudes towards FGM/C abandonment, being better able to identify the practice, more aware of its health complications, and more concerned in their essential role as social agents of change. However, 25. 4 % of HCPs still embraced the continuation of the practice, 24. 4 % expressed intention of subjecting their own daughters to it, and 10. 5 % declared to have performed it within their professional praxis. Conclusion: Findings confirm progress in knowledge and attitudes regarding FGM/C among HCPs, who are better skilled to understand and manage the consequences. Nevertheless, discrepancies between information, intention, and behavior unveil resistance in practice and proves that FGM/C medicalization is increasing. Thus, there is an urgent need to support HCPs in the integration of FGM/C preventive interventions within the public health system, to address arguments favoring medicalization, and to use data to design appropriate strategies.

Its {{prevalence}} in The Gambia is 76. 3 %. The objective {{of this study was}} to gain precise information on the long-term health consequences of FGM/C in The Gambia as well as on its impact on delivery and on the health of the newborns. Methods: Data were collected from 588 female patients examined for antenatal care or delivery in hospitals and health centers of the Western Health Region, The Gambia. The information collected, both through a questionnaire and medical examination, included sociodemographic factors, the presence or not of FGM/C, the types of FGM/C practiced, the long-term health consequences of FGM/C, complications during delivery and for the newborn. Odds ratios, their 95 % confidence intervals, and P values were calculated. Results: The prevalence of patients who had undergone FGM/C was 75. 6 % (type I: 75. 6 %; type II: 24. 4 %). Women with type I and II FGM/C had a significantly higher prevalence of long-term health problems (eg, dysmenorrhea, vulvar or vaginal pain), problems related to anomalous healing (eg, fibrosis, keloid, synechia), and sexual dysfunction. Women with FGM/C were also much more likely to suffer complications during delivery (perineal tear, obstructed labor, episiotomy, cesarean, stillbirth) and complications associated with anomalous healing after FGM/C. Similarly, newborns were found to be more likely to suffer complications such as fetal distress and caput of the fetal head. Conclusion: This study shows that FGM/C is associated with a variety of long-term health consequences, that women with FGM/C are four times more likely to suffer complications during delivery, and the newborn is four times more likely to have health complications if the parturient has undergone FGM/C. These results highlight for the first time the magnitude of consequences during delivery and for the newborn, associated with FGM/C in The Gambia.

This thesis informs understanding of the factors that both perpetuate and inhibit resistance to HTPs. It further provides understanding of the psychological impact of female genital mutilation (FGM) informing both clinical and policy action. Chapter one is a critical review of both quantitative and qualitative literature exploring factors that perpetuate and facilitate resistance to HTPs. Following both database and manual searches, 21 studies were included and reviewed. Women who had experienced or carried out <b>harmful</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>practices</b> of son preference, FGM or child marriage, relate educational status, residential location, economic status, and family history of practising FGM as sociological facets that perpetuate HTPs. Negative health implications and female autonomy are considered factors that facilitated resistance to HTPs, and religion, tradition and patriarchy serve as control mechanisms that inhibit resistance to HTPs. Chapter two is a qualitative research study that explores women survivors’ experiences of FGM and the resultant psychological impact. The development of a theoretical model shows women related lack of knowledge, female identity, religion, culture, role of men, and deception as reasons for the practice of FGM. Experiencing FGM impacted on the physical, identity, emotional, and relational aspects of women’s lives. All of these factors, in addition to women’s resilience, were influenced by key stages of their life including menstruation, sexual intimacy, and having a child, as well as by fear and unmet needs due to insufficient service provision. Chapter three is a reflective account, exploring the challenges encountered throughout the research process, as well as reflecting on issues of counter-transference between the researcher and the participants, their impact, and their management. ...|$|R
