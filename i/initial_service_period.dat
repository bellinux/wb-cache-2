Her first {{recorded}} voyage to Australia {{took place in}} December 1885, carrying eight cabin- and six steerage-class passengers {{in addition to her}} cargoes. Upon arrival in Australia, the ship immediately became embroiled in controversy when The Argus newspaper in Melbourne accused a company responsible for providing some of the ship's cargoes of falsely describing a consignment of 13 tons of bisulphate of carbon, [...] "a chemical of a most volatile and combustible nature", as sheep dip. The firm in question quickly sued the paper for libel, and in August 1887, won damages of £250 in a split jury decision. The Argus however maintained that it had been correct to publish the story, citing public safety and noting that public pressure had since forced the shipping firm in question {{to reduce the amount of}} the chemical shipped in individual vessels.|$|E
40|$|Magnesium, a {{light-weight}} engineering metal, is {{a potential}} biomaterial for orthopaedic biodegradable mini-implant applications due to its compatible mechanical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility. However, magnesium-based implants will become a reality only if the degradation rate of magnesium is controlled. Alloying has shown to reduce the degradation rate of magnesium to some degree, but magnesium alloys are highly susceptible to localized degradation, which can affect the mechanical integrity during service. In orthopaedic applications, mechanical integrity of the implant is a key factor to be considered, especially during the <b>initial</b> <b>service</b> <b>period.</b> Hence, surface modification techniques to delay the general and localized degradation behaviour of magnesium-based materials have gained increased interest in recent years. This chapter reviews the use of biodegradable polymers as coating materials on magnesium-based materials for enhancing the general and localized degradation resistance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Material {{handling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial issues that should be taken into account for eliminating waste and reducing the cost. The purpose of this research is to develop a mathematical model, which will be helpful to construct the routes and determine the service period for the design of milk-run material supply system. The material supply by this system occurs on a just-in-time basis from a central warehouse to several stations. Milk-run material supply system is the round trips are either goods collected from several suppliers and transported to one customer, or goods collected from one supplier and transported to several customers. Besides, it’s intends to construct routes based on an <b>initial</b> <b>service</b> <b>period</b> value and attempts to improve the solution by considering different period values. The most suitable solution is decided on the basis of the least total material handling and inventory holding cost. The objective of the mathematical model is the minimization of the total material handling and inventory holding cost. These saving could be either use for reduction of the product cost, which will boost up the sales or to lift the company profit margin. I...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{establish}} reproductive traits and their heritability during the three successive generations of Holstein-Friesian cattle. Research {{was conducted on the}} duration of pregnancy, <b>service</b> <b>period</b> and fertility intensity. In each generation there were 135 first calved cows. <b>Service</b> <b>period</b> and fertility intensity refers to the following calving. Significant differences were established (P < 0. 05) regarding duration of pregnancy between I and II generation. Significant (P < 0. 05) influence of season on duration of pregnancy and <b>service</b> <b>period</b> was established in I generation (1991), on duration of <b>service</b> <b>period</b> and fertility intensity in II generation (1996) and on duration of pregnancy and <b>service</b> <b>period</b> in III generation (2000). Season effect (summer) was established for all traits of fertility in II generation (P < 0. 05). The season (spring) had influence on duration of pregnancy (P < 0. 05) and summer had an influence on duration of <b>service</b> <b>period</b> and fertility intensity, and winter effected the duration of <b>service</b> <b>period</b> (P < 0. 05) in III generation. Values of heritability coefficients are pretty low for all generations. Considerably greater values for heritability were established for <b>service</b> <b>period</b> and intensity of fertility of cows per generations...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the Power Save Polling mechanism, which was available pre-802.11e, new power save delivery and notification mechanisms have been introduced in 802.11e. APSD (automatic power save delivery) provides two ways to start delivery: ‘scheduled APSD’ (S-APSD) and ‘unscheduled APSD’ (U-APSD). With APSD, multiple frames may be transmitted together by the access point to a power-saving device during a <b>service</b> <b>period.</b> After {{the end of a}} <b>service</b> <b>period,</b> the device enters a doze state until next <b>service</b> <b>period.</b> With S-APSD, <b>service</b> <b>periods</b> start according to a predetermined schedule known to the power-saving device, thus allowing the Access Point to transmit its buffered traffic without the need for any signaling. With U-APSD, whenever a frame is sent to the Access Point, a <b>service</b> <b>period</b> is triggered, which allows the access point to send buffered frames in the other direction. U-APSD can take a ‘full’ U-APSD or ‘hybrid’ U-APSD form. With Full U-APSD, all types of frames use U-APSD independently of their priority. With Hybrid U-APSD, either U-APSD or the legacy Power Save Polling mechanism is used, depending on the access category. S-APSD is available for both channel access mechanisms, EDCA and HCCA, while U-APSD is available only for EDCA.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{deterioration}} on {{the reliability of}} slopes of various <b>service</b> <b>periods</b> has seldom been considered explicitly in the current reliability approach in slope engineering. Constant annual failure probabilities, that are commonly used in practice to evaluate reliability of a slope over a given expected <b>service</b> <b>period,</b> may not be capable of capturing the deteriorating characteristics of slopes. This paper presents a procedure to model probabilistically the deteriorating effect on the failure probability with time. Past performance of geotechnical systems of similar nature is systematically analyzed to evaluate the failure probabilities for systems of different ages and for different expected <b>service</b> <b>periods.</b> The method {{was applied to the}} stability performance of soil cut slopes in Hong Kong. Through this exercise, the reliability of slopes of different ages for different future <b>service</b> <b>periods</b> can be reasonably estimated. As such, a planner can benchmark a design standard and plan a slope improvement program in a more effective and defensible way...|$|R

40|$|Philips is {{a company}} that {{produces}} electronic equipment like kitchen appliances, television sets, videorecorders, medical equipment, and so on. This equipment is sold world-wide. The central service organization of Philips, situated in Eindhoven (The Netherlands), is responsible for providing spare parts for these products during the entire <b>service</b> <b>period.</b> The length of this <b>service</b> <b>period</b> depends on the type of product. Television sets, for instance, have a <b>service</b> <b>period</b> of eight years. Since the <b>service</b> <b>period</b> is typically much longer than the production <b>period,</b> the <b>service</b> department places a large ‘final order’ for spare parts at the moment the product is taken out of production. This final order is expected to suffice, with a sufficiently large probability, until all service obligations have ended. In this paper we seek close to optimal final order quantities. Actually, this paper is a follow-up on a more theoretical paper, in which a close to optimal final order quantity, given by an explicit formula was derived. This paper presents the results of trying to apply that formula in practise...|$|R
