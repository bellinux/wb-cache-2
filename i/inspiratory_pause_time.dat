Changes of VTC 02 were explained by changes in airway dead space and by effects on intra-alveolar gas mixing inversely reflecting alveolar dead space.|$|E
30|$|During {{the bench}} procedure, {{mechanical}} ventilation was set as volume-controlled ventilation with constant flow of 60  l/min; tidal volume of 500  ml; inspiratory time of 0.5  s with <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pause</b> <b>time</b> of 0.5  s; respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min; and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5  cmH 2 O. The inspiratory trigger {{was set at}} − 20  cmH 2 O to avoid auto-triggering. The compliance of the Michigan test lung was set to 20  ml/cmH 2 O. These ventilator and test lung settings produced a plateau airway pressure of approximately 40  cmH 2 O and a chamber pressure of 20  cmH 2 O.|$|E
30|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{prolongation}} of EIP enhances CO 2 elimination and decreases dead space and PaCO 2 levels [14 – 18]. Diffusion of CO 2 is time dependent, and EIP prolongation increases the time available for alveolar gas exchange [14, 23, 24]. Devaquet et al. [18] extended inspiratory time from 0.7  ±  0.2 to 1.4  ±  0.3  s by increasing the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pause</b> <b>time</b> from 0 to 20  % of the total breathing cycle. They observed that this modification significantly decreased both Vd/Vt (around 10  %) and PaCO 2 (around 11  %). Despite these beneficial effects of prolonged EIP and the direct relationship between inspiratory time and enhanced CO 2 elimination [16, 18], EIP prolongation may lead to potentially adverse effects such as PEEPi production and inversion of the I/E ratio together with increases in mean airway pressure. These effects might also provoke hyperinflation, thus altering cardiac performance [25, 26]. Nevertheless, Devaquet and colleagues [18] showed that EIP could be prolonged without significantly increasing PEEPi (I/E ratio 1 : 1.5). Not surprisingly, and in spite of a significant increase in EIP, we did not induce any significant increase in PEEPi since the expiratory time was long enough to avoid air trapping {{at the end of a}} passive expiration (average expiratory time 1.7  ±  0.3  s). Actually (see Table  2), the average product of three time constants (the time needed to passively exhale 96  % of inhaled tidal volume) was in our patients about 1.1  s. (0.373  ×  3  =  1.1  s), well below to the average expiratory time.|$|E

Prospective experimental laboratory study with eight pigs. Induction of acute lung injury with sequential pulmonary lavages and injurious ventilation was initially performed. Then, animals were ventilated on a conventional mechanical ventilator with a respiratory rate (RR) = 60 breaths/minute and PEEP titrated according to ARDS Network table. The first two steps consisted of a randomized order of <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pauses</b> of 10 and 30 % of inspiratory time. In final step, we removed the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pause</b> and titrated PEEP, after lung recruitment, {{with the aid of}} electrical impedance tomography. At each step, PaCO 2 was allowed to stabilize between 57 - 63 mmHg for 30 minutes. The step with RR of 60 after lung recruitment had the highest PEEP when compared with all other steps (17 [16, 19] vs 14 [10, 17]cmH 2 O), but had lower driving pressures (13 [13, 11] vs 16 [14, 17]cmH 2 O), higher P/F ratios (212 [191, 243] vs 141 [105, 184] mmHg), lower shunt (23 [20, 23] vs 32 [27, 49]%), lower dead space ventilation (10 [0, 15] vs 30 [20, 37]%), and a more homogeneous alveolar ventilation distribution. There were no detrimental effects in terms of lung mechanics, hemodynamics, or gas exchange. Neither the addition of <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pauses</b> or the alveolar recruitment maneuver followed by decremental PEEP titration resulted in further reductions in VT. During MHFPPV set with RR of 60 bpm delivered by a conventional ventilator in severe ARDS swine model, neither the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pauses</b> or PEEP titration after recruitment maneuver allowed reduction of VT significantly, however the last strategy decreased driving pressures and improved both shunt and dead space...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Driving airway pressure, the {{difference}} between plateau (end of an <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pause)</b> and end-expiratory airway pressure, can be an independent predictor of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1]. However, during ongoing mechanical ventilation, (dynamic) end-inspiratory airway pressure exceeds (static) plateau airway pressure, especially when inspiratory flows are very high [2]. Thus, for the same static driving airway pressure, different dynamic driving airway pressures can be reached.|$|R

During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that, during mechanical ventilation, an <b>inspiratory</b> <b>pause</b> enhances gas exchange. This {{has been attributed to}} prolonged time during which fresh gas of the tidal volume is present in the respiratory zone and is available for distribution in the lung periphery. The mean distribution time of inspired gas (MDT) is the mean time during which fractions of fresh gas are present in the respiratory zone. All ventilators allow setting of <b>pause</b> <b>time,</b> T-P, which is a determinant of MDT. The objective {{of the present study was}} to test in patients the hypothesis that the volume of CO 2 eliminated per breath, VTCO 2, is correlated to the logarithm of MDT as previously found in animal models. Eleven patients with acute lung injury were studied. When T-P increased from 0 % to 30 %, MDT increased fourfold. A change of T-P from 10 % to 0 % reduced VTCO 2 by 14 %, while a change to 30 % increased VTCO 2 by 19 %. The relationship between VTCO 2 and MDT was in accordance with the logarithmic hypothesis. The change in VTCO 2 reflected to equal extent changes in airway dead space and alveolar PCO 2 read from the alveolar plateau of the single breath test for CO 2. By varying T-P, effects are observed on VTCO 2, airway dead space and alveolar PCO 2. These effects depend on perfusion, gas distribution and diffusion in the lung periphery, which need to be further elucidated...|$|R

We therefore tested the hypothesis that perfusion deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with slower processing, but also with these speech measures. Using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements during the performance of a continuous colour and form-naming task, we found that naming speed was substantially slower in AD patients than in controls. This slower naming was exclusively determined by an increase in mean <b>pause</b> <b>time,</b> and only to a limited extent by articulation <b>time.</b> The increased <b>pause</b> <b>time</b> was uniquely associated with temporo-parietal rCBF reductions of the patients, while articulation was not.
