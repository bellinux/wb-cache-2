Soot loading along the burner length was quantified by acquiring measurements {{first at the}} exit of the full-length combustor and then at upstream stations by sequential removal of liner louvers to shorten the burner length. Alteration of the flow field approaching removed louvers, maintaining a constant liner pressure drop.
