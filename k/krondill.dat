5000|$|In Sweden, dill is {{a common}} spice or herb. The top of fully grown dill is called <b>krondill</b> (English: Crown dill); this is used when cooking {{crayfish}}. The <b>krondill</b> is put into the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is stored in refrigerator for at least 24 hours before eating (with toasted bread and butter). <b>Krondill</b> is also used for cucumber pickles. Small cucumbers, sliced or not, are put into a solution of hot water, mild acetic vinegar (not made from wine and without colour), sugar and <b>krondill.</b> After a month or two, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce and potatoes, as a [...] "sweetener". The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled fresh potatoes (as the first potatoes for the year, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). It is used together with, or instead of other green herbs, like parsley, chives and basil, in salads. It is also often paired up with chives when used in food. Dill {{is often used to}} flavour fish and seafood in Sweden, for example gravlax and various herring pickles, among them the traditional sill i dill (literally [...] "herring in dill"). In contrast to the various fish dishes flavoured with dill, there is also a traditional Swedish dish called dillkött, which is a meaty stew flavoured with dill. The dish commonly contains either pieces of veal or lamb that are boiled until tender and then served together with a vinegary dill sauce. Dill seeds may be used in breads or akvavit. A newer, non-traditional use of dill is paired up with chives as a flavouring of potato chips. This flavour of potato chips called [...] "dillchips" [...] is quite popular in Sweden.|$|E

Afterwards placed in a jar with a sour-sweet brine of vinegar, sugar, dill and mustard seeds. Danish cucumber salad (agurkesalat) is similar, but the cucumbers are not pressed and the brine doesn't have parsley. The cucumber salad accompanies meat dishes, especially a roasted chicken dish (gammeldags kylling med agurkesalat), and is used on Danish hot dogs. There are also [...] "long time pickles", which call for some months of cool storing {{in order to be}} edible. In southern Sweden and Denmark a solution of water, mild acidic vinegar (not made of wine and as clear as water), sugar and the top of dill plants, known as <b>krondill</b> (English: crown dill) and a little salt. In Sweden this is known as [...] "Ättiksgurka" [...] (English: vinegar cucumber) and has a crispy sweet and sour taste. Further north in Sweden some of the acidic vinegar and all the sugar are replaced with more salt. This is known as [...] "saltgurka". Both [...] "ättiksgurka" [...] and [...] "saltgurka" [...] are used as a minor part of certain dishes.|$|E
