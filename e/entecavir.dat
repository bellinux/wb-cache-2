50|$|Patients {{with chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B have antibodies against hepatitis B, but these antibodies {{are not enough}} to clear the infection of the affected liver cells. The continued production of virus combined with antibodies is a likely cause of the immune complex disease seen in these patients. A vaccine is available that will prevent infection from hepatitis B for life. Hepatitis B infections result in 500,000 to 1,200,000 deaths per year worldwide due to the complications of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B is endemic {{in a number of}} (mainly South-East Asian) countries, making cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma big killers. There are six treatment options approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) available for persons with a chronic hepatitis B infection: alpha-interferon, pegylated interferon, adefovir, <b>entecavir,</b> telbivudine, and lamivudine. About 65% of persons on treatment achieve a sustained response.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{there are}} no agents {{available}} with high enough efficacy and safety to fully eradicate HBV. Neither interferon alpha, including standard and pegylated forms, nor nucleotide analogues (including lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and most recently, <b>entecavir)</b> could eradicate HBV covalently-closed-circular DNA in liver cells, which is the replication model for HBV recurrence. However, no agents are available {{to break through the}} host's immune tolerance to HBV, which is another important reason for persistent infection with HBV, although some patients respond well temporarily to administration of interferon and nucleotide analogues alone or in combination regimens. Some traditional Chinese herbs, such as kushenin (Sophora flavescens) and some complex prescriptions, have some efficacy as antivirals and in the protection of liver function, although the specific mechanism and components need to be identified. The current treatment in China is the combination of antiviral agents (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil), immune modulators (interferon alpha, peginterferon alpha, thymosin), and hepatic protectors (such as glycyrrhizin, glucuronolactone). The Chinese spend around Ɲ900 billion (US$110 billion) on these regimens every year. Apart from cost, patients and carriers of HBV infection are often confronted with tough conditions and social pressures, although such discrimination is illegal in China.|$|E
5000|$|The two guanine antivral carbocyclic nucleosides, the anti-HIV agent {{abacavir}} and the anti-hepatitis B agent <b>entecavir,</b> are {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors.

[...] The (-) enantiomer of carbovir was later shown to be the biologically active form for inhibition of HIV. [...] However carbovir’s low aqueous solubility and poor oral bioavailability, as well as inefficient central nervous system penetration prevented it from further developing as an anti-HIV agent.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesHealth care {{decision}} makers are increasingly {{concerned about the}} value of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatments in China. This analysis aims at estimating the relative value of <b>entecavir</b> as a first-line option at treatment initiation and for different treatment durations from a holistic perspective. MethodsCHB was simulated by using a Markov disease transition model with disease states based on available natural history data. The model assumed 5 -year treatment duration with <b>entecavir,</b> lamivudine, telbivudine, and adefovir based on published clinical data. The speed of disease progression varies by viral load and hepatitis B “e” antigen status. Direct medical costs included medication and management of liver complications. The primary output was the estimated cost savings of <b>entecavir</b> per patient per day versus the comparator. ResultsFor treatment duration of 5 years and a follow-up period of 30 years, <b>entecavir</b> treatment was translated into specific patient benefit of an estimated cost saving of $ 2. 69 per day compared with no treatment. In addition, long-term usage of <b>entecavir</b> resulted in daily $ 2. 33 and $ 1. 73 cost saving compared with short-term usage (1 -year and 2 -year, respectively). Among available treatment options in China, <b>entecavir</b> treatment exhibited about $ 0. 90 to $ 1. 81 daily cost saving versus the comparators. The detailed daily cost saving of <b>entecavir</b> is summarized as follows—entecavir versus lamivudine: $ 1. 81, <b>entecavir</b> versus telbivudine: $ 0. 90, <b>entecavir</b> versus adefovir: $ 2. 02, and <b>entecavir</b> versus generic adefovir: $ 1. 37.

40|$|Aims The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the roles of transporters in the renal excretion of <b>entecavir.</b> Main methods We analyzed the effect of probenecid, cimetidine, sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP), verapamil, inhibitors of organic anion transporter (OAT), organic cation transporter (OCT), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP 2) and P-glycoprotein respectively, on the excretion of <b>entecavir.</b> The area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), body clearance, and renal clearance of <b>entecavir</b> was examined in each group. Key findings After intravenous coadministration with <b>entecavir</b> in conscious rats, cimetidine, probenecid, BSP and verapamil significantly increased the AUC of <b>entecavir</b> by 40. 07 %, 48. 78 %, 37. 49 %, and 54. 58 %, and reduced the body clearance by 27. 14 %, 31. 69 %, 29. 79 %, and 42. 17 %, respectively. Then the effects of these inhibitors on the renal clearance of <b>entecavir</b> in unconscious rats were studied. Coadministration of cimetidine and probenecid increased the steady plasma concentration of <b>entecavir</b> by 127. 61 % and 169. 46 %, reduced the renal clearance by 50. 47 % and 67. 76 %, and decreased the excretion ratio by 44. 81 % and 64. 16 % compared to initial values.

In study <b>entecavir</b> (ETV) - 022, 48 weeks of <b>entecavir</b> 0. 5 mg was superior to lamivudine for virologic suppression for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive CHB. A total of 183 entecavir-treated patients from ETV- 022 subsequently enrolled in study ETV- 901. We present the results after up to 5 years (240 weeks) of continuous <b>entecavir</b> therapy. The <b>entecavir</b> long-term cohort consists of patients who received >= 1 year of <b>entecavir</b> 0. 5 mg in ETV- 022 and then entered ETV- 901 with a treatment gap <= 35 days.

For patients with samples available at Year 5, proportions with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA < 300 copies/mL, normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HBeAg loss, and HBeAg seroconversion were determined. In all, 146 patients met criteria {{for inclusion in the}} <b>entecavir</b> long-term cohort. At Year 5, 94 % (88 / 94) had HBV DNA < 300 copies/mL and 80 % (78 / 98) had normal ALT levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The current {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B infection (CHBV) has achieved several step-ups {{thanks to the}} introduction of the new-generation nucleos(t) ide analogs. <b>Entecavir</b> and tenofovir have shown a high genetic resistance barrier and a low rate of side effects. In literature, there are a few studies comparing <b>entecavir</b> and tenofovir in the {{treatment of}} CHBV. Thus, we describe the results of our experience in managing CHBV patients with tenofovir vs. <b>entecavir.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively evaluated, from 2007 to date, 20 CHBV patients treated with <b>entecavir</b> and tenofovir. All the patients underwent basal and periodical clinical follow-up, blood tests, virological tests, Fibroscan® test or liver biopsy and also upper abdominal ultrasound examination. Study endpoints were: viral replication inhibition, viral antigens seroconversion and transaminases normalization. Drug-associated side effects were also registered. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of therapy, <b>entecavir</b> and tenofovir lead to HBV-DNA negativization in 44 % and 62 % of patients, respectively.
