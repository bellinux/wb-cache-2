40|$|The {{solidification}} process of CV graphite cast iron {{was investigated in}} <b>hypoeutectic</b> <b>iron</b> melts which were treated with Fe-Si-Mg alloy, solidified as white cast irons by metal mold casting and then remelted under the identical heating conditions.

The action of Mg is more effective in very small amounts for the eutectic solidification than the primary solidification. Small spheroidal graphite forms {{at the start of}} the first eutectic reaction occured at high temperature than that of the usual graphite-austenite eutectic reaction, and the CV graphite generates and grows on the speroidal graphite as a starting point in the second eutectic reaction.

40|$|In this work, {{the metal}} and slag phase mixing in {{three steps of}} a ladle {{refining}} operation of steel melts and for an oxygen balance during cooling of cast iron melts have been studied at two Swedish steel plants and at two Swedish cast iron foundries, respectively. In order to predict the oxygen activity in the steel bulk in equilibrium with the top slag {{as well as in}} metal droplets in the top slag in equilibrium with the top slag, three slag models were used. In addition, the assumptions of a sulphur-oxygen equilibrium between steel and slag and the dilute solution model for the liquid steel phase were utilized in the calculations. Measured oxygen activities in steel bulk, which varied between 3. 5 - 6 ppm, were compared to predicted oxygen activities. The differences between the predicted and measured oxygen activities were found to be significant (0 - 500 %) and the reasons for the differences are discussed in the thesis. Slag samples have been evaluated to determine the distribution of the metal droplets. The results show that the relatively largest numbers of metal droplets are present in the slag samples taken before vacuum degassing. Also, the projected interfacial area between steel bulk and top slag has been compared to the interfacial area between the metal droplets and slag. The results show that the droplet-slag interfacial area is 3 to 14 times larger than the flat projected interfacial area between the steel and top slag. Furthermore, the effect of the reactions between top slag and steel and the slag viscosity on the metal droplet formation is discussed. The results show significant differences between the steel bulk and steel droplet compositions and the reasons for the differences are discussed in the thesis. The oxygen activity in different cast irons was studied. Plant trials were performed at three occasions for lamellar, compacted and nodular iron melts. The results show that at temperatures close to the liquidus temperature the oxygen activities were 0. 03 - 0. 1 ppm for LGI, around 0. 02 ppm for CGI, and 0. 001 ppm for SGI. In addition, it was found that as the oxygen activities increased with time after an Mg treatment, the ability to form a compact graphite or a nodular graphite in Mg-treated iron melts was decreased. Also, extrapolated oxygen activity differences up to 0. 07 ppm were found for different <b>hypoeutectic</b> <b>iron</b> compositions for lamellar graphite iron at the liquidus temperature. Overall, the observed differences in the dissolved oxygen levels were believed to influence how graphite particles are incorporated into the austenite matrix and how the graphite morphology will be in the cast product.

The <b>hypoeutectic</b> white cast <b>irons</b> with 2. 92 … 3. 35 % carbon content and additionally alloyed by 3. 18 % vanadium have been used as the research materials. The mentioned alloys have been pre-heat treated and hot twist tested. Findings. The research results showed that the carbide net breaking by plastic deforming leads to cast irons mechanical properties increasing but has difficulties in implementation due to the white cast irons low plasticity. The influence of different pre-heat treatment modes on structure and plasticity of white <b>hypoeutectic</b> cast <b>irons</b> have been investigated. They include the isotherm soaking under the different temperatures as well as multiply soakings and thermo-cycling. The influence of eutectic level, as well as pre heat treatment modes on different composition white cast irons hot plasticity have been investigated. Originality. It was determined that the heat treatment, which leads to double α→γ recrystallization under 860 – 950 °С and reperlitization under 720 - 680 °С results in significant increase of plasticity, as well as in un-alloyed and alloyed by vanadium white cast irons. It takes place due to carbide matrix phase separation in ledeburite colonies by new phase boundaries forming especially due to carbide transformations under vanadium alloying. Practical value.

40|$|Most lost-foam casting {{processes}} involve non-equilibrium solidification {{dominated by}} kinetic factors, while {{construction of a}} common dynamic solidification curve is based on pure thermodynamics, not applicable for analyses and research of non-equilibrium macro-solidification processes, and the construction mode can not be applied to non-equilibrium solidification process. In this study, {{the construction of the}} dynamic solidification curve (DSC) for the non-equilibrium macro-solidification process included: a modified method to determine the start temperature of primary austenite precipitation (TAL) and the start temperature of eutectic solidification (TES); double curves method to determine the temperature of the dendrite coherency point of primary austenite (TAC) and the temperature of eutectic cells collision point (TEC); the “technical solidus” method to determine the end temperature of eutectic reaction (TEN). For this purpose, a comparative testing of the non-equilibrium solidification temperature fields in lost-foam casting and green sand mold casting <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray <b>iron</b> was carried out. The thermal analysis results were used to construct the DSCs of both these casting methods under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. The results show that the transformation rate of non-equilibrium solidification in <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray cast <b>iron</b> is greater than that of equilibrium solidification. The eutectic solidification region presents a typical mushy solidification mode. The results also indicate that the primary austenite precipitation zone of lost-foam casting is slightly larger than that of green sand casting. At the same time, the solid fraction (fs) of the dendrite coherency points in lost-foam casting is greater than that in the green sand casting. Therefore, from these two points, lost-foam casting is more preferable for reduction of shrinkage and mechanical burnt-in sand tendency of the <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray cast <b>iron.</b> Due {{to the fact that the}} solidification process (from the surface to center) at primary austenite growth area in the lost-foam cylinder sample lags behind that in the green sand casting, the mushy solidification tendency of lost-foam casting is greater and the solidification time is longer...|$|R

After being heated to the semisolid state at 1160 degrees C and 1180 degrees C and held at these temperatures for 0, 30, 60 and 90 s, the samples were subjected to the thixoforming process. The holding time in the semisolid range simulates the industrial heating process, which is time controlled rather than temperature controlled. The {{results indicate that the}} forces applied during thixoforming are closely related to the liquid fraction of the <b>hypoeutectic</b> gray cast <b>iron.</b> A comparative analysis of the behavior of the tensile properties, Vickers microhardness and porosity before and after thixoforming was carried out. The stress-strain curves were similar for the different liquid fractions studied: at 1160 degrees C the average values were YE = 282 MPa, UTS = 289 MPa, E = 0. 21 % and Vickers microhardness = 274 HV, while at 1180 degrees C the corresponding figures were YE = 272 MPa, UTS = 277 MPa, E = 0. 2 % and Vickers microhardness = 257 HV.

The results indicated that under the proper agitating temperatures and speeds applied, the dendrite structures in white cast iron slurry were gradually evolved into spherical structures during a certain agitating time. It also revealed that the bent dendrites were formed by either convection force or by the growth of the dendrites themselves in the bending direction; then, as they were in solidifying, they were gradually being alternated into separated particles and into more spherical structures {{at the end of the}} isothermal cooling process. Especially, the dendrites were granulated as the bending process proceeding, which suggested that they were caused by unwanted elements such as sulfur and phosphor usually contained in engineering cast iron. Convective flow of the melt caused corrosion on the dendritic segments where they were weaker in strength and lower in melting temperature because of higher concentration of sulfur or phosphor. And the granulation process for such dendrites formed in the melt became possible under the condition.

40|$|Automotive {{industry}} products portfolio {{includes a}} wide variety of complex‐shaped cast iron products, such as truck engine components, that need to withstand a constant trend of higher demands, especially urged by stricter environmental regulations on emissions. Combined with this continued demand on properties improvement, cast iron industry faces a process problem related to the lack of understanding of solidification and mechanisms behind defect formation. Casting products are highly affected by the product design and the manufacturing method itself, which governs the final microstructure and hence the final mechanical properties. Wall thickness of the moulding material strongly influences the solidification time, varying the microstructural coarseness, resulting in a component with different properties depending on the local shape of the casting. The main objective of this work is the characterization of the primary austenite microstructure and its coarsening process, which has been poorly documented in cast iron literature, to allow the prediction and control of these microstructural features present in the casting. The microstructural evolution of the primary austenite in <b>hypoeutectic</b> lamellar graphite <b>iron</b> (LGI) is studied under isothermal coarsening conditions. The dendritic microstructure suffered major morphological changes that included dendrite fragmentation, globularization, and coalescence. Empirical relations based on morphological parameters are introduced to predict the microstructural evolution of primary austenite. A novel technique for colour‐etching and semi‐automatic image analysis for the characterization of quenched dendritic microstructures in cast iron is presented.

40|$|The {{avoidance}} of shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration defects {{as well as}} the control of the size and number of eutectic colonies and the tensile properties of the casting are issues of major importance in the production of lamellar cast iron. These defects, characteristics and properties are related to the microstructure that develops during solidification. An improved control of this features derive from our understanding of how the microstructure changes until its final state and our capacity to accurately measure such changes. The aim of this work is to enhance such understanding in <b>hypoeutectic</b> grey cast <b>iron</b> and provide experimental and analytical techniques to facilitate a deeper investigation of the solidification phenomena. Interrupted solidification, natural solidification, direct austempering after solidification treatment, cooling curve analysis, Fourier thermal analysis, different etching reagents, non-standard image processing techniques and stereological relations are combined {{for the first time to}} study the development of the microstructure from the beginning of the solidification to the as-cast state. Stereological relations are successfully combined with bi-dimensional observations to approximate tri-dimensional parameters of the microstructure in single or multiple sections analysis. The fundamental phenomenon of the coarsening of the primary phase (reduction of the primary austenite surface) and the increase of the secondary dendrite arm spacing are observed to occur prior, during and after the eutectic solidification in different cooling conditions. The validity of the secondary dendrite arm spacing as a measure of coarsening is assessed. The ease of flow for the interdendritic melt is characterized in terms of the hydraulic diameter of the interdendritic phase, which captures the improved flow conditions during the eutectic phase. The change of and interdependence between the inverse surface area per unit volume, secondary dendrite arm spacing, the cube root of time, solidification time, eutectic colony diameter and cooling rate {{as well as the}} change of fraction of primary austenite is presented.

40|$|This thesis work {{deals with}} the volume changes during the {{solidification}} of cast irons and peritectic steels. The volume changes in casting metals {{are related to the}} expansion and/or contraction of the molten metal during solidification. Often, different types of shrinkage, namely macro- and micro-shrinkage, affect the casting quality. In addition to that, exposure of the metal casting to higher contraction or expansion during the solidification might also be related to internal strain development in samples, which eventually leads to surface crack propagation in some types of steel alloys during continuous casting. In consequence, a deep understanding of the mechanisms and control of the solidification will improve casting quality and production. All of the experiments during the entire work were carried out on laboratory scale samples. Displacement changes during solidification were measured {{with the help of a}} Linear Variable Displacement Transformer (LVDT). All of the LVDT experiments were performed on samples inside a sand mould. Simultaneously, the cooling curves of the respective samples during solidification were recorded with a thermocouple. By combining the displacement and cooling curves, the volume changes was evaluated and later used to explain the influence of inoculants, carbon and cooling rates on volume shrinkages of the casting. <b>Hypoeutectic</b> grey cast <b>iron</b> (GCI) and nodular cast iron (NCI) with hypo-, hyper- and eutectic carbon compositions were considered in the experiments from cast iron group. High nickel alloy steel (Sandvik Sanbar  64) was also used from peritectic steel type. These materials were melted inside an induction furnace and treated with different types of inoculants before and during pouring in order to modify the composition. Samples that were taken from the LVDT experiments were investigated using a number of different  methods in order to support the observations from the displacement measurements:  Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), to evaluate the different phase present; Dilatometry, to see the effect of cooling rates on contraction for the various types of alloys; metallographic studies with optical microscopy; Backscattered electrons (BSE) analysis on SEM S- 3700 N, to investigate the different types of oxide and sulphide nuclei; and bulk density measurements  by applying Archimedes' principle. Furthermore, the experimental volume expansion during solidification was compared with the theoretically calculated values for GCI and NCI. It was found that the casting shows hardly any shrinkage during early solidification in GCI, but in the eutectic region the casting expands until the end of solidification. The measured and the calculated volume changes are close to one another, but the former shows more expansion. The addition of MBZCAS (Si, Ca, Zr, Ba, Mn and Al) promotes more flake graphite, and ASSC (Si, Ca, Sr and Al) does not increase the number of eutectic cells by much. In addition to that, it lowers the primary austenite fraction, promotes more eutectic growth and decreases undercooled graphite and secondary dendritic arm spacing (SDAS). As a result, the volume expansion changes in the eutectic region. The expansion during the eutectic growth increase with an increase in the inoculant weight percentage. At the same time, the eutectic cells become smaller and increase in number. The effect of the inoculant and the superheat temperature shows a variation in the degree of expansion/contraction and the cooling rates for the experiments. Effective inoculation tends to homogenize the eutectic structure, reducing the undercooled and interdendritic graphite throughout the structure. In NCI experiments, it was found that the samples showed no expansion in the transversal direction due to higher micro-shrinkages in the centre, whereas in the longitudinal direction the samples shows expansion until solidification was complete.    The theoretical and measured volume changes agreed with each other. The austenite fraction and number of micro-shrinkage pores decreased with increase in carbon content. The nodule count and distribution changes with carbon content. The thermal contraction of NCI is not influenced by the variation in carbon content at lower cooling rates. The structural analysis and solidification simulation results for NCI show that the nodule size and count distribution along the cross-sections at various locations are different due to the variation in cooling rates and carbon concentration. Finer nodule graphite appears in the thinner sections and close to the mold walls. A coarser structure is distributed mostly in the last solidified location. The simulation result indicates that finer nodules are associated with higher cooling rate and a lower degree of microsegregation, whereas the coarser nodules are related to lower cooling rate and a higher degree of microsegregation. As a result, this structural variation influences the micro-shrinkage in different parts. The displacement change measurements show that the peritectic steel expands and/or contracts during the solidification. The primary austenite precipitation during the solidification in the metastable region is accompanied by gradual expansion on the casting sides. Primary δ-ferrite precipitation under stable phase diagram is complemented by a severe contraction during solidification. The microstructural analysis reveals that the only difference between the samples is grain refinement with Ti addition. Moreover, the severe contraction in solidification region might be the source for the crack formation due to strain development, and further theoretical analysis is required in the future to verify this observation.
