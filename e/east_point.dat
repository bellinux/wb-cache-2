5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to <b>East</b> <b>Point,</b> Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta.

Although two parties expressed interest in the station during the frequency change stage (individual Clifton Thomas of Jackson and Dain Schult Radioactivity, Inc. of <b>East</b> <b>Point,</b> Georgia), a local third contender, Gordon ("Jerry") J. Lousteau, Jr., of WMGO 1370 AM in Canton {{was the only person}} that responded to the FCC's public notice, and therefore his WMGO Broadcasting Corporation was granted the license.

25|$|The {{table of}} {{secondary}} schools below, {{and links to}} individuals schools, shows that OFSTED concerns about standards across the chain as a whole were also mirrored in concerns about individual academies and parliamentarians such as Lord Watson of Invergowrie have queried publicly the number of AET academies with individual warning notices stating {{the need to improve}} standards urgently. When schools have been removed from AET and given to other Academy chains, exam results have been seen to improve. For example, at <b>East</b> <b>Point</b> Academy results rose from 32% 5 GCSE A-C (including English and Maths) which was the nadir of a 3-year set of declining results. Upon being taken over by a new Academy Trust, exam results immediately rose to 36%.|$|E
25|$|In the Western Conference, {{the race}} was tight. Allen Iverson, {{formerly}} the seven-time <b>East</b> <b>point</b> guard starter, moved to Denver from Philadelphia, attracting votes from reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash. But surprisingly, neither of the two was voted in; both were reserves as swingman Tracy McGrady came {{in the back door}} win. Dirk Nowitzki, another player who analysts predicted that would be starting, was not able to muster enough votes to get over former MVP Kevin Garnett's 1,600,000, but was put in by coaches as a reserve and later added to the starting lineup by West coach Mike D'Antoni. Tim Duncan was also voted in as a forward. Carmelo Anthony, the star small forward for the Nuggets, was not voted in as a starter or reserve, contrary to earlier reports that head coaches from the conference would put him in the lineup despite being involved in a brawl, but was allowed as a reserve (because Carlos Boozer was injured). Mehmet Okur of the Utah Jazz and Ray Allen of the Seattle Sonics were chosen by Stern to replace the injured Nash and Iverson.|$|E

25|$|The Surprise sails to the {{farthest}} <b>east</b> <b>point</b> of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS Norfolk pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in {{an affair with}} Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will {{not interfere with the}} pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, Surprise retakes the packet Danaë, with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the Danae back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. Surprise rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the Juan Fernández Islands to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, Surprise retakes the valuable whaler Acapulco with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the Norfolks captain. Mr Allen negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, where the American prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.|$|E
500|$|... “Thumbelina” is {{essentially}} Andersen’s invention but takes {{inspiration from the}} traditional tale of [...] "Tom Thumb" [...] (both tales begin with a childless woman consulting a supernatural being about acquiring a child). [...] Other inspirations were the six-inch Lilliputians in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver's Travels, Voltaire‘s short story, “Micromégas“ with its cast of huge and miniature peoples, and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s hallucinatory, erotic tale [...] "Meister Floh" [...] in which a tiny lady a span in height torments the hero. A tiny girl figures in Andersen‘s prose fantasy [...] "A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the <b>East</b> <b>Point</b> of Amager" [...] (1828), and a literary image similar to Andersen’s tiny being inside a flower is found in E.

He ran unopposed in the November 2, 2004 general election, and he also ran unopposed in his 2006 and 2008 primary and general elections.|$|E
