25|$|Sildenafil (Viagra). Concomitant {{administration}} of <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate and sildenafil (Viagra) or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate {{with the potential}} result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isosorbide</b> mononitrate is a nitrate-class drug {{used for}} the {{prophylactic}} treatment of angina pectoris; that is, it is taken {{in order to prevent}} or at least reduce the occurrence of angina. Research on <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate as a cervical ripener to reduce time at hospital to birth is supportive.|$|E
25|$|Propranolol. The {{addition}} of <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate to propranolol treatment {{in patients with}} cirrhosis and portal hypertension caused a marked fall in portal pressure, a reduction in hepatic blood flow, cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure, but no additional change in azygos blood flow. The additional effect of <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate was especially evident in patients whose portal pressure was not reduced by propranolol.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reactions}} {{that have been}} reported with <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate modified-release tablets include tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea, vertigo, and heartburn.|$|E
25|$|Sulfhydryl-containing compounds. The {{metabolism}} {{of organic}} nitrates to nitric oxide {{is dependent on}} the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle. The combination of oral N-acetylcysteine and a single dose of sustained-release <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate 60nbsp&mg significantly prolonged the total exercise time in patients with angina pectoris and angiographically proven significant coronary artery disease, when compared with <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate alone. Concomitant administration of other exogenous sources of sulfhydryl groups such as methionine and captopril may produce a similar interaction.|$|E
25|$|Common: Tiredness, sleep {{disturbances}} (6%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (6%) {{have been reported}} during clinical trials with <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate modified-release tablets, but at a frequency no greater than for placebo. Hypotension (4 to 5%), poor appetite (2.5%), nausea (1%).|$|E
25|$|Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists. The {{addition}} of a calcium channel blocker of the verapamil type, such as gallopamil 75nbsp&mg, {{has been shown to}} further improve left ventricular functional parameters when given in combination with <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate in a sustained-release formulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of <b>isosorbide</b> dinitrate/hydralazine {{is the only}} vasodilator regimen, other than ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with proven survival benefits. This combination appears to be particularly beneficial in CHF patients with an African American background, who respond less effectively to ACEI therapy.|$|E
25|$|The FDA {{approval}} of the drug BiDil (<b>isosorbide</b> dinitrate/hydralazine) with a label specifying African-Americans with congestive heart failure, produced a storm of controversy over race-based medicine and fears of genetic stereotyping, even though the label for BiDil did not specify any genetic variants but was based on racial self-identification.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} {{significant}} varices or cirrhosis nonselective Î²-blockers {{reduce the risk}} of future bleeding. With a target heart rate of 55beats per minute they reduce the absolute risk of bleeding by 10%. Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is also effective at improving outcomes. Either B-blockers or EBL are recommended as initial preventative measures. In those who have had a previous varcial bleed both treatments are recommended. With some evidence supporting the addition of <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate. Testing for and treating those who are positive for H. pylori is recommended. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may be used to prevent bleeding in people who re-bleed despite other measures.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), <b>isosorbide</b> mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Isosorbide</b> mononitrate {{is a drug}} used principally in the {{treatment}} of angina pectoris and acts by dilating the blood vessels so as to reduce the blood pressure. It is sold in the USA by Kremers Urban under the trade name Monoket, also sold in the USA under the name Imdur, and marketed in the UK under the trade names: Monosorb, Chemydur. [...] In India, this drug is available under the brand names of Ismo, Isonorm, Monotrate, Solotrate, and Monit. In Russia it is occasionally used under the brand names Monocinque and Pektrol.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{therapy for}} {{nutcracker}} esophagus includes {{the use of}} calcium-channel blockers, which relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and palliate the dysphagia symptoms. [...] Diltiazem, a calcium-channel blocker, {{has been used in}} randomized control studies with good effect. [...] Nitrate medications, including <b>isosorbide</b> dinitrate, given before meals, may also help relax the LES and improve symptoms. [...] The inexpensive generic combination of belladonna and phenobarbital (Donnatal and other brands) may be taken three times daily as a tablet to prevent attacks or, for patients with only occasional episodes, as an elixir at the onset of symptoms. [...] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil, can be given to reduce symptoms, particularly pain, but small trials {{have not been able to}} demonstrate clinical improvement. [...] Finally, trazodone, an antidepressant that reduces visceral sensitivity, has also been shown to reduce chest pain symptoms in patients with nutcracker esophagus.|$|E

Other isosorbide-based medicines are used as osmotic diuretics and for treatment of esophageal varices. Like other nitric oxide donors (see biological functions of nitric oxide), these drugs lower portal pressure by vasodilation and decreasing cardiac output. <b>Isosorbide</b> dinitrate and hydralazine are the two components of the anti-hypertensive drug <b>isosorbide</b> dinitrate/hydralazine (Bidil).|$|E
