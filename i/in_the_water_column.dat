Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|In stream {{communities}}, few animal groups became extinct {{because such}} communities rely less directly on food from living plants {{and more on}} detritus that washes in from the land, buffering them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns {{have been found in}} the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers, can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous.|$|E

In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
30|$|The {{simulated}} sand deposits thickness increase {{near the}} steeper slope topography (hill) that stops the tsunami for inundating farther inland.

Comparison of bed changes using the three topography shows that the sand layer is distributed more smoothly when using milder topographic slope.

5|$|Teleosts may spawn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners {{are mostly}} limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards {{the surface and}} release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators {{and allow them to}} {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish.

The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> but not a cloaca.

It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E
40|$|Glycerol dialkyl {{glycerol}} tetraether (GDGT) compositions of {{suspended particulate}} matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> of two anoxic marine settings, the Black Sea and Cariaco Basin, were analyzed to better define the sources of GDGTs in marine environments. <b>In</b> deep anoxic <b>waters</b> <b>the</b> enhanced abundance of the conventional branched GDGTs (B-GDGTs) and recently introduced overly- and sparsely branched GDGTs (OB- and SB-GDGTs, respectively) indicated their in situ production by presently unidentified planktonic microorganisms favoring anoxic environment. The elevated concentrations of these branched GDGTs in anoxic waters were accompanied {{by an increase in}} their degree of methylation. Such a change in lipid composition may reflect either a microbial community shift or a physiological response of the source organism(s) to redox conditions, but nonetheless, confirms <b>the</b> <b>in</b> situ production of branched GDGTs in anoxic marine settings. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> B-GDGTs, which have originally been assumed to be of terrestrial origin, OB- and SB-GDGTs in marine sediments are more likely of anoxic marine origin. This notion is supported by a shelf-to-basin transect of surface sediments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea, <b>in</b> which OB- and SB-GDGTs were restricted to distal sediments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central anoxic basin. Even though the OB-, B- and SB-GDGTs are presumed to have related molecular structures, B-GDGTs were the only group that contained cyclopentane rings. The distribution of cycloalkylated vs. non-cycloalkylated B-GDGTs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>columns</b> of both <b>the</b> Black Sea and Cariaco Basin and surface sediments of the Black Sea suggests a primarily terrestrial origin for the cycloalkylated B-GDGTs but a mixed contribution from both terrestrial and marine sources for non-cycloalkylated B-GDGTs...|$|R

5|$|With {{a sizable}} oily liver and low-density tissues, the Pacific {{electric}} ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> {{with very little}} effort.

It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E
5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E
50|$|The Great Pacific garbage patch {{has one of}} {{the highest}} levels known of plastic {{particulate}} suspended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> As a result, it is one of several oceanic regions where researchers have studied the effects and impact of plastic photodegradation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neustonic layer of water.

This process continues down to the molecular level.As the plastic flotsam photodegrades into smaller and smaller pieces, it concentrates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> As it disintegrates, the plastic ultimately becomes small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near <b>the</b> ocean's surface. <b>In</b> this way, plastic may become concentrated in neuston, thereby entering the food chain.|$|R

The δ^(56) Fe profile {{is very different from the}} iron concentration profile; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>column</b> [Fe] is variable while δ^(56) Fe is relatively constant, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deeper <b>water</b> <b>column</b> δ^(56) Fe varies while [Fe] remains relatively constant.

The dissimilarity between δ^(56) Fe profiles and profiles of [Fe] and other hydrographic tracers shows that Fe isotope ratios provide a unique sort of information about ocean chemistry, and they suggest that Fe isotopes may therefore be a valuable new tool for tracing the global sources, sinks, and biogeochemical cycling of Fe...|$|R

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column,</b> because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> feed on diatoms {{or other}} phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients {{stored in the}} yolk of the egg where {{the main energy source}} is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E
40|$|Bottom {{trawling}} represents nowadays one of {{the most}} severe anthropogenic disturbances at sea, and determines large impacts on benthic communities and processes. Bottom trawling determines also local sediment resuspension and the effects of the injection of large amounts of surface sediments into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> have been repeatedly investigated. Few studies have assessed the consequences of sediment resuspension caused by bottom trawling on the quantity, biochemical composition and bioavailability of suspended organic particles and how these eventually rival those exerted by natural storms. To provide insights on this poorly addressed issue, we investigated concentrations and biochemical composition of total and enzymatically digestible pools of particulate organic matter (POM) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thermaikos Gulf (Mediterranean Sea) under calm sea conditions, during intensive trawling activities, and after a severe storm. We show here that sediment resuspension caused by trawling can cause large effects on POM quantity, biochemical composition and bioavailability. Both during trawling and after the storm, the relative importance of the carbohydrate pools increased (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>column)</b> and <b>the</b> total lipid concentrations decreased (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> intermediate and bottom layers) when compared to values measured during calm conditions. These results would suggest that bottom trawling could inject <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>column</b> POM pools more refractory in nature (e. g., carbohydrates) than those present in calm or after-storm conditions. By contrast, we show also that the bioavailable fraction of biopolymeric C increased significantly during trawling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>column</b> of <b>the</b> shallowest stations and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>water</b> <b>column</b> layer of <b>the</b> deepest ones. These results provide evidence that bottom trawling can influence the overall trophic status of coastal waters, exerting effects similar or stronger than those caused by natural storms, though of variable amplitude depending on <b>the</b> <b>water</b> depth. Since bottom trawling is carried out worldwide and natural storms at sea can be frequent and intense, we claim for the need of assessing new adapting management strategies of bottom trawling in order to mitigate the synergistic impacts of anthropogenic and natural sediment resuspension on coastal biogeochemical cycles...|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months.

40|$|Shallow {{lakes and}} ponds, {{including}} those {{commonly found in}} agricultural landscapes are often only a few metres deep, with surface areas < 1 ha. Despite this, landscapes may contain {{a high number of}} these ponds, amounting to a considerable cumulative surface area. Many of these features, both naturally formed and man-made, receive and trap runoff with high nutrient and sediment loadings. As such, the potential for the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through biogeochemical cycling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pond sediments may be significant. Furthermore, the abundance of available nutrients coupled with the shallow physical characteristics of these systems, mean that short, irregular eutrophic episodes during the summer are common, causing large fluctuations in th oxygen content of <b>the</b> overlying <b>water</b> <b>column.</b> <b>The</b> oxygen content of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>column</b> is often cited as key factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of GHGs in large lake and reservoir systems. Given the limited research focusing on shallow ponds/lakes, and potential for these systems to be important sources of GHGs, the impacts of variable water oxygen content should be investigated. Here we present the results from a sediment microcosm experiment utilising sediment cores from an agricultural pond system in Cumbria, UK. Intact sediment cores were incubated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark at in-situ temperature and continuously fed with filtered pond water for 2 weeks.

These results indicate that while representing a significant cumulative carbon store in agricultural landscapes, shallow pond and lake systems can contribute to emission of GHGs.
