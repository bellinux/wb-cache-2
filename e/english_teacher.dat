40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to examine how nonnative English teachers' identity constructions develop and influence their pedagogy in U. S. higher education. The research on nonnative <b>teachers</b> of <b>English</b> has not adequately explored their identity constructions. This study relied on a phenomenological case study approach that analyzed the lived experience of nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers</b> in relation to wider language ideologies and practices. Data were generated from spring 2003 to fall 2003 through phenomenological in-depth interviews, classroom observations, questionnaires, and autobiographical accounts of research participants. The data were primarily analyzed {{through the use of}} the constant comparative method. The study reveals that identity construction among nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers,</b> with its dynamic and contradictory nature, remains challenging, changing, and growing over time in relations of wider language ideologies and practices. Thus, the findings reject a fixed, unitary, and monolithic view on the identity construction of nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers.</b> In terms of the study's practical and pedagogical implications, university programs should know that nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers</b> can practice mutual accommodation through which both nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers</b> and their students can collaborate in order to improve the learning of English and enrich diversity within U. S. higher education. University programs should also focus more on what nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers</b> can do in collaboration with native <b>English</b> <b>teachers.</b> Finally, this study suggests that language educators should explore the role nonnative <b>English</b> <b>teachers</b> play in language pedagogy in an era of the global spread of English that produces highly proficient nonnative English speaking professionals...|$|R
