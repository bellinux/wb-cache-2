25|$|An {{additional}} use of unibits is <b>deburring</b> holes left {{by other}} bits, as the sharp increase {{to the next}} step size allows the cutting edge to scrape burrs off the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the straight flute is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral twist drill bit turning at high speed.|$|E
25|$|Cleansing and polishing: Walnut shells {{are mostly}} used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This {{environmentally}} friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive {{is well suited}} for air blasting, <b>deburring,</b> descaling, and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In {{the early days of}} jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used to scour the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with air cooled vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.|$|E

2500|$|Part separation: A very {{important}} {{function of the}} medium is to separate parts during the <b>deburring,</b> cutting, surface improving or burnishing operations. [...] The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a vibratory or tumble finishing operation.

5000|$|Because {{they operate}} at low {{pressure}} {{and rely on}} gravity to move fluids (and entrained solids), drain-waste-vent systems use fittings whose interior surfaces are as smooth as possible. The fittings may be [...] "belled" [...] (expanded slightly in diameter) or otherwise shaped to accommodate the insertion of pipe or tubing without forming a sharp interior ridge that might catch debris or accumulate material, and cause a clog or blockage. Freshly cut ends of pipe segments are carefully <b>deburred</b> to remove projecting slivers of material which may snag debris (such as hair or fibers) which can build up to cause blockages.

2500|$|Filing is {{combination}} of grinding and saw tooth cutting using a file. Prior {{to the development}} of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces. [...] The skilled use of a file allowed a machinist to work to fine tolerances and was the hallmark of the craft. [...] Files can vary in shape, coarseness, and whether the teeth or single cut or double cut depending on what application the file is to be used for. Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in industry, though it remains as a common method of <b>deburring.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>deburring</b> processes, {{but the most}} common are mass-finishing, spindle finishing, media blasting, sanding, grinding, wire brushing, {{abrasive}} flow machining, electrochemical <b>deburring,</b> electropolishing, thermal energy method, machining, and manual <b>deburring.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the same}} {{properties}} {{that make it}} a good solvent for oils also make it a good solvent of undesired things left behind during the manufacturing of a unit. Some of which are: dust, dirt, residue from soldering, small bits of metal from cutting, and oxidized metal from the tubing. The residues collected can clog the system filters and cause excessive wear or damage to critical components such as the vanes or valves. This aspect makes it more important to check that components are machined properly, <b>deburred,</b> and cleaned. Another problem with these oils {{is that they are}} hygroscopic in nature, which means they can absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Hence, technicians working with units that have to be opened, should leave the unit open for as little time as required.|$|R
50|$|Remedial {{measures}} for impingement attack include {{modifications to the}} system to reduce the average water velocity, e.g. by using larger diameter tubes or, if appropriate, to lower the pump speed, and/or to redesign {{the part of the}} installation concerned to eliminate the cause of local turbulence, e.g. by using slow or swept bends and tee fittings rather than elbows and square tees. It is important to minimise the possibility of any local turbulence occurring by ensuring that the ends of tubes cut with a tube cutter are <b>deburred</b> and that the tubes are inserted fully to the stops in the fitting before the joints are made, as referred to earlier in this section. In some cases, where the above approaches are not possible, the length of copper tube affected can sometimes be replaced by materials more resistant to corrosion-erosion, e.g. 90/10 copper-nickel (BS Designation CN102) using appropriate fittings, or stainless steel to BS 4127:1994.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unusual}} for the general water {{velocity}} in a system to be so high that impingement attack occurs throughout {{the whole of the}} copper pipework. More commonly, the velocity is just sufficiently low for satisfactory protective films to be formed and to remain in position on most of the system, with impingement damage more likely to occur where there is an abrupt change in the direction of water flow giving rise to a high degree of turbulence, such as at tee pieces and elbow fittings. It is not generally realised how great an effect small obstructions can have on the flow pattern of water in a pipe-work system {{and the extent to which}} they can induce turbulence and cause corrosion-erosion. For example, it is most important, as far as possible, to ensure that copper tubes cut with a tube cutter are <b>deburred</b> before making the joint. Also a gap between the tube end and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the socket of the fitting, can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical <b>deburring</b> is a <b>deburring</b> {{process that}} either {{mechanically}} grinds a burr off of metal or rolls {{the edge of}} dangerous slit or sheared metal burrs into itself.

40|$|Noise {{pollution}} is an identified issue in manufacturing environments. While machines, motion, production, etc. {{are a large}} factor in this noise pollution, other sources exist. Often copper tubing is connected to pressurized containers as a make-shift jet stream for reorienting elements on the assembly line. These makeshift jets when working in conjunction create noise pollution. By manipulating the exit of these small jets, it is hypothesized that the noise level can be decreased. Using the National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) at the University of Mississippi, three geometry alterations—deburring the end, creating a converging-diverging nozzle, and flattening the end—were tested on these small jets against a control (that still had the burrs and smaller diameter from the pipe cut) to determine {{the validity of the}} hypothesis. The results indicated minimal sound pressure level (SPL) changes for each of the alterations compared against the control. Furthermore, the control appeared to be quieter than all the variables. However, by performing an uncertainty analysis and investigating the volumetric flow rate of the control, two discrepancies were uncovered: the flow rate for the control was less than the variables and the volumetric flow readout had its own amount of uncertainty. It was found that both the <b>deburred</b> and converging-diverging jets eliminated a tonal frequency that occurred with the control jet. However, this difference is negligible; geometric alterations did not vastly change the SPL of the jets. More analysis should be conducted; specifically, a sound level weighting analysis and ideal thrust for part reorientation...|$|R
40|$|Increased US {{export of}} cotton and global {{competition}} necessitates that plant breeders {{continue to improve}} fiber properties of upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.). Cotton cultivars having whiter fibers and more mature fibers are desirable due to decreased processing costs. TAM B 182 - 33 ELS (Extra Long Staple) germplasm line of upland cotton, and Tamcot CAMD-E, a short staple obsolete cultivar were crossed with 36 cultivars representing unique germplasm pools from China (12 cultivars), west and central Africa (7 cultivars), south Africa (10 cultivars), and the United States (7 cultivars) that represent distinct germplasm pools. Parents and F 1 s were grown in College Station, TX, in a Line x Tester design during the summers of 2010 and 2011. Seedcotton was harvested by hand (to avoid the presence of thrash particles in the lint that could bias the color measurements), <b>deburred</b> and allowed to dry in limited light. Cotton samples were ginned on a laboratory saw gin, separated into 2. 00 gram subsamples, and color measurements were taken using a Konica-Minolta CR- 310 reflectance colorimeter. Absolute color measurements were obtained in two color systems (tristimulus XYZ and CIE L*a*b*). At the Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute (FBRI) in Lubbock, TX, 50. 0 mg samples of the 38 parents and F 1 s {{were used to determine}} maturity ratio (MR), ribbon width (RbWth) and micronaire (Mic) on a Cottonscope. The fibers were cut into 2. 0 mm snippets and immersed in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant and NaCl. Approximately, 20, 000 snippets per entry were analyzed for MR, RbWth and Mic in the Cottonscope using polarized light. General and specific combining abilities for all the variables were calculated from the data collected. Despite the evident genetic variation from this study for the degree of fiber whiteness, the difficulties in the phenotypic screening of this trait and its importance relative to other fiber traits are problematic. At this time, it is not advisable to begin a cotton breeding program based upon degree of fiber whiteness. Genetic variation also existed for MR, RbWth and Mic among the distinct germplasm pools utilized in this study, but it is not advisable to begin a breeding program based on RbWth or Mic. However, a cotton breeding program to improve MR would be feasible, especially with fast and repeatable measurements from the Cottonscope...|$|R
40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringLearning {{representations}} for {{object recognition}} and image quality enhancement with the deep {{convolutional neural network}} approach has received {{a great deal of attention}} in the past several years and recently has gained widespread popularity in the field of computer vision and image processing. Many convolutional neural networks based researches has shown successful results in image processing and computer vision area by feeding only raw images into the convolutional neural network model to learn network parameters. In supervised learning, every input image in our traingset is "a question" and corresponding label or groundtruth is "a correct answer" that we would have quite liked the algorithms have predicted on that image. Even though the CNN models can be skillful enough to solve a problem by learning a large trainingset, we expect that if CNNs were feed with additional information, as well as with images, that would leads learning in a better way, it may perform better. It is like giving helpful hints when teaching a child. This thesis presents fingerprint liveness detection and space-varying deblur methods based on CNN. The first fingerprint liveness detection belongs to a classification problem and the second space-varying deblur belongs to a prediction problem of original sharpen image. Instead of training CNNs with input images only, we provide additional information with which CNNs can learn features in a domain specific, or a problem specific way. Simple additional information that can obtain fairly easily but crucial for a given task is used as an additional input of each CNN. Sweat pore map is used as additional information for fingerprint liveness detection and spatial pixel indices are used as additional information for space-varying deblur. For fingerprint liveness detection, the sweat pore map provides enough hint to allow CNN to learn features for specific regions such as regions right at the pores, regions around the pores, regions in the ridges that do not contain pores. Our fingerprint liveness detection method outperforms the best algorithms of fingerprint liveness detection competition 2013 (LivDet 2013). For CNN based space-varying <b>debur,</b> the spatial pixel indices provide enough hint to allow CNN to learn filters that have stronger response at specific areas of an image. Our non-stationary lens blur method is the first CNN model that directly outputs the restored image from a blurry image, without any assumption or approximation of block-wise spatially invariant blur. The proposed deblurring method provides the state-of-the-art performances. We established procedures for building training sets from real-world lenses and cameras for restoration of lens blur. ope...|$|R

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional tubing instrumentation for measuring airflow, designers and technicians at the NASA Glenn Research Center have been fabricating packaging components and assembling a set of unique probes using commercial-off-the-shelf microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) integrated circuits (computer chips). Using MEMS as {{an alternative}} has some compelling advantages over standard measurement devices. Sensor technologies have matured through high-production usage in industries such as automotive and aircraft manufacturers. Currently, MEMS are the choice in applications such as tire pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances. Conventional instrumentation uses tubing buried in the model aerodynamic surfaces or wind tunnel walls. The measurements are made when pressure is introduced at the tube opening. The pressure then must travel the tubing for lengths ranging from 20 to hundreds of feet before reaching an electronic signal conditioner. This condition causes {{a considerable amount of}} damping and requires measurements to be made only after the test rig has reached steady-state operation. The electronic MEMS pressure sensor is able to take readings continuously under dynamic states in nearly real time. The use of stainless steel tubing for pressure measurements requires many tubes to be cleaned, cut to length, carefully installed, and delicately <b>deburred</b> and spliced for use. A cluster of a few hundred 1 / 16 -in. - (0. 0625 -in. -) diameter tubes (not uncommon in research testing facilities) can be several inches in diameter and may weigh enough to require two men to handle. Replacing hard tubing with electronic chips can eliminate much of the bulk. Each sensor would fit on the tip of the 1 / 16 -in. tubing with room to spare. The P 592 piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor (Lucas NovaSensor, Fremont, CA) was chosen for this project because of its cost, availability, and tolerance to extreme ambient conditions. The chip is 1 mm square by 0. 6 mm thick (0. 039 by 0. 023 in.) with 0. 12 -mm (0. 005 -in.) wire connection tabs. Three MEMS chips were used to build the first type of flow-angularity probe. This MEMS probe will be demonstrated as {{an alternative to}} a standard tube type "Cobra Probe" now used routinely in wind tunnel and aeronautical hardware applications. The response time and accuracy would allow the probe to be translated on an actuator across a flow field, yielding precision dynamic measurements not possible with conventional instrumentation. The low profile, the minimal power requirement, the rugged construction, and the moderate cost all contribute to making MEMS sensors the enticing choice instrument in future research measurement needs. The MEMS probe efforts are a continuation of work initiated by Brian Willis, without whose foresight and efforts this project would never have been realized. This task was funded through cooperation with the NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, burr removal {{is a very}} important part of the manufacturing process. Stacks of material on sections of an aircraft are assembled and drilled by hand. Due to extensive burr formation the sheets must be destacked so that burrs can be removed and then the stacks are reassembled and fastened together. If burrs are minimized in the drilling process, this would reduce the necessity for the sheets to be destacked and <b>deburred.</b> One approach to minimizing burrs is to lower the thrust force in drilling through suitable modification of the drill geometry such as the use of a step drill. Although prior researchers have analyzed different drill geometries such as step drills and their effect on hole exit burr formation in the drilling process through experimentation, no work has been reported on modeling and analysis of step drilling forces and their relationship to burr formation as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. Consequently, this thesis focuses on the modeling of the thrust force and torque for step drills and analyzes their relationship with burr size as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. In the first step, a mechanistic model for thrust and torque in drilling is implemented for a standard twist drill. This mechanistic model is then adapted to predict the thrust and torque for a step drill. Subsequently, experiments are performed to validate the mechanistic model and to evaluate burr formation with standard and step drills. The influence of thrust and torque on hole exit burr formation is analyzed for different step drill geometries and experimental feeds and speeds. The results show that the predicted thrust and torque values for both drill geometries are in good agreement with measured values, although the torque model consistently underpredicts. For standard drill geometry in the calibration tests, the average error in the thrust prediction is 7. 09 % and the average error in the torque prediction is - 18. 05 %. In validation tests, the average error for predicted thrust is 2. 29 % and the average error for predicted torque is - 18. 46 %. For the step drill model the average error in thrust is 0. 72 % while the average error in torque is - 8. 72 %. In addition, a reduction in the predicted thrust force for a step drill relative to the standard twist drill is found to correlate well with a reduction in the measured burr size. However, further reduction in the thrust force by varying the step angle and diameter ratio do not correlate well with the measured burr size. Likely reasons for these results are presented in this thesis. MSCommittee Chair: Shreyes Melkote; Committee Member: Steven Danyluk; Committee Member: Steven Lian...|$|R
