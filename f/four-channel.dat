5|$|The MSS was {{manufactured}} by Hughes Aircraft Company. The sensor {{was considered an}} experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed the data that was beamed back to Earth. After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a <b>four-channel</b> scanner that obtained radiometric images of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a <b>four-channel</b> anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a <b>four-channel</b> digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E
25|$|US Aveo safety {{features}} include available <b>four-channel,</b> four-sensor ABS system with electronic {{brake force distribution}} (EBD), and front (dual-stage) and side air bags for front row occupants with a passenger-sensing system. Beginning with 2008, Aveo standard equipment includes a tire pressure monitoring system.|$|E
25|$|The Mustang GT {{features}} a stiffer, better handling {{version of the}} standard suspension, larger 12.4-inch front brake discs (versus the 11.4-inch discs used on V6 Mustangs), standard <b>four-channel</b> ABS with traction control, a two-piece drive shaft, a stainless steel dual exhaust, standard grille-mounted fog lights, and 17-inch wheels with optional 18-inch wheels.|$|E
25|$|The {{braking system}} {{includes}} <b>four-channel</b> ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A brake booster pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes {{are used in the}} rear.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the {{previous}} model, stability improved {{through the use of}} wider tracks a longer wheelbase and <b>four-channel</b> ABS disc brakes with traction control. Usable boot space increased to 541 litres. Cornering lights were provided integrated into the front fog light assembly- these cornering lights were illuminated whenever the indicator was operating {{on that side of the}} car, illuminating a turning path for the driver. Electrochromatic rear view mirror sensed headlight glare from vehicles travelling behind, and automatically adjusts mirror glass tint level to reduce driver glare.|$|E
25|$|Various {{avionics}} {{systems were}} used on Sea Furies, it was unusually well equipped for an aircraft {{of the era}} in this respect. Many aircraft would be equipped with onboard radar, often the ARI 5307 ZBX, which could be directly integrated with the <b>four-channel</b> VHF radio system. Several of the navigational aids, such as the altimeter and G2F compass, were also advanced; many of these subsystems would appear on subsequent jet aircraft {{with little or no}} alteration. Other aspects of the Sea Fury, such as the majority of the flight controls, were conventional. Some controls were electrically powered, such as the weapons controls, onboard cameras, and the gyro gunsight.|$|E
25|$|The logical {{format of}} an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is {{described}} in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the Red Book CD-DA after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit PCM encoding at a 44.1kHz sampling rate per channel. <b>Four-channel</b> sound was to be an allowable option within the Red Book format, but has never been implemented. Monaural audio has no existing standard on a Red Book CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard Red Book stereo track (i.e., mirrored mono); an MP3 CD, however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 2007, Sony {{announced}} the PlayStation Eye. This is {{an updated version}} of the PlayStation2 peripheral, the EyeToy. The camera is capable of capturing 60frames per second video at 640×480 resolution and 120 frame/s video at 320×240 resolution. The <b>four-channel</b> microphone on the Eye can block out background noise. The camera supports live video chat and voice chat without a headset, and was launched in the United States on October 23, 2007, for US$39.99, and in Australia on November 8, 2007, for A$79.95. It was also bundled with the card game The Eye of Judgment released in the United States on the same day as the camera itself for US$69.99, and in Japan and Australia on October 25, 2007 for JP¥9,980 and A$159.95, respectively.|$|E
25|$|For {{model year}} 1999 a minor {{facelift}} was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes like the square XC-style roof rails replacing the rounded version {{and a slightly}} changed logo for the front grill, it concentrated on the mechanicals. Volvo introduced dual stage frontal airbag deployment logic and its second generation side airbag which was increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS was also introduced {{as part of the}} standard equipment. New engine management systems with drive-by-wire throttle replaced the mechanical throttle on turbo models and an upgraded traction control now called STC was introduced. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a <b>four-channel</b> system, while all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} also notable {{for its use}} of sound, being the first comedy series to be {{produced}} in stereo. Adams said that he wanted the programme's production to be {{comparable to that of}} a modern rock album. Much of the programme's budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland (for the pilot episode and the complete second series) at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Dick Mills and Harry Parker (for the remaining episodes (2–6) of the first series). The fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of Hitchhiker's became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into <b>four-channel</b> Dolby Surround. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of the third radio series.|$|E
25|$|One key {{innovation}} of the rotorcraft is the <b>four-channel</b> fly-by-wire {{control system}} employed; the NH90 {{is the first}} helicopter {{in the world to}} be equipped with full fly-by-wire flight controls. A four-axis autopilot is also integrated with the fly-by-wire system, as are mission and navigation systems to enable greater autonomy during operations and to reduce pilot workload. The flight envelope of the NH90 is capable of all-weather day-and-night operations, ship-borne operations during high sea states, across a temperature range from −40°C to +50°C, and up to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. Power is provided by a pair of turboshaft engines, dependent on customer selection, the NH90 is either fitted with Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 or General Electric T700E powerplants; exhaust gases from the engines are filtered through an infrared suppression system for decreased sensory visibility. According to Airbus Helicopters, the NH90 possesses the lowest radar signature in its class, principally due to its diamond-shaped composite fuselage.|$|E
500|$|Throughout their career, Pink Floyd {{experimented with}} their sound. Their second single, [...] "See Emily Play" [...] premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early {{quadraphonic}} device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, {{to manipulate the}} band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded <b>four-channel,</b> 360-degree system.|$|E
500|$|To {{counter the}} {{tendency}} to depart from controlled flight—and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (<b>four-channel)</b> fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces {{in such a way}} as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: [...] "You don't fly an F-16; it flies you." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the game was less well received. Critics panned the music as [...] "easily the worst Castlevania soundtrack" [...] and [...] "muddy, plodding, and {{reminiscent}} of the days of <b>four-channel</b> NES soundtracks". Conversely, GameSpot found that the music was [...] "decent" [...] and occasionally [...] "fitting or even catchy", but {{failed to live up}} to the high expectations of the series. IGN felt that while not [...] "quite as bad as importers have made it out to be", the songs [...] "aren't nearly as nice as they have been in past Castlevania adventures." [...] Reviewers also disliked the lack of difficulty with GamePro describing it as the game's [...] "biggest flaw". Other criticism included predictable and easy boss battles, and [...] "a much smaller explorable area and somewhat less compelling map design".|$|E
2500|$|... 1) <b>Four-channel,</b> four-sensor ABS: There is a {{speed sensor}} {{on all four}} wheels and a {{separate}} valve for all four wheels. With this setup, the controller monitors each wheel individually {{to make sure it}} is achieving maximum braking force.|$|E
2500|$|When the BBC Micro was released, many {{competing}} {{home computers}} used Microsoft BASIC, or variants typically designed to resemble it. Compared to Microsoft BASIC, BBC BASIC featured IF…THEN…ELSE, REPEAT…UNTIL, named procedures and functions, but retained Goto and GOSUB for compatibility. [...] It also supported high-resolution graphics, <b>four-channel</b> sound, pointer-based memory access (borrowed from BCPL) and rudimentary macro assembly. [...] Long variable names were accepted and distinguished completely, {{not just by}} the first two characters.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gary Flint, the truck's Variable Torque Management Four-Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system —co-developed with BorgWarner— [...] "provides {{front-wheel drive}} for dry-pavement {{cruising}} conditions and engages all-wheel drive when {{needed to improve}} stability or maneuverability" [...] and supports medium duty off-road use. The electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential can be manually locked (VTM-4 Lock) to help the truck better handle adverse terrain or become unstuck. It also has a <b>four-channel</b> fully automatic Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system {{that is designed to}} enhance control during acceleration, cornering, and collision-avoidance maneuvers and can be manually disabled to prevent undesirable throttle intervention in off-road conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Yorkville Sound {{incorporated}} as [...] "Yorkville Sound Limited" [...] with Long as President and Traynor as Vice-President. The operation {{moved to}} Dundas Street near Parliament in Toronto. In 1966, more products were introduced including the YVM-1 [...] "Voice Master", a portable 45 watt tube amplifier {{combined with a}} <b>four-channel</b> microphone mixer. The Voice Master contained 1/4-inch phone jacks for PA speakers, a master volume control, treble, mid-range and bass tone controls and patching points for the TR-1, a spring reverb unit made by Traynor. The portable mixer-amplifier concept was a novel idea that quickly proved popular among musicians, and was {{the inspiration for the}} 1967 introduction of the competing [...] "Vocal Master" [...] product line by Shure.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 October 1948, RDF {{broadcast}} Schaeffer's Etude aux chemins de fer. This was {{the first}} [...] "movement" [...] of Cinq études de bruits, and {{marked the beginning of}} studio realizations and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting lathe, four turntables, a <b>four-channel</b> mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on Déserts, a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Gerd Stern's move to New York, {{while still}} in the San Francisco Bay Area, he began to project slides of words found on street signs, forming a poetry collage later known as Verbal American Landscape. After invited to give a poetry reading at the San Francisco Museum of Art, Stern instead staged a two-night {{performance}} in November 1963 titled Contact Is the Only Love, which involved sixty-four performers. The slides were shot by Stewart Brand. Callahan (in his late teens) assisted with audio, using equipment borrowed from the San Francisco Tape Music Center. Stern and Callahan created a <b>four-channel</b> mix of conversation, announcements, and popular music by simultaneously playing, mixing, and switching four pre-recorded tapes and live cut-ups of radio. Stern described the performance: ...|$|E
2500|$|The stock A80 Supra chassis {{has also}} proven an {{effective}} platform for roadracing, with several top 20 and top 10 One Lap of America finishes in the SSGT1 class.

2500|$|Marshall looked {{towards a}} new {{flagship}} to nail all the compromising {{of the earlier}} models, the JVM, made {{in a variety of}} models and ranges. These amps have up to four channels, each with three-foot-switchable modes, dual master volumes, reverb controls for each channel, and a foot-switchable effects loop. These features can be programmed into the standard foot-switch to be foot-switchable as [...] "patches", so now the user can switch from, say, a clean channel with a chorus in the effects loop and reverb, to a medium-gain rhythm sound with no effects, to a high-gain lead sound with boosted output volume, with one click of the foot-switch per sound. The JVM range consists of a 100-watt <b>four-channel</b> head, JVM 410C (2×12-inch speaker combo), a 100-watt two-channel head (JVM 210H, used by Joe Satriani for some time), JVM 210C (2×12-inch speaker combo) and 50-watt versions of these (JVM 205H (head), JVM215C (1×12-inch speaker combo) and JVM205C (2×12-inch speaker combo), respectively).|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{equipment}} on the 2005 Mustang included power windows, dual power mirrors, power door locks with remote keyless entry, front air bags, AM/FM stereo with CD player, 16-inch painted aluminum wheels, and larger brake discs {{than the previous}} generation Mustang with twin-piston calipers in the front. Some of the options available included Ford's MyColor (a color-configurable instrument cluster available {{as part of the}} Interior Upgrade Package), brushed aluminum panels (also part of the Interior Upgrade Package), Ford's Shaker 500 (500 watt peak output) or Shaker 1000 (1000 watt peak output) premium audio system with a 6-disc MP3-compatible CD changer, leather seating surfaces, a six-way power adjustable driver seat, and a <b>four-channel</b> anti-lock brake system with traction control (standard on GT models).
