40|$|This thesis covers {{defaults}} in the Norwegian {{high yield}} bond market between January 1 st 2005 and June 30 th 2010. To a large extent, our task {{has been to}} register and document the details of all defaults that occurred within this timeframe and to use this information to compile {{a complete set of}} recovery rates. Our findings show that security does not affect recovery rates in the way one would assume. The average recovery is actually higher for defaulted senior unsecured issues than senior secured ones. We have also found a range of factors that affect the recovery of a <b>defaulted</b> <b>bond.</b> Briefly put, bonds most likely to yield low recovery in a default were issued by partly financed start-up companies that built a single asset with a proprietary design. Despite the fact {{that a lot of the}} bonds issued shortly before the financial crisis have defaulted, we have found that this market has many traits of a well functioning one. Recovery rate levels are comparable to what has been found in international studies. Companies tend to get chances to solve their problems before they end up in bankruptcy.

40|$|Receiving {{the same}} {{fractional}} recovery of par at default for bonds {{of the same}} issuer and seniority, regardless of remaining maturity, has been labelled in the academic literature as a Recovery of Face Value at Default (RFV). Such a recovery form results from language found in typical bond indentures and is supported by empirical evidence from <b>defaulted</b> <b>bond</b> values. We incorporate RFV into an exogenous boundary structural credit risk model and compare its e ect to more typical recovery forms found in such models. We find that the chosen recovery form can significantly a ect valuation and the sensitivities produced by these models, thus having important implications for empirical studies attempting to validate structural credit risk models. We show that some features of existing structural models {{are a result of}} the recovery form assumed in the model and do not necessarily hold under an RFV recovery form. Some of our results complement those found in the literature which examines the endogeneity of the default boundary. We find that some features that may have been solely attributed to modelling the boundary as an optimal decision by the firm can be obtained in an exogenous boundary framework with RFV. This has direct implications for studies which attempt to determine whether endogenous or exogenous models are better supported empirically. We extend our results to incorporate a multifactor default-free term structure model and examine the impact of the recovery form in estimating the cost of debt capital within a structural model framework. ...|$|E
40|$|This Special Comment {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between bond prices at default and prices immediately prior to bankruptcy resolution for a sample of 303 non-financial US firms with an average time in bankruptcy of about twenty months. The key findings are: • The median nominal return on bonds from default to resolution is zero, but the mean return is substantial due to the skewness of return distribution. The median ratio of the emergence price to the default price is 1. 00, and the mean ratio is 1. 17. This means while the typical <b>defaulted</b> <b>bond</b> had the same price at emergences as at default, on average, bond prices at emergence were 17 % higher than at default. • The mean return on defaulted bonds earned by investors {{is similar to the}} average return earned by the Lehman single-B bond index, but the median return is substantially less. When the emergence price is discounted back to the default date at the contemporaneous rate of return earned by the index, the mean ratio of the discounted reso-lution price to the default price is 0. 97, and the median ratio is 0. 87, implying that, on average, defaulted bonds earn roughly the same return as the Single-B Index. • The mean ratio of the discounted emergence price to the default price does not appear to vary systematically across various subsets of the sample, including types of initial default events, levels of seniority, price ranges at default, lengths of time spent in bankruptcy, and different years of default...|$|E

40|$|In [10] we {{presented}} a reduced form of risky bond pricing. At default date, a bond seller fails to continue fulfilling his obligation {{and the price}} of the bond sharply drops. For nodefault scenarios, if the face value of the <b>defaulted</b> <b>bond</b> is $ 1 then the bond price just after the default is its’ recovery rate (RR). Rating agencies and theoretical models are trying to predict RR for companies or sovereign countries. The main theoretical problem with a risky bond or with the general debt problems is presenting the price, knowing the RR. The problem of a credit default swap (CDS) pricing is somewhat an adjacent problem. Recall that the corporate bond price inversely depends on interest rate. In case of a default, the credit risk on a debt investment is related to the loss. There is a possibility for a risky bond buyer to reduce his credit risk. This can be achieved through buying a protection from a protection seller. The bondholder would pay a fixed premium up to maturity or default, which ever one comes first. If default comes before maturity, the protection buyer will receive the difference between the initial face value of the bond and RR. This difference is called ‘loss given default’. This contract represents CDS. The counterparty that pays a fixed premium is called CDS buyer or protection buyer; the opposite party is the CDS seller. Note, that in contrast to corporate bond, CDS contract does not assume that the buyer of the CDS is the holder of underlying bond. Also note that underlying to the swap can be any asset. It is called a reference asset or a reference entity. Thus, CDS is a credit instrument that separates credit risk from corresponding underlying entity. The formal type of the CDS can be described as follows. The buyer of the credit swap pays fixed rate or coupon until maturity or default in case it occurs before the maturity. If default does occur, protection buyer delivers cash or a default asset in exchange with the face value of the defaulted debt. These are known as cash or physical settlements. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results and}} discussion of the investment performance of those bonds and bank loans that have defaulted on their scheduled payments to creditors and continue trading while the issuing firm attempts a financial reorganization. Monthly total return measures are compiled based on the Altman-NYU Salomon Center Indexes of Defaulted Bonds and Defaulted Banks Loans, {{as well as an}} index that combines bonds and loans. These returns are compared to the total returns of common stocks and high yield corporate bonds. Returns are based on our market-weighted indexes and presented for the past year (1999), {{as well as for the}} last 13 years (for bonds) and four years for bank loans. We also estimate the expected supply of new defaulted debt in the United States for the coming three years. Nineteen ninety-nine was a mixed year for investors in distressed debt securities. Although the Defaulted Public Bond Index increased by a respectable 11. 34 % in 1999, the positive rate of increase was mainly a function of the excellent performance over a threemonth period in the earlier part of the year (February, March and April) when the size of the index was comprised of a relatively small number of securities and when the movement of a few issues had a significant influence on the Index. Still, the positive annual performance reversed the negative annual returns that we had observed in the prior two years. On a comparative note, our Defaulted Public Bond Index’s return of 11. 34 % was slightly higher than Salomon Smith Barney’s Bankrupt Bond Index return of 8. 42 %. Defaulted bank loans did not fare as well, recording a slight increase for the year of 0. 65 %. Except for the initial year (1996) of our Bank Loan Index, performance has been lackluster in the past three years. Finally, the Combined Public Bond and Private Bank Loan Index recorded a positive annual return in 1999 of 4. 45 %, resulting in a basically flat performance over the four years of the combined index calculation period. Comparative returns for the thirteen-year period (1987 - 1999), show that common stocks strengthened its number one asset class return/risk position. High yield bonds, while performing relatively poorly in 1999 (+ 1. 7 %), maintained a slight average annual return advantage over defaulted bonds. The two “bright” or positive factors related to the <b>defaulted</b> <b>bond</b> and bank loan markets in 1999 were the enormous increase in the supply of new defaulted issues and the record low average market value to face value ratio of the Index at the end of the year. The size of the Index more than doubled in number of issues and tripled in face and market values over the past twelve months as the default amount of high yield bonds reached a record high level in 1999 and the default rate went from 1. 6 % to over 4. 0 % (see our companion report on Defaults and Returns in the High Yield Bond Market). Based on our forecast of future defaults, we expect the number and amounts of the issues in both the Bond and Bank Loan indexes to continue to grow, albeit at a lower rate, in the next three years. Going forward, we suggest that this increased supply, and the relatively low marketto-face value ratio of defaulted bonds at the end of 1999, may present significant investment opportunities. ...|$|E

The Altman-NYU Salomon Center Index of <b>Defaulted</b> <b>Bonds</b> grew to a face value of $ 61. 5 billion. The market-to-face value ratio of the Bond Index fell to 0. 17 from 0. 21 one year ago.

30|$|Default {{probability}} distributions {{are often}} {{defined in terms}} of their conditional default probability distribution, or their hazard rate. By their definition, they imply a unique probability density function. The applications of default probability distributions are varied, including the risk premium model used to price <b>default</b> <b>bonds,</b> reliability measurement models, insurance, etc. Fractional probability density functions (FPD), however, are not in general conventional probability density functions (Tapiero and Vallois, Physica A,. Stat. Mech. Appl. 462 : 1161 – 1177, 2016). As a result, a fractional FPD does not define a fractional hazard rate. However, a fractional hazard rate implies a unique and conventional FPD. For example, an exponential distribution fractional hazard rate implies a Weibull probability density function while, a fractional exponential probability distribution is not a conventional distribution and therefore does not define a fractional hazard rate. The purpose of this paper consists of defining fractional hazard rates implied fractional distributions and to highlight their usefulness to granular default risk distributions. Applications of such an approach are varied. For example, pricing <b>default</b> <b>bonds,</b> pricing complex insurance contracts, as well as complex network risks of various granularity, that have well defined and quantitative definitions of their hazard rates.|$|R
