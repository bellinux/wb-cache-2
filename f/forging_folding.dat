5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The improvement of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated <b>forging,</b> <b>folding,</b> and stacking of wrought iron from pig iron to make swords.|$|E

Fracture analysis, chemical analysis, microstructure examination and finite element stress analysis {{were carried out}} on the fractured shaft. The analysis result showed that the shaft fracture cause is <b>forging</b> <b>fold.</b> By improving the forging process, the <b>forging</b> <b>fold</b> was solved, and the durability test {{can be carried out}} smoothly...|$|R

This particular process of <b>forging</b> and <b>folding</b> the sword blanks was to be perfected by the mid-Han dynasty (known as the [...] "refinings" [...] process) to become a standardized process for later blades for almost 2,000 years.|$|R

5000|$|If {{iron ores}} are heated with carbon to 1420 - 1470 K, a molten liquid is formed, an alloy of about 96.5% iron and 3.5% carbon. This product is strong, can be cast into {{intricate}} shapes, but is too brittle to be worked, unless {{the product is}} decarburized to remove most of the carbon. The vast majority of Chinese iron manufacture, from the Zhou dynasty onward, was of cast iron. However forged swords began {{to be made in}} the Warring-States-period: [...] "Earliest iron and steel jian also appear, made by the earliest and most basic <b>forging</b> and <b>folding</b> techniques." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An old, famous Japanese sword {{has been}} studied metallurigically to observe its {{microstructure}} by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The microstructure in the sharp edge of cross-sectional part is fine martensite and the morphology is lath type martensite. The other parts of sword, side and central part, of cross section show the structure of fine pearlite or coarse pearlite dominantly. The hardness of the sharp edge is high enough to possess the sharp cutting property. SEM-EDX observations indicated that several kinds of non-metallic inclusions exist in the sword which {{are considered to be}} originated from the slag smelting reaction in Tatara process. The amount of non-metallic inclusions in the sword is 50 - 100 times more than that of the ordinary steel. In the sharp edge the amount of inclusions is fewer and the sizes are finer in comparison with side and central part of the sword. It is considered that repeatedly <b>forging</b> and <b>folding</b> operations in making sword process are responsible for that...|$|R
5000|$|The swordsmiths will {{carefully}} {{break the}} kera apart, and separate the various carbon steels. The lowest carbon steel is called hocho-tetsu (soft iron), {{which is used}} for the shingane (translated as [...] "core-steel") of the blade. The high carbon steel (tamahagane) and higher carbon pig iron, called nabe-gane, will then be forged in alternating layers, using very intricate methods to form the very hard steel for the edge, called hagane (edge steel), and the springy metal jacket, called kawagane (skin steel). The most useful process is the folding, where the metals are <b>forge</b> welded, <b>folded,</b> and welded again, as many as 16 times. The folding removes impurities and helps even out the carbon content, while the alternating layers combine hardness with ductility to greatly enhance the toughness. Currently, tamahagane is only made {{three or four times a}} year by Nittoho and Hitachi Metals during winter in a wood building and is only sold to the master swordsmiths to use once it is made.|$|R
5000|$|Loom {{was to be}} {{the first}} game of a trilogy. Aside from the [...] "cliffhanger" [...] ending, the game {{contained}} several other hints pointing toward a sequel â€” for example, one of the [...] "scrying spheres" [...] the player can find shows a scene of a volcanic eruption, which does not occur in the game, but can be caused by Temblor, one of the several unused spells listed in The Book of Patterns. The two sequels planned were titled <b>Forge</b> and The <b>Fold,</b> starring Bobbin's friends Rusty Nailbender and Fleece Firmflanks. Moriarty gave an account of potential sequels in a 2006 interview: ...|$|R
5000|$|Loom wasn't {{actually}} {{written with}} a trilogy in mind. But {{after it was}} finished, there was vague interest in continuing the story. In discussing this possibility, I imagined two sequels.The first was tentatively called Forge. It {{tells the story of}} Bobbin's friend Rusty Nailbender, whose home city (the Forge of the Blacksmiths) was enslaved by Chaos near the end of Loom. Rusty becomes the leader of an underground movement to overthrow Chaos, together with Fleece Firmflanks of the Shepherds and new characters from the other Guilds. Bobbin appears every now and then as a ghostly swan dispensing mystical advice, an obvious nod to Obi-Wan Kenobi of Star Wars. The story climaxes in a terrible battle that nearly destroys the world.The third game, The Fold, is about Fleece Firmflanks and her attempt to unite the shattered Guilds in a final, desperate effort to banish Chaos. Near the end of the game, when the cause appears hopeless, Bobbin and the Weavers swoop in like the proverbial cavalry to save the day. The Loom of the Weavers is remade, reality is healed, and peace is restored to the Guilds.But this was all just talk. I was busy with other projects, and nobody else felt strongly enough about the games to make a commitment. So <b>Forge</b> and The <b>Fold</b> never got made.|$|R
