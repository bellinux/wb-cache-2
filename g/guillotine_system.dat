40|$|A novel {{design of}} a {{wide-angle}} monochromatic x-ray beam shutter is discussed. The shutter is designed as a compact unit capable of providing users with the means of shutting off the beam in secondary beamlines that are {{at an angle to}} the primary beamline and to each other. The single-unit design used the fact that all the secondary beamlines will be closed at the same time. The main challenge was to fit the shutter in the limited space of the existing Advanced Photon Source IMMW-CAT hutch. Space limitations led to the change in position of the actuator subassembly as compared to the standard shutter design. Although the actuator subassembly is placed underneath the shutter, fail-safe shutting is achieved by placing tungsten blocks above the beam while the shutter is open and using gravity to close the shutter in case of pneumatic failure. Redundancy required by safety concerns was achieved by duplicating the tungsten block/actuator subunits. Tungsten blocks of uneven length were used to counteract the increase in the center-to-center distance among secondary beamlines due to their angular offset. A special support table was designed to facilitate assembly and adjustability of the shutter position in the available space. To provide a radiation-tight hutch, a non-standard <b>guillotine</b> <b>system</b> was designed. In this paper, the design, specifications and optical ray tracing of the shutter assembly are presented...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} porcine vitreous {{flow and}} water flow rates {{in a new}} prototype hypersonic vitrectomy system compared to currently available pneumatic <b>guillotine</b> vitrectors (GVs) <b>systems.</b> Two vitrectors were tested, a prototype, ultrasound-powered, hypersonic vitrector (HV) and a GV. Porcine vitreous was obtained within 12 to 24 h of sacrifice and kept at 4 Â°C. A vial of vitreous or water was placed on a precision balance and its weight measured {{before and after the}} use of each vitrector. Test parameters included changes in aspiration levels, vitrector gauge, cut rates for GVs, % ultrasound (US) power for HVs, and port size for HVs. Data was analysed using linear regression and t-tests. There was no difference in the total average mean water flow between the 25 -gauge GV and the 25 -gauge HV (t-test: P = 0. 363); however, 25 -gauge GV was superior (t-test: P < 0. 001) in vitreous flow. The 23 -gauge GV was only more efficient in water and vitreous removal than 23 -gauge HV needle- 1 (Port 0. 0055) (t-test: P < 0. 001). For HV, wall thickness and gauge had no effect on flow rates. Water and vitreous flows showed a direct correlation with increasing aspiration levels and % US power (p< 0. 05). The HV produced consistent water and vitreous flow rates across the range of US power and aspiration levels tested. Hypersonic vitrectomy may be a promising new alternative to the currently available guillotine-based technologies...|$|R
