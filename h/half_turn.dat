25|$|On {{resuming}} service, Smith {{received an}} invitation from the Dutch government to bring the vessel to the Netherlands for a demonstration, which he accepted. On the voyage to the Texel however, Archimedes broke her crankshaft {{and was forced to}} return to England for further repairs, which on this occasion were effected by the firm of Miller, Ravenhill & Co. It was during this refit that the original full helix, single turn, single threaded propeller was replaced by a double-threaded, <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> propeller with two distinct blades. The new propeller had the advantage of considerably reducing the ship's vibration at the stern.|$|E
25|$|The {{routine is}} marked out of 10 by five judges with {{deductions}} for incomplete moves or poor form. Usually {{the highest and}} lowest scores are discarded. Additional points can be added depending on {{the difficulty of the}} skills being performed. The degree of difficulty (DD or tariff) is calculated by adding a factor for each <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> (or twist) or quarter somersault. Difficulty is important in a routine, however, there are differences in opinion between various coaches whether it is better to focus on increasing the difficulty of routines given that this usually results in a reduced form score or to focus on improving execution scores by displaying better form in an easier routine.|$|E

5000|$|Each side is {{permitted}} to turn in only 180° increments or <b>half</b> <b>turns.</b> Due to the gears not making a full rotation along with the side it's attached to, it prohibits 90° turns.

25|$|Marian Drăgulescu (born December 18, 1980 in Bucharest) is a Romanian artistic gymnast. During {{his senior}} {{gymnastics}} career {{he has won}} an impressive 31 medals at Olympic games, World or European Championships among which eight gold medals at World Championships. He excels in vault and floor on which he was a multiple world champion and Olympic medallist. His name will remain the history of gymnastics {{not only because of}} his world titles on floor (2001, 2002, 2006, 2009) and vault (2001, 2005, 2006, 2009), but also because of the extremely difficult vault named after him: handspring double front somersault with <b>half</b> <b>turn.</b> He was also an excellent all around gymnast: On the all around event he is a European champion (2004) and a bronze medallist (2000), and placed 8th at the 2004 Olympic Games.|$|E
25|$|The vowels {{fall into}} two sets, the back vowels -a and -o, and the front vowels -e and -i. Each set {{consists}} of a lower vowel, -a or -e, and a higher vowel, -o or -i. In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants. These follow two patterns. Symmetrical, vowel, p-, t-, sp-, are rotated 90 degrees (a quarter turn) counter-clockwise, while those that are asymmetrical top-to-bottom, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-, are rotated 180 degrees (a <b>half</b> <b>turn).</b> The lower front-vowel (-e) syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (a) syllables, and the high front-vowel (-i) syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (-o) syllables.|$|E
25|$|At the 2004 Olympic Games Drăgulescu {{helped his}} team to a bronze medal and was a forerunner in the all around event until a mistake on the high bar, after which he still thrilled the crowd with a {{difficult}} routine. He won silver in the men's floor only after a tiebreaker was needed with gold medalist Kyle Shewfelt. On the men's vault he performed the exceptionally difficult vault {{that bears his name}} (a handspring double front with <b>half</b> <b>turn)</b> and received a 9.9, the highest score awarded in World or Olympic competition since 1995. It seemed he needed only to land his second vault to take gold, but he fell. However Drăgulescu was still awarded the bronze, a controversial decision because the disparity between the judges scores was greater than is permitted and therefore some or all of them should have been altered. They were not, and Shewfelt was pushed into fourth place. The Canadian federation filed a protest, but the result stood. In 2005 the judges involved were suspended for one year.|$|E

2500|$|A similar event {{occurred}} in the next U.S. Open, played at the Scioto Country Club in Columbus, Ohio. In the second round, after his opening round put him in second place, Jones was putting on the 15th green {{in the face of}} a strong wind. [...] After grounding his putter during address to square up the club face, the ball rolled a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> in the wind when Jones lifted the club head to place it behind the ball. [...] Although no one else observed this movement of the ball either, again Jones called a penalty on himself, but this time Jones went on to win the tournament, the second of his four U.S. Open victories.|$|E
