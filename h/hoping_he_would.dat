5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E
5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
25|$|After {{three seasons}} in Minnesota, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Walker in 1992 <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be the final}} {{ingredient}} they needed to reach the Super Bowl. That year, he enjoyed his best season as a Pro since 1988, rushing for 1,070 yards. In 1994 {{he became the first}} NFL player to have one-play gains of 90 or more yards rushing, receiving and kick-returning in a single season. He spent three seasons in Philadelphia, leaving after the Eagles signed free agent Ricky Watters.|$|E
25|$|The group head to Arizona {{to meet a}} gun runner. In Tucson, {{they learn}} he has been imprisoned by the Pinkertons. Marisa {{secretly}} flirts with Ray, who tells her they could take the medallion for themselves. Ray and Thomas then rescue the gun runner, who is wrapped in bandages, and return him to Mendoza. In private, he reveals himself to be Barnsby, telling Mendoza if he wants the rifles, he must hand over the McCalls. Meanwhile, Ray brags to Thomas and William of his plans with Marisa. Thomas goes to see Marisa, who says she was using Ray, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> kill Mendoza, when she is actually in love with Thomas.|$|E

25|$|In September 1880, Behan and Sadie left Tip Top for Tombstone. Soon {{after they}} arrived, Behan's ex-wife sent their eight-year-old son Albert {{to live with}} him. In reconstructing her life story, Josephine said years later that she {{actually}} lived with Kitty Jones and her husband, a lawyer, {{while working as a}} housekeeper for Behan. Boyer and other modern researchers argue that she actually lived with Behan. In Josephine's version of her life story, she left San Francisco to join Behan to Tombstone in October, 1880, and was <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fulfill his promises to marry her. When he delayed, she was ready to leave him.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Childress {{promoted}} 25-year-old Busch Series driver Johnny Sauter to the ride, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rise to {{the occasion}} like Harvick had in 2001. Kevin Hamlin moved over from the 31 team to serve as Sauter's crew chief. Sauter had helped secure the 2003 Busch Series owner's championship in a partial schedule with RCR, while finishing 8th in driver points. Sauter failed to score a top ten, ranked {{at the bottom of the}} Raybestos Rookie standings, and was released just 13 races into the season. After that, Dave Blaney drove the car, only skipping Infineon Raceway when Jim Inglebright took the wheel. A couple of weeks after it was announced Blaney would be in the car for rest of the year, Jeff Burton became available after parting ways with Roush Racing's No. 99 car, leaving Blaney out in the cold. Burton was signed to a multi-year contract and drove the car for the rest of the year beginning at Michigan in August. When Robby Gordon left to start his own team, Burton moved to the 31.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} portion of Toole's {{military}} career {{one of his}} primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island {{with some of the}} men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they could have some solitude. Toole's army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual orientation a secret, there was an openly gay contingent which flaunted their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more {{than the rest of the}} group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand of behavior that made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole's response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he waited a half-hour to call for help, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole's negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.|$|E

500|$|Hayes, {{who wore}} #9 for the Michigan Wolverines from 1992 to 1995, was {{recruited}} by University of Colorado, Florida State University, University of Arkansas, and University of Southern California.

[...] She requested the intervention of her uncle, the respected Marquis of Villena, to negotiate with the Royal Council, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to obtain better concessions. [...] The Marquis eventually abandoned the negotiations, and María Pacheco took on personal negotiations with Prior Zúñiga, the commander of the besieging forces. [...] Her demands, though somewhat galling to honor, were ultimately minor, such as guaranteeing the property and reputation of her children.|$|E
500|$|Sforza {{was coming}} close to Milan itself in his conquests, {{and decided that}} since it was too {{powerful}} to be taken by force, he would surround it and starve the populace into surrender. With {{the loss of the}} outer cities by conquest or defection, Milan experienced famine. Gonzaga offered Crema to Sforza, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be tempted to take it himself and betray the Venetians. But Sforza remained staunch, and instead offered Gonzaga the city of Tortona if he would abandon Crema. This was accepted, and Crema, without support, quickly capitulated.|$|E
500|$|By 1998, Hammonds and the Orioles were <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> achieve more consistency. With {{the threat}} of facing a salary {{arbitration}} hearing, the Orioles approached him {{with the idea of}} working out an agreement on a multi-year contract extension. Hammonds agreed, and signed a three-year, $7 million contract before the 1998 season. Hammonds felt that this was a strong commitment from the Orioles hierarchy, including Gillick, after which [...] manager Ray Miller believed that this would allow Hammonds to focus on improving his skills. However, Hammonds suffered a back injury that returned him to the disabled list that year.|$|E

500|$|In Washington, D.C., Whitman's friend Charley Eldridge {{helped him}} obtain {{part-time}} {{work in the}} army paymaster's office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals. He would write of this experience in [...] "The Great Army of the Sick", published in a New York newspaper in 1863 and, 12years later, in a book called Memoranda During the War. He then contacted Emerson, this time {{to ask for help}} in obtaining a government post. Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as Leaves of Grass.|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have had a chance}} to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one. The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E
500|$|Henry had {{no further}} {{opportunities}} to reconquer his possessions in France {{after the collapse}} of his military campaign at Taillebourg. Henry's resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of the French Crown, {{and by the end of}} the 1240s it was clear that King Louis had become the preeminent power across France. Henry instead adopted what historian Michael Clanchy has described as a [...] "European strategy", attempting to regain his lands in France through diplomacy rather than force, building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on the French King. In particular, Henry cultivated Frederick II, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> turn against Louis or allow his nobility to join Henry's campaigns. In the process, Henry's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs.|$|E
