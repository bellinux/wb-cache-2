40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} requirements and best practices for implementing international nuclear safeguards at independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> (ISFSIs), {{also known as}} Away-from- Reactor (AFR) <b>storage</b> facilities. These <b>installations</b> may provide wet or dry storage of spent fuel, although the safeguards guidance herein focuses on dry storage facilities. In principle, the safeguards guidance applies to both wet and dry storage. The reason for focusing on dry independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> {{is that this is}} one of the fastest growing nuclear installations worldwide. Independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> are typically outside of the safeguards nuclear material balance area (MBA) of the reactor. They may be located on the reactor site, but are generally considered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the State Regulator/SSAC to be a separate facility. The need for this guidance is becoming increasingly urgent as more and more nuclear power plants move their spent fuel from resident spent fuel ponds to independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations.</b> The safeguards requirements and best practices described herein are also relevant to the design and construction of regional independent spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> that nuclear power plant operators are starting to consider in the absence of a national long-term geological spent fuel repository. The following document has been prepared in support of two of the three foundational pillars for implementing Safeguards-by-Design (SBD). These are: i) defining the relevant safeguards requirements, and ii) defining the best practices for meeting the requirements. This document was prepared with the design of the latest independent dry spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> in mind and was prepared specifically as an aid for designers of commercial nuclear facilities to help them understand the relevant international requirements that follow from a country’s safeguards agreement with the IAEA. If these requirements are understood at the earliest stages of facility design, it will help eliminate the costly retrofit of facilities that has occurred in the past to accommodate nuclear safeguards, and will help the IAEA implement nuclear safeguards worldwide, especially in countries building their first nuclear facilities. It is also hoped that this guidance document will promote discussion between the IAEA, State Regulator/SSAC, Project Design Team, and Facility Owner/Operator at an early stage to ensure that new ISFSIs will be effectively and efficiently safeguarded. This is intended to be a living document, since the international nuclear safeguards requirements may be subject to revision over time. More importantly, the practices by which the requirements are met are continuously modernized by the IAEA and facility operators for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. As these improvements are made, it is recommended that the subject guidance document be updated and revised accordingly...|$|R

40|$|The design <b>storage</b> <b>installations</b> for {{dangerous}} substances can be optimized from {{a safety}} and risk {{point of view}} by combining quantitative risk analysis and mathematical optimization techniques; the consequences of accidents are directly proportional to the mass involved in them, which means that in a <b>storage</b> <b>installation,</b> if {{the totality of the}} stored substance is divided into more tanks, the consequences when an accident occurs in any of the units will be less significant than if all the mass was stored in one tank (in installations where there is low possibility of domino effect occurrence). However, as more tanks are used to store the mass, the economical investment will also increase; then, a situation arises between two conflicting objectives, that can be solved through the use of multi objective optimization.
