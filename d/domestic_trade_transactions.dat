40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that international trade transactions carry inherently more risk than <b>domestic</b> <b>trade</b> <b>transactions,</b> because {{of differences in}} culture, business processes, laws and regulations. It is therefore important for traders to ensure that payment is received for goods despatched and that the goods received and paid for comply with the contract of sale. One effective way of managing these risks has been for traders {{to rely on the}} letter of credit as a payment method. However for exporters in particular, the letter of credit has presented difficulties in meeting the compliance requirements necessary for the payment to be triggered. The current rules that govern letter of credit transactions (UCP 500) have been under review {{for the past three years}} and an updated set of rules (UCP 600) is expected to be introduced on 1 July 2007. This paper focuses on the changes mooted for 2007 and compares these main issues with the existing rules and other associated guidelines and regulations governing this method of payment. The conclusion is that the UCP 600 have not paid enough consideration to traders and service providers and are likely to engender an environment of uncertainty for exporters in particular...|$|E

Factoring activities relate to both purchasing and transfering credit_ Consequently, the stipulations of trading, particularly a credit trading within Civil Code. can be implemented as a basic analysis for the factoring transaction. There are three parts in the factoring transaction, namely; credit seller (client), credit buyer (factor) and customer of tehe client. So, there is a law relationship among them. The law relationship between client and customer is both goods and services trading by a periodic payment. The law relationship between Factor and Client is a law relationship of the credit trading.

40|$|Markets are not {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} but depend on {{a complex set of}} institutions. Commercial law enables and facilitates at-arm’s-length market exchange. Competition law regulates freedom of contract in order to protect it from self-abolition. On the domestic level, these core pillars of the economic constitution have been safely installed by the modern nation state. However, on the global level the situation is different. Since in contrast to <b>domestic</b> <b>trade,</b> cross-border <b>transactions</b> are not conducted “in the shadow of law” but largely depend on private governance-mechanisms, the crucial question is whether the world market is able to reproduce its own institutional prerequisites. Consequently, we assess the potential effects of this privatization of commercial law on competition policy, namely the potential abuse of market-dominating positions resulting from a rise in the level of vertical integration on the world market as well as the potential of contracting around the ban on cartels by choosing arbitration rather than litigation as a means of commercial dispute resolution...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTransaction cost {{has emerged}} as a core concept in the New Institutional Economics (NIE) and an {{important}} theoretical tool for researchers in this field. Measuring transaction costs and the quantitative analysis of the relationship between transaction costs and other economic indicators has become a central theme of analysis in the NIE. By measuring China's macroscopic transaction costs since 1978 and utilizing a dynamic econometric model, this chapter analyzes the relationship between macroscopic transaction costs and China's economic growth and trade structure changes. The findings suggest that in the mid- and long-term, growth in China's macroscopic transaction costs does stimulate exports while restraining <b>domestic</b> <b>trade.</b> Thus, macroscopic <b>transaction</b> costs can be said to have indirectly changed China's trade structure leading to the persistent surplus it has recorded against its major trading partners over the last few years.

40|$|The {{economic}} cost of capital, as measured in Chapter 8, {{deals with the}} intertemporal comparisons. It links the annual flows of benefits and costs over a project's life to its initial capital investment. In the present chapter we deal with another facet of the act of raising project funds from the country's capital market. This facet concerns the distortions that are affected not intertemporally {{but at the same}} moment that the funds are raised. Investment and consumption expenditures by others in the market are displaced by the very act of raising the project's funds in the capital market. As a consequence, the government loses tariff revenue plus value added and other indirect taxes. These losses must be counted in the economic evaluation of any project, in addition to those linked to the spending of project funds on tradable or non-tradable goods and services, and in addition to the intertemporal distortions captured by the economic opportunity cost of capital. The existence of these indirect taxes on <b>domestic</b> and <b>trade</b> <b>transactions,</b> the economic value of foreign exchange differs from the market exchange rate {{and there will be a}} tax externality associated with expenditures on nontradables.

40|$|Abstract—How {{does the}} quality of {{national}} institutions that enforce {{the rule of law}} influence international trade? Anderson and Marcouiller argue that bad institutions located in the importer’s country deter international trade because they enable economic predators to steal and extort rents at the importer’s border. We complement this research and show how good institutions located in the exporter’s country enhance international trade, in particular, trade in complex products whose characteristics are difficult to fully specify in a contract. We argue that both exporter and importer institutions affect international as well as domestic transaction costs in complex and simple product markets. International transaction costs {{are a part of the}} costs of <b>trade.</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>transaction</b> costs affect complex and simple products differently, thereby changing a country’s comparative advantage in producing such goods. We find ample empirical evidence for these predictions: countries that have good institutions tend to export more complex products and import more simple products. Furthermore, insti-tutions have a stronger influence on trade via production costs (compar-ative advantage) than through international transactions costs. Interna-tional institutions seem to operate as substitutes for domestic institutions, because good domestic institutions are less important for promoting exports in those countries that have signed the New York Convention.
