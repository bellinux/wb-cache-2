500|$|Pope's {{wardrobe}} {{is designed}} by Scandal costume designer Lyn Paolo (known for costume design on The West Wing, ER and Shameless), {{and it has}} {{caught the attention of}} the Vogue staff. In 2014, Washington's portrayal of Pope and her promotion of Pope's style earned her acclaim as a style <b>influencer</b> from the Accessories Council. Paolo attempted to make Pope stand apart from the black, gray and dark blue colors of DC by outfitting her in [...] "chic pastels" [...] {{going so far as to}} put her in pink pants or Louboutin shoes at times. Some of her most respected wardrobe pieces are from notable fashion houses such as Ferragamo, Burberry, Gucci, Armani, Prada, Valentino, Tory Burch, and Michael Kors. The Valentino was saved for the season 1 finale. In addition to the luxurious elements of her wardrobe that are on loan from designers, Pope wears modest elements that Paolo picks up from Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdale's and Loehmann's. The Pope character has become somewhat of a style icon. Harper's Bazaar and Glamour analyze her wardrobe every week in a dedicated fashion watch columns. Time describes her as [...] "a real-world lifestyle tastemaker", pointing out that the Crate & Barrel wine glasses that she drinks from on the show sold out at the store. Washington and Paolo curated a Saks Fifth Avenue installation of Pope fashions in October 2013. That season, Pope's attire was part of a special collection at Saks Fifth Avenue. In September 2014, an Olivia Pope Scandal collection was set to debut at The Limited, in what was publicized as [...] "the first design collaboration between a national retailer and a top-rated network TV show, its costume designer and star". The collaboration included [...] "tops, pants, jackets and outerwear" [...] and incorporated items priced as low as $49. The collaboration includes 42 pieces. Vulture dedicated a feature to presenting every outfit Pope wore during season 2. When her wardrobe changed to more colorful and asymmetric looks in season 3, The Huffington Post dedicated a feature to this issue. During season 3, Entertainment Weekly ranked Pope's ten best outfits. Because Pope's wardrobe is pricey, there are features and websites dedicated to cheap alternatives to the exact wardrobe elements. Paolo suggests that the Pope style be purchased at Zara and Ann Taylor. In terms of jewelry, Pope wears long necklaces and exclusively wears Movado watches. She also generally uses one of her modest collection of Prada purses.|$|E

Whilst consumer choice is important to understand, the products available for consumers to choose from depend on the choices made along the supply chain. This research seeks to begin the investigation through examining the <b>influencers</b> that affect a distributor’s choice when considering taking on a new winery. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - Initial qualitative interviews of Distributors in Australia were used to establish and then pilot a decision (choice) set for use in a quantitative Best-Worse study. The results from the initial quantitative phase now offer an opportunity to extend the study into other geographic markets. FINDINGS - A consistent hierarchy of <b>influencers</b> was identified in the sample, which was able to demonstrate a difference in decision-making <b>influencers</b> between low and high volume distributors, lower and higher margin distribution firms as well as between those with an On-Premise focus opposed to Off-Premise focussed. A clearly different approach to decision making is seen in the higher volume and off-premise distributors in this survey.
