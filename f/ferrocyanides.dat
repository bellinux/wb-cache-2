50|$|Experiments {{have been}} done about the {{stability}} of ferric <b>ferrocyanide</b> in the soil around manufactured gas plant sites. Ferric <b>ferrocyanide</b> is, on its own, of fairly low toxicity. In fact, {{there is evidence that}} being complexed with iron retards the mobility of the cyanide ion, which is the problematic species of this compound. This means that the mobility of cyanide is entirely dependent on the stability of iron-cyanide complexes. Below pH 4 and above pH 6, ferric <b>ferrocyanide</b> begins to dissociate in water under this reaction:Fe4Fe(CN)63(s) + 12 H2O ↔ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 3Fe(CN)6−3(aq) + 3e− + 12H+ This dissolved <b>ferrocyanide</b> can then go through a first-order photochemical dissociation pathway if exposed to sunlight, dissociating to iron ions and <b>ferrocyanide</b> between the rates of 2.2% per hour to 40% per hour depending on the flow of the body of water. The following reactions show the dissocation of <b>ferrocyanide,</b> then the future of the iron ion:Fe(CN)63− → 6CN− + Fe3+Fe3+ + 3OH− → Fe(OH)3This leads to free cyanide ions, which are not retarded in mobility. The rate of photo-dissociation of <b>ferrocyanide</b> is given by:C(CN, t) = C(CN, 0)e0.39twhere C is concentration, (CN, t) is cyanide concentration at a specified unit of time, (CN, 0) is initial cyanide concentration, and t is time.|$|R

Despite the presence of the cyanide ligands, sodium ferrocyanide has low toxicity (acceptable daily intake 0-0.025 mg/kg body weight).

Calcium cyanide's high toxicity to touch, inhale, or ingest makes it useful as a rodenticide.

The <b>ferrocyanide</b> simulant primarily used in these studies was dried In-Farm- 1 B, Rev. 7, prepared by Westinghouse Hanford Company to simulate the waste generated when the In-Farm flowsheet was used to remove radiocesium from waste supernates in single-shell tanks at the Hanford Site. In the In-Farm flowsheet, nickel ion and <b>ferrocyanide</b> anion were added to waste supernates to precipitate sodium nickel <b>ferrocyanide,</b> Na{sub 2 }NiFe(CN) {sub 6 }, and co-precipitate radiocesium.

The <b>Ferrocyanide</b> Safety Project was initiated as a result of concern raised about the safe storage of <b>ferrocyanide</b> waste intermixed with oxidants, such as nitrate and nitrite salts, in Hanford Site single-shell tanks (SSTs). In the laboratory, such mixtures can be made to undergo uncontrolled or explosive reactions by heating dry reagents to over 200 {degrees}C. In 1987, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), published by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Final Environmental Impact Statement, Disposal of Hanford Defense High-Level Transuranic and Tank Waste, Hanford Site, Richland, Washington, included an environmental impact analysis of potential explosions involving ferrocyanide-nitrate mixtures. The EIS postulated that an explosion could occur during mechanical retrieval of saltcake or sludge from a <b>ferrocyanide</b> waste tank, and concluded that this worst-case accident could create enough energy to release radioactive material to the atmosphere through ventilation openings, exposing persons offsite to a short-term radiation dose of approximately 200 mrem. Later, in a separate study (1990), the General Accounting Office postulated a worst-case accident of one to two orders of magnitude greater than that postulated in the DOE EIS.

In concentrations ranging from 2. 48 10 4 up to 2. 85 10 3 M the additive was able to increase the solution critical supersaturation (up to 8 %) resulting in a significant crystallization inhibition effect, which promoted efflorescence growth on the porous stone surface as opposed to subflorescence growth. The former induced no damage to the stone support while the latter always resulted in crystallization pressure development inside the pores, causing granular disintegration—a process also known as ‘‘salt weathering’’. Significant changes in NaCl crystal growth morphology (from { 1 0 0 } towards { 1 1 0 }, { 1 1 1 } and { 2 1 0 } forms) were observed {{in the presence of}} ferrocyanide ions, which also promoted the growth of dendrites with their main growth axis parallel to / 111 S, and branched along / 100 S, at the highest supersaturation.

In batch experiments, metal hexacyanoferrate films showed high selectivities for cesium in concentrated sodium solutions.

40|$|In {{our recent}} letter [de Lacy Costello et al., 2009] we {{described}} {{the formation of}} spontaneous complex tessellations of the plane constructed in simple chemical reactions between drops of metal salts and ferricyanide or ferrocyanide loaded gels. In this paper, we provide more examples of binary tessellations and extend our analysis to tessellations constructed via tertiary mixtures of reactants. We also provide a classification system which describes the tessellation based on the reactivity of the metal salt with the substrate and also the cross-reactivity of the primary products. This results in balanced tessellations where both reactants have equal reactivity or unbalanced tessellations where one reactant has a lower reactivity with the gel. The products can also be partially or fully cross reactive which gives a highly complex tessellation. The tessellations {{are made up of}} colored cells (corresponding to different metal ferricyanides or <b>ferrocyanides)</b> separated by bisectors of low precipitate concentration. The tessellations constructed by these reactions constitute generalized Voronoi diagrams. In the case of certain binary or tertiary combinations of reactants where the diffusion/reaction rates differ, then multiplicatively weighted crystal growth Voronoi diagrams are constructed. Where one reactant has limited or no reactivity with the gel (or the products are cross reactive) then the fronts originating from the reactive metal ions cross the fronts originating from the partially reactive metal ions. The fronts can annihilate in the formation of a second Voronoi diagram relating to the relative positions of the reactive drops. Therefore, two or more generalised or weighted Voronoi diagrams can be calculated in parallel by these simple chemical systems. However when these reactions were used to calculate an additively weighted Voronoi diagram (the reaction was initiated at different time intervals) the diagram constructed did not correspond to the theoretical calculation. We use the failure of these reactions to construct an additively weighted Voronoi diagram to prove a mechanism of substrate competition for bisector formation. These tessellations are an important class of pattern forming reactions and are useful in modeling natural pattern forming phenomena {{in addition to being a}} great resource for scientific demonstrations...|$|E
