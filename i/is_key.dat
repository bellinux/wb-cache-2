5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability <b>is</b> <b>key.</b> Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} costly to provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to advancing the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption <b>is</b> <b>key</b> for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E
5|$|For some readers, Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of {{the script}} <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to interpreting the film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} skeleton key to unlock it.|$|E

5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E

The Spartan aids the local {{military}} in fighting the Covenant and evacuating the city, reuniting with Noble Team along the way. They retreat to an underground bunker when the Covenant begin to bombard the city with plasma, but Kat is killed by a Covenant sniper before they reach it. Recalled to Sword Base, Noble Team is guided underground to an ancient artifact that Halsey believes <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to winning the war against the Covenant. Six, Carter and Emile are entrusted with transporting the artificial intelligence Cortana, and the information she carries concerning the artifact, to the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn. Jun leaves the team to escort Halsey to another base.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of the Children as a significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection of the sexual purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E

In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille <b>is</b> <b>key</b> to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions.
