5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him. Jug {{responds}} that it is normal for a patient to feel this way about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Sadler's final book, Courtship and Love, was {{published}} by Macmillan Publishers. He wrote another title, A Doctor Talks With <b>His</b> <b>Patient,</b> but after it was rejected by a publisher, he decided to stop writing. In March 1957, Sadler was appointed as the superintendent of Barboursville State Hospital in Barboursville, West Virginia, where he stayed until July 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{ghost of}} Zero (Normand Fauteux) materializes {{at a local}} gay bathhouse. No one can see or hear him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him, {{although}} Zero does not show up on Burton's video camera. The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with <b>his</b> <b>Patient</b> Zero exhibit if Burton {{finds a way to}} make Zero appear.|$|E

50|$|This {{encounter}} {{caused him}} to radically change his medical practice.

5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A. Tripp, {{a psychologist who}} had put CBS in touch with <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> Larson, claimed that Salant felt the piece was pro-homosexuality. Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature of the subject matter. Commercial spots were filled by public service announcements for the Peace Corps and the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E
5|$|Chanderpaul {{made his}} Test debut in March 1994, {{selected}} as an all-rounder who could bowl leg breaks, against England. He reached his first century three years later, scoring an unbeaten 137 against India at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. During the initial phase of his career, Chanderpaul was criticised for {{his inability to}} convert half-centuries into centuries, but he proved his critics wrong during the 2001–02 series against India when he scored three centuries in five matches, thus earning {{the man of the}} series accolade. During that tournament, he batted for 1,513 minutes between dismissals, a record in Test cricket. Despite being well known for <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> batting, Chanderpaul scored a 69-ball century against Australia in 2003, which at the time was the third fastest century in terms of balls faced. His highest score in Test cricket is 203 not out, a total he achieved twice, first against South Africa in 2005, and then against Bangladesh in 2012. He has scored centuries against every Test playing nation with the exception of Sri Lanka, and has scored seven centuries against India, more than any other team.|$|E

25|$|On March 3, 2017, the Texas Medical Board sanctioned Burzynski, placing him on {{probation}} and fining him $40,000. Staff recommendations {{had been more}} punitive.

25|$|In the novella, {{the husband}} long {{suspected}} that <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> (Marion) was infatuated with him, {{while in the}} film it is a complete surprise and he seems shocked. He is also more overwhelmed by the orgy in the film than in the novella. Fridolin is socially bolder but less sexual with the prostitute (Mizzi in the novella, Domino in the film). Fridolin is also conscious of looking old in the novella, though he hardly does in the film.|$|E
5000|$|His {{remedies}} were, therefore, {{directed to}} the restoration of harmony. He trusted much to changes of diet, massages, bathing and exercise, though he also employed emetics and bleeding. A {{part of the great}} popularity which he enjoyed depended upon his prescribing the liberal use of wine to <b>his</b> <b>patients,</b> and upon <b>his</b> attending to their every need, and indulging their inclinations. He would treat all <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> fairly and not discriminate based upon gender or mental illness. He believed treating <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> kindly and amicably was a staple to being a good physician. Cito tuto jucunde meaning to treat <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> [...] "swiftly, safely, and sweetly" [...] was a motto that he followed. [...] Many physicians during his era had a tendency to be uncaring and have a lack of sympathy towards their patients.|$|R

Years later she asserted that {{he wanted her to}} be <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> at age 23 and made physical advances toward her, and that the horror she then felt toward the Swedish royal family, because of their unlimited support of Munthe, was the main reason she fled them and filed for divorce from Prince Wilhelm.|$|E
25|$|Halloween II is a 1981 American slasher {{film and}} the second {{installment}} in the Halloween film series. Directed by Rick Rosenthal, written and produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, it is a direct sequel to Carpenter's Halloween, immediately picking up where it had left off. Set {{on the same night}} of October 31, 1978, Michael Myers follows survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to a nearby hospital while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is still in pursuit of <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|E
25|$|If Smackout {{proved the}} Jordan-Quinn union's viability, their next {{creation}} proved their most enduring. Amplifying Luke Grey's tall talesmanship to Midwestern braggadocio, Quinn developed Fibber McGee and Molly with Jim as the foible-prone Fibber and Marian playing <b>his</b> <b>patient,</b> common sense, honey-natured wife. The show premiered on NBC April 16, 1935, {{and though it}} took three seasons to become an irrevocable hit, it became the country's top-rated radio series. In 1935, Jim Jordan won the Burlington Liars' Club championship with a story about catching an elusive rat.|$|E

The overall goal is to work with each of <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> to achieve a higher level of wellness. Through extensive research, the Tony Mills Medical Practice is able to offer the most up-to-date therapies for his patients' medical needs.|$|R
25|$|Freud himself {{reserved}} initial judgement on the matter, and was swiftly told by Dora {{that her}} father had a relationship with Frau K, and that she felt he was surreptitiously palming her off on Herr K in return. By initially accepting her reading of events, Freud was able to remove her cough symptom; but by pressing her to accept her own implication in the complex interfamily drama, and an attraction to Herr K, he alienated <b>his</b> <b>patient,</b> who abruptly finished the treatment after 11 weeks, producing, Freud reported bitterly, a therapeutic failure.|$|E
25|$|Palmer and <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> Harvey Lillard gave differing {{accounts}} of {{when and how}} Palmer began to experiment with spinal manipulation. Palmer recalled an incident in 1895 when he was investigating the medical history of a partially deaf man, Harvey Lillard. Lillard informed Palmer that while working in a cramped area seventeen years earlier, he felt a 'pop' in his back, and had been nearly deaf ever since. Palmer’s examination found a sore lump which he believed was a spinal misalignment and a possible cause of Lillard's poor hearing. Palmer claimed to have corrected the misalignment and that Lillard's hearing improved.|$|E
25|$|Padeen (Patrick Colman) is Maturin's {{longtime}} servant and loblolly boy. Only Maturin is able {{to communicate}} with him, as Padeen has a cleft palate and can speak only in the Irish tongue. He becomes addicted to opium after he is anaesthesized with laudanum following a shipboard accident in The Letter of Marque, and found out by Martin. He breaks into an apothecary shop to steal some. He is caught and transported to New South Wales, but later pardoned. <b>His</b> <b>patient,</b> gentle nature is instrumental in bringing Brigid, Maturin's disabled (possibly autistic) daughter, out of her shell. In the 2003 , Padeen was played by John DeSantis.|$|E

25|$|Ada lasted {{through the}} spring and summer of 1935. Later it was said that Waddingham was quite {{attentive}} to her. In September 1935 Ada received a visit from an old family friend, Mrs Alice Briggs, who spent an afternoon cheering her up. Mrs Briggs told Waddingham that she would have Ada over for tea at her home in a couple of days. But on 11 September (the next day) Sullivan advised Dr H. H. Mansfield that <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> Ada was in a coma. Mansfield came and found Ada was dead. As this was expected the doctor was not suspicious, and after getting further details from Waddingham he filled out a death certificate that Ada died of cardiovascular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss then batted to {{tea with}} composure, taking the {{boundaries}} off Test debutant Shahadat Hossain in particular, and the pair made 70 runs before tea – meaning that England were only 38 off with ten wickets in hand after two sessions. An hour after tea, England {{brought up the}} lead, with Strauss having notched his fifty despite looking slightly shaky against Anwar Hossain Monir bowling, and then being dropped on 51. Trescothick then made his fifty with a four off Mohammad Rafique. The opening partnership eventually was worth 148, as Strauss was nearly lbw on 69 with an inswinging ball on one ball and then finally lbw on the next, Mashrafe Mortaza getting rewards for <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> bowling.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} sources for the scare was Michelle Remembers, a 1980 book by the Canadian {{psychiatrist}} Lawrence Pazder in which he detailed what he claimed were the repressed memories of <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> (and wife) Michelle Smith. Smith had claimed that as a child she had been abused by her family in Satanic rituals in which babies were sacrificed and Satan himself appeared. In 1983, allegations were made that the McMartin family—owners of a preschool in California—were guilty of sexually abusing the children in their care during Satanic rituals. The allegations resulted in a lengthy and expensive trial, in which all of the accused would eventually be cleared. The publicity generated by the case resulted in similar allegations being made in various {{other parts of the}} United States.|$|E
