2500|$|Several historians {{take the}} middle ground between condemning reparations and {{supporting}} the argument {{that they were not}} a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, [...] "Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy" [...] as had been feared, however the [...] "psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system". P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a [...] "strain on the German balance of payments", they could be paid and were [...] "compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry". According to Martel, Robert Boyce said reparations were [...] "a heavy burden on Germany, both as a financial charge...and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments". However, he says that while [...] "Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations" [...] this was far from the truth, and that [...] "...Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad". William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, [...] "an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt". However, Charles Feinstein writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans [...] "to accept even a modest <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries". Feinstein says that [...] "even if the economic aspects...were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany".|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career, Le Blant was focused on memorializing the revolt that occurred against the French Revolution in the Vendée. This campaign against Revolutionary authority began in 1773 and ended in 1796 with the capture and execution of the last of its major leaders. Le Blant portrayed the leaders and occurrences of [...] "La Vendée in virtually all of his major works. The Vendée revolt {{is one of the most}} controversial subjects in French history. A series of new edicts from the Revolutionary government in Paris is credited with setting off the revolt. These included an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation,</b> conscription and a number of anti-clerical measures that the deeply religious people of the region resisted. [...] The Revolutionary troops were spread thin in the region, and as the revolt widened the hastily formed Catholic Army of the Vendee managed to capture a number of towns and win a series of pitched battles. Eventually, through superior numbers and equipment, the forces of the Revolution defeated the rebels, and the campaign to put down the revolt became notoriously savage. While there were atrocities on both sides, the government in Paris wanted the rebellion to be put down savagely in order to discourage further revolts against its authority, and it was. The most modern academic estimates are that about a quarter of the population – men, women and children – were killed by the troops of the Revolutionary and their sympathizers.|$|E

2500|$|Various [...] "plans" [...] {{to resolve}} the crisis were suggested; Sir Otto Niemeyer, a {{representative}} of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer Ted Theodore proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt. The [...] "Premier's Plan" [...] finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation.</b> In March 1931, Lang announced that interest due in London would not be paid and the Federal government stepped in to meet the debt. In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Game, had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury. Game judged it was illegal. Lang refused to withdraw his order and, on 13 May, he was dismissed by Governor Game. At June elections, Lang Labor's seats collapsed.|$|E

That first year was a bad one to him, but he set his teeth and quietly bore all that befell him; the odd, brutal task, paid for at half the usual wages, the frequent rebuffs, the long nights spent shelterless in the bush, utter weariness, and often downright hunger. It was a hard school, but it taught him much, and he graduated as a man, strong and comely of body, and resolute of mind. What was more, he had, though he scarcely realized it, after all, only left behind in England a cramped life embittered by a steady shrinkage in the rent roll and as steady an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> and expenses.

50|$|When {{unemployment}} {{of resources}} in the economy is high, and cash, in effect, is being hoarded in the financial and credit system, the fiscal multiplier may be 1 or greater.
