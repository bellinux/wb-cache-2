50|$|The methods {{combine the}} {{specificity}} of the Mabs for antigen capture and concentration with the sensitivity of a surround optical fiber detection technology. In contrast to previously described methods for detection of PrPSc in brain homogenates, these techniques, when used to study brain homogenates, do not use seeded polymerization, amplification, or enzymatic digestion (for example, by proteinase K, or “PK”). This is important in that previous reports have indicated the existence of PrPSc isoforms with varied PK sensitivity, which decreases reliability of the assay. The sensitivity of this assay makes it suitable as a platform for rapid prion <b>detection</b> <b>assay</b> in biological fluids. In addition to prion diseases, the method may provide a means for rapid, high-throughput testing for {{a wide spectrum of}} infections and disorders.|$|E

50|$|Most recently, {{population}} dynamics of aphids in tulip fields were monitored during three growing seasons. Simultaneously, {{the period of}} TBV transmission by aphids was investigated experimentally by exposing small tulip plots during specified intervals to naturally occurring aphids. Finally, timing of virus spread was correlated with aphid {{population dynamics}} and weather conditions. In 2007 {{it was discovered that}} TBV transmission started in April, while the first aphids were not found until May. Apparently, the first aphids of the season had already contributed, in great extent, to the virus transmission, which was observed locally in the tulip plots. In addition, a second, but distinct, TBV isolate was identified, which resulted in the design of an improved TBV <b>detection</b> <b>assay.</b> These results should enable formulation of crop protection guidelines that are fine-tuned with the risk of virus transmission, which will help decrease environmental damage caused by pesticides.|$|E

The objectives {{of the present study}} were to develop a specific and simple antigen-based ELISA method for diagnosis of hydatidosis and compare it with antibody detection method. The subjects in this study included 89 patients in the following groups: surgically confirmed hydatidosis patients (35 cases), control with other parasitic diseases (29 cases), and healthy controls (25 cases). Hyperimmune serum was raised against hydatid cyst fluid in rabbits. Anti-hydatid cyst IgG was purified by affinity chromatography using protein A column and labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Collected sera were assessed for hydatid cyst antigens and antibody by ELISA. Circulating hydatid antigen was found in 9 out of 35 patients with surgically confirmed hydatidosis. A sensitivity of 25. 7 % and a specificity of 98. 0 % were calculated for the antigen <b>detection</b> <b>assay.</b> Antibody detection by indirect ELISA, using antigen B, showed that 94. 2 % of patients (33 cases) have anti-hydatid cyst antibodies in their serum while cross reaction was noted in a few of non-hydatidosis patients.

Histological, immunohistochemical and molecular <b>detection</b> <b>assays</b> are of outstanding importance for the examination of tissues of aborted foetuses. While histology and immunohistochemistry allow direct assessment of pathomorphological changes caused by infection, molecular <b>detection</b> <b>assays</b> such as PCR are superior because of higher sensitivity and specificity in identifying N. caninum in foetal tissues. Serological tests, such as ELISA, are useful in determining whether an animal has been infected with N. caninum.

When the dye labelled oligonucleotide nanoparticle conjugates are exposed to the same conditions there is a pronounced increase in the stability for both thioctic acid and thiol modified sequences.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnostic}} {{value and}} prognostic significance of {{circulating tumor cell}} (CTC) detection in patients with bladder cancer is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to consolidate current evidence {{regarding the use of}} CTC <b>detection</b> <b>assays</b> to diagnose bladder and other urothelial cancers and the association of CTC positivity with advanced, remote disease. Methods Studies that investigated the presence of CTCs in the peripheral blood of patients with bladder cancer and/or urothelial cancer were identified and reviewed. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-) of CTC detection in individual studies were calculated and meta-analyzed by random effects model. Overall odds ratio of CTC positivity in patients with advanced disease versus those with organ-confined cancer was also calculated. Results Overall sensitivity of CTC <b>detection</b> <b>assays</b> was 35. 1 % (95 %CI, 32. 4 - 38 %); specificity, LR+, and LR- was 89. 4 % (95 %CI, 87. 2 - 91. 3 %), 3. 77 (95 %CI, 1. 95 - 7. 30) and 0. 72 (95 %CI, 0. 64 - 0. 81). CTC-positive patients {{were significantly more likely to}} have advanced (stage III-IV) disease compared with CTC-negative patients (OR, 5. 05; 95 %CI, 2. 49 - 10. 26). Conclusions CTC evaluation can confirm tumor diagnosis and identify patients with advanced bladder cancer.
