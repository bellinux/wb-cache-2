5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} <b>Fourth</b> Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v.

He argued that the <b>Fourth</b> Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
