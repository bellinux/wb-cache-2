500|$|As the NWC {{continued}} its studies, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) annihilated the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. Japan {{had already been}} a concern of the U.S. Navy. Strategist and Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan had warned then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt in 1897 of a much greater likelihood of conflict in the Pacific than in the Atlantic. Roosevelt himself, as President of the United States, had written before Tsushima to British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice, [...] "The Japs <b>interest</b> <b>me</b> and I like them. I am perfectly well aware that if they win out it may possibly mean a struggle between them and us in the future." [...] Tsushima sealed {{the outcome of the}} Russo-Japanese War in Japan's favor, signaled its emergence as a world power and began a period of rivalry with the United States over intentions in the Pacific theater, as the two now became the dominant military powers there. An immediate consequence was the four [...] armored cruisers, laid down between 1905 and 1908. These ships were designed to carry four [...] guns, a size generally allocated to capital ships and unprecedented for armored cruisers. They would be protected with [...] of belt and turret armour and [...] of deck armour and be capable of a speed of 20.5 knots. The Tsukubas were intended {{to take the place of}} aging battleships and thus showed Japan's intention of continuing to use armored cruisers in fleet engagements. They were also exactly the type of ships for which the college had argued unsuccessfully to add to the U.S. Navy before switching to battlecruisers.|$|E

500|$|Due to the band's lack of {{creative}} {{control on the}} first album, Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of the Cure's second album Seventeen Seconds, which he co-produced with Mike Hedges. The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts. A single from the album, [...] "A Forest", became the band's first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart. The album was {{a departure from the}} Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as [...] "morose, atmospheric, very different to Three Imaginary Boys." [...] In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said, [...] "For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time." [...] At the same time, Smith was pressed concerning the concept of an alleged [...] "anti-image". Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be [...] "elaborately disguising their plainness", stating, [...] "We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand." [...] That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don't Cry, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, [...] "I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music—the sort of thing that didn't <b>interest</b> <b>me</b> at all." ...|$|E

The morning program was {{described}} in an ad for WOR as [...] "a show deliberately planned to help women adapt their homes and habits to changing economic conditions" [...] related to World War II. The show included [...] "weekly reviews of exceptional retail ads in metropolitan newspapers." [...] It began as a quarter-hour program broadcast three days a week. By November 1942, it had expanded to 25 minutes six times weekly.|$|E

Not {{necessarily}} a subject, but we had a direction before we wrote it. As you get older it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I would say this album [...] has a theme. I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that <b>interest</b> <b>me</b> deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Then {{there was}} Japan. Its naval {{build-up}} following {{the end of}} the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 and its forced return of the Liaotung peninsula to China under pressure from Russia, Germany and France (in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Triple Intervention") had at its core a [...] "Six-Six Program" [...] of six battleships and six (eventually eight) armored cruisers comparable to the British Cressy class. The [...] followed the basic pattern for these cruisers—on a [...] displacement, she carried four [...] and twelve [...] guns, was protected by a [...] main belt, [...] armored deck and [...] turret armor and steamed at [...] United States President Theodore Roosevelt, while impressed with Japan's success in the war and its modernization overall, considered its actions a threat to American interests in the Pacific region. This in turn had motivated him to maintain a [...] "controlling voice" [...] in the Philippines after the Philippine–American War ended in 1902 and would encourage him to send the Great White Fleet on its worldwide voyage in 1907. (Unfortunately, the visit of the fleet would inspire Japan to step up its building program still further.) Japan's 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese War would usher its entrance as a world power and begin a rivalry with the United States over dominance in the Pacific. As Roosevelt would surmise during that conflict in a letter to British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice, [...] "The Japs <b>interest</b> <b>me</b> and I like them.
