5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> on his feet as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E

500|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer. She told MTV [...] "I wrote [...] about this guy that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song." [...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain. <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a tranny. I was like, 'Wait a minute, have I been barking up the wrong genre of tree?'" ...|$|E

Random shots of pandas and rain forest imagery are also spliced into the video, and it ends with Ocean being slapped by the ghostly image of a woman. MTV further summarized the video; [...] "Ocean is surrounded by ghostly incarnations of beautiful women, tigers and pandas. At one point, Ocean smears {{what appears to be}} novocaine — or Procaine — on his solemn-looking face." [...] Supposedly, it required several takes to achieve the correct angle for the slapping moment, and the spliced images were placed in the video because Ocean asked the director whether or not they [...] "can we put some kind of Asian-rain-forest stuff in there?" [...] Billboard wrote that the video was [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "eerie". Pitchfork named the video amongst the best of the year.|$|E

500|$|In {{the eleven}} years {{up to and}} {{including}} Traviata, Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to Aida), he wrote only six new works for the stage. [...] Verdi was happy to return to Sant'Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a [...] "total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that's all". A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: [...] "I'm not doing anything. I don't read. I don't write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble caused me by I vespri siciliani. Cursed operas!" [...] An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: [...] "His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything you like that is exaggerated. [...] <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed." ...|$|E
500|$|Most reviewers were {{impressed}} with {{the premise of the}} novel, but critical of its melodramatic style. While Griffin praised the plot and concept as [...] "clever", she argued that Niffenegger's writing is usually [...] "pedestrian" [...] and the story at times contrived. Heidi Darroch of the National Post agreed, contending that the story has an excess of overwrought emotional moments [...] "which never quite add up to a fully developed plot". Writing in The Chicago Tribune, Carey Harrison praised the originality of the novel, specifically the intersection of child-bearing and time travel. Despite appreciating the novel's premise, Amidon complained that the implications of Henry's time-traveling were poorly thought out. For example, Henry has foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks but does nothing to try to prevent them. Instead, on 11 September 2001, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> early [...] "to listen to the world being normal for a little while longer". Amidon also criticized the novel's [...] "overall clumsiness", writing that Niffenegger is [...] "a ham-fisted stylist, long-winded and given to sudden eruptions of cliche". Miriam Shaviv agreed to an extent, writing in The Jerusalem Post, [...] "There are no original or even non-cliched messages here. True love, Niffenegger seems to be telling us, is timeless, and can survive even the worst [...] yet, the book is a page-turner, delicately crafted and psychologically sound." [...] The Library Journal described the novel as [...] "skillfully written with a blend of distinct characters and heartfelt emotions"; it recommended that public libraries purchase multiple copies of the book.|$|E

2500|$|Mencken countered the {{arguments}} for Anglo-Saxon superiority prevalent in his time in a 1923 essay entitled [...] "The Anglo-Saxon", which argued {{that if there was}} {{such a thing as a}} pure [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] race, it was defined by its inferiority and cowardice.
