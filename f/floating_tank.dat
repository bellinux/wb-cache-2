40|$|Abstract: A new {{unpowered}} decanter {{system was}} designed to lift the decanting sink only by the dynamic provided by liquid level difference.

The system was run by the difference of liquid level between <b>float</b> <b>tank</b> pool and reaction pool. When the level difference got small, the <b>float</b> <b>tank</b> would rise and hence lift up the decanting sink in the reaction pool to up above the liquid level; when the level difference got large, the <b>float</b> <b>tank</b> no longer received the buoyance so the decanting sink would float in the reaction pool and decant.

40|$|AbstractA {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to determine the geometry, operating parameters, and other key features of large circular or octagonal culture tanks used to produce Atlantic salmon smolt and post-smolt at six major Norwegian Atlantic salmon production companies. A total of 55 large tanks were reported at seven land-based hatchery locations, i. e., averaging 7. 9 (range of 4 – 12) large tanks per land-based site. In addition, one 21, 000 m 3 floating fiberglass tank in sea was reported. Culture volume ranged from 500 to 1300 m 3 for each land-based tank. Most tanks were circular, but one site used octagonal tanks. Land-based tank diameters ranged from 14. 5 to 20 m diameter, whereas the <b>floating</b> <b>tank</b> was 40 m diameter. Maximum tank depths ranged from 3. 5 to 4. 5 m at land-based facilities, which produced diameter-to-average-depth ratios of 3. 6 : 1 to 5. 5 : 1 m:m. The <b>floating</b> <b>tank</b> was much deeper at 20 m, with a diameter-to-average-depth ratio of only 2. 4 : 1 m:m. All land-based tanks had floors sloping at 4. 0 – 6. 5 % toward the tank center and various pipe configurations that penetrated the culture tank water volume at tank center. These pipes and sloping floors were used to reduce labor when removing dead fish and harvesting fish. Maximum flow ranged from 3 to 19 m 3 /min per land-based tank, with 400 m 3 /min at the <b>floating</b> <b>tank,</b> but tank flow was adjustable at most facilities. Land-based tanks were flushed at a mean hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 35 – 170 min. Maximum feed load on each land-based tank ranged from 525 to 850 kg/day, but the <b>floating</b> <b>tank</b> reached 3700 kg/day. Almost half of the large tanks reported in this survey were installed or renovated since 2013, including the three tank systems with the highest flow rate per tank (greater than 17. 6 m 3 /min). These more recent tanks were operated at more rapid tank HRT’s, i. e., from 34. 8 to 52. 5 min, than the 67 – 170 min HRT typical of the large tanks built before 2013. In addition, flow per unit of feed load in land-based tanks that began operating before 2010 were lower (19 – 30 m 3 flow/kg feed) than in tanks that began operating later (33 – 40 m 3 flow/kg feed). In comparison, the <b>floating</b> <b>tank</b> operates at a maximum daily tank flow to feed load of 160 m 3 flow/kg feed, which is the least intensive of all tanks surveyed. Survey {{results suggest that the}} recently built tanks have been designed to operate at a reduced metabolic loading per unit of flow, a tendency that would improve water quality throughout the culture tank, all else equal. This trend is possible due to the ever increasing application of water recirculating systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a hybrid frequency-time domain {{simulation}} scheme {{is used to}} analyze the dynamic response of sea-wave-induced fully non-linear sloshing fluid in a floating oil storage tank. The hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces are firstly obtained by a potential-theory-based three-dimensional (3 D) radiation/diffraction panel program (DIFFRACT) in frequency domain. Then, a time domain model based on frequency domain data is built upon the Cummins equations to study the corresponding simulations of tank motions. State-space models are proposed as approximate representations of the convolutions in this equation. Navier-Stokes equations are applied to simulate the nonlinear fluid sloshing in time-domain and solved using the finite difference method (FDM). The volume of fluid method (VOF) is used to track the non-linear free surface. The multi-cable mooring system is used as a sea-keeping approach.

Some examples of floating structure with internal liquid are: vessels with roll damping tanks, floating hydrocarbon storage facility, LNG tankers and etc. A floating oil storage tank is considered in this study, which has a cuboid shaped external wall, cylinder shaped internal wall and simple structure configurations for its roof and bottom. Influence of internal liquid on the hydrostatic response of floating structures is well established and {{must be taken into}} consideration. The internal liquid reduces the stability of floating structures. The focus of this study is the influence of internal liquid on the hydrodynamic response of <b>floating</b> <b>tank.</b> Frequency domain analysis is performed with WAMIT, for partially filled tank with both solid mass and liquid. mass. By comparing the different cases, the force induced by the internal liquid on the <b>floating</b> <b>tank</b> is illustrated. Based on the WAMIT calculated radiation damping force for the external flow, Impulse Response Function (IRF) connecting frequency domain and time domain solution is constructed and the force and moment induced by internal liquid is considered as an excitation force. By assuming linear tank motion, the internal liquid induced force is related to the incoming wave by a set of force transfer functions and it is moved to the right hand side of the tank motion equation. In practice, this set of force transfer function due to internal liquid has to be combined with the wave excitation force transfer function and it is the total force transfer function (internal liquid plus wave excitation) to be imported to SIMO. SIMO time domain simulation is performed in regular waves.

Rainbow trout were grown with an FCR of 0. 97 from 83 to 697 g over 111 days (specific growth rate (SGR), 1. 91 %/day) between June and September, when average daily water temperatures ranged from 12. 3 to 18. 2 °C. Over the same time period, mulloway grew only from 100 to 116 g, however, once temperatures increased to approximately 21 °C in October, food intake increased and mulloway grew to an average size of 384 g over 174 days with an SGR and FCR of 0. 68 %/day and 1. 39, respectively. Barramundi stocked in November with an average weight of 40 g increased to 435 g in 138 days (SGR 1. 73 %/day) with an FCR of 0. 90. The SIFTS significantly reduced nutrient input into the pond by removing settleable wastes as a thick sludge with a dry matter content of 5 – 10 %.

40|$|Some {{storage tank}} {{terminals}} located in hurricane prone regions were heavily struck by hurricanes. An {{example is the}} storage tank terminal of Stolthaven Terminals (Stolt-Nielsen Limited) which is located in New-Orleans and was severely struck by Hurricane Katrina and Isaac. Damage to the terminal was caused by high wind pressures, but mainly due to flooding of the terminal caused by the overflowing levee. The storage tanks did not possess sufficient weight to counterbalance the buoyancy load generated by the flood. Due to this, storage tanks were lifted off their foundation and damage occurred to the bottom plate and the connections. Chemical liquid stored in the tank had now {{found its way into}} the environment. This disaster resulted in high costs and insurance claims from the contamination. The problem can be formulated as: "How can storage tank damage and chemical spill best be prevented during a flood?" Alternative solutions for a flood proof storage tank are presented which are applicable to the still-to-be-built new terminal next to the present terminal. Also a combination of the flood proof tank and management of tank operations is considered. 3 of the alternatives seem structurally feasible and are further elaborated in the report. These are: 1. The use of a steel-concrete-steel sandwich slab (SCS slab) inside the tank. This consists of 2 steel plates connected to a concrete core by means of shear studs. The slab should have sufficient weight to counteract the buoyancy load. [Tank alternative A] 2. Anchoring the area of the bottom plate of the tank to the concrete foundation by means of shear studs.

40|$|Secondary {{salinisation}} has rendered over 100 {{million hectares}} of land throughout the world, and over 5 million hectares in Australia, unsuitable for conventional agriculture. The utilization of salinised land {{and its associated}} water resources for mariculture is an adaptive approach to this environmental problem with many potential economic, social and environmental benefits. Despite this, inland mariculture is yet to develop into an industrial-scale, rural enterprise. The main {{aim of this study}} was therefore to identify and address some of the technical and biological limitations to the development of an inland finfish mariculture industry. Three technical aspects essential to the development of an Australian inland mariculture industry were reviewed; potential sources of water, the species suitable for culture in these water sources and the production systems available to produce them. Based on factors such as their quantity, quality and proximity to infrastructure, the most appropriate water sources were deemed to be groundwater obtained from interception schemes and waters from operational or disused mines. In terms of species, mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) were identified as having many positive attributes for inland mariculture, including being temperate and therefore having the ability to be cultured year-round in the regions where the majority of secondary salinity occurs. Seasonal production of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in ponds in the temperate climatic zones has potential, but may be more appropriate for those salinised water sources located in the warmer parts of the country. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were also identified as having excellent potential provided water temperature can be maintained below the upper lethal limit and also have potential for seasonal production, perhaps in rotation with barramundi. In terms of production systems, pond-based culture methods were found to have many advantages specific to inland mariculture. Static ponds enable culture in areas with low groundwater yield and more cost-effective potassium supplementation compared with flow through ponds. Static ponds also largely overcome the issues associated with the disposal of salt-laden and eutrophied waste water; however yields from static ponds are typically low and limited by the nutrient input into the pond. In response to the yield constraints of static pond culture, a new culture technology known as the Semi-Intensive <b>Floating</b> <b>Tank</b> System (SIFTS) was designed, patented and constructed in collaboration with the aquaculture industry and tested in a static inland saline pond in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. This technology was designed to reduce nutrient input into ponds by the collection of settleable wastes and to provide large volumes of well-oxygenated water to the target species, to ameliorate the loss of fish from low dissolved oxygen during strong microalgal blooms. The three species identified above has having excellent potential for inland mariculture (mulloway, rainbow trout, and barramundi) were grown in SIFTS held within a 0. 13 ha static, inland saline water body (salinity 14 ppt) over a period of 292 days, yielding the equivalent of 26 tonnes/ha/year (total for all three species).

The smallest losses are for internal <b>floating</b> roof <b>tank</b> and domed external floating roof tank: 0. 072 and 0. 044, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the liquid with low volatility of low BTEX amount can be stored in tanks with fixed roof. In this case, the prevailing economic aspect, because the total amount of evaporative loss does not significantly affect the environment. On the other hand, storage of volatile derivatives with high levels of BTEX is not justified from the economic point of view or from the standpoint of the environment protection...|$|R
