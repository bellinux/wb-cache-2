40|$|An {{incident}} {{alike to}} <b>egg-drop</b> <b>syndrome</b> (EDS) occurred in commercial egg laying chickens in Gazipur district, Bangladesh from July to November 2005. The chickens showed decreased egg production along with production of shell less and soft shelled eggs {{when they were}} at predicted peak production age. Nutritional status, especially crude protein (16. 65 - 18. 50 %) and calcium (2. 15 - 3. 62 %) content of the supplied feed was within the range. Virological and serological investigations on causes of decreased egg production and production of soft-shelled and shell less egg by the laying hens revealed that the responsible causative agent is EDS virus. Total seven EDS viruses were isolated from cloacal swab (4), soft-shelled eggs (2) and feces (1). The isolation rate 71. 43 % (5 / 7) was higher in second passage than in first passage 28. 57 % (2 / 7) in duck embryos. None of the 7 viruses grew in chicken embryo even after second passage.

40|$|Respiratory {{diseases}} have {{obviously a}} major pathological impact in poultry, {{mainly in the}} last period of production (broilers and meat turkeys). They are also associated with <b>egg-drop</b> <b>syndromes</b> in layers and breeders with losses in both egg and day-old-chick production. In broiler turkeys, respiratory conditions are not only directly impacting growth and viability, but lead to secondary leg bacterial arthritis, resulting in increased condemnation rates and increased use of antibiotics. Avian metapneumoviruses, Mycoplasma spp. Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) and/or E. coli are considered as key co-infectious agents of respiratory syndromes. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses and Aspergillus sp., Pasteurella multocida or Chlamydia psittaci may also be involved in respiratory outbreaks in turkeys. An innovative quantitative PCR method was developed, based on a microfluidic technology: more than 20 respiratory pathogens (viruses, bacteria and fungi) were targeted and a Sybr Green PCR assay was optimized for each one. These primers were subsequently used in a high throughput PCR microfluidic platform, resulting in a multiplex-like quantitative PCR assay. The 48 x 48 array {{used in this study}} (an integrated fluidic circuit component, IFC) is an efficient solution for large-scale, real-time qPCR. The matrix of channels, chambers and integrated valves allows the processing of more than 2000 reactions, i. e. the screening of up to 48 samples against a set of 48 primers pairs. A 96 x 96 array may be used in the same way. Swabs were sampled from 2011 to 2013 on 25 turkey flocks facing respiratory syndromes (10 to 20 birds/flock) and submitted to this screening assay. These analyses showed a very comprehensive overview of respiratory co-infections in turkey poults, suggesting widespread co-infections. This screening approach may be used on a larger extend for a comprehensive description of respiratory co-infection profiles in poultry...|$|R

At present, IB {{is more common}} and far more spread than EDS. The large genetic and phenotypic diversity of IBV have been resulting in common vaccination failures. In addition, new strains of IBV, not present in commercial vaccines, can cause the disease in IB vaccinated flocks. Attenuated vaccines will revert to virulence by consecutive passage in chickens in densely populated areas, and may reassort with field strains, generating potentially important variants.|$|R

Serum lipocalin- 2 levels are elevated in obese patients. Obesity and insulin resistance are cardinal characteristics of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, there are limited data on serum lipocalin- 2 levels in patients with PCOS. The aim of the present study was to assess serum lipocalin- 2 levels in PCOS. Methods We studied 200 patients with PCOS and 50 healthy female volunteers. Results Serum lipocalin- 2 levels were slightly higher in women with PCOS compared with controls (65. 4 +/- 34. 3 vs. 60. 3 +/- 26. 0 ng/ml, respectively) but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|BACKGROUND Progress in {{management}} of {{congenital heart disease}} has shifted mortality largely to adulthood. However, adult survivors with complex congenital heart disease are not cured and remain at risk of premature death as young adults. Thus, {{our aim was to}} describe the evolution and mortality risk of adult patient cohorts with complex congenital heart disease. METHODS Among 12 [*] 644 adults with congenital heart disease followed at a single center from 1980 to 2009, 176 had Eisenmenger <b>syndrome,</b> <b>76</b> had unrepaired cyanotic defects, 221 had atrial switch operations for transposition of the great arteries, 158 had congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, 227 had Fontan palliation, and 789 had repaired tetralogy of Fallot. We depict the 30 -year evolution of these 6 patient cohorts, analyze survival probabilities in adulthood, and predict future number of deaths through 2029. RESULTS Since 1980, there has been a steady increase in numbers of patients followed, except in cohorts with Eisenmenger syndrome and unrepaired cyanotic defects. Between 1980 and 2009, 308 patients in the study cohorts (19 %) died. At the end of 2009, 85 % of survivors were younger than 50 years. Survival estimates for all cohorts were markedly lower than for the general population, with important differences between cohorts. Over the upcoming two decades, we predict a substantial increase in numbers of deaths among young adults with subaortic right ventricles, Fontan palliation, and repaired tetralogy of Fallot.

We reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500 - 800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1 q 32 -q 41 [Sander et al., 1994 : Hum Mol Genet 3 : 576 - 578]. Along with cleft lip/palate and lip pits, affected relatives exhibit developmental delays, {{suggesting that the}} function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted. To further localize the VWS gene we searched for other deletions that cause VWS. An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker, D 1 S 3753. From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals, we detected an allele loss in one family, indicating {{the presence of a}} deletion. In this family, the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of VWS.

Aim: To describe objectively measured physical activity level, cardiorespiratory fitness and diabetes risk in a group of Pakistani immigrant men living in Oslo, Norway. Methods: One hundred and fifty Pakistani immigrant men in the age group 25 - 60 years were included. Physical activity level was assessed with an accelerometer. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured until exhaustion on a treadmill, and diabetes risk was evaluated with an oral glucose tolerance test. Results: Mean age was 37. 3 years (SD= 7. 7).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} that decisions about prenatal testing should a) be informed, and b) reflect the individual's attitudes and values. Most {{research has focused on}} information and attitudes in relation to the tests but there has been little attention given to these factors in relation to the target condition. AIMS: This thesis is concerned with informed choice in the context of prenatal testing for Down's syndrome. The main aims were to describe the written information that women receive about Down's syndrome prior to prenatal screening, characterise understandings of Down's syndrome that exist independently of the testing context, and identify the relationships between understandings of Down's syndrome, intentions towards using testing and termination, and actual screening choices. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study 1 employed a content analysis of information about Down syndrome contained in 80 prenatal screening leaflets. Information about Down's syndrome was low in quantity (the median number of statements was one and 33 % percent of leaflets contained no descriptive information {{on the nature of the}} condition). The majority of statements (63 %) were rated as negative in tone, (25 % were rated as neutral and 19 % were rated as positive). 89 % of the statements were of a medical, clinical or epidemiological nature and 11 % concerned social, educational or psychosocial issues associated with Down's syndrome. Study 2 used Q methodology to characterise understandings of Down's <b>syndrome.</b> <b>76</b> people chosen as being likely to represent a diverse range of views Q sorted 50 beliefs about Down's syndrome. Five statistically independent understandings of the condition were extracted using Principal Components Analysis. There was a consensus across participants on the rights of existing people with Down's syndrome to a good quality of life, but there were significant differences in to how respondents believed they personally would cope with, and adjust to an affected child. Some tentative associations between these five understandings and attitudes towards testing and termination were identified. Study 3 employed a self-completion questionnaire in 197 pregnant women to measure attitudes towards Down's syndrome and intentions to test and terminate for the condition. Serum screening uptake was collected later from patient records. Attitudes towards Down's syndrome were significantly associated with intentions to use screening, diagnostic tests, and termination, and also with actual screening uptake (p < 0. 05). However, most women accepted screening tests (77 % overall) regardless of whether their attitude towards Down's syndrome was favourable or not. Attitudes towards Down's syndrome were most strongly associated with intentions to terminate a pregnancy for the condition. Women who were uncertain about terminating for Down's syndrome had significantly higher levels of ambivalence in their attitudes towards the condition than women whose behavioural intentions were either `yes' to termination or `no' to termination. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that a) guidelines regarding informed choice are not being met in the case of written information provided about the target condition and b) screening choices might not always be directly informed either by attitudes towards Down's syndrome or towards termination for the condition. Further investigation into the psychological and situational factors associated with testing and termination choices is recommended. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The angle between a vertical line and a line connecting a superior angle with an inferior angle of the scapular of the side of the lower shoulder was- 0. 31 ± 3. 73 degrees, compared with 3. 85 ± 4. 42 degrees for the higher shoulder. Conclusion The frequency of shoulder impingement syndrome was significantly higher on the side of the relatively lower shoulder, and there is no significant difference in the acromiohumeral interval between the side of the lower shoulder and that of the higher shoulder. In patients with unilateral shoulder impingement syndrome, the scapular on the side of lower shoulder was more rotated downward than on the side of the higher shoulder.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE:The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for neuroendocrine liver metastases {{using a combination of}} streptozocin, Lipiodol, and tris-acryl microspheres. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A total of 16 men and 9 women aged 59. 6 ± 11. 3 years, all with predominant liver disease, underwent 54 courses of TACE using an emulsion of 1. 5 g of streptozocin and 10 ml of Lipiodol. Additional embolization was performed using 300 - 500 µm tris-acryl microspheres. Morphological response was evaluated using the RECIST criteria on multi-detector computed tomography or MRI. Clinical efficacy was evaluated particularly in patients with carcinoid syndrome. RESULTS:The primary tumor was located in the small bowel or pancreas in 21 (84 %) patients. Eleven (44 %) patients presented with a carcinoid <b>syndrome.</b> Nineteen (<b>76</b> %) patients presented with more than 10 liver nodules. One delayed case of ischemic cholecystitis was treated conservatively. After a median follow-up of 36. 1 months, 1 (4 %) patient had a complete response, 12 (48 %) patients had a partial response, and 7 (28 %) patients had a stable disease corresponding to a disease control rate of 80 %. All patients with carcinoid syndrome had significant improvement. Median time to progression was 18. 8 months and overall survival was 100, 100, and 92 % at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Seven patients presented with extrahepatic progression with abdominal lymphadenopathies or metastases to the brain, ovary, adrenal gland, or lung. CONCLUSION:Optimized TACE using a combination of streptozocin, Lipiodol, and tris-acryl microspheres is effective and well tolerated...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Surveillance of {{multiple}} congenital anomalies {{is considered to}} be more sensitive for the detection of new teratogens than surveillance of all or isolated congenital anomalies. Current literature proposes the manual review of all cases for classification into isolated or multiple congenital anomalies. METHODS: Multiple anomalies were defined as two or more major congenital anomalies, excluding sequences and syndromes. A computer algorithm for classification of major congenital anomaly cases in the EUROCAT database according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) v 10 codes was programmed, further developed, and implemented for 1 year's data (2004) from 25 registries. The group of cases classified with potential multiple congenital anomalies were manually reviewed by three geneticists to reach a final agreement of classification as "multiple congenital anomaly'' cases. RESULTS: A total of 17, 733 cases with major congenital anomalies were reported giving an overall prevalence of major congenital anomalies at 2. 17 %. The computer algorithm classified 10. 5 % of all cases as "potentially multiple congenital anomalies''. After manual review of these cases, 7 % were agreed to have true multiple congenital anomalies. Furthermore, the algorithm classified 15 % of all cases as having chromosomal anomalies, 2 % as monogenic <b>syndromes,</b> and <b>76</b> % as isolated congenital anomalies. The proportion {{of multiple}} anomalies varies by congenital anomaly subgroup with up to 35 % of cases with bilateral renal agenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the EUROCAT computer algorithm is a feasible, efficient, and transparent way to improve classification of congenital anomalies for surveillance and research.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether prophylactic treatment with oral broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy improves pregnancy outcomes in twin gestations. Methods: Patients with twin gestations between 24 and 32 weeks were randomized to receive amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or placebo. Those patients randomized before 24 weeks received a 1 -week course at 24 and at 28 weeks gestation. Those patients entered later than 24 weeks received a 1 -week course either at 28 weeks or at enrollment (up to 32 weeks). Other than antibiotic use, the management of the groups was identical and unchanged from the routine care of twin gestations. Results: Of 149 twin pregnancies enrolled, 76 were randomized to the drug group and 73 to the placebo group. There was no significant difference in mean gestational age at delivery (35. 9 vs. 35. 7 weeks), birth weight (2, 358 vs. 2, 344 g), mean neonatal nursery stay (9. 9 vs. 11. 7 days), or respiratory distress <b>syndrome</b> (6 / <b>76</b> vs. 4 / 73) in the drug vs. placebo group, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of prophylactic oral broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy to the standard antepartum management of twin gestations had no demonstrable effect on the gestational age at delivery, birth weight, or neonatal complications.

40|$|Introduction. Paraneoplastic {{encephalomyelitis}} (PEM) and subacute sensory neuronopathy (SSN) are remote {{effects of}} cancer, {{usually associated with}} small-cell lung carcinoma and positive anti-Hu antibody. We describe the rare association of bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with anti-Hu antibody positivity resulting in this paraneoplastic neurological <b>syndrome.</b> Patient. A <b>76</b> -year-old female presented with bilateral muscle weakness and paraesthesia of {{the upper and lower}} limbs in a length-dependent “glove and stocking” distribution. Central nervous system symptoms included cognitive problems, personality change, and truncal ataxia. Case notes and the literature were reviewed. Result. Autoantibody screening was positive for anti-Hu antibody (recently renamed antineuronal nuclear antibody 1, ANNA- 1). The diagnosis of PEM and SSN was supported by MRI and lumbar puncture results. A superficial bladder TCC was demonstrated on CT and subsequently confirmed on histology. No other primary neoplasm was found on full-body imaging. The neurological symptoms were considered to be an antibody-mediated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome and improved after resection of the tumour. 		 			Discussion. The association of anti-Hu positive paraneoplastic neurological syndrome and TCC has not been described in the literature previously. We emphasize the need for detailed clinical examination and the importance of a multidisciplinary thought process and encourage further awareness of this rare association...|$|R
40|$|Student Number : 9703129 J - MSc(Med) {{research}} report - School of Pathology - Faculty of Health SciencesDown syndrome is the commonest cause of congenital developmental disability in industrialized countries, where {{it occurs in}} approximately 1. 4 per 1000 live births. In South Africa, the birth prevalence of Down syndrome was documented as 1. 8 and 2. 09 per 1000 live births in urban and rural populations, respectively. The physical, psychosocial and emotional burden of Down syndrome on affected families is significant. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the reproductive choices of women with a child with Down syndrome, aged 1 year or older. The survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire. The sample consisted of fifty women; 36 African, 4 Asian and 10 Caucasian. The questionnaire assessed the mothers’ knowledge of Down syndrome prior to diagnosis, what counselling was received and how this knowledge was utilised. Information was also obtained on the mothers’ use of family planning, the knowledge and use of prenatal medical genetic screening and diagnosis, and what decisions would be made in future pregnancies. None of the sample group of mothers had prenatal diagnosis in their pregnancy with their Down <b>syndrome</b> child, but <b>76...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} controlled {{study with}} repeated measures {{before and after}} surgery examined the medical, surgical, and health outcomes of gastrostomy {{for children with disabilities}} at a tertiary paediatric referral centre in the North Thames area, UK. Anthropometric measures included weight, mid-upper-arm and head circumference. Five-day prospective food diaries were completed and data on physical health and surgical outcomes recorded. Seventy-six children participated and underwent gastrostomy (44 males, 32 females; median age 3 y 4 mo, range 4 mo- 17 y 5 mo), and 35 / 76 required an anti-reflux procedure. Categories of disability were: cerebral palsy (32 / <b>76),</b> <b>syndrome</b> of chromosomal or other genetic origin (25 / 76), slowly progressive degenerative disease (11 / 76), and unconfirmed diagnosis (8 / 76). Most children had gross motor difficulties (99 %) and were non-ambulant (83 %). Oromotor problems were identified in 78 % of children, 69 % aspirated, and 65 % were fed nasogastrically before surgery. The mean weight before surgery was - 2. 84 standard deviation score (SDS; SD 2. 21, range - 9. 8 to 3. 4). Two-thirds of children achieved catch-up growth postoperatively: weight-for-age (mean difference 0. 51 SDS, 95 % CI 0. 23 - 0. 79, p= 0. 001) and mid-upper arm circumference (mean difference 1. 12 cm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 50 - 1. 75, p= 0. 001). Health gains included a reduction in drooling, secretions, vomiting, and constipation. Major surgical complications were found in 13 / 74 children. The study provides evidence that catch-up growth and health gains are possible following gastrostomy...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Considering {{that the}} Cockcroft-Gault formula and theequation of diet {{modification}} in renal disease are amply used in clinical practice {{to estimate the}} glomerular filtration rate, although {{they seem to have}} low accuracy in obese patients, the present study intends to evaluate the predictive performance of 12 equations used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate in obese patients. Methods: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study, conducted between 2007 and 2008 and carried out at a university, of 140 patients with severe obesity (mean body mass index 44 ± 4. 4 kg/m 2). The glomerular filtration rate was determined by means of 24 -hour urine samples. Patients were classified into {{one or more of the}} four subgroups: impaired glucose tolerance (n = 43), diabetic (n = 24), metabolic <b>syndrome</b> (n = <b>76),</b> and/or hypertension (n = 66). We used bias, precision, and accuracy to assess the predictive performance of each equation in the entire group and in the subgroups. Results: In renal disease, Cockcroft-Gault’s formula and the diet modification equation are not precise in severely obese patients (precision: 40. 9 and 33. 4, respectively). Sobh’s equationshowed no bias in the general group or in two subgroups. Salazar-Corcoran’s and Sobh’s equations showed no bias for the entire group(Bias: - 5. 2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = - 11. 4, 1. 0, and 6. 2; 95 %CI = - 0. 3, 12. 7, respectively). All the other equations were imprecise for the entire group. Conclusion: Of the equations studied, those of Sobh and Salazar-Corcoran seem to be the best for estimating the glomerular filtration rate in severely obese patients analyzed in our study...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of surgical and postoperative management techniques has improved the treatment outcomes of esophageal cancer resection. However, respiratory morbidity {{is still the}} most frequent complication after esophagectomy. The objective {{of the present study was}} to identify risk factors for respiratory complications following resection for esophageal cancer. This study included 96 patients with esophageal cancer who had undergone esophagectomy with lymph node dissection. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence (20 patients, 17 had pneumonia and 3 had acute respiratory distress <b>syndrome)</b> or absence (<b>76</b> patients) of postoperative respiratory complications (PRC). The two groups were compared with respect to their preoperative clinical variables, such as age, body mass index, smoking history, serum albumin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), number of lymphocytes, %VC, FEV 1. 0 % and FEV 1. 0. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate relative risk factors for respiratory complications. Results of the univariate analysis showed that smoking history (+/-, patients with PRC, 19 / 1 and without PRC, 53 / 23), serum CRP (≥ 1. 0 mg/dl/< 1. 0 mg/dl, patients with PRC, 6 / 14 and without PRC, 6 / 70) and FEV 1. 0 % (≥ 60 %/< 60 %, patients with PRC, 16 / 4 and without PRC, 73 / 3) were significantly different between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that FEV 1. 0 % was the strongest predictor of PRC. FEV 1. 0 %, serum CRP and smoking history are reliable predictors of the risk of respiratory complications following esophageal cancer resection. For patients with these factors, perioperative management for the prevention of postoperative respiratory complications should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background: In impingment {{syndrome}} with associated stiff {{shoulder the}} general protocol of management is to conservatively treat the stiff shoulder followed by operative {{treatment of the}} impingement syndrome. This consecutive prospective study was carried out to evaluate the functional outcome of surgical management for impingement syndrome associated with stiff shoulder and to compare the results with surgical management of impingement syndrome alone. Materials and Methods: We evaluated a total of 100 patients with impingement <b>syndrome,</b> consisting of <b>76</b> patients with impingement syndrome alone (Group A) and 24 patients of stiff shoulder associated with impingement syndrome (Group B). Group A patients were treated by subacromial decompression alone and Group B patients were treated by closed manipulation under anesthesia followed by subacromial decompression. Results: According to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) evaluation score satisfactory results were obtained in 80 &#x 0025; patients of Group A and 67 &#x 0025; patients of Group B, while for patients with diabetes [(n = 18), Group A (n = 11), Group B (n = 7) ] satisfactory results were achieved in 82 &#x 0025; of patients of Group A(9 / 11) and 43 &#x 0025; of Group B(3 / 7). Overall, Group B patients had a lower range of motion for external rotation postoperatively, thus indicating that procedures to improve the external rotation, such as a release of the rotator interval or anterior capsule, might be considered {{in conjunction with other}} surgical procedures in patients with impingement syndrome with associated stiffness to further improve functional outcome. Conclusion: Acromioplasty can be performed in stiff shoulder associated with impingement syndrome without fears of further worsening of stiffness from adhesions with the exposed raw undersurface of acromian. Patients with diabetes mellitus and shoulder stiffness tend to have poor clinical outcomes and must receive appropriate counseling preoperatively...|$|R
40|$|Background: Body {{shape is}} a known {{risk factor for}} {{diabetes}} and mortality, but the methods estimating body shape, BMI and waist circumference are crude. We determined whether a novel body shape measure, trunk to leg volume ratio, was independently associated with diabetes and mortality. Methods: Data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 1999 – 2004, a study representative of the US population, were used to generate dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived trunk to leg volume ratio and determine its associations to diabetes, metabolic covariates, and mortality by BMI category, gender, and race/ethnicity group. Results: The prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes increased with age, BMI, triglycerides, blood pressure, and decreased HDL level. After adjusting for covariates, the corresponding fourth to first quartile trunk to leg volume ratio odds ratios (OR) were 6. 8 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4. 9 – 9. 6) for diabetes, 3. 9 (95 % CI, 3. 0 – 5. 2) for high triglycerides, 1. 8 (95 % CI, 1. 6 – 2. 1) for high blood pressure, 3. 0 (95 % CI, 2. 4 – 3. 8) for low HDL, 3. 6 (95 % CI, 2. 8 – 4. 7) for metabolic <b>syndrome,</b> and 1. <b>76</b> (95 % CI, 1. 20 – 2. 60) for mortality. Additionally, trunk to leg volume ratio was the strongest independent measure associated with diabetes (P, 0. 001), even after adjusting for BMI and waist circumference. Even among those with normal BMI, those in the highest quartile of trunk to leg volume ratio had a higher likelihood of death (5. 5 %) {{than those in the}} lowest quartile (0. 2 %).

40|$|BackgroundD allele of insertion/deletion {{polymorphism}} of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) gene {{was reported}} to be associated with myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy. It was suggested that the possible mechanism of these of associations might be coronary artery vasopasm. We therefore studied to know whether variant angina is related with polymorphism of ACE gene. MethodsFour groups of patients were studied; (1) variant angina group (n= 64) who received coronary angiography and provocation test using ergonovine or acetylcholine, (2) normal control group (n= 66) whose coronary angiogram was normal, (3) acute ischemic <b>syndrome</b> group (n= <b>76).</b> (4) chronic stable angina group (n= 25). Genomic DNA was extracted from mononuclear cells of peripheral blood and PCR was done. ResultsDistribution of genotypic frequency of normal controls (DD : ID: II= 0. 152 : 0. 500 : 0. 348, D allele: I allele= 0. 402 : 0. 598) is different from that of Caucasians (p< 0. 005) but similar to that of Japanese. Distribution of genotypic frequency of variant angina (DD : ID : II= 0. 094 : 0. 625 : 0. 281, D : I= 0. 406 : 0. 594) is neither significantly different from that of normal controls nor that of ischemic heart disease groups. Furthermore. it is not different from that of patients (n= 22) who had negative results provocation test (DD : ID : II= 0. 182 : 0. 409 : 0. 409, D : I= 0. 386 : 0. 614). In acute ischemic syndrome patients, D allele was more frequent in patients with normal cholesterol level than in patients with high cholesterol level (p< 0. 05). Among patients without hypertension, DD homozygotes were more frequent in patients with high left ventricular mass index than low ventricular mass index (p< 0. 05). ConclusionsThe findings suggest that insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene is not associated with variant angina, butit is associated with the development of acute ischemic syndrome in low risk group and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy...|$|R
