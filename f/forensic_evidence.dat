5|$|Convicted serial rapist Jonathan Haynes {{forced his}} victims to destroy <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b> He was only caught {{after one of}} his victims {{deliberately}} pulled out her own hair which was later discovered in his car, tying him to the attacks. She was inspired by watching the CSI television series.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for retrial that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> presented by the prosecution and accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. It {{was reported to be}} the former death row inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
30|$|Healthcare {{professionals}} {{preserved the}} potential <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences,</b> as a rule. These included the patient’s belongings and bullet/pellet fragments {{extracted from the}} body. The recovered <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences</b> were labeled and kept in a secure place until transferred to the police.|$|R
40|$|Windows registry, {{a central}} {{repository}} for configuration data, {{should be investigated}} for obtaining <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences,</b> since it contains lots of information that are of potential evidential value. Using some forensic tools, forensic examiners can investigate values of windows registry and get information can be <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences.</b> However, since windows registry contains huge amount of values and these values can be modified by users, suspect can hide his secret like password in registry values. In this paper, we discuss the basics of Windows XP registry and extract some registry entries related to forensic analysis. Finally, we show that some countermeasures are needed, listing up consideration items for hiding secrets in registry as suspect’s viewpoint...|$|R

5|$|Police caught Carty through CCTV footage {{which showed}} him using Pryce's Oyster Card (which {{he claimed to}} have found) at Kensal Green station, <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> found at the homes of Carty and Brown, and Pryce's mobile phone. Carty and Brown both denied murder but {{admitted}} that they had robbed Pryce and another man just before. Brown was 17 {{at the time of the}} offence so initially could not be named for legal reasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> on {{the package}} {{eventually}} leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b> Senior {{officers}} had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E
40|$|Infrared {{microspectroscopy}} {{has been}} used by forensic scientists to analyze polymer. With the development of Dispersive Raman Microspectroscopy, the application of Raman to forensic analysis became more prevalent because of the complementary vibrational information to infrared. By applying both infrared and Raman microspectroscopy to <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences</b> which can reveal more molecular information from <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences.</b> Applications of these techniques in forensic laboratory have including trace evidences such as drugs, explosives, fibers, paints, pigments, inks, gunshot residues, forgeries and fakes. It has been found that infrared microspectroscopy offers a nondestructive method of fiber identification. Raman microspectroscopy is also very convenient, nondestructive and often permits any form of the sam ples with no sample preparation. This preliminary study showed that natural and manufacturered fibers can be rapidly characterized by these techniques. Raman microspectroscopy shows great potential for analysis and comparison of fiber evidences...|$|R
25|$|Nicholas Petraco, {{a retired}} NYPD <b>forensics</b> <b>evidence</b> expert, testified that fibers from two fur coats and a rabbit-collared leather jacket {{gathered}} by police at Littlejohn's home {{were found in}} his van, on tape binding St. Guillen, and on a quilt used to wrap her battered body. He indicated that fiber analysis {{is not as good}} as DNA evidence.|$|R

5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b> According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Tom later {{searches}} Black's office, stealing his gun {{and finding}} Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is exactly why he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E
30|$|The time {{interval}} between sexual assaults and disclosure varied widely {{from less than}} 24  h to six months (24  weeks pregnancy). This wide variation in the interval of disclosure {{may be due to}} threats or fear of stigmatization, violence or even death. The longer the interval between assault and its disclosure, the lower {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences,</b> also the higher the risk of negative health outcomes (World Health Organization 2003).|$|R
25|$|George {{was tried}} at the Old Bailey, convicted, and on 2 July 2001 {{was sentenced to}} life imprisonment. Concern about this {{conviction}} was widespread on the basis that the case against George appeared thin. Two appeals were unsuccessful, but after discredited <b>forensics</b> <b>evidence</b> was excluded from the prosecution's case, George's third appeal succeeded in November 2007. The original conviction was quashed and a second trial lasting eight weeks ended in George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.|$|R
30|$|Fabio et al. {{formulated}} a {{case study}} to analyze <b>forensics</b> <b>evidence</b> stored in a Window 7 personal computer when Google documents, PicasaWeb, Flickr, and Dropbox are accessed via web browser.

They performed the test twice, the former with live forensics tools on a powered on laptop running Windows 7 and the latter with postmortem forensic tools on a physical image of its hard drive [41].|$|R
5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a bouncer at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b> The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Provo, Utah to meet Calvin Smith (Michael O'Neill), the {{prosecutor}} in a local murder case; and Didi Higgens (Sarah Koskoff), a pathologist for the County Medical Examiner's office. Smith and Higgens {{have been involved in}} the trial of former sheriff William Garry (John Finn), who has been convicted of killing his three children and wife. Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> has linked him to a wood-carving chisel used to commit the murders. Black has been asked to construct an offender profile for Garry, to determine whether the man is sufficiently dangerous to society for a judge to issue a death penalty. Garry himself is asking to be executed.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E

40|$|Windows Registry {{forensics}} is {{an important}} branch of computer and network forensics. Windows Registry is often considered as the heart of Windows Operating Systems because it contains allof the configuration setting of specific users, groups, hardware, software, and networks. Therefore, Windows Registry {{can be viewed as}} a gold mine of <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences</b> which could be used in courts. This paper introduces the basics of Windows Registry, describes its structure and its keys and subkeys thathave forensic values. This paper also discusses how the Windows Registry forensic keys can be applied in intrusion detection...|$|R

5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. <b>Forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later {{identified}} as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Years later, {{six months}} after the Battle of New York, Stark's {{experiences}} during the alien invasion are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence.</b> Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.|$|E
40|$|The {{assumptions}} {{and the results}} of applying three fire modeling approaches to study three accidental fires that occurred in single-family dwellings, are presented in this work. The modeling approaches used are: a simplified analytical model of fire growth, a zone model (CFAST) and a field model (FDS). The fires predicted are: a house fire of suspected initial location but of unknown ignition source, a small-apartment fire initiated by the ignition of a sofa which extinguished due to oxygen depletion, and a one-story house fire started by a malfunctioning gas heater. The input to each model has been kept as independent as possible from the other models while consistent with the <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences.</b> The predictions from the models of the fires’ characteristics are analyzed {{in the context of the}} <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences</b> for each accidental fire to compare the models’ predictive capabilities. It is found that in spite of the differences in the sophistication of these three modeling approaches, the results were in relatively good agreement, particularly in the early stages of the fire. Simpler models can be used as a first step towards less approximate modelling or to confirm the order of magnitude of the results from more complex models. The results of this work can be used to reach conclusions about the complexity of the model required to describe a particular fire scenario...|$|R
50|$|After {{the arrest}} and {{conviction}} of Barry George at the Old Bailey on 2 July 2001 {{for the murder}} of BBC news presenter Jill Dando, George was sentenced to life imprisonment. Concern about this conviction was widespread on the basis that the case against George appeared thin. Two appeals were unsuccessful, but after Rowe filmed a BBC Panorama film which discredited <b>forensics</b> <b>evidence</b> was excluded from the prosecution's case, George's third appeal succeeded in November 2007. The original conviction was quashed and a second trial lasting eight weeks ended in George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.|$|R
25|$|During the trial, a {{mattress}} {{was presented to}} court, supposedly stained with Anwar's semen. This was submitted as DNA evidence of Anwar's sexual acts. Anwar denied having {{anything to do with}} the mattress, although the DNA tests came out positive. Lim Kong Boon, a DNA chemist, testified during the trial that DNA taken from 10 of 13 semen stains on the mattress matched Anwar's DNA. The defence team implied that DNA samples may have been taken from Anwar, while unconscious, after his beating in police custody, to create false <b>forensics</b> <b>evidence</b> to frame Anwar; however, High Court Judge Augustine Paul accepted that DNA evidence.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, <b>forensic</b> <b>evidence</b> confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E
30|$|In this trend, {{there are}} two major types of <b>forensic</b> <b>evidences</b> [196]. One type is {{intrinsic}} to the device, the information processing chain, or the physical environment, in such forms as the special characteristics associated with specific types of hardware or software processing or environment, the unique noise patterns as a signature of a specific device unit, certain regularities or correlations related to certain device, processing or their combinations, and more. Another type is extrinsic approaches, whereby specially designed data are proactively injected into the signals/data or into the physical world and later extracted and examined to infer or verify the hosting data’s origin, integrity, processing history, or capturing environment.|$|R
30|$|Finally, Alqahtany et al. {{proposed}} a framework claimed to enable CSCs {{to collect and}} analyze <b>forensics</b> <b>evidence</b> {{without the consent of}} the CSPs. The model uses an agent-based approach that is held in each virtual machine. The agents send the required evidence to a central cloud forensic acquisition and analysis system in the CSPs environment. The communication between the two components is provided through a communication engine. The system uses cryptography to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the forensic data. The researchers believe that the framework might cause additional performance overhead. However, this framework has not been tested in a cloud environments [11].|$|R
