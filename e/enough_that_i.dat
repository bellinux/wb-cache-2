500|$|Handlen {{thought that}} Michael sounded [...] "reasonable", and Sepinwall said [...] "Awake... {{a good job}} of making the guest {{characters}} involved in 's cases interesting <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care about what happens in each investigation." [...] He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other. Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the [...] "red reality" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] "Jake reminded [...] of Al Pacino's aging [...] in Donnie Brasco." [...] Sepinwall liked Jake's actor, Lawrence, praising his appearance on the Awake episode.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would recommend that he {{sit down with the}} mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E
500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion {{to such a degree that}} the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" [...] (1.78m), 180-pound (82kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, [...] "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't have to have surgery." ...|$|E

500|$|The guest {{performances}} made by Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine {{were met}} with mixed reception from several critics. Amy Reiter was more critical on Griffin's performance as Tammy Jean Albertson, and noted [...] "while Kathy Griffin was sight-gag funny as local tea party candidate Tammy Jean Albertson [...] her lines fell a bit flat." [...] She went on to praise Devine's performance as Sister Mary Constance, saying that her lines [...] "totally hit the bull's-eye." [...] Robert Canning praised both performances, {{saying that it was}} {{the best part of the}} episode. He continued, [...] "I love how the guest judge segments of these contest episodes are beginning to become mini-series unto themselves. I hope that tradition continues." [...] James Poniewozik had mixed feelings regarding Griffin's performance. He went on to write, [...] "Glee can be sharp and topical <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought it could actually do something clever with the much-publicized cameo. Instead, the performance hinged on expected gags [...] and Griffin delivered it all with a stiffness that felt more like a recitation than a performance." [...] Todd VanDerWerff reacted negatively to both performances. In his review of the episode, he opined, [...] "That judges’ scene [...] was a pale retread of the original, only this time, it had Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine, as well as a bunch of tired Tea Party gags that were tired when this episode was written." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "One, it was {{embarrassing}} and, two, {{it made me think}} about quitting," [...] said Hill. [...] "While Coppola's intentions were honorable, I think he made a bad situation worse. I didn't do anything for a year. I was fortunate <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could buy my children a hot lunch. Then, I decided I wanted to work again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{are really}} asking the Court two things," [...] he continued. The first {{was to take}} the {{presumption}} that illegal use was intended in that kind of marketing, or at least take judicial notice. The second was in regard to the appeals court's concern about targeting certain lifestyles. [...] "I can't make the argument strong <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think under the rational interest of the community and the state {{we have a right to}} legislate against lifestyles, such as homicidal maniacs, burglars, and drug abusers ... We don't like his lifestyle in Hoffman Estates, and I don't think anywhere else in the country do they care for that lifestyle, and I believe we have a right to legislate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right, Professor," [...] Quest assured him. [...] "They {{know well}} <b>enough</b> downstairs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am always {{at liberty to}} you. Come in." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I wasn't smart <b>enough</b> about <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> was {{reflecting}} my engineering {{background and}} was insufficient {{appreciative of the}} human dimension. I've learned that's critical." ...|$|R

2500|$|On March 1, 1995, at the Patinoire Auditorium in Lausanne, Switzerland, Berry {{collapsed}} on stage during an R.E.M. show from a ruptured brain aneurysm. He recovered and rejoined the band, but left in October 1997, {{saying that he}} no longer had the drive or enjoyment level to be in the band, and that he wanted a career change. He later explained on VH-1's Behind The Music: I didn't wake up one day and decide, 'I just can't stand these guys anymore' or anything. I feel like I'm ready for a life change. I'm still young <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can do something else. I've been pounding the tubs since I was nine years old ... I'm ready to do something else.|$|E
2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend that you give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'" [...] Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{this was}} true to the ear, at least, though I saw, plainly <b>enough,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not believed.|$|E
5000|$|Hammer {{similarly}} admitted that:"I wasn't smart <b>enough</b> about <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> was reflecting my engineering {{background and}} was insufficient {{appreciative of the}} human dimension. I've learned that's critical." ...|$|R

5000|$|The explanation, Maibaum {{once told}} an interviewer, was that writing for Bond is [...] "a case of Walter Mitty. I'm law-abiding and non-violent.
