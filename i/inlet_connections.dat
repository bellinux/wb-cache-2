40|$|As {{demand for}} energy {{continues}} to rise, the {{concern over the}} increase in emissions grows, prompting much interest in using renewable energy resources such as solar energy. However, there are numerous issues with using solar energy including intermittency {{and the need for}} storage. A potential solution is the concept of hybrid solar-fossil fuel power generation. Previous work has shown that utilizing solar reforming in conventional power cycles has higher performance compared to other integration methods. In this thesis, a two level analysis of a hybrid redox redox cycle is performed. First, a system analysis of a hybrid cycle utilizing steam redox reforming is presented. Important cycle design and operation parameters such as the oxidation temperature and reformer operating pressure are identified and their effect on both the reformer and cycle performance is discussed. Simulation results show that increasing oxidation temperature can improve reformer and cycle efficiency. Also shown is that increasing the amount of reforming water leads to a higher reformer efficiency, but can be detrimental to cycle efficiency depending on how the reforming water is utilized. Next, a system analysis for a CO 2 redox reforming hybrid cycle and comparison of cycle and reformer performance between a CO 2 redox reformer and steam redox reformer hybrid cycle are presented. Similar to the steam redox system, results show that increasing the oxidation temperature or the amount of reforming CO 2 leads to higher reformer and cycle efficiencies. In addition, the comparison between the CO 2 and steam redox reformer hybrid cycles shows that the CO 2 cycle has the potential to have better overall performance. Based on the system analysis, a reformer level analysis is also performed. A novel receiver reactor concept for a solar steam redox reformer is presented, and a computational model is developed to assess its performance. The receiver-reactor consists of a dumbbell shape absorber system that has two distinct absorbers. This absorber system setup allows for the switching between reduction and oxidation steps without having to constantly change inlet streams to the reactor and is designed such that the <b>inlet</b> <b>connections</b> do not interfere with the solar window. In addition, at any point in time only one solar absorber is irradiated by the solar energy (during the reduction step). Simulation results show that the receiver-reactor strongly absorbs the solar radiation and most of the radiative heat transfer occurs in the front half of the reactor. Moreover, results show that higher conductivity absorber materials are more suitable for long term reactor operation. A sensitivity analysis is also performed for the solar steam redox reformer with respect to different performance metrics. Important parameters include channel size, inlet temperature, and reformer pressure. Moreover, a strategy for reactor design based on performance as well as integration with the power cycle is discussed. by Elysia J. Sheu. Thesis: Ph.

By varying {{the diameter of}} the sample <b>inlet</b> <b>connection</b> into the reservoir, the particle position was influenced significantly, which enabled desired separations. Additionally it was noted that the relative, horizontal position of the inlet also had a significant influence on particle position within the device. A dimensionless number, the Characteristic Sample Inlet, was developed to relate geometric properties of the inlet reservoir to downstream particle distribution. It was found that a 2 : 1 ratio between inlet reservoir and sample inlet diameter, and placed {{at the top of the}} reservoir yielded the best separation results. Fluid velocity profiles in the reservoir were explored using Comsol Multyphysics. The experimentally observed particle trajectories and COMSOL predictions were in good agreement. Based on Comsol models a dimensionless parameter to relate the unique velocity profiles within the inlet reservoir to downstream separation of particles was also developed. A mixture of 10, 5. 5, and 3. 0 µm particles were separated to three distinct collection outlets at 73. 4 %, 64. 7 %, and 52. 8 % respectively.

Operating experience and improved operating procedures were developed during test operations in FY 06 and {{the first quarter of}} FY 07. Eight different cell configurations, using various MEA designs, have been tested. The single cell test electrolyzer has been modified to overcome difficulties experienced during testing, including modifications to the <b>inlet</b> <b>connection</b> to eliminate minute acid leaks that caused short circuits. The test facility was modified by adding a water bath for cell heating, thus permitting operation over a wider range of flowrates and cell temperatures.

40|$|A fully nonlinear, nonhydrostatic {{numerical}} model is utilized {{to investigate the}} generation of Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) upstream of the Knight Inlet sill. While an upstream hydraulic jump initiates the ISW generation and both hydraulic jump and upstream influence contribute to the generation, {{it is found that}} upstream influence is dominant and the hydraulic jump is not necessary for the ultimate generation of ISWs. Decreasing the tidal forcing or upstream sill width may render the flow subcritical (i. e., the hydraulic jump disappears) and ISWs can be generated by nonlinear steepening of long wave disturbances induced by upstream influence. Increasing the tidal forcing or upstream sill width may generate a hydraulic jump blocking strong upstream propagating disturbances. The jump subsequently becomes a turbulent bore and later disperses into a train of ISWs as the tide relaxes. Further increase in the tidal forcing may sweep the turbulent bore downstream and a train of ISWs is emitted upstream toward the end of waning tide. By reducing the stratification strength by 1 order of magnitude, the near-sill flow is in the transcritical regime and ISWs are resonantly generated over the lee side slope. Connections to the internal tide release mechanism at Luzon Strait and to the unsteady lee wave model are also discussed. The present work provides some more insights into the ISW generation process at Knight <b>Inlet</b> and the <b>connection</b> between the generation mechanism at Knight Inlet and that at Luzon Strait is identified...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} an optrode sensing device that utilizes a polymerized colloidal array (PCCA) photonic crystal material. This array diffracts {{light in the}} visible spectral region due to the periodic spacing of colloidal particles. The PCCA changes diffraction wavelength due to binding of Pb 2 + to an 18 -crown- 6 ether molecular recognition agent. This optrode consists of a probe assembly that contains the PCCA Pb 2 + sensing film. An inexpensive, commercial diode array spectrometer and a fiber-optic reflectance probe monitors the wavelength of light back diffracted by the PCCA. Liquid <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>connections</b> are provided to introduce the sample solution and to exchange out nonbinding ions. In low ionic strength solutions, diffraction wavelength shifts are actuated by the binding of the Pb 2 + to the crown ether to immobilize the Pb 2 + counterions. In these low ionic strength solutions, a Donnan potential forms to cause an osmotic pressure, which swells the PCCA {{in proportion to the}} number density of bound Pb 2 +. This Donnan potential disappears at high ionic strengths. Thus, no response of the PCCA occurs. Our optrode design allows for the fast removal of nonbound ions from the PCCA by washing with pure water. Since the bound Pb 2 + ions have a slow off rate from the crown ether, the bound Pb 2 + PCCA diffraction transiently red shifts during washing, directly in proportion to the sample Pb 2 + concentration. This transient diffraction red-shift can be used to quantitatively determine Pb 2 + concentrations in high ionic strength solutions such as bodily fluids...|$|R
40|$|Transposition of {{the great}} arteries (TGA) is a cardiac {{condition}} in which the arterial trunks arise from the inappropriate ventricle: the aorta from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle [discordant ventriculo-arterial (VA) connection]. In complete TGA the discordant VA connection is associated with situs solitus or inversus and concordant atrioventricular (AV) connection. The hemodynamic consequence of these combined connections is that systemic and pulmonary circulations function in parallel rather than in series. The presence of situs solitus or inversus associated with both AV and VA discordant connections characterizes a different anatomical complex known as corrected TGA. In these hearts, the double discordance at AV and VA level permits a normal sequence of the blood flow from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery and from the left atrium to the aorta. The systemic and pulmonary circulation in these hearts functions regularly in series and the blood sequence is physiologically corrected. Thus the term transposition, either complete or corrected, identifies two precise, different anatomical complexes, both characterized by VA discordance. However among congenital heart disease (CHD), there are other anatomical complexes with discordant VA connection {{in the setting of}} isomeric atrial situs (right or left) or of univentricular AV <b>connections</b> (double <b>inlet</b> or absent <b>connections).</b> In these latter conditions, the term transposition is still necessary to stress that the great arteries are transposed in relation to the ventricular septum (aorta from the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle) but certainly does not figure out the anatomical complexes named complete or corrected transposition. We reviewed the hearts with discordant VA connection of our Anatomical Collection, consisting of 1640 specimens with CHD, with the aim to discuss the anatomy and the frequency of the anatomical variants of TGA and to clarify terminology and classification.

40|$|Tidal <b>inlets</b> are <b>connections</b> between small, shallow {{bays and}} the sea. In a tide-dominated environment, {{the status of}} this inlet is a balance between local given {{conditions}} such as channel geometry, and the hydraulic environment. According to Escoffier, we already know when the equilibrium is disrupted, it should generally return to its original state. In tidal lagoon systems with more inlets, it is more uncertain to predict a stable condition for each inlet. There are cases where some channels will close and others stay open, while other systems remain overall stable, i. e. each inlet has an equilibrium state. An analytical method to determine this stability is yet no available. Therefore, the focus attends to research a model bay system with two ocean inlets, where there could be an unconditionally stable environment. Next, a double inlet lagoon system is modelled: this consists of a bay area with no significant shape, two channels with relevant friction and inertia parameters and an idealized ocean tide, with a tidal range and phase at each inlet. Also, a second model is created where the bay area is (virtually) split up. On each model, {{a series of tests}} has been done with calculation and graphic software. Every inlet has an equilibrium flow curve, i. e. a cross-sectional area where the maximum currents are just enough to flush sediment and keeping the channel open. If this is the case for both cross-sections, the whole lagoon system is referred to as stable (E-type flow condition). In the graphic image, this is shown by four intersections of the equilibrium flow curves, where the stable intersection is the black dot. The normal model bay system showed that a stable condition exists when the tidal range at the seaside is different at each inlet, provided that this is not too large. In addition, the channels should be sufficiently short, with friction not too high. This is also valid for higher tidal ranges, where this critical difference is even smaller. The bay system with the partition had the same stability conditions. Higher tide levels at both inlets could also ensure stability, as the inlet in the partition becomes relatively small. Next, the E-type flow condition is more likely if this third inlet is smaller or longer. Further, the ratio in bay area {{on either side of the}} partition channel has some negative influence on this, but in combination with tide difference, a balanced system can remain. The models are further implemented on a present-day situation, a lagoon inlet system located in the Hue province in Vietnam. Here, there are two inlets, located far apart, letting the system be relatively stable. In this particular case, repeated flooding and breaching of the sand barrier resulted into another inlet next to the main inlet in the northern part of the lagoon. The appearance of this third channel has raised the question whether the two close inlets could be stable, although the authorities would rather have this channel closed. The partition model indicated that this could be the case. Although the lagoon is also largely influenced by frequent storm surges and river runoff, the tidal inlet model is a useful tool in order to understand the basic behaviour of this lagoon better.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains one}} of the main causes of human death around the globe. The {{mortality}} rate for patients infected with active TB goes beyond 50 % when not diagnosed. Rapid and accurate diagnostics coupled with further prompt treatment of the disease is the cornerstone for controlling TB outbreaks. To reduce this burden, the existing gap between detection and treatment must be addressed, and dedicated diagnostic tools such as biosensors should be developed. A biosensor is a sensing micro-device that consists of a biological sensing element and a transducer part to produce signals in proportion to quantitative information about the binding event. The micro-biosensor cell considered in this investigation is designed to operate based on aptamers as recognition elements against Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted protein MPT 64, combined in a microfluidic-chamber with <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>connections.</b> The microfluidic cell is a miniaturized platform with valuable advantages such as low cost of analysis with low reagent consumption, reduced sample volume, and shortened processing time with enhanced analytical capability. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the flooding characteristics of the encapsulated microfluidic cell of an existing micro-biosensor using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. The main challenge in the design of the microfluidic cell lies in the extraction of entrained air bubbles, which may remain after the filling process is completed, dramatically affecting the performance of the sensing element. In this work, a CFD model was developed on the platform ANSYS-CFX using the finite volume method to discretize the domain and solving the Navier–Stokes equations for both air and water in a Eulerian framework. Second-order space discretization scheme and second-order Euler Backward time discretization were used in the numerical treatment of the equations. For a given inlet–outlet diameter and dimensions of an in-house built cell chamber, different inlet liquid flow rates were explored to determine an appropriate flow condition to guarantee an effective venting of the air while filling the chamber. The numerical model depicted free surface waves as promoters of air entrainment that ultimately may explain the significant amount of air content in the chamber observed in preliminary tests after the filling process is completed. Results demonstrated that for the present design, against the intuition, the chamber must be filled with liquid at a modest flow rate to minimize free surface waviness during the flooding stage of the chamber...|$|R
40|$|Harrington Sound, {{located in}} east central Bermuda, {{is almost entirely}} {{enclosed}} by land except for a 26. 4 m wide channel called Flatts <b>Inlet.</b> This limited <b>connection</b> to the open ocean restricts Harrington Sound?s tides, resulting in a near 3 hour delay and dampening the tidal range to 35 % {{of those on the}} coast. By comparing the tidal amplitude and surface area of Harrington Sound, tidal exchange can be determined. Past research has shown Flatts Inlet only supplies the Sound with about half of its tidal water. The remaining tidal exchange enters and leaves the Sound either via groundwater influx through pores in the rock or through the traversable passageways of limestone cave systems in the land that encloses the Sound. The aim {{of this study was to}} model hydrodynamic tidal flux and current through marine caves into Harrington Sound. One of the goals of Bermuda?s cave habitat protection plan is to track tidal circulation of water through these cave systems. Information on such cave water transport would facilitate future pollution and nutrient exchange studies. This research was initiated during a six week trip to Bermuda by Jonathan Stoffer as he obtained tidal and water quality data from caves along the perimeter of Harrington Sound. Additional flow data was collected with instruments placed by local cave divers. A YSI 600 XLM water quality sonde, Norteck Vector Current Meter, and an in-situ level Aqua TROLL were used to monitor tidal amplitude, periodicity, current velocity, and water quality in cave pools and submerged passages. Profiles of the top 1 - 2 meters of water at each pool were taken at 56 sites. Tidal gauges were placed in 27 major cave pools surrounding Harrington Sound, as well as Harrington Sound itself, for 48 hours, to monitor tidal propagation through the island. The vector current meter was placed for six weeks to measure water flow in and out of Harrington Sound in six cave passageways known to have high flow rates. The resulting data have been compared to atmospheric data obtained from the Bermuda Weather Service and analyzed using Microsoft Excel, MATLAB and ArcGIS. The final goal of this project was to create a hydrological model able to predict flow rate and water depth in Bermudian caves with water depth data from the ocean and Harrington Sound. In constructing a water budget for Harrington Sound, I was able to account for 72. 3 % of all tidal inflow and 43. 3 % of all tidal outflow from the Sound as passing through either Flatt?s Inlet or one of the six tested caves. In creating my tidal models, I was able to achieve an averaged sum of squared deviation (SSD) normalized against count ranging from 5. 1 x 10 ^- 4 to 8. 4 x 10 ^- 4 m^ 2. The flow model achieved a SSD of 3. 8 x 10 ^- 3 m^ 2. My data also suggest that exchange between Harrington Sound and other inland waters, through cave systems, does exist...|$|R
40|$|Today, Providing {{drinking}} water and process water {{is one of the}} major problems in most countries; the surface water often need to be treated to achieve necessary quality, and in this way, technological and also financial difficulties cause great restrictions in operating the treatment units. Although water supply by simple and cheap systems has been one of the important objectives in most scientific and research centers in the world, still a great percent of population in developing countries, especially in rural areas, don't benefit well quality water. One of the big and available sources for providing acceptable water is sea water. There are two ways to treat sea water first evaporation and second reverse osmosis system. Nowadays R. O system has been used for desalination because of low budget price and easily to operate and maintenance. The sea water should be pretreated before R. O plants, because there is some difficulties in raw sea water that can decrease yield point of membranes in R. O system. The subject of this research may be useful in this way, and we hope to be able to achieve complete success in design and construction of useful pretreatment systems for R. O plant. One of the most important units in the sea water pretreatment plant is filtration, the conventional method for filtration is pressurized sand filters, and the subject of this research is about new filtration which is called continuous back wash sand filtration (CBWSF). The CBWSF designed and tested in this research may be used more economically with less difficulty. It consists two main parts first shell body and second central part comprising of airlift pump, raw water feeding pipe, air supply hose, backwash chamber and sand washer as well as <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>connections.</b> The CBWSF is a continuously operating filter, i. e. the filter does not have to be taken out of operation for backwashing or cleaning. Inlet water is fed through the sand bed while the sand bed is moving downwards. The water gets filtered while the sand becomes dirty. Simultaneously, the dirty sand is cleaned in the sand washer and the suspended solids are discharged in backwash water. We analyze the behavior of CBWSF in pretreatment of sea water instead of pressurized sand filter. There is one important factor which is not suitable for R. O membranes, it is bio-fouling. This factor is defined by Silt Density Index (SDI). measured by SDI. In this research has been focused on decreasing of SDI and NTU. Based on this goal, the prototype of pretreatment had been designed and manufactured to test. The system design was done mainly by using the design fundamentals of CBWSF. The automatic backwash sand filter can be used in small and also big water supply schemes. In big water treatment plants, the units of filters perform the filtration and backwash stages separately, and in small treatment plants, the unit is usually compacted to achieve less energy consumption. The analysis of the system showed that it may be used feasibly for water treating, especially for limited population. The construction is rapid, simple and economic, and its performance is high enough because no mobile mechanical part is used in it, so it may be proposed as an effective method to improve the water quality and consequently the hygiene level in the remote places of the country...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the aerodynamic performance characteristics of a custom fan or even a line of fans, the accepted practice of the industry is to carry out testing on a scale model in a laboratory to develop its fan performance curve. Then by applying affinity laws in conjunction with very specific rules that address scaling issues, the performance characteristics of geometrically similar fans can be predicted. These affinity laws (frequently referred to as fan laws) also allow the performance of fans operating at different speeds or handling gases at different density values to be accurately predicted. However, it is often found that even fans with well defined and pedigreed performance curves are unable to meet their performance expectations once they are installed on the systems for {{which they have been}} sold. This is primarily due to the adverse aerodynamic impact of the <b>inlet</b> or outlet <b>connections</b> on the performance capacity of the fan and thus on the overall system efficiency. The general term for design conditions at inlets or outlets of fans that cause deficient aerodynamic performance is ?system effects?. The characteristics of fan system effects are that they reduce fan capacity and are both velocity and geometry dependent. On the inlet side of a fan, this generally characterizes itself by a flow pattern that is highly non?uniform. On the discharge side, the high and low velocity flow streams leaving the fan may simply be prevented from redeveloping a uniform flow profile and normal static pressure conversion before encountering a disturbance. The term can also apply to system elements such as silencers, elbows and transitions. For these components, the actual pressure drop across them may be significantly higher than their calculated or rated values if the velocity profile of the entering flow is skewed or non?uniform. For either case (fan connection or system component), the result is that additional power will be required to address the flow rate required by the system. In many instances, system designers are simply unfamiliar with the importance of understanding system effects as it pertains to new fan selections and the attendant power requirements. At a minimum, a reasonable approach for new fan projects should be to establish the theoretical system effect of connection designs by using a recognized document such as Air Movement and Control Association Publication 201. The objective should be to first minimize their impact through appropriate connection design modifications in conjunction with potential fan inlet and outlet re?orientation. Once the system effects are minimized, the residual value should be applied to the fan performance specification {{in order to ensure that}} the fan is selected for the required aerodynamic capacity. For system components, an approach that has proved to be of significant value is to predict the flow pattern using computation fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling tools and in this process, the design can be tweaked until the designer finds the overall pressure drops of a system are minimized to the greatest practical extent. Similarly, CFD can be used to predict the flow profile at a fan inlet to ensure that it is as uniform as practically possible. This paper reviews the concept of system effects from the perspective of fan power requirements and provides a methodology for approaching system design from the perspective of optimizing fan energy use while achieving the required system capacity. ...|$|R
