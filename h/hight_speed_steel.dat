The passive films formed on chromium and high <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> showed superior protective properties than those formed on carbon steel. It was confirmed by XPS that the steel composition influences the passive film composition. Chromium oxide and hydroxide, as well as molybdenum and tungsten oxides and hydroxides {{are present in the}} passive film of chromium <b>steel</b> and high <b>speed</b> <b>steel,</b> respectively, besides iron oxide and hydroxide. The more complex composition of the oxide film on high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> explains its electrochemical behaviour and highest corrosion resistance...|$|R
5000|$|Material: High <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> (HSS) cutters are the least-expensive and shortest-lived cutters. Cobalt-bearing high <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> {{generally}} can be run 10% {{faster than}} regular high <b>speed</b> <b>steel.</b> Cemented carbide tools {{are more expensive}} than steel, but last longer, and can be run much faster, so prove more economical in the long run. HSS tools are perfectly adequate for many applications. The progression from regular HSS to cobalt HSS to carbide {{could be viewed as}} very good, even better, and the best. Using high speed spindles may preclude use of HSS entirely.|$|R
50|$|Turning {{tools are}} {{generally}} made {{from three different}} types of steel; carbon <b>steel,</b> high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> (HSS), and more recently powdered metal. Comparing the three types, high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> tools maintain their edge longer, requiring less frequent sharpening than carbon steel, but {{not as long as}} powdered metal tools. The harder the type of high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> used, the longer the edge will maintain sharpness. Powdered steel is even harder than HSS, but takes more effort to obtain an edge as sharp as HSS, just as HSS is harder to get as sharp as carbon steel.|$|R

40|$|Advantages of P/M high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> tools {{compared}} with conventional high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> tools {{are due to}} the former's lack of segregation and coarse particles within thin the crystallized carbide structure. Carbidide particles of P/M tools have a uniform distribution range of about 1 μm in diameter, higher toughness, and excellent grindability. After turning and milling operation, {{the edge of the}} tools are carefully observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to determine how the uniform distribution of the small carbide particles can affect the sharpenability of the cutting edge. The results show the P/M high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> tool minimizes the fall-off of carbide particles on the cutting edge, reduces wear on the flank face, and maintains sharpness of the cutting edge. However, under certain cutting conditions, in which crater wear readily forms on the tool face, the conventional high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> tool is superior in terms of tool wear...|$|R

40|$|High <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> rolls have {{prevailed in}} hot rolling mills {{due to their}} {{excellent}} wear resistance, high hardness and oxidation resistance. The thermal cycling ol the rolls causes the surface oxidation, which significantly changes the contact and tribological behaviour between work roll and hot rolled material. In the paper, the formation and growth ol oxide scale ol a high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> roll material were in- situ investigated by a High Temperature Microscope. In- situ observations indicate that the oxide scales of the high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> first nucleate at the carbides/matrix interfaces, and then rapidly spread to cover the carbides and followed by continuous growth over the whole surface. The selective oxidation of high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> has {{a significant impact on}} the roll surface morphology. Water vapour in oxidizing atmosphere increases the oxidation rates of carbides and the matrix. The two-high mini mill coupled with the Gleeble 3500 thermo- mechanical simulator was used to measure the tribological contact behaviour between high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> work roll and mild steel strip sample under the stalled hot rolling conditions. The experimental results show that fresh ground and pre- oxidized roll surfaces exhibit quite different ways of tribological behaviours. The rolling force of pre-oxidized rolls is always higher than that of fresh ground rolls whatever in different reductions, or temperatures. The surface conditions of work roll have a decisive effect on the strip roughness...|$|R

The article deals with the cutting life of tools, which cutting tips were produced from high <b>speed</b> <b>steels.</b> The test were realized at Faculty of Manufacturing Technologies TU Kosice with the seat in Presov, in collaboration with Institute of Material Research of Slovak Academy of Sciences in Kosice. As the method for tool-life investigation was selected the simple radial lathe-turning test. The measured values were statistically processed and submitted to the remoteness testing according to Grubbs. The results of the experiments are graphically presented as a dependence of cutting life on the cutting speed for five types of high <b>speed</b> <b>steels.</b> The base material for four of them was high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> STN 19 830 produced via powder metallurgy.

50|$|For {{several decades}} now, hacksaw blades have used high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> for their teeth, giving greatly {{improved}} cutting and tooth life. These blades were first {{available in the}} 'All-hard' form which cut accurately but were extremely brittle. This limited their practical use to benchwork on a workpiece that was firmly clamped in a vice. A softer form of high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> blade was also available, which wore well and resisted breakage, but was less stiff and so less accurate for precise sawing. Since the 1980s, bi-metal blades {{have been used to}} give the advantages of both forms, without risk of breakage. A strip of high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> along the tooth edge is electron beam welded to a softer spine. As the price of these has dropped to be comparable with the older blades, their use is now almost universal.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The heat {{treatment}} of high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> tools consists of austenitizing, quenching and tempering. The size of austenite grains formed during the hardening treatment {{is an important}} factor in the final microstructure of the steel, and it also affects properties such as wear resistance and toughness. This paper presents the austenite grain size, matrix composition and hardness of commercial AISI M 2, AISI T 15, VWM 3 C and Sinter 23 high <b>speed</b> <b>steels</b> that were austenitized and quenched from five distinct temperatures. This study shows that increase in quenching temperature results in grain growth of steels such as AISI M 2 and VWM 3 C, obtained by the conventional method (cast to ingot and worked). The P/M Sinter 23 high <b>speed</b> <b>steel</b> showed a slight grain growth (about 10 %). This effect was not observed in AISI T 15 obtained by the powder metallurgy process...|$|R

In this work the same powder was uniaxially cold compacted and vacuum sintered by adding some small quantity of graphite (0. 3 %C in weight) to prevent porosity and loss of carbon which result from the sintering cycle. The samples from all these experimental procedures were uniaxially cold compacted and vacuum sintered at five different temperatures and had its densities evaluated.
