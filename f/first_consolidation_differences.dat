Thispaper proposes aswarm-inspireddata centre self-organizingand {{consolidation}} technique whichaimsatreducing {{the power}} demand in data centres while ensuring the workload execution within the established performance parameters. Each data centre server is managed by an intelligent agent that implements a bird’s migration-inspired behaviour {{to decide on}} the appropriate server consolidation actions. The selected actions are executed to achieve an optimal utilization of server computing resources thus lowering power demand. The data centre servers self-organize in logical clusters according to the birds V-formation self-organizing migration model. The results are promising showing that by using the proposed swarm-inspired solution, the data centre Deployed Hardware Utilization Ratio Green Indicator increases compared to the widely used Fit <b>First</b> <b>consolidation</b> algorithm. The average power saving of the proposed technique isaround 40 % ofthe power demanded by the data centre computing resources and about 16 % of its total power demand including the IT facility, when comparing to OpenNebula Fit <b>First</b> <b>consolidation</b> technique.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of the <b>difference</b> arising on <b>consolidation</b> has been both a subject of debate (especially in the English-speaking counties) {{and a source of}} international diversity in financial reporting. The implementation of the EU Fourth and Seventh Directives could be expected {{to reduce the amount of}} this diversity so far as member states are concerned. To a large extent, the directives imposed methods which were generally accepted in the English-speaking countries; for example, what is now known as the 'former German method' was excluded. Nevertheless, the Directives left a fair amount of flexibility; alternative practices, some generally accepted in the UK and others in the USA, were permitted. This paper compares the {{treatment of}} the <b>consolidation</b> <b>difference</b> in two EU member states, France and the UK, based on an analysis of five years' financial statements of a random sample of seventy companies, in each country (700 sets of financial statements in all). The research shows that, notwithstanding the harmonizing effects of the Directives, substantial differences exist between the French and British treatments. In general, French recommended treatments are quite close to those required by U. S. GAAP, with a major exception in the treatment of 'quasi-goodwill' items such as brands. By contrast, the UK treatments differ from the U. S. and French treatments in some important respects; they also fail to comply with the revised IAS 22. On the other hand, the UK requirements are clearly documented and mandatory; hence the level of compliance is very high. By contrast the French requirements are variously and not always consistently documented and only partly mandatory; the levels of compliance are consequently lower. There was some evidence that the choice of treatment in the UK, as between immediate elimination against reserves and capitalization and amortiz-ation, was influenced by the company's level of gearing. No such choice exists in France, so no comparable analysis was possible. The research suggests that, in the case of the <b>consolidation</b> <b>difference,</b> the EU Directives left an arguably excessive degree of flexibility of treatment, a problem which it has been left to the revised IAS 22 to address. ...|$|R

This study explores the cost-reduction effects of local government consolidation using Japanese municipality data.

The study uses an instrumental variable methodology to deal with the endogeneity problem regarding consolidation decisions. The findings of this study are twofold. <b>First,</b> <b>consolidation</b> increases costs, and economies of scale do not lead to cost reduction.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the <b>first</b> <b>consolidation</b> of palaeoclimate proxy records from multiple archives to develop statistical rainfall reconstructions for southern Africa covering {{the last two}} centuries. State-of-the-art ensemble reconstructions reveal multi-decadal rainfall variability {{in the summer and}} winter rainfall zones. A decrease in precipitation amount over time is identified in the summer rainfall zone. No significant change in precipitation amount occurred in the winter rainfall zone, but rainfall variability has increased over time. Generally synchronous rainfall fluctuations between the two zones are identified on decadal scales, with common wet (dry) periods reconstructed around 1890 (1930). A strong relationship between seasonal rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the surrounding oceans is confirmed. Coherence among decadal-scale fluctuations of southern African rainfall, regional SST, SSTs in the Pacific Ocean and rainfall in south-eastern Australia suggest SST-rainfall teleconnections across the southern hemisphere. Temporal breakdowns of the SST-rainfall relationship in the southern African regions and the connection between the two rainfall zones are observed, for example during the 1950 s. Our results confirm the complex interplay between large-scale teleconnections, regional SSTs and local effects in modulating multi-decadal southern African rainfall variability over long timescales.

40|$|Proteus mirabilis colonies exhibit {{striking}} geometric regularity. Basic microbiological {{methods and}} imaging techniques {{were used to}} measure periodic macroscopic events in swarm colony morphogenesis. We distin-guished three initial phases (lag phase, first swarming phase, and <b>first</b> <b>consolidation</b> phase) followed by repeating cycles of subsequent swarming plus consolidation phases. Each Proteus swarm colony terrace corresponds to one swarming-plus-consolidation cycle. The duration of the lag phase was dependent upon inoculation density {{in a way that}} indicated the operation of both cooperative and inhibitory multicellular effects. On our standard medium, the second and subsequent swarm phases displayed structure in the form of internal waves visible with reflected and dark-field illumination. These internal waves resulted from organi-zation of the migrating bacteria into successively thicker cohorts of swarmer cells. Bacterial growth and motility were independently modified by altering the composition of the growth medium. By varying the glucose concentration in the substrate, it was possible to alter biomass production without greatly affecting the kinetics of colony surface area expansion. By varying the agar concentration in the substrate, initial bacterial biomass production was unaffected but colony expansion dynamics were significantly altered. Higher agar concentra-tions led to slower, shorter swarm phases and longer consolidation phases. Thus, colony growth was restricted by higher agar concentrations but the overall timing of the swarming-plus-consolidation cycles remaine...|$|R

Research in this dissertation {{is dedicated to the}} design of so-called express line-haul transports from the <b>first</b> <b>consolidation</b> point, the origin depot, to the last consolidation point, the destination depot. The line-haul transport is commonly organized either via road or via air.

The strategic network design problem is concerned with decisions on these hub locations in the network: how many hubs are needed and where should these be located, and which line-hauls are unloaded and loaded at each hub location? The tactical planning level at express {{service providers}} contains decisions on package routings from origin to destination and asset usages.
