The Royal Society considered {{it important to}} be seen to be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> climate change, so it became carbon neutral in 2008 when it received carboNZero certification from Landcare Research. Similar to other national science organisations, the Royal Society of New Zealand has released a position statement on global warming.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 1810, the {{precursors}} {{of the independence}} - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; {{the precursors}} were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had {{to come from the}} Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy and ask him to allow a Junta to take place: they knew {{that he was going to}} oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.|$|E

Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as divided between complaining about Hitler's regime and actually <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. The actor described his portrayal, [...] "One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform.

500|$|Uhls {{described}} {{the film as}} a [...] "romantic comedy", explaining, [...] "It {{has to do with}} the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically." [...] The Narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler Durden. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. Tyler also suggests <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Marla, implying that she is a risk to be removed. When Tyler says this, the Narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.|$|E

2500|$|An {{article in}} the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "the uproar over Ritalin was {{triggered}} almost single-handedly by the Scientology movement." [...] The Citizens Commission on Human Rights, an anti-psychiatry group formed by Scientologists in 1969, conducted a major campaign against Ritalin in the 1980s and lobbied Congress for an investigation of Ritalin. Scientology publications claimed the [...] "real target of the campaign" [...] as [...] "the psychiatric profession itself" [...] {{and said that the}} campaign [...] "brought wide acceptance of the fact that (the commission) and the Scientologists are the ones effectively <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> [...] psychiatric drugging".|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of steamboat operations on the Red River and plans for railroad development in Northwest Minnesota, the clamor for development and settlement south of the 49th parallel continued unabated throughout the 1850s. Incursions into Ojibwe territory {{on the part of}} fur traders and others were common. [...] A leading trader and Métis state legislator, Joseph Rolette, even started a townsite called [...] "Douglas" [...] at the Old Crossing which was designated by the Legislature as the first county seat of Polk County. The Ojibwe objected to the peremptory establishment of a town on their unceded territory, and the Legislature removed the county seat to Crookston, but demands for <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "sullen Chippewa" [...] and their claims to the territory continued to mount and by 1862 had risen to a crescendo.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} several {{songs for}} War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Something in the Air" [...] for the compilation 1 Love. Elbow contributed the song [...] "Snowball" [...] to another compilation, , in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that we listened to in that car was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone's <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it".|$|E

'Why,' says he, 'we have been talking of her below-stairs this half-hour.' 'Well,' says his sister, 'you can say no harm of her, that I am sure, so 'tis no matter what you have been talking about.' 'Nay,' says he, ''tis so far from talking harm of her, that we have been talking a great deal of good, and a great many fine things have been said of Mrs. Betty, I assure you; and particularly, that she is the handsomest young woman in Colchester; and, in short, they begin to toast her health in the town.' ...|$|E
