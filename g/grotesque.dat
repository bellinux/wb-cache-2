5|$|<b>Grotesque</b> {{masks and}} putti, often {{supporting}} balconies or decorating various bands of the entablature of a building; these grinning or glaring faces are {{a relic of}} Sicilian architecture from before the mid-17th century (Illustrations 2 and 9).|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used <b>grotesque</b> imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent}} in the wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of <b>grotesque</b> imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Grotesques</b> {{are often}} {{confused}} with gargoyles, but {{the distinction is}} that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while <b>grotesques</b> do not. This type of sculpture is also called a chimera. In the Middle Ages, the term babewyn was {{used to refer to}} both gargoyles and <b>grotesques.</b> This word is derived from the Italian word babbuino, which means [...] "baboon".|$|R

40|$|Prospects of ruins feature {{frequently}} {{within the}} <b>grotesques</b> or ornamental frescoes of sixteenth-century Italy. What {{is at stake}} in the representations of ruins seems to be at stake on a more general level in the <b>grotesques</b> seen as a compositional device: the visualisation of passages between a form and the formless, or between culture and nature, with change and movement as key concepts. The article addresses how the exploration of transformation, which is fundamental to the representation of ruins in <b>grotesques,</b> is manifested in subject matter, composition, and spatial relations; and how all three are aspects of the telling of time. It is suggested that the prevalence of ruins in <b>grotesques</b> highlights the preoccupation with temporality as a major theme in the visual culture of the period...|$|R
5|$|A polystylist, Shostakovich {{developed}} a hybrid voice, combining {{a variety of}} different musical techniques into his works. His music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the <b>grotesque,</b> and ambivalent tonality; the composer was also heavily influenced by the neo-classical style pioneered by Igor Stravinsky, and (especially in his symphonies) by the late Romanticism associated with Gustav Mahler.|$|E
5|$|Clotho– The final Sister {{who was the}} {{gigantic}} and <b>grotesque</b> keeper of the loom from which the threads of all life are spun. The character was voiced by Susan Silo in God of War II, and Marina Gordon in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|Emilio del Guercio {{said that}} the toy arrow {{represents}} absurdity and the teardrop sentimentality and melancholy. According to Argentine graphic artist Rep, the artwork conveys a <b>grotesque,</b> dramatic flavor and {{the feeling that the}} album should be taken seriously but not too seriously.|$|E

5|$|The Land of Gorch {{takes place}} in a world far away from {{contemporaneous}} society. The characters live on a fictional, swamp-like planet in a fantasy genre. The set includes volcanoes and prehistoric themes. The environment is dismal and the puppets have <b>grotesque</b> physical appearances.|$|E
5|$|The characters' {{contemporary}} {{language and}} Pitar's thorough knowledge of modern-day history, philosophy and science {{add to the}} <b>grotesque</b> humor of the novel, while his two friends quote classical Roman literature and Chinese sayings. The book was published by Viennese publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, several Austrian and German critics and writers published reviews of the novel.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{includes}} {{the debut of}} the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl. After the episode, it was moved into the Simpsons' basement, where it has since reappeared as a prop {{in the background of}} several episodes, although never in a major role. The design was partially based on real Olmec heads, but changed to look more interesting and <b>grotesque.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a <b>grotesque</b> head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, a Thrud {{comic strip}} {{was a regular}} and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame {{magazine}} White Dwarf with Thrud's <b>grotesque</b> and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine's golden age. In 2002, continued interest in the character from role-playing enthusiasts {{and a desire to}} be free to experiment with a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length Thrud the Barbarian comics.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day. The satirical character of the book stems from the underlying <b>grotesque</b> scenario, the speeches of Pitar and his fellow hominids, the mentioning of artifacts which {{have not yet been}} invented, and the numerous allusions to world history and literature.|$|E

5|$|In need of work, Poe {{accepted}} {{a job at}} the low salary of $10 per week as assistant editor for Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, despite their negative review of his novel. He also returned to his focus on short stories rather than longer works of prose; Poe's next published book after this, his only completed novel, was the collection Tales of the <b>Grotesque</b> and Arabesque in 1840.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the killer}} is hunting {{for his next}} victim. While unknown to him, the murderer is trapped {{in a world of}} <b>grotesque</b> hallucinations. Later that night, local police {{officers}} spot his latest victim. Frank visits the crime scene, which gives him a vision of the crime, again startling his colleague Bletcher. Later on, Frank presents his finding to the local homicide department, saying that the murderer is obsessed with apocalyptic prophecies and maddened by twisted sexual guilt.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as {{the type}} {{specimen}} {{of a variety}} of <b>grotesque</b> hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).|$|E

5|$|The Golden Age of <b>Grotesque</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was {{released}} on May 7, 2003 by Nothing and Interscope Records, and was their first album to feature former KMFDM member Tim Sköld, who joined after longtime bassist Twiggy Ramirez amicably left the group over creative differences. It was also their final studio album to feature keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit before {{the release of the}} band's next studio album.|$|E
5|$|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was {{published}} and widely reviewed in 1838. In {{the summer of}} 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing {{his reputation as a}} trenchant critic which he had established at the Southern Literary Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the <b>Grotesque</b> and Arabesque {{was published}} in twovolumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews. Poe left Burton's after about a year and found a position as assistant at Graham's Magazine.|$|E
5|$|Trollope has {{described}} {{again and again}} the ravages of love... His story is always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system. There is a young lady who has two lovers, or {{a young man who}} has two sweethearts; we are treated to the innumerable forms in which this predicament may present itself and the consequences, sometimes pathetic, sometimes <b>grotesque,</b> which spring from such false situations.|$|E
