50|$|<b>Diastrophism</b> covers {{movement}} of solid (plastic) crust material, {{as opposed to}} {{movement of}} molten material which is covered by volcanism. Movement causes rock to be bent or broken. The most obvious evidence of disastrophic movement can be seen where sedimentary rocks have been bent, broken or tilted. Such non-horizontal strata provide visual proof of movement. Diastrophic movement can be classified as two types, folding and faulting, tilted beds usually {{are part of a}} larger syncline or anticline. Diastrophic movement is often called orogenic as it is associated with mountain building.|$|E

5000|$|The word <b>diastrophism</b> {{refers to}} the {{deformation}} of the earth, such as by earthquakes; Hernandez defines it as [...] "the action of forces that deform the Earth's crust and so produce continents, mountains, etc". [...] "Human diastrophism" [...] thus refers metaphorically to the great changes {{that take place in}} the lives of those in Palomar through the events in the story.

5000|$|Henrandez {{recognized}} {{how difficult}} it was for new readers of Love and Rockets to get up to speed with the increasingly longer and complex stories; in issue [...] (June 1988)—in which the last instalment of Human <b>Diastrophism</b> appeared—in lieu of a [...] "story so far", he declared: [...] "For any new reader of this story; forget it, it's hopeless." [...] The problem only worsened with the following serial, Poison River, which was longer and more complex. The weak reader reception to these two serials contributed to Hernandez' decision to bring Love and Rockets to an end in 1996, after which he produced various series and standalone graphic novels.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} <b>diastrophism</b> {{encompasses}} the varying {{responses of the}} crust to tectonic stresses. These responses include linear or torsional horizontal movements (such as continental drift) and vertical subsidence and uplift of the lithosphere (strain) in response to natural stresses on Earth’s surface such as the weight of mountains, lakes, and glaciers. Subsurface conditions also cause subsidence or uplift, known as epeirogeny, over large areas of Earth’s surface without deforming rock strata. Such changes include the thickening of the lithosphere by overthrusting, changes in rock density of the lithosphere caused by metamorphism or thermal expansion and contraction, increases in {{the volume of the}} asthenosphere (part of the upper mantle supporting the lithosphere) caused by hydration of olivine, and orogenic, or mountain-building, movements.|$|E

Hernandez introduces her and the teenaged Heraclio as newcomers to the fictional Latin American village of Palomar in [...] "Sopa de Gran Pena" [...] (Spanish for [...] "Heartbreak Soup") in Love and Rockets [...] in 1983. Hernandez gradually took advantage of serialization to broaden his narrative scope; the stories became longer and more ambitious, and Hernandez delved more deeply into the backgrounds of his large cast of characters as their stories develop over a narrative timeframe of decades. Hernandez embarked on his longest and most complex work to date when he began Human <b>Diastrophism</b> in 1987.|$|E
50|$|The Himalayan {{mountain}} {{chain is}} a fold and thrust belt {{that can be}} divided into four units bounded by thrusts from south to north: the Sub-Himalaya, Lesser Himalaya, Greater Himalaya and Tethyan Himalaya. The Lesser Himalayan Zone has a lower relief and elevation of the mountains compared to Greater Himalaya. The Lesser Himalaya Sequence (LHS) is bounded by two main thrusts: the Main Central Thrust (MCT) in the north and the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) in the south.The main layers of the LHS includes non-fossiliferous, low-grade, metasedimentary rocks, metavolcanic strata and augen gneiss. These have been dated as an age ranging from 1870 Ma to 520 Ma (i.e. Proterozoic to Cambrian). Near the end of the Early Cambrian, there was a regional <b>diastrophism</b> (i.e. deformation of the Earth's crust) or crustal movement that heaved up the Indian subcontinent, interrupting the sedimentation in the Lesser Himalaya and causing a widespread unconformity in Nepal. This is known as the Great Lesser Himalayan Unconformity, which separates the older LHS from the overlying younger LHS that has an age of Permian to Middle Eocene.|$|E

Our electromagnetic wave data, observed at 223 Hz at the Omaezaki site, about 110 km and 150 km northwest of the Kozu and Miyake Islands, respectively, detected a clear, anomalous magnetic flux radiation that corresponded well with the seismographic and GPS data. Similar radiation was received for about one week preceding the big volcanic eruption that occurred on 18 August 2000.

40|$|The {{changing}} patterns and episodic nature of <b>diastrophism,</b> sedimentation, and volcanism from Late Ordovician through Early Devonian time in Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand is {{presented with the}} aid of a correlation chart and two paleogeographic-lithofacies maps for late Llandovery and Ludlow-Pridoli times; such analysis proved impractical for the early Llandovery and Wenlock owing to the paucity of preserved sequences, a reflection of significant <b>diastrophism</b> at those times. The criteria for correlation, patterns of paleocommunities, and the applicability of local series ' names are examined; plutonism and the contribution of radiometric dating, particularly with regard to estimates of the age of system boundaries, using Australian sequences, are briefly probed.
