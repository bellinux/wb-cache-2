5|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{those who}} {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune {{showed that it}} must have been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these storms did not threaten land. As Kenna and Patricia were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes. While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to test equipment and conduct research.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy {{before and after the}} first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon system}} was not {{designed}} for customization, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> soldiers <b>of</b> the South Korean military will not see extended use of their weapons.|$|R

5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on {{the defeat of the}} Reds in the 1918 war and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.|$|E
5000|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} the skeptical movement is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the phenomena covered, e.g. astrology or homeopathy, have been debunked again and again, they stay popular.|$|R

5000|$|The name {{monocotyledons}} {{is derived}} from the traditional botanical name [...] "Monocotyledones" [...] or Monocotyledoneae in Latin, which refers to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> members <b>of</b> this group have one cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds.|$|R
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Rewrite {{marked the}} first time since Key's third game Clannad that Itaru Hinoue was staffed as the sole art {{director}} and character designer in a Key visual novel. The school uniforms for the heroines in the game are old designs that Hinoue created and used before in dōjinshi (self-published work). In particular, Hinoue spent much time on drawing the character art in Rewrite {{due in part to the}} design of the school uniforms, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the female characters have long hair, and because of the increased aspect ratio. Six more graphic artists worked on Rewrite: Torino headed the background art, Ryou Shigawa designed and illustrated the monsters, and the computer graphics in the game were done by Na-Ga, Shinory, Mochisuke, and Minimo Tayama. The game's soundtrack was composed by Key's signature composers Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, in addition to Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Maeda also contributed on the quality control for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping {{to make more money}} that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{common names}} [...] - [...] barbs and barbels [...] - [...] {{refer to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> members <b>of</b> the genera have a pair of barbels on their mouths, which they can use to search for food {{at the bottom of}} the water.|$|R
50|$|Before they disbanded, the Legionnaires sent nine {{players to}} the NHL, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their history, {{they were a}} Jr.'B' team and there were only six NHL teams. They also sent two players to the WHA.|$|R
40|$|Equilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{have been used}} to investigate the fluid adsorption phenomena and calculate the surface tension in porous media at different temperatures, densities and pore widths. The <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the fluid particles are adsorbed adherent to the pore walls and the surface forms near the walls have been found, and that the surface is not stable which means there exists an oscillation phenomenon in pores have been also found. The surface tension in pores is much bigger than that in macrovolume systems like normal liquid–liquid and liquid–vapor interfaces, and it will increase with the increase of density and pore width, but will decrease with the increase of temperature...|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of the}} Christianisation of Scotland {{has seen}} it as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. Historian Richard Fletcher argued that motivations for these missions may have included the example of St. Patrick, the idea of Peregrinatio and a growing interest in evangelism. Missionaries from Ireland were operating on the British mainland from at least the sixth century. This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of St. Ninian, St. Kentigern and St. Columba. However, historian Gilbert Markus highlights the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its volume {{is made up of}} a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E

60|$|It {{appears to}} be the <b>fact,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the vessels with which Columbus {{undertook}} his long and perilous voyages, were of this light and frail construction; and little superior to the small craft which ply on rivers and along coasts in modern days.|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron {{sources have}} proven to be immensely {{important}} research tools throughout the biological, physical and engineering sciences.

30|$|The idea of {{vaporization}} {{of external}} water {{is supported by}} the geological background that a shallow hydrothermal system is developed beneath the Kirishima Volcano Group (e.g., Kagiyama et al., 1996). This is also supported by the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the historical explosive activities in the Shinmoedake volcano is characterized by phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions (Imura and Kobayashi, 2001). Even for vulcanian explosions at the later stage of the 2011 event, magma-water interaction is suggested based on a microscopic analysis of ash particles (Suzuki et al., 2013 b). However, this idea is questionable for the 1 February vulcanian explosion because {{it is likely that the}} shallow hydrothermal system had been mostly dried up during the subplinian and dome-building stages in January.|$|R
25|$|Williams famously remarked {{upon the}} bitter {{irony of the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the homes he designed, and whose {{construction}} he oversaw, were on parcels whose deeds included segregation covenants barring blacks from purchasing them.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{a number}} of authors have had {{more to say about}} what Newton gained from Hooke and some aspects remain controversial. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Hooke's private papers had been {{destroyed}} or have disappeared does not help to establish the truth.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} {{significant}} progress in the integration of this population group in the Israeli society, primarily due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the young Ethiopian population enlists to the mandatory Israel military service, where most Ethiopian Jews have been able to increase their chances for better opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Many {{microorganisms}} {{can cause}} infective endocarditis. These are generally isolated by blood culture, where the patient's blood is removed, and any growth is noted and identified. The term bacterial endocarditis (BE) commonly is used, reflecting the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> cases <b>of</b> IE {{are due to}} bacteria; however, infective endocarditis (IE) has become the preferred term.|$|R
25|$|Five days later, on 5 December 1645 {{a second}} {{earthquake}} occurred, {{said to be}} of the same magnitude as the first. This time there were no fatalities, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the buildings had already collapsed and the population was prepared. The city was left in such condition that one could not walk through it.|$|E
25|$|The series took {{almost five}} years to make, {{involving}} nearly 200 filming locations. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the ocean environment remains a mystery presented the production team with many challenges. Besides witnessing some animal behaviours for the first time, the crew also observed some that were new to science. The producers were helped by marine scientists {{all over the world}} with state-of-the-art equipment.|$|E
25|$|He also located {{his brother}} (a Polish {{resistance}} fighter) in a German POW camp in Austria, {{which had been}} liberated by the Russians in 1945. Anticipating the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Polish resistance falling {{into the hands of}} the Soviets were likely to be deported to Siberia, Gladych used his USAAF status to visit the camp and managed to smuggle his brother out to the West.|$|E
30|$|Many {{researchers}} have {{paid attention to}} the study of the probability limit theorem and its applications for the independent random variables, while the <b>fact</b> is <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the random variables found in real practice are dependent, which just motivates the authors’ interests in how well the dependent random variables will behave in some cases.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to overcrowding, juvenile prisons are questioned for their overall effectiveness in rehabilitating youth.
