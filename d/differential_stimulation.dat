40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{inhibition}} of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) by the specific inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in the rat colon and small intestine on mucosal contents of polyamines, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (decarboxylated AdoMet) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMet decarboxylase) activity were studied. Administration of 1 % DFMO in {{the drinking water}} for 10 or 15 weeks resulted in inhibition of ODC and decreases in intracellular putrescine and spermidine contents in both proximal and distal segments of small intestine and colon. At both time points DFMO administration resulted in a dramatic stimulation of AdoMet decarboxylase activity and a rise in decarboxylated AdoMet content in the proximal and distal small-intestinal segments compared with controls, which was not seen in either colonic segment of DFMO-treated animals. This <b>differential</b> <b>stimulation</b> of AdoMet decarboxylase by DFMO in the small intestine and colon could not be entirely explained {{on the basis of}} differences in polyamine contents, which are known to regulate this enzyme activity. Kinetic and inhibition studies of AdoMet decarboxylase in control small and large intestine revealed that: (1) {{there was no difference in}} Vmax. values between the tissues; (2) the Km for AdoMet was higher in the small intestine than in the colon; and (3) the Ki for product inhibition by decarboxylated AdoMet was higher in the small intestine than in the colon.

Gene expression and protein levels of signaling molecules including collagen type I (Col I), Col II, Col X, Ihh, and PTHrP in the cytoplasm of fibrochondrocytes were detected.

Ihh/PTHrP double intervention group, as well as control group, was included to study the regulatory mechanisms of the Ihh/PTHrP signaling pathway in fibrochondrocytes. Under low cyclic stress tensile (CTS), PTHrP, Col I, and Col II gene expression and protein synthesis increased. Under high CTS, Ihh and Col X gene expression and protein synthesis increased. Blocking Ihh signaling with cyclopamine resulted in reduced PTHrP gene expression and protein synthesis and increased Col X gene expression and protein synthesis.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pattern-classification methods to show that the cortical representation of a nonstimulated quarter-field carries information that can discriminate the surrounding visual context. We show further that the activity patterns in these regions are significantly related to those observed with feed-forward stimulation and that these effects are driven primarily by V 1.

Bisection of vertical lines has also been employed, albeit less frequently. Interestingly, normal subjects often bisect horizontal lines too far left and vertical lines too high. We used fMRI to investigate whether vertical/horizontal stimulus orientation interacts with the neural mechanisms associated with line bisection judgments (the Landmark task). For control of orientation per se, subjects performed a visual detection task with the same stimuli. Statistical analysis of evoked BOLD responses employed SPM 99. The Landmark task increased neural activity (P < 0. 05, corrected) in the superior and inferior parietal lobes bilaterally, though predominantly on the right; early visual processing areas bilaterally; and cerebellar vermis, left cerebellar hemisphere, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex bilaterally. Vertical lines (relative to horizontal lines and vice versa) increased neural activity in early visual processing areas, consistent with <b>differential</b> retinotopic <b>stimulation.</b> In addition, vertical lines activated right parietooccipital and superior posterior parietal cortex bilaterally. No significant interactions between the neural mechanisms associated with task and stimuli were observed. Increased neural activation in parietal and parietooccipital cortex associated with vertical lines may reflect increased attentional demands associated with this stimulus orientation. The right hemispheric dominance observed in posterior parietal during the Landmark task irrespective of stimulus orientation is consistent with lesion studies. Our results suggest that the behavioral patterns observed in normal subjects and neurological patients result from different stimulus effects rather than differential task demands...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} single and of {{multiple}} iron injection {{on the distribution}} of isoferritins was studied in rat liver with the aid of 14 C-labelling either after or before iron treatment.

Analysis of protein and labelling patterns show that it not only produces a disproportionate increase in the more-basic isoferritins, but may, in sufficient dose, actually lead to a decrease in the more-acidic isoferritins. Use of iron injection after radioactivity shows that it must give rise to post-assembly changes causing acidic isoferritins to become more basic. With a moderate iron dose this change is relatively slow, taking several hours, and seems to occur in addition to a <b>differential</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the synthesis of the more-basic isoferritins.

40|$|Effects {{of light}} on {{carbohydrate}} levels and certain carbon metabolizing enzyme activities were studied during the early development of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) fruit. Sucrose levels were low and continued to decline during development and were unaffected by light. Starch was significantly greater in light. Invertase activity was similar in both light- and dark-grown fruit. Sucrose synthase activity was much lower than invertase and showed a slight decrease in light-grown fruit between days 21 and 28. Light-grown fruit also had higher ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase activity than dark-grown fruit, which was correlated with higher starch levels. The rapidly decreasing activity of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase during early fruit development in the dark in conjunction with reduced starch levels and rates of accumulation indicates that ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase is crucial for carbon import and storage in tomato.

The effect on glycine uptake was not due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation or to a decrease in respiration rate. Evidence for anaerobic differences was provided by the addition of either glucose or ferricyanide to cell suspensions containing glycerol, thereby maintaining anoxic uptake of phenylalanine, but not glycine, at the aerobic level. Ferricyanide stimulation required a functional Ca, Mg-adenosine 5 '-triphosphatase and involved cell metabolism.

Females were autopsied on days 7, 14 or 21 after mating, or on the expected day of birth to confirm pregnancy, and the number of implantation sites or of viable fetuses or pups determined. Because of substantial behavioural variability within an ejaculatory series, data from paced and nonpaced females were divided according to whether they received a low (=le) or high (=ge) number of intromissions. The incidence of pregnancy was significantly reduced among paced females receiving few intromissions relative to that of any other group. Histological examination of ovaries from females autopsied on day 7 after mating suggested that the reduced pregnancy rate among this paced, low intromission group resulted from a failure of activation of the corpora lutea, a possible consequence of the low number of intromissions received by these females. However, in paced, low intromission females that became pregnant, litter size was significantly greater than in nonpaced, low intromission females. These results suggest a compensatory effect of the temporal patterning of intromissive stimulation on fertility. This effect is not a consequence of differential mortality after implantation since {{there was no difference in}} litter size among females autopsied at any of the four times. The differences between paced and nonpaced females may be attributable to preimplantation effects such as differential release of ova or sperm transport...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of species-typical perceptual preferences {{has been shown}} to depend on a variety of socially and ecologically derived sensory stimulation during both the pre- and postnatal periods. The prominent mechanism behind the {{development of}} these seemingly innate tendencies in young organisms has been hypothesized to be a domain-general pan-sensory selectivity process referred to as perceptual narrowing, whereby regularly experienced sensory stimuli are honed in upon, while simultaneously losing the ability to effectively discriminate between atypical or unfamiliar sensory stimulation. Previous work with precocial birds has been successful in preventing the development of species-typical perceptual preferences by denying the organism typical levels of social and/or self-produced stimulation. The current series of experiments explored the mechanism of perceptual narrowing to assess the malleability of a species-typical auditory preference in avian embryos. By providing a variety of different unimodal and bimodal presentations of a mixed-species vocalizations at the onset of prenatal auditory function, the following project aimed to 1) keep the perceptual window from narrowing, thereby interfering with the development of a species-typical auditory preference, 2) investigate how long <b>differential</b> prenatal <b>stimulation</b> can keep the perceptual window open postnatally, 3) explore how prenatal auditory enrichment effected preferences for novelty, and 4) assess whether prenatal auditory perceptual narrowing is affected by modality specific or amodal stimulus properties during early development. Results indicated that prenatal auditory enrichment significantly interferes with the emergence of a species-typical auditory preference and increases openness to novelty, at least temporarily. After accruing postnatal experience in an environment rich with species-typical auditory and multisensory cues, the effect of prenatal auditory enrichment rapidly was found to rapidly fade. Prenatal auditory enrichment with extraneous non-synchronous light exposure was shown to both keep the perceptual narrowing window open and impede learning in the postnatal environment, following hatching. Results are discussed in light of the role experience plays in perceptual narrowing during the perinatal period. ...|$|R

Exposure of BALB/c strain mice to concentrations of TMA and DNCB which resulted in equivalent levels of activation (cell proliferation) in lymph nodes draining the site of application (50 % TMA and 1 % DNCB) induced comparable levels of contact sensitization and IgG anti-hapten antibody production. However, under these conditions, exposure only to TMA resulted in an elevation of serum IgE. Furthermore, while TMA induced IgG 2 b rather than IgG 2 a antibody the reverse pattern was observed with DNCB. These data demonstrate that TMA and DNCB elicit qualitatively different immune responses which are consistent with their potential to cause respiratory and contact allergy, respectively.

40|$|Innate {{immunity}} recognizes and resists various pathogens; {{however, the}} mechanisms regulating pathogen versus non-pathogen discrimination are still imprecisely understood. Here, we demonstrate that pathogen-specific activation of TLR 2 upon infection with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, {{in comparison with}} other pathogenic microbes, including Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus, programs macrophages for robust up-regulation of signaling cohorts of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. Signaling perturbations or genetic approaches suggest that infection-mediated stimulation of Wnt-beta-catenin is vital for activation of Notch 1 signaling. Interestingly, inducible NOS (iNOS) activity is pivotal for TLR 2 -mediated activation of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling as iNOS(-/-) mice demonstrated compromised ability to trigger activation of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling as well as Notch 1 -mediated cellular responses. Intriguingly, TLR 2 -driven integration of iNOS/NO, Wnt-beta-catenin, and Notch 1 signaling contributes to its capacity to regulate the battery of genes associated with T(Reg) cell lineage commitment. These findings reveal a role for <b>differential</b> <b>stimulation</b> of TLR 2 in deciding the strength of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling, which together with signals from Notch 1 contributes toward the modulation of a defined set of effector functions in macrophages and thus establishes a conceptual framework {{for the development of}} novel therapeutics...|$|E

The hypothesis usually postulated to explain these anomalies is that the tumour may in the same individual be composed of multiple genetically distinct clones of cells.

We now report the identification and characterization of novel five-transmembrane(5 TM) forms of both human VPAC 1 and human VPAC 2.

These differences were attributable neither to a <b>differential</b> blue light <b>stimulation</b> of photorespiration nor to a differential presence of a nonplastid screening pigment. The conifers all had similar carotenoid-chlorophyll ratios, with approximately 50 % more carotenoid relative to chlorophyll as compared to red alder.

This study provides strong evidence for <b>differential</b> <b>stimulation</b> of microbial nitrogen transformations by three functionally contrasting species of macrofauna (Hediste diversicolor, Corophium volutator, Hydrobia ulvae). Despite increased nitrification, abundance of ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) at the sediment–water interface did not significantly change {{in the presence of}} macrofauna. However, species-specific differences in macrofaunal activity did influence ammonia oxidiser community structure, increasing AOB abundance relative to AOA in the presence of C. volutator or H. ulvae, but with no change in H. diversicolor and no-macrofauna treatments. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles were similar between macrofaunal treatments, although one AOB band increased in relative intensity in the presence of C. volutator, decreased in the H. diversicolor treatment and was unchanged in the H. ulvae treatment. These data suggest that links between bioturbating macrofauna and nutrient cycling are not expressed through changes in the abundance of ammonia oxidisers in surface sediments, but are associated with changes in the AOA : AOB ratio depending on the invertebrate species...|$|E
40|$|To {{reveal the}} {{cortical}} network underlying figure/ground perception {{and to understand}} its neural dynamics, we developed a novel paradigm that creates distinct and prolonged percepts of spatial structures by instantaneous refreshes in random dot fields. Three different forms of spatial configuration were generated by: (i) updating the whole stimulus field, (ii) updating the ground region only (negative-figure), and (iii) updating the figure and ground regions in brief temporal asynchrony. FMRI responses were measured throughout the brain. As expected, activation by the homogenous whole-field update was focused onto the posterior part of the brain, but distinct networks extending beyond the occipital lobe into the parietal and frontal cortex were activated by the figure/ground and by the negativefigure configurations. The instantaneous stimulus paradigm generated {{a wide variety of}} BOLD waveforms and corresponding neural response estimates throughout the network. Such expressly different responses evoked by <b>differential</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the identical cortical regions assure that the differences could be securely attributed to the neural dynamics, not to spatial variations in the hemodynamic response function. The activation pattern for figure/ground implies a widely distributed neural architecture, distinct from the control conditions. Even where activations are partially overlapping, an integrated analysis of the BOLD response properties will enable the functional specificity of the cortical areas to be distinguished...|$|E
40|$|Coffee {{is widely}} consumed, {{especially}} during mental stress conditions. Cardiovascular impact of coffee remains debated because {{the underlying mechanisms}} of action are complex. We reported previously <b>differential</b> cardiovascular <b>stimulation</b> of coffee at rest depending on habitual consumption. The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effects of coffee on cardiovascular response to mental stress. In 15 healthy volunteers (6 habitual, 9 nonhabitual coffee drinkers), we assessed the effect of mental stress on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) before and after a triple espresso, intravenous caffeine, and placebo in the same subjects. Under baseline conditions, mental stress significantly increases MSA (+ 2. 5 +/- 0. 7 volts per minute; + 14. 1 +/- 10. 3 %), systolic (+ 11. 6 +/- 4. 1 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (+ 6. 4 +/- 2. 0 mm Hg), and HR (+ 9. 6 +/- 1. 8 minutes(- 1)). In nonhabitual coffee drinkers, a triple espresso but not caffeine induced an additional increase in systolic BP (+ 9 +/- 6. 3 mm Hg; P= 0. 003) during mental stress, whereas in habitual drinkers, the stress-induced BP increase was blunted (+ 4 +/- 3. 9 mm Hg; P=NS). As a result, nonhabitual coffee drinkers experienced significantly higher BP during mental stress than habitual drinkers (151 +/- 17. 9 / 83 +/- 5. 6 mm Hg versus 130 +/- 7. 8 / 74 +/- 6. 7 mm Hg; P< 0. 05). Caffeine induced similar effects in habitual and nonhabitual coffee drinkers at rest and during mental stress. The response to the cold pressor test was not influenced by coffee drinking in both groups. In conclusion, in nonhabitual coffee drinkers, coffee enhances the cardiovascular response to mental stress with an additional increase in systolic BP, whereas in habitual drinkers, the response is blunted. Caffeine alone does not exert any potentiating effect, confirming that ingredients other than caffeine are partially responsible for the stimulating effect of coffee on the cardiovascular system...|$|R
40|$|Our in vivo {{study used}} an ErbB 3 {{receptor}} transfection strategy {{to determine if}} topical application of EGF-like ligands would enhance repair. Partial-thickness porcine wounds transfected with adenoviral particles containing an ErbB 3 receptor gene or a vehicle β-galactosidase gene were introduced and wounds were concomitantly supplied {{with a variety of}} EGF-like ligands – EGF, epiregulin (EPR), heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF), and heregulin/neuregulin (HRG). Comparisons of cutaneous repair (resurfacing, dermal depth, proliferation, macrophage infiltration, microvascular density, apoptosis) were assessed after a 5 -day healing interval. Differential effects were noted. In wounds transfected with additional ErbB 3, either EPR or HB-EGF promoted resurfacing greater than EGF, HRG, or controls. Dermal responses differed significantly after EPR or HB-EGF treatments compared to EGF, HRG, ErbB 3 only, or empty vehicle. Hallmarks of enhanced wound maturity were noted in EPR- and HB-EGF-treated wounds transfected with ErbB 3. Our data confirmed that an ErbB 3 -driven pathway mediates a net positive influence in an in vivo model closely resembling human repair. The sensitivity in this system was sufficient to reveal <b>differential</b> outcomes following <b>stimulation</b> with various EGF ligands. We conclude that selective stimulation through an ErbB 3 -driven pathway shows promise as a therapeutic strategy to hasten wound maturity...|$|R
40|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation {{has become}} a popular tool to modulate neuronal networks and associated brain functions in both clinical and basic research. Yet {{few studies have examined}} the potential effects of cortical stimulation on general levels of vigilance. In this exploratory study, we used theta-burst protocols, both continuous (cTBS) and intermittent (iTBS) patterns, to examine whether inhibition or excitation of the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was able to induce reliable and acute changes to vigilance measures, compared to the left dorso-lateral associative visual cortex (dlAVC) as a control site in line with previous work. Partially sleep restricted participants underwent four separate sessions in a single day, in a between subjects design for TBS stimulation type and within subjects for locaton, each consisting of maintenance of wakefulness test, a sleep latency test, and a psychomotor vigilance task. TBS significantly affected measures of sleep consolidation, namely latency to sleep stage 2 and sleep efficiency, but had no effects on sleep drive or psychomotor vigilance levels for either TBS type or location. Contrary to our initial hypothesis of the dlAVC as a control site, stimulation to this region resulted in the largest <b>differential</b> effects between <b>stimulation</b> types. Moreover, the effect of TBS was found to be consistent throughout the day. These data may provide the basis for further investigation into therapeutic applications of TBS in sleep disorders...|$|R
