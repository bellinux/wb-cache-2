5|$|The 1954 <b>Guatemalan</b> coup d'état was {{a covert}} {{operation}} {{carried out by}} the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that deposed the democratically elected <b>Guatemalan</b> President Jacobo Árbenz and ended the <b>Guatemalan</b> Revolution of 1944–1954. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, {{the first in a series}} of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the <b>Guatemalan</b> government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the <b>Guatemalan</b> Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the <b>Guatemalan</b> government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the <b>Guatemalan</b> government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán was {{a colonial}} <b>Guatemalan</b> {{historian}} of Spanish descent who wrote La Recordación Florida. The book {{was written in}} 1690 and is {{regarded as one of}} the most important works of <b>Guatemalan</b> history. Field investigation has tended to support the estimates of indigenous population and army sizes given by Fuentes y Guzmán.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} with <b>Guatemalans</b> in the US from other Latinos {{is that a}} large percentage of <b>Guatemalans</b> are Evangelical Protestants. Guatemala had seen a rise of Protestant and Evangelist churches in the late 20th century, although the majority of <b>Guatemalans</b> are Roman Catholics.|$|R

5|$|His {{policies}} ran {{afoul of}} the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned {{by the presence of}} communists in the <b>Guatemalan</b> government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 <b>Guatemalan</b> coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the <b>Guatemalan</b> government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1970 {{the site}} was {{declared}} a National Precolumbian Monument by accord of the <b>Guatemalan</b> Ministry of Education (MINEDUC).|$|E
50|$|By 1986 {{the most}} {{prominent}} groups of Central Americans came from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Rodriguez identified five key groups: Salvadorans from urban and rural areas, urban Hispanic <b>Guatemalans,</b> rural <b>Guatemalans</b> of Mayan/indigenous origin, urban Hispanic Hondurans, and rural Hondurans of Garifuna origin.|$|R
50|$|The Northeast megalopolis, {{extending}} from Northern Virginia to north of Boston {{is home to}} a population of 257,729 <b>Guatemalans.</b> Cities such as Langley Park, Maryland, Trenton, New Jersey, Stamford, Connecticut, Providence, Rhode Island, and Lynn, Massachusetts have significant concentrations of <b>Guatemalans</b> along the corridor.|$|R
50|$|Immigrant Mayan American {{communities}} have preserved their ethnic customs. The <b>Guatemalans</b> of European descent (most of Spanish ancestries) often mixed with other U.S. Hispanic groups. However, {{it is unknown}} the transmission of cultural traditions <b>Guatemalans</b> of immigrants to their descendants by lack of studies, not knowing anything about their descendants.|$|R

5|$|According to officials, the {{sinkhole}} had similarities {{with another}} <b>Guatemalan</b> sinkhole which collapsed in 2007, which {{may also have}} been formed by ruptured sewage pipes.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among <b>Guatemalan</b> exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the <b>Guatemalan</b> people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the <b>Guatemalan</b> countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the <b>Guatemalan</b> military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to the <b>Guatemalan</b> people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 27 June 1954, a CIA Lockheed P-38M Lightning {{attacked}} Puerto San José and dropped napalm bombs on the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company W.R. Grace and Company Line, and was being loaded with <b>Guatemalan</b> cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation. On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the <b>Guatemalan</b> air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the <b>Guatemalan</b> army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán was {{a colonial}} <b>Guatemalan</b> {{historian}} of Spanish descent who wrote La Recordación Florida, also called Historia de Guatemala (History of Guatemala).

5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the <b>Guatemalan</b> black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and <b>Guatemalan</b> black howler.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} force led by Castillo Armas {{attempted to make}} forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the <b>Guatemalan</b> army. The propaganda broadcast by the CIA had far more effect; it succeeded in leading a <b>Guatemalan</b> pilot to defect, which led to Árbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb <b>Guatemalan</b> towns for psychological effect. When the old planes used by the invasion force {{were found to be}} inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident by the Security Council, stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that Árbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas.|$|E
