Master and antithetic faults across Devils Lane and several other grabens are defined quantitatively by the displacement distributions along the faults. Two-dimensional shape parameters that characterize the displacement profiles indicate that inelastic processes such as changes in fault frictional strength influence strain accumulation along the faults. The degree of graben asymmetry increases systematically with distance from the Colorado River; greater symmetry is associated with locally greater age and/or strain of grabens nearer the river. Scatter in plots of maximum displacement vs. fault length was attributed previously to linkage of fault segments alone but is here shown to correlate additionally with distance from the Colorado River and, therefore, to spatial strain gradients within the graben array. Extensional strain across the fault array, accumulating at rates of perhaps 1. 5 to 2 cm/yr or 10 (- 14) to 10 (- 13) s(- 1), is accommodated at depth by salt flow and formation of reactive salt diapirs beneath the grabens and was probably initiated when the Colorado River had cut sufficiently deep into the section for active salt diapirism to commence...|$|E
40|$|A {{boundary}} element {{model was}} developed for stress/stability analysis of underground excavations {{in the vicinity of}} faults. The boundary element formulation adopts the Fictitious Stress Method for the simulation of excavation boundaries and the Displacement Discontinuity Method for the representation of faults. With the assumption that deformations and stress changes can generally be attributed to the presence of faults rather than to elastoplasticity of the rock mass, the numerical model employed a linear elastic constitutive relation for the rock, and nonlinear behaviour for the fault. This assumption is particularly justified in hard rock environment. Following a comprehensive review of constitutive models for rock joints, both deformation and peak strength models were incorporated for modelling the mechanical behaviour of the fault. Deformation or stiffness models include Goodman's constant stiffness model and Barton-Bandis' nonlinear model. The latter, considers the effect {{of a wide range of}} parameters such as coupling between shear and normal stresses and displacement, <b>joint</b> <b>closure,</b> joint separation, hardening followed by postpeak or residual behaviour. Peak strength models include Mohr-Coulomb and Barton-Bandis which employs a mobilized nonlinear shear strength envelope. An incremental, in situ stress relaxation algorithm is developed and implemented for the nonlinear analysis of the faults. Model verification was done by a comparison of its predictions with previously published results found in the literature. The comparison showed excellent agreement. A model sensitivity analysis was then carried out to compare the response of different discontinuity models.

40|$|AbstractWe {{implement}} proppant transport in {{a three-dimensional}} hydraulic fracturing simulator, including proppant settlement due to gravity, tip screen-out, and fracture closure. Constitutive equations are used {{that account for}} processes that can cause the flowing fraction of proppant {{to be different from}} the volumetric fraction of proppant. The constitutive equations capture the transition from Poiseuille flow to Darcy flow as the slurry transitions from dilute mixture to packed bed. We introduce new constitutive equations that allow the simulator to seamlessly describe the process of fracture closure, including a nonlinear <b>joint</b> <b>closure</b> law expressing fracture compliance and roughness and accounting for the effect of proppant accumulation into a packed layer between the fracture walls. We perform sensitivity analysis simulations to investigate the effect of fluid viscosity, proppant density, proppant size, and formation permeability. The simulations confirm that tip screen-out can limit fracture length, cause proppant banking, and increase injection pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that reasonably accurate results can be achieved without excessive mesh refinement. We also perform a simulation of hydraulic fracture propagation through a complex natural fracture network. In this simulation, proppant tends to accumulate at the intersections between natural and hydraulic fractures. Overall, the results suggest that in very low permeability formations, proppant settling is a major problem for proppant placement because proppant tends to gravitationally settle before fracture closure can occur. Because leakoff is so slow, proppant immobilization through bridging is critical for vertical proppant placement. Bridging can occur at aperture approximately three times greater than particle diameter, which will occur much sooner after shut-in than full mechanical closure. Even though larger diameter proppant settles more rapidly, it may lead to better proppant placement because it will bridge sooner, at a larger fracture aperture. These results also suggest that it is critical to optimize injection schedule in order to avoid tip screen-out, which leads to a shorter, wider fracture in which bridging is less likely to occur. Our modeling approach can be used practically for optimization of proppant placement through selection of fluid properties, proppant properties, and injection schedule...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to deepen the understanding of joint shear behavior under different boundary conditions. For this purpose, <b>joint</b> <b>closure</b> tests under quasi-static and dynamic conditions, direct shear and cyclic shear tests under CNL and DNL boundary conditions of plane joints are performed using GS- 1000 big shear box device. The dissertation also presents the procedure to simulate the shear box device and simulating the behavior of plane joints at the micro-scale using FLAC 3 D. Special {{attention has been given}} to understand the influencing factors of the normal stress level, direct shear rate, horizontal cyclic shear frequency, normal impact frequency, horizontal cyclic shear displacement amplitude and vertical impact force amplitude. Lab test and numerical simulation results show that the quasi-static joint stiffness increases with increasing normal force. Dynamic joint stiffness decreases with increasing superimposed normal force amplitudes. Normal impact frequencies have little influence on the joint stiffness. Rotations and stress changes at the plane joint during shearing are proven. Rotations and development of stress gradients can be decreased significantly by increasing the size of the bottom specimen and applying a shear velocity at the upper shear box and normal loading piston. Furthermore, peak shear force increases with increasing normal force. Friction angle of cyclic shear tests is smaller than that of direct shear tests. Moreover, significant time shifts between normal and shear force (shear force delay), normal force and friction coefficient (friction coefficient delay) during direct shear tests under DNL boundary conditions are observed and the reference quantity ‘shear-velocity-normal-impact-frequency’ (SV-NIF) to describe the behavior under DNL boundary conditions is defined. Peak shear force and minimum friction coefficient increase with increasing SV-NIF. Relative time shift between normal force and shear force decreases with increase of SV-NIF. The mechanical behavior of the GS- 1000 big shear box device is simulated and the loss of normal force caused by the tilting of the loading plate is quantified. Finally, the novel direct and cyclic shear strength criterions under DNL conditions are put forward. The shear strength criterions are in close agreement with the measured values, which indicates that the novel shear strength criterions are able to predict the shear strength under DNL conditions...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{ten years}} ago, the International Court of Justice made its {{landmark}} decision delimiting the United States (U. S.) -Canadian maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine. That decision {{was expected to}} open a new chapter in U. S. -Canadian maritime relations by forcing cooperative management of transboundary fishing stocks for one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s richest fishing grounds-Georges Bank. The shared management of this region was not considered problematic by the World Court due to the positive history of U. S. -Canadian relations. Until recently, however, there has been very little shared management in the Georges Bank region. Fish stocks in Georges Bank have been steadily declining, and are currently at an all time low. This decline has occurred despite restrictions on open fishing areas and landing limits that have been imposed on the fisheries in that area since the passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. A recent, stark example of the effects of this decline is the <b>joint</b> <b>closure</b> of the New England haddock fishery by Canada and the U. S. due to severe depletion of stocks caused by overfishing. The current condition of the Georges Bank fishery indicates that the United States and Canada have not effectively managed the fishery resources within their own exclusive economic zones (EEZ). It further demonstrates the consequences of their failure to successfully manage the shared resources of Georges Bank. In the past few years there have been limited efforts in cooperative fisheries management between the two countries. The recently approved Canada-United States Agreement of Fisheries Enforcement now requires that each country prohibit its fishermen from operating contrary to fisheries laws of the other country, while in that country 2 ̆ 7 s waters. Fishermen who violate the laws can no longer escape enforcement action by retreating to their own waters. This agreement made a positive step toward reducing tensions in the boundary areas between the countries and toward improving U. S. -Canadian coastal conservation efforts. Additionally, in recognition that cooperative fishery management plans between the two countries are more urgently needed than ever before, -the U. S. Congress has renewed its efforts to pass the necessary enabling legislation to allow the U. S. to become a participating member of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO). Although U. S. boats do not now regularly fish outside the EEZ, membership in NAFO would give the U. S. the opportunity to exchange scientific data about the fish stocks in the region, and would give the government leverage to negotiate a fishing quota for U. S. fishermen Most critically for the Georges Bank region, the legislation authorizes negotiations between the U. S. and Canada to seek a mutually beneficial management agreement for transboundary stocks, particularly cod and haddock. At a time when the United States is urging other countries to join fisheries management agreements, and advancing the general argument that fishing countries have a responsibility to participate in regional fishery conservation and management organizations, it should have a moral obligation, if not a legal one, to approve the NAFO legislation. This Article will present a look at the international legal standard for fisheries management contained in Article 63 of the Convention of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I). Specifically, it will consider whether Article 63 (1), which imposes a limited duty on States to seek agreement on transboundary stock management issues, reflects a generally accepted legal standard and, if so, how this standard should affect fisheries management in the Gulf of Maine. The 2 ̆ 2 legislative 2 ̆ 2 history of both sections of Article 63 will be reviewed, although the analysis will focus on Article 63 (1). The 2 ̆ 2 straddling stocks 2 ̆ 2 provisions of Article 63 (2) and the broader extent of UNCLOS III negotiations are {{beyond the scope of this}} article. In order to trace the international legal standard for transboundary stock management, one must first understand the legal process by which such a standard is developed. One scholar has defined modem international law as 2 ̆ 2 that body of [legal] rules and principles which States [...] . recognize as necessary for the maintenance of peace and good order among themselves, and habitually obey in order to maintain and preserve that good order. ” It is a law based upon the consent of States, where a breach of such consent subjects a State to those remedies available in international law. It follows from this that customary international law cannot be grounded upon mere convenience or courtesy, but must be evidenced by a consistent practice by the States in question based upon their recognition of the appropriate legal rules and regulations. Thus, the development of customary international law requires an agreement between two or more States on some norm which is based upon a perceived legal obligation to follow the norm in question. To determine whether an internatinational norm of cooperative management of transboundary or shared fish stocks exists, this Article reviews state practice in the years preceding the First United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I) in 1958, including a general review of fisheries agreements for the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and agreements among European and Asian countries. A brief review of the cooperative management provisions of the 1958 Geneva Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the High Seas will follow. The next section will trace the legislative history of Article 63 at UNCLOS III, followed by a determination of whether Article 63 (1) represents a codification of the customary law of the sea for cooperative fisheries management of transboundary stocks. This Article will then look at recent practices of cooperative management to determine if such practices are representative of an international standard. The conclusion will attempt to draw implications for the management of transboundary fish stocks on Georges Bank...|$|E

The first one is the measurements of the vibration change at a bridge movement joint and roadside noise change induced when a control vehicle is passing it (this one requires lane closure). The correlation between the vibration change and roadside noise change is plotted according the measurement data.

40|$|Two new {{three-dimensional}} rock mass strength {{criteria are}} developed in this dissertation by extending an existing rock mass strength criterion. These criteria incorporate {{the effects of}} the intermediate principal stress, minimum principal stress and the anisotropy resulting from these stresses acting on the fracture system. In addition, these criteria have the capability of capturing the anisotropic and scale dependent behavior of the jointed rock mass strength by incorporating the effect of fracture geometry through the fracture tensor components. Another significant feature of the new rock mass strength criterion which has the exponential functions (equation 6. 7) is having only four empirical coefficients compared to the existing strength criterion which has five empirical coefficients; if the joint sets have the same isotropic mechanical behavior, the number of the empirical coefficients reduces to two in this new strength criterion (equation 6. 10). The new criteria were proposed after analyzing 452 numerical modeling results of the triaxial, polyaxial and biaxial compression tests conducted on the jointed rock blocks having one or two joint sets by the PFC 3 D software version 5. In this research to have several samples with the same properties a synthetic rock material that is made out of a mixture of gypsum, sand and water was used. In total, 20 joint systems were chosen and joint sets have different dip angles varying from 15 to 60 at an interval of 15 with dip directions of 30 and 75 for the two joint sets. Each joint set also has 3 persistent joints with the joint spacing of 42 mm in a cubic sample of size 160 mm and the joints have the same isotropic mechanical behavior. The confining stress combination values were chosen based on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) value of the modeled intact synthetic rock. The minimum principal stress values were chosen as 0, 20, 40 and 60 percent of the UCS. For each minimum principal stress value, the intermediate principal stress value varies starting at the minimum principal stress value and increasing at an interval of 20 percent of the UCS until it is lower than the strength of the sample under the biaxial loading condition with the same minimum principal stress value. The new rock mass failure criteria were developed from the PFC 3 D modeling data. However, since the joint sets having the dip angle of 60 intersect the top and bottom boundaries of the sample simultaneously, the joint systems with {{at least one of the}} joint sets having the dip angle of 60 were removed from the database. Thus, 284 data points from 12 joint systems were used to find the best values of the empirical coefficients for the new rock mass strength criteria. λ, p and q were found to be 0. 675, 3. 16 and 0. 6, respectively, through a conducted grid analysis with a high R 2 (coefficient of determination) value of 0. 94 for the new criterion given by equation 6. 9 and a and b were found to be 0. 404 and 0. 972, respectively, through a conducted grid analysis with a high R 2 value of 0. 92 for the new criterion given by equation 6. 10. The research results clearly illustrate how increase of the minimum and intermediate principal stresses and decrease of the joint dip angle, increase the jointed rock block strength. This dissertation also illustrates how different confining stress combinations and joint set dip angles result in different jointed rock mass failure modes such as sliding on the joints, failure through the intact rock and a combination of the intact rock and joint failures. To express the new rock mass strength failure criteria, it was necessary to determine the intact rock strengths under the same confining stress combinations mentioned earlier. Therefore, the intact rock was also modeled for all three compression tests and the intact rock strengths were found for 33 different confining stress combinations. Suitability of six major intact rock failure criteria: Mohr-Coulomb, Hoek-Brown, Modified Lade, Modified Wiebols and Cook, Mogi and Drucker-Prager in representing the intact rock strength was examined through fitting them using the aforementioned 33 PFC 3 D data points. Among these criteria, Modified Lade, Modified Mogi with power function and Modified Wiebols and Cook were found to be the best failure criteria producing lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 0. 272, 0. 301 and 0. 307, respectively. Thus, these three failure criteria are recommended for the prediction of the intact rock strength under the polyaxial stress condition. In PFC unlike the other methods, macro mechanical parameters are not directly used in the model and micro mechanical parameter values applicable between the particles should be calibrated using the macro mechanical properties. Accurate calibration is a difficult or challenging task. This dissertation emphasized the importance of studying the effects of all micro parameter values on the macro mechanical properties before one goes through calibration of the micro parameters in PFC modeling. Important effects of two micro parameters, which have received very little attention, the particle size distribution and the cov of the normal and shear strengths, on the macro properties are clearly illustrated before conducting the said calibration. The intact rock macro mechanical parameter values for the Young’s modulus, uniaxial compression strength (UCS), internal friction angle, cohesion and Poisson's ratio were found by performing 3 uniaxial tests, 3 triaxial tests and 5 Brazilian tests on a synthetic material made out of a mixture of gypsum, sand and water and the joint macro mechanical parameter values were found by conducting 4 uniaxial compression tests and 4 direct shear tests on jointed synthetic rocks with a horizontal joint. Then the micro mechanical properties of the Linear Parallel Bond Model (LPMB) and Modified Smooth Joint Contact Model (MSJCM) were calibrated to represent the intact rock and joints respectively, through the specific procedures explained in this research. The similar results obtained between the 2 polyaxial experiments tests of the intact rock and 11 polyaxial experimental tests of the jointed rock blocks having one joint set and the numerical modeling verified the calibrated micro mechanical properties and further modification of these properties was not necessary. This dissertation also proposes a modification to the Smooth Joint Contact Model (SJCM) to overcome the shortcoming of the SJCM to capture the non-linear behavior of the <b>joint</b> <b>closure</b> varying with the joint normal stress. Modified Smooth Joint Contact Model (MSJCM) uses a linear relation between the joint normal stiffness and the normal contact stress to model the non-linear relation between the joint normal deformation and the joint normal stress observed in the compression joint normal stiffness test. A good agreement obtained between the results from the experimental tests and the numerical modeling of the compression joint normal test shows the accuracy of this new model. Moreover, another shortcoming associated with the SJCM application known as the interlocking problem was solved through this research by proposing a new joint contact implementation algorithm called joint sides checking (JSC) approach. The interlocking problem occurs due to a shortcoming of the updating procedure in the PFC software related to the contact conditions of the particles that lie around the intended joint plane during high shear displacements. This problem increases the joint strength and dilation angle and creates unwanted fractures around the intended joint plane...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in non-invasive optical, radiographic and μCT imaging {{provide an opportunity}} to monitor biological processes longitudinally in an anatomical context. One particularly relevant application for combining these modalities is to study orthopaedic implant infections. These infections are characterized by the formation of persistent bacterial biofilms on the implanted materials, causing inflammation, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteomyelitis, and bone damage, resulting in implant loosening and failure. An orthopaedic implant infection model was used in which a titanium Kirshner-wire was surgically placed in femurs of LysEGFP mice, which possess EGFP-fluorescent neutrophils, and a bioluminescent S. aureus strain (Xen 29; 1 × 10 (3) CFUs) was inoculated in the knee <b>joint</b> before <b>closure.</b> In vivo bioluminescent, fluorescent, X-ray and μCT imaging were performed on various postoperative days. The bacterial bioluminescent signals of the S. aureus-infected mice peaked on day 19, before decreasing to a basal level of light, which remained measurable for the entire 48 day experiment. Neutrophil EGFP-fluorescent signals of the S. aureus-infected mice were statistically greater than uninfected mice on days 2 and 5, but afterwards the signals for both groups approached background levels of detection. To visualize the three-dimensional location of the bacterial infection and neutrophil infiltration, a diffuse optical tomography reconstruction algorithm was used to co-register the bioluminescent and fluorescent signals with μCT images. To quantify the anatomical bone changes on the μCT images, the outer bone volume of the distal femurs were measured using a semi-automated contour based segmentation process. The outer bone volume increased through day 48, indicating that bone damage continued during the implant infection. Bioluminescent and fluorescent optical imaging was combined with X-ray and μCT imaging to provide noninvasive and longitudinal measurements of the dynamic changes in bacterial burden, neutrophil recruitment and bone damage in a mouse orthopaedic implant infection model...|$|R

These first computers were very expensive and were used mainly for storage and provided little assistance in calculations. When Figg was in his thirties, computers began to cost less and provide more. The 1960s, and 1970’s, hosted a majority of the pioneering work in technology for structural methods that are used today in concrete bridges. Before the late 1960s, bridges were constructed using deck hinges. This let the structure deform without applying high forces to the girders. However, over time the bridge itself would change shape because of the constant deformations. This would cause problems such as uneven road surfaces and early cracking in the pavement of the roads. Due to improvements in technology, however, this problem was solved using <b>closure</b> <b>joints</b> that made the bridge span continuous (Murillo 2004). This continuity method was made possible largely due to the creation of computer programs that could create detailed material-behavior-prediction models. Using these programs, engineers could run simulations that would help them predict whether or not these new techniques would work. These programs were not available until the early 1970s, because the computer itself still needed improvement.|$|R

40|$|A magnetotelluric survey {{across the}} Carnmenellis granite, {{part of the}} Cornubian {{batholith}} of SW England, is described. The granite is being investigated {{with reference to the}} extraction of Hot Dry Rock geothermal energy. The sounding data are found to be influenced by near-surface static distortion which can be minimized by the construction of a granite-average sounding tensor. The anisotropy in the average tensor {{can be attributed to the}} spatial form of the granite. This is verified by 2 -D modelling and the model results are used as control in the assessment of the vertical resistivity profile. The resistivity values obtained by the survey are found to correspond to a saturated ‘wet’ granite down to at least 10 km. Despite the high geothermal gradient the anticipated decrease of resistivity with increasing temperature does not take place. Below a depth of just over 1 km, resistivity values are found to increase to a depth of about 6 km. The results are compared with the laboratory-observed response of granite to increasing applied pressure and stress. The resistivity/depth section appears consistent with the completion of <b>joint</b> and crack <b>closure</b> by a depth of 7 km and a transfer to a pore-dominated resistivity mechanism below this depth. An electrical base to the granite is resolved at a depth of 14 km in accord with the depth to base adopted by regional gravity models...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Post-operative {{range of}} motion (ROM) {{is one of the}} most {{important}} parameters to assess, following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aims of the present systematic review were to analyse the available literature and determine if closing the knee in flexion or extension influences post-operative ROM, clinical outcomes, and complications following TKA. Methods A systematic review was performed using the keywords 'total knee arthroplasty', 'total knee replacement', and 'wound closure' or 'joint closure' or 'extension' or 'flexion' with no limit regarding the year of publication. The review was limited to the English-language articles, and each article was evaluated with a modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS). Results Six articles met inclusion criteria. The initial cohort included 202 TKAs in the flexion group and 201 in the extension group. Three hundred and ninety-seven TKAs were evaluated with an average follow-up of 8 months. There was no statistical difference (n. s.) between the two groups in terms of the average post-operative flexion. There were no statistical differences between the two groups regarding post-operative functional scores and VAS scores (n. s.). The average mCMS was 70. 9, indicating good methodological quality in the included studies. Conclusions The findings of the present review did not show any statistically significant differences in terms of post-operative flexion ROM, functional scores, or complications related to the position of the knee at the time of <b>joint</b> and wound <b>closure</b> during TKA. There is no clear advantage to either closure method based on the currently available evidence, and therefore, this choice should be based on surgeon preference...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTranexamic acid {{has been}} {{reported}} to be safer with topical administration than with intravenous administration in total knee arthroplasty. However, the most effective administration route of tranexamic acid in total hip arthroplasty remains controversial. This study compared the effectiveness of topical tranexamic acid administration with that of intravenous tranexamic acid administration in total hip arthroplasty. MethodsWe retrospectively examined the medical records of 886 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip joint, who had undergone unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty. The patients were divided into a control group (n =  302; did not receive tranexamic acid), topical group (n =  265; topically administered 2  g tranexamic acid in 30  mL normal saline via drain tubes placed in the <b>joint</b> before wound <b>closure</b> along with posterior soft tissue repair), and intravenous group (n =  319; intravenously administered 1  g tranexamic acid before skin incision along with posterior soft tissue repair). Data on blood loss, hemoglobin levels, transfusion rates, and occurrence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolization were collected. ResultsThe mean operation times were approximately 40  min in all of the groups. The operation time and intra-operative blood loss were significantly lower in the control group than in the topical and intravenous groups. However, the post-operative blood loss, total blood loss, and decrease in the hemoglobin level were significantly higher in the control group than in the topical and intravenous groups. There {{were no significant differences in}} terms of blood loss and systemic complications between the tranexamic acid administration methods. ConclusionsTranexamic acid reduces both post-operative and total blood loss in total hip arthroplasty. Moreover, a lower amount of tranexamic acid can be used to reduce blood loss in total hip arthroplasty with intravenous tranexamic acid administration than with topical tranexamic acid administration. Therefore, we suggest that tranexamic acid should be intravenously administered pre-operatively and the posterior soft tissue should be repaired to decrease total hip arthroplasty-related complications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} recent {{developments}} in the PDF calculations of turbulent flames, the high computational time required to implement PDF simulations makes it intractable in practical applications. Therefore, {{it is important to}} design and select different parameters for PDF calculation of most important quantities, i. e. temperature and major species means, in an efficient manner. The ingredients of the present model are a standard k–ε turbulence closure for modeling flow field and a <b>joint</b> composition PDF <b>closure</b> for the scalar fields. A modified Curl model is applied to consider molecular mixing in PDF transport equation and a simplified two-step mechanism which lowers the computational cost is incorporated to describe the chemistry. The flow field is solved numerically using an upwind discretization for the convective terms and a central discretization for the diffusion terms by coupling it with an Eulerian Monte Carlo algorithm to solve PDF transport equation. To show the superiority of the current PDF calculations over traditional moment-closure methods commonly used in practical applications, simulation is also performed by RANS method which shows large discrepancies, especially in prediction of maximum flame temperature (on the basis of present results, predicted flame temperature has 26 % error via RANS method and 8 % error via PDF method). Stoichiometric flame length predicted by RANS has 10 % error while, by PDF method, this error is negligible and about 0. 6 %. The effect of coefficient CΦ on the modified Curl model is also investigated and it is concluded that the commonly used value CΦ= 2. 0 is the best choice for the case of study. The numerical results obtained reveal that Westbrook–Drier mechanism is working very well in fuel-lean (F<Fst) non-premixed combustion and also it predicts the total heat released in methane combustion in a very good agreement with the experiment...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} concern of our nation’s aging infrastructure, several {{new ideas and}} {{concepts}} are being developed and implemented throughout several state departments. These turnkey innovative designs are being introduced into a rapid renewal technique called Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC). ABC was developed under the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2), which targeted strategic solutions to improve several aspects of transportation including, safety, congestion, and renewal methods for roads and bridges. Prefabricated bridge elements and systems (PBES) is one technique often associated with ABC. It incorporates the use of prebuilt modules, which include part of the girder system and {{a portion of the}} bridge deck. One of the most critical components in a modular system are the closure pours required to connect each prefabricated module. High performance materials (HPM) such as Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) are often being used for the longitudinal connections today. The transverse <b>closure</b> <b>joints</b> are used over the piers and connect each adjacent module. In this particular study, a steel compression block was placed on the piers and positioned tightly between the two adjacent modules to attempt to reduce the compressive forces that were transferred through the diaphragm. To assess the performance of the longitudinal and transverse joint details that were designed for use on a demonstration bridge, several specimens were constructed with a replica of the joint detail and ran through a series of lab tests to determine the strength and constructability. There were also specimens designed and constructed as a standard cast-in-place bridge deck that served as a baseline for comparison purposes. It was proven that the performance of the longitudinal joint detail was very consistent to the continuity that is provided by a monolithic slab. Two different materials were tested for use as the longitudinal joint material, Ductal UHPC and Korean UHPC. Both materials had comparable results throughout testing. As for the transverse joints, the inclusion of the steel compression block showed to effectively alter the performance as the specimen was able to withstand a larger moment prior to ultimate failure...|$|R
30|$|A lateral {{approach}} to the proximal femur was performed in all cases. The average incision length was approximately 14  cm. The deep fascia was opened {{the length of the}} incision. A “Y” incision was made over the greater trochanter elevating the gluteus medius, short external rotators and vastus lateralis. The muscles were elevated exposing the hip capsule. These muscles were later repaired in a cerclage fashion over the shoulder prosthesis to limit migration of the implant. The hip capsule was elevated off of the femoral neck and head. After debridement of the <b>joint,</b> a cerclage <b>closure</b> of the hip capsule using a heavy, non-absorbable suture was performed as an interpositional capsular arthroplasty. Next, attention was turned to the proximal femur, where sub-periosteal dissection was carried out to expose at least 2  cm below the lesser trochanter. At this level a transverse cut was made and the proximal femoral segment was liberated and removed. Once this step was completed, the femoral canal was prepared with sequential reaming. An adult shoulder prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) was then chosen. A drill hole was placed in the proximal femur, and a heavy, non-absorbable suture was placed through the drill hole to act as a cerclage suture to aid in securing the prosthesis. The component was then inserted in a press-fit manner and secured. Bone cement was not used. The remaining muscle sleeve was then re-approximated with heavy, non-absorbable sutures, closing the vastus lateralis, gluteus medius and short external rotators over the prosthesis. The post-operative management protocol involved radiographic imaging in the recovery unit, overnight admission, and parenteral antibiotic administration for the first post-operative 24  h. A 12 -week course of either oral indomethacin 25  mg three times daily or ibuprofen 10  mg/kg three times daily was administered for the prevention of HO; if the child was dependent on a gastrostomy tube, this medication was administered via gastrostomy tube.|$|R
40|$|The geomorphological {{behaviour}} of steep jointed rock slopes {{has been}} studied using distinct element computer models. In order to model steep slopes effectively, methodologies need to be combined from the studies of environmental modellers, geomorphologists and engineers. The distinct element method is ideal {{for the study of}} the development of jointed rock masses, where the failure is controlled by the nature of the discontinuities. Theoretical modelling identified that block size is a key control affecting the deformation of rock masses. Deformation of rock masses with smaller block assemblages is greater than for rock masses composed of larger block sizes. This is due to the increased magnitude of <b>joint</b> normal <b>closure.</b> Catastrophic failure is less likely in slopes with smaller block sizes because the shear strength is greater in a closely jointed rock mass. These slopes are more likely to undergo gradual deformations. Block-size effects are also responsible for influencing the failure mechanism of rock masses. As block size decreases, the magnitude of block rotation increases and the failure mechanism changes from sliding to toppling. The effect of slope scale on the deformation properties of the rock masses has also been investigated. Two field locations, the Picos de Europa mountains, northern Spain and Wadi Rum, southern Jordan, have been chosen to provide a link between the theoretical modelling and classic rock landforms which are controlled by the discontinuity geometry. Given the sporadic and infrequent occurrence of failure events at the field sites, a computer modelling approach has been adopted to analyse slope behaviour. In the Picos de Europa, slope deformations are deep-seated, with sliding and toppling being the dominant modes of failure. Much of the slope deformation in these mountains is a result of post-glacial rock-slope deformation. The sandstone inselbergs of Jordan show a range of morphologies from rounded hills to vertical cliffs. The morphology of the inselbergs is related to the intact rock strength; stronger Red lshrin sandstone forms vertical slopes, whereas the weaker Disi sandstone forms rounded domes. Jointing in the area is sub-vertical with horizontal bedding and computer simulations have shown that toppling is the dominant mode of failure in these inselbergs. Comparison of computer model output suggests that different failure mechanisms have distinct failure signatures. Catastrophic, deep-seated failures are characterised by a long period of acceleration as the failure propagates through the rock mass and infinite velocity is reached. Non-catastrophic slope movements, such as self-stabilising topples, are characterised by short periods of acceleration followed by small creep movements at a constant velocity. Computer modelling has indicated that scale effects do exist in the modelled rock masses from the Picos de Europa and particularly Wadi Rum. In areas where jointing is constant, the relative block size of the rock mass decreases as slope scale increases. The greater numbers of blocks along with greater in situ stresses influence the failure of the slope. Cosmogenic dating was used to temporally constrain UDEC model output and provide a better understanding of rock slope failure mechanisms in the Picos de Europa and Wadi Rum. Dating indicated delayed paraglacial adjustment was the triggering mechanism for slope failure in the Picos de Europa, whereas failures in Wadi Rum appeared to be closely linked with wetter climatic conditions.

40|$|QuestionDoes {{use of a}} splint {{at night}} improve pain and {{disability}} in people with osteoarthritis {{at the base of}} the thumb (OABT) ?DesignRandomised, controlled trial with concealed allocation. SettingTwo tertiary hospitals in France. ParticipantsPatients were recruited from tertiary clinics or private practices. Inclusion criteria were pain {{at the base of the}} thumb 30 mm or greater on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm, age 45 – 75 years, radiographic evidence of OABT, and either trapeziometacarpal <b>joint</b> enlargement or <b>closure</b> of the first web. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis, inflammatory and crystal arthritis, neurological conditions, trauma, surgery and collagen diseases were exclusion criteria. Randomisation of 112 participants allotted 57 to the intervention group and 55 to a control group. InterventionsBoth groups received usual care, at the discretion of the general practitioner or rheumatologist. In addition, a rigid splint was custom made for participants in the intervention group by an occupational therapist. It covered the base of the thumb and the thenar eminence but not the wrist. These participants were advised to wear it at night for one year, and encouraged to contact the therapist if they felt the splint needed adjustment, if pain increased while wearing the splint, or if they had adverse effects, eg, skin erosion. Outcome measuresThe primary outcome was the change in pain on the VAS at one month. Secondary outcome measures were disability at one month, and pain and disability at twelve months. Disability was measured with Cochin Hand Functional Scale from 0 (low disability) to 90, and on another VAS (100 mm = high perceived disability). Participants also rated their perceived global improvement and underwent clinical and radiological measures: pinch strength, pain during pinch, thumb mobility, closure of the first web, and blinded assessment of radiological progression of osteoarthritis. Results 98 (87 %) participants completed the study. No significant between-group differences in any outcomes were observed at one month. At 12 months, however, the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in pain (by 14 mm, 95 % CI 5 to 23), in Cochin scores (by 6 points, 95 % CI 2 to 11), and in perceived disability (by 13 mm, 95 % CI 4 to 22). The groups did not significantly differ on the remaining secondary outcomes. ConclusionFor patients with OABT, night splinting had no effect on pain and disability at 1 month but both improved at 12 months...|$|R
