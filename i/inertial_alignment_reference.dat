Since the horizontal alignment {{is easy to}} complete, and a characteristic of gravity is that its component in the horizontal plane is zero, we use a clever method to improve the conventional <b>inertial</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm. Firstly, a large misalignment angle model and a dimensionality reduction Gauss-Hermite filter are employed to establish the fine horizontal reference frame. Based on this, the projection of the gravity in the body inertial coordinate frame can be calculated easily. Then, the initial alignment algorithm is accomplished through an <b>inertial</b> frame <b>alignment</b> algorithm. The simulation and experiment {{results show that the}} improved initial alignment algorithm performs better than the conventional <b>inertial</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm, and meets the accuracy requirements of a medium-accuracy marine SINS...|$|R

40|$|The {{uses of the}} Genome Reference Consortium’s human {{reference}} sequence can {{be roughly}} categorized into three related but distinct categories: as a representative species genome, as a coordinate system for identifying variants, and as an <b>alignment</b> <b>reference</b> for variation detection algorithms.

The ISIM element primarily {{consists of a}} mechanical metering structure, three science instruments, and a fine guidance sensor. One of the critical optomechanical alignments is the co-registration of the optical telescope element (OTE) exit pupil with the entrance pupils of the ISIM instruments. The test architecture has been developed to verify that the ISIM element will be properly aligned with the nominal OTE exit pupil when the two elements come together. The architecture measures {{three of the most}} critical pupil degrees-of-freedom during optical testing of the ISIM element. The pupil measurement scheme makes use of specularly reflective pupil <b>alignment</b> <b>references</b> located inside the JWST instruments, ground support equipment that contains a pupil imaging module, an OTE simulator, and pupil viewing channels in two of the JWST flight instruments. Pupil <b>alignment</b> <b>references</b> (PARs) are introduced into the instrument, and their reflections are checked using the instrument's mirrors. After the pupil imaging module (PIM) captures a reflected PAR image, the image will be analyzed to determine the relative alignment offset.

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{reference}} posture is important when investigating rearfoot motion in clinical populations. The reference posture used may affect {{the magnitude of the}} peak angles and therefore may not enable comparison of the rearfoot kinematics across different populations. This study examined the relationship between the rearfoot frontal plane pattern of motion and three reference postures during the stance phase of walking in healthy and patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) subjects. The three reference postures investigated were: Relaxed Standing posture, subtalar joint neutral position (STJN) and when the calcaneus and the lower leg were vertically aligned (Vertical Alignment). The rearfoot inversion/eversion during the stance phase was measured in 14 healthy subjects and 13 subjects with diagnosed PFPS using three dimensional motion analysis with the three different reference postures. The graphs of rearfoot inversion/eversion motion were overlaid with the angle at the rearfoot in the static posture and any intersection between the static angle and rearfoot motion was noted. An ANOVA showed significant differences in static posture between the groups for Relaxed Standing (p = 0. 01), and STJN (p = 0. 02). For both groups, with Relaxed Standing as a reference posture, the mean rearfoot pattern of motion did not intersect the Relaxed Standing static angle during the stance phase. The use of Vertical <b>Alignment</b> <b>reference</b> posture, however, showed an intersection of this reference posture through the rearfoot pattern of motion. The use of the Vertical <b>Alignment</b> <b>reference</b> posture also generated a typical rearfoot motion pattern for both groups and therefore it may be an appropriate reference posture for both healthy and PFPS individual...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—When {{aligning}} biological sequences, {{the choice}} of scoring scheme is critical. Even small changes in gap penalties, for example, can yield radically different alignments. A rigorous way to learn parameter values that are appropriate for biological sequences is through inverse parametric sequence alignment. Given a collection of examples of biologically correct <b>reference</b> <b>alignments,</b> {{this is the problem}} of finding parameter values that make the scores of the <b>reference</b> <b>alignments</b> be {{as close as possible to}} those of optimal alignments of their sequences. We extend prior work on inverse parametric alignment to partial examples, which contain regions where the <b>reference</b> <b>alignment</b> is not specified, and to an improved formulation based on minimizing the average error between the scores of the <b>reference</b> <b>alignments</b> and the scores of optimal alignments. Experiments on benchmark biological alignments show we can learn scoring schemes that generalize across protein families, and that boost the accuracy of multiple sequence alignment by as much as 25 percent.

Experiments are carried out in a Spanish–English European Parliament Proceedings parallel corpus, both in a large and a small data track. As expected, improvements due to introducing morphosyntactic information are bigger in case of data scarcity, but significant improvement is also achieved in a large data task, meaning that certain linguistic knowledge is relevant even in situations of large data availability. ...|$|R

40|$|The most {{prominent}} way {{to assess the}} quality of an ontology alignment is to compute its precision and recall with respect to another <b>alignment</b> taken as <b>reference.</b> These measures determine, respectively, the proportion of found mappings that belong to the <b>reference</b> <b>alignment</b> {{and the proportion of}} the <b>reference</b> <b>alignment</b> that was found.

40|$|Background: In a {{computed}} protein multiple sequence alignment, the coreness of {{a column}} is {{the fraction of}} its substitutions that are in so-called core columns of the gold-standard <b>reference</b> <b>alignment</b> of its proteins. In benchmark suites of protein <b>reference</b> <b>alignments,</b> the core columns of the <b>reference</b> <b>alignment</b> are those that can be confidently labeled as correct, usually due to all residues in the column being sufficiently close in the spatial superposition of the known three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Typically the accuracy of a protein multiple sequence alignment that has been computed for a benchmark is only measured {{with respect to the}} core columns of the <b>reference</b> <b>alignment.</b> When computing an alignment in practice, however, a <b>reference</b> <b>alignment</b> is not known, so the coreness of its columns can only be predicted. Results: We develop {{for the first time a}} predictor of column coreness for protein multiple sequence alignments. This allows us to predict which columns of a computed alignment are core, and hence better estimate the alignment's accuracy. Our approach to predicting coreness is similar to nearest-neighbor classification from machine learning, except we transform nearest-neighbor distances into a coreness prediction via a regression function, and we learn an appropriate distance function through a new optimization formulation that solves a large-scale linear programming problem. We apply our coreness predictor to parameter advising, the task of choosing parameter values for an aligner's scoring function to obtain a more accurate alignment of a specific set of sequences. We show that for this task, our predictor strongly outperforms other column-confidence estimators from the literature, and affords a substantial boost in alignment accuracy...|$|R

This must be accomplished for all beamlines in a time consistent with planned shot rates and yet, in the front end and main laser, beam control functions cannot be initiated until the amplifiers have sufficiently cooled so as to minimize dynamic thermal distortions during and after alignment and wavefront optimization.
