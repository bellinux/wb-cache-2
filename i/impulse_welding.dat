40|$|Work {{has begun}} under three major tasks of this project. With respect to {{increasing}} the circumferential {{strength of a}} MA 956 tube, approximately 60 MA 956 rods have been extruded using a 20 : 1 extrusion ratio and extrusion temperatures of 1000, 1075, 1150, and 1200 C. Also, creep testing is underway {{for the purpose of}} determining the ''stress threshold'' curves for this alloy. Regarding joining of the alloy MA 956, work has begun on the friction welding, magnetic <b>impulse</b> <b>welding,</b> explosive welding, and transient liquid phase bonding aspects of this project. And finally, material is being prepared for the laboratory fire-side high temperature corrosion tests, with potential gas and deposits for a typical Vision 21 plant being reviewed for final determination of these variables in the test program...|$|E
40|$|Work {{continued}} on three major tasks {{of this project}} [...] increasing the circumferential strength of the MA 956 tube, joining of the MA 956 alloy, and determination of the high temperature corrosion limits of the MA 956 alloy. With respect to increasing the circumferential strength of a MA 956 tube, an additional 120 MA 956 rods have been extruded (total of 180 rods) using 16 : 1 and 10 : 1 extrusion ratios and extrusion temperatures of 1000, 1075, 1150, and 1200 C. Also, approximately 40 cold work (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 %) plus annealing treatments (1000, 1150, 1300 C) have been completed with sample microstructure presently being analyzed. Also, creep testing to determine the ''stress threshold'' curves for this alloy continues. Regarding joining of the alloy MA 956, work {{continued on}} the friction welding, magnetic <b>impulse</b> <b>welding,</b> explosive welding, and transient liquid phase bonding, with joints produced using the friction, magnetic impulse and explosive welding techniques. And finally, fluid-side high temperature corrosion tests of the material have been initiated...|$|E
40|$|Work {{continued}} on four major tasks {{of this project}} [...] increasing the circumferential strength of MA 956 tubing, joining of the MA 956 alloy, determining the bending limits of MA 956 tubing, and determination of the high temperature corrosion limits of the MA 956 alloy. With respect to increasing the circumferential strength of a MA 956 tube, an additional 120 MA 956 rods have been extruded (total of 180 rods) using 16 : 1 and 10 : 1 extrusion ratios and extrusion temperatures of 1000, 1075, 1150, and 1200 C. Also, approximately 40 cold work (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 %) plus annealing treatments (1000, 1150, 1300 C) have been completed with the resulting sample microstructures presently being analyzed. Creep testing to determine the ''stress threshold'' curves for this alloy continues. Regarding joining of the MA 956 alloy, work continued using friction welding, magnetic <b>impulse</b> <b>welding,</b> explosive welding, and transient liquid phase bonding, with encouraging results obtained from the friction, explosive, and transient liquid phase joining methods. Initial work on determining the bending limits of the MA 956 tubing {{has shown that the}} recrystallized material shows good ductility but the unrecrystallized material does not. And finally, fluid-side high temperature corrosion testing of the material continues and the environment for the laboratory fireside corrosion testing has been established and testing initiated...|$|E
