25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes.

In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E

25|$|The entire genomes of the centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana (32.4 Mb), and the pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (27.4 Mb), {{have been}} sequenced. Comparisons {{of the two}} fully sequenced diatom genomes finds that the P. tricornutum genome {{includes}} fewer genes (10,402 opposed to 11,776) than T. pseudonana and no major synteny (gene order) could be detected between the two genomes. T. pseudonana genes show an average of ~1.52 introns per gene as opposed to 0.79 in P. tricornutum, suggesting recent widespread intron <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centric diatom. Despite relatively recent evolutionary divergence (90 million years), the extent of molecular divergence between centrics and pennates indicates rapid evolutionary rates within the Bacillariophyceae compared to other eukaryotic groups. Comparative genomics also established that a specific class of transposable elements, the Diatom Copia-like retrotransposons (or CoDis), has been significantly amplified in the P. tricornutum genome with respect to T. pseudonana, constituting 5.8 and 1% of the respective genomes.|$|E
25|$|At current state, the Internet {{provides}} {{a form of}} education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs, minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways. For example, users attempting to learn the minority language may opt to read and understand {{about it in a}} majority language and stop there, resulting in a loss instead of <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> potential speakers of the minority language. Also, speakers of minority languages may be encouraged to learn the more common languages that are being used on the Web in order to gain access to more resources, and in turn leading to a decline in their usage of their own language. The future of endangered minority languages in view of the spread of Internet remains to be observed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Palsy of a nerve {{might be}} {{expected}} to lower vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responses in its fields of motion, but effects of peripheral neuromuscu-lar disease were unknown. We recorded the VOR during sinusoidal head rota-tions in yaw, pitch, and roll at 0. 5 – 2 Hz and static torsional <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> 43 patients with unilateral nerve palsies. Sixth nerve palsy (n = 21) reduced both abduction and adduction VOR <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> darkness. In light, horizontal visually enhanced VOR (VVOR) <b>gains</b> were normal <b>in</b> moderate and mild palsy. In severe palsy, horizontal VVOR <b>gains</b> remained low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paretic eye when it was fixating, whereas <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonparetic eye became higher than normal. Third nerve palsy (n = 10) decreased VOR and VVOR gains during abduction, adduction, elevation, depression, extorsion, and intorsion. Fourth nerve palsy (n = 13) re-duced VOR gains of the paretic eye during intorsion, extorsion, elevation, de-pression, abduction, and adduction, but in light vertical and horizontal VVOR <b>gains</b> were normal. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> nonparetic eye, all gains were normal. Reduced VOR <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of paretic muscles and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of their antag-onists, together with normal <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonparetic eye, indicate a selective ad-justment to the antagonists of paretic muscles. Increase of VVOR <b>gains</b> to normal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paretic eye, when used for fixation, without conjugate increase <b>in</b> <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> occluded nonparetic eye, provides further evidence of selective ad-aptation for the paretic eye. Motions of the eyes after nerve palsies indicate mo-nocular VOR adaptation in three dimensions...|$|R
