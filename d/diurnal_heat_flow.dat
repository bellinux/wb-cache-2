40|$|Buried heat sources can be {{investigated}} by examining thermal infrared images and comparing these {{with the results}} of theoretical models which predict the thermal anomaly a given heat source may generate. Key factors influencing surface temperature include the geometry and temperature of the heat source, the surface meteorological environment, and the thermal conductivity and anisotropy of the rock. In general, a geothermal heat flux of greater than 2 % of solar insolation is required to produce a detectable thermal anomaly in a thermal infrared image. A heat source of, for example, 2 - 300 K greater than the average surface temperature must be a t depth shallower than 50 m for the detection of the anomaly in a thermal infrared image, for typical terrestrial conditions. Atmospheric factors are of critical importance. While the mean atmospheric temperature has little significance, the convection is a dominant factor, and can act to swamp the thermal signature entirely. Given a steady state heat source that produces a detectable thermal anomaly, it is possible to loosely constrain the physical properties of the heat source and surrounding rock, using the surface thermal anomaly as a basis. The success of this technique is highly dependent on {{the degree to which the}} physical properties of the host rock are known. Important parameters include the surface thermal properties and thermal conductivity of the rock. Modelling of transient thermal situations was carried out, to assess the effect of time dependant thermal fluxes. One-dimensional finite element models can be readily and accurately applied to the investigation of <b>diurnal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flow,</b> as with thermal inertia models. Diurnal thermal models of environments on Earth, the Moon and Mars were carried out using finite elements and found to be consistent with published measurements. The heat flow from an injection of hot lava into a near surface lava tube was considered. While this approach was useful for study, and long term monitoring in inhospitable areas, it was found to have little hazard warning utility, as the time taken for the thermal energy to propagate to the surface in dry rock (several months) in very long. The resolution of the thermal infrared imaging system is an important factor. Presently available satellite based systems such as Landsat (resolution of 120 m) are inadequate for detailed study of geothermal anomalies. Airborne systems, such as TIMS (variable resolution of 3 - 6 m) are much more useful for discriminating small buried heat sources. Planned improvements in the resolution of satellite based systems will broaden the potential for application of the techniques developed in this thesis. It is important to note, however, that adequate spatial resolution is a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful application of these techniques...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} extent to which {{regional}} variations in continental <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> can be interpreted, making use of a <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data set from east and southern Africa. The first-order observation deriving from these <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> measurements is a common pattern characterized in both regions by low <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in Archean cratons and higher <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in younger mobile belts. Two regional differences between east and southern Africa are superimposed on this common <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> pattern: (1) <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in the Tanzania Craton is about 13 mW m- 2 lower than in the Kalahari Craton, and (2) <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in the Mozambique Belt in east Africa is about 9 mW m- 2 lower than in the southern African mobile belts, within about 250 km of the respective Archean cratons. The differences in <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> between east and southern Africa suggest that the thermal structure of the lithosphere beneath these regions differs somewhat, and we attempt to resolve these differences in lithospheric thermal structure by examining four explanations that could account for the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> observations: (1) diminished <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in shallow boreholes in east Africa; (2) less crustal heat production in the regions of lower heat flow; (3) thicker lithosphere beneath the regions of lower heat flow; (4) cooler mantle beneath the areas of lower <b>heat</b> <b>flow.</b> We find it difficult to interpret uniquely the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> differences between east and southern Africa because available constraints on crustal heat production, crustal structure, lithospheric thickness and mantle temperatures are insufficient to discriminate among the possible explanations.

40|$|Abstract. In the United States, {{the surface}} <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> can be {{separated}} into two main components. The first component {{is due to}} radioactive heat sources in the upper crust, and the second component is due to sources in the lower crust and upper mantle. The <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> from the lower crust and upper mantle is constant over large regions, called <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> provinces, and the transitions between provinces are very narrow (less than 100 km). High values of mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (> 1. 4 ìcal/cm 2 sec) occur in the Basin and Range, Columbia Plateaus, Northern Rocky Mountains, Southern Rocky Mountains physiographic provinces, and in the Franciscan rocks east of the San Andreas fault zone. Normal or near-normal mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (0. 8) {{is found in the}} United States east of the Rocky Mountains, in the Colorado Plateaus, the Southern California batholith, and in the Puget Sound Region. Subnormal mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (0. 4, the lowest known anywhere) occurs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The variations in mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> are attributed to the thermal effects of sea-floor spreading during the Cenozoic.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>flow</b> {{in active}} tectonic zones as the Baikal rift {{is a crucial}} {{parameter}} for evaluating deep anomalous structures and lithosphere evolution. Based on {{the interpretation of the}} existing datasets, the Baikal rift has been characterized in the past by either high <b>heat</b> <b>flow,</b> or moderately elevated <b>heat</b> <b>flow,</b> or even lacking a surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> anomaly. We made an attempt to better constrain the geothermal picture by a detailed offshore contouring survey of known anomalies, and to estimate the importance of observed <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> anomalies within the regional surface heat output. A total of about 200 new and close-spaced <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> measurements were obtained in several selected study areas in the North Baikal Basin. With an outrigged and a violinbow designed thermoprobe of 2 – 3 -m length, both the sediment temperature and thermal conductivity were measured. The new data show at all investigated sites that the large <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> highs are limited to local <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> anomalies. The maximum measured <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> reaches values of 300 – 35000 mW/m 2, but the extent of the anomalies is not larger than 2 to 4 km in diameter. Aside of these local anomalies, <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> variations are restricted to near background values of 50 – 70 mW/m 2, except in the uplifted Academician zone. The extent of the local anomalies excludes a conductive source, and therefore heat transport by fluids must be considered. In a conceptual model where all bottom floor <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> anomalies are the result of upflowing fluids along a conduit, an extra heat output of 20 MW (including advection) is estimated for all known anomalies in the North Baikal Basin. Relative to a basal <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> of 55 – 65 mW/m 2, these estimations suggest an extra heat output in the northern Lake Baikal of only 5 %, corresponding to a regional <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> increase of 3 mW/m 2. The source of this heat can be fully attributed to a regional heat redistribution by topographically driven ground water flow. Thus, the surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> is not expected to bear a signal of deeper lithospheric thermal anomalies that can be separated from <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> typical for orogenically altered crust (40 – 70 mW/m 2).

While data coverage remains poor, a previous attempt to characterise the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> field of South Australia (Neumann et al. 2000) described an “anomalous <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> zone” in central South Australia. This region was not previously delineated by high spatial resolution <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data, but the work published here demonstrates that the “zone” described as the South Australian <b>Heat</b> <b>Flow</b> Anomaly (SAHFA; Neumann et al., 2000), is a region where anomalously high <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> values are interspersed with low values, and there is significant lateral variation in surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> over scales of tens of kilometres. This thesis addresses the following questions: • Is the SAHFA, as shown in Cull (1982) and defined by Neumann et al.

The <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> field is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the tectonic setting of a geological terrane because the magnitude of surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow,</b> Qs, can have a strong influence on the mechanical or rheological behaviour of crustal rocks. The distribution of Qs is also directly relevant to resource exploration, in that it is related directly to the distribution of heat producing elements (HPEs). These control the prospectivity for high geothermal gradients and geothermal energy, as well as potentially the locations of elevated concentrations of uranium. Closely spaced surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data clearly highlights the location of the Olympic Dam ore body, and would probably have aided previous explorers in the discovery of Prominent Hill.

These are thought to be mainly due to advective fluid flows (e.g., Wang et al. 1993, 1995), rapid sedimentation or erosion (Hutchison 1985; Wang et al. 1993), or fault activity (e.g., Kinoshita et al. 2011). In addition, topographic effects that arise in convex-upward and convex-downward topographies also cause locally high or low <b>heat</b> <b>flows</b> (Ganguly et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014). Identifying the phenomena that cause local high or low <b>heat</b> <b>flows</b> is important because surface measurements of <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> are utilized to estimate thermal properties in plate subduction zones, including frictional strength along plate boundaries and radioactive heat production.|$|R
40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> meter {{method of}} {{measurement}} of soil <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> is shown {{to be the most}} suitable of available techniques for the investigation of the spatial variation of soil <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> within the Chilton Valley. A procedure for the calibration of <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> meters is developed that permits the minimization of meter measurement errors due to the distortion of the natural soil <b>heat</b> <b>flow.</b> The most significant measurement errors are shown to be those resulting from inaccurate installation of the meters. It is shown that a major factor in determining the spatial variability of soil <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> within a defined area in the Chilton Valley is the differential shading of the surface by the taller vegetation, and that the spatial sampling density required for the evaluation of the soil <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> paramenter is detailed micrometeorological studies is considerably greater than that required for the evaluation of this parameter in general studies dealing with longer-term climatological averages...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the influence of temperature along the very young ( 9) subduction zone thrust earthquakes. Thermal cross-sections based on measured <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> and {{the properties of the}} overlying accretionary complex and adjacent backstop are used to characterize the temperature of the shallow décollement (≤ 30 km) within these segments of the subduction zone. Eight new <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> determinations (offshore) are used, in conjunction with existing <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data and a theoretical surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> value at the deformation front, to establish a complete surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> profile across the CSZ in northern Oregon (45 °N). A <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> profile north of the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ) in northern California (40 °N), utilizing existing <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data and a theoretical deformation front <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> value, was also constructed to investigate the thermal effects of subduction of the even younger Gorda plate and to compare the seismicity in the MTJ area with our thermal model for the CSZ. Thermal cross-sections were constructed using the following methodology. Heat generation was removed from a “low ” and “high ” surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> profile to obtain a basal (i. e., along the décollement) <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> boundary condition. Two-dimensional, finite difference calculations utilizing this boundary condition were used to model the CSZ forearc thermal regime. Strength envelopes and steady-state pressure-temperature paths calculated from temperature-depth data sampled along the subducting plate-top illustrate the low strength along the slab-face. ...|$|R
