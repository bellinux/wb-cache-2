5|$|Graham's {{replacement}} was Glaswegian John Docherty. In {{his second}} season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football {{for the first time}} in the club's history. Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely slipped out of the top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons playing together. Millwall's first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club all season. The following season, they briefly led the league <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>night</b> in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games all season and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.|$|E

5|$|The {{build-up}} <b>for</b> <b>One</b> <b>Night</b> Stand {{occurred on}} both Raw and SmackDown {{heading into the}} pay-per-view, but build-up behind the scenes began several months earlier, as WWE was bringing back ECW full-time.
