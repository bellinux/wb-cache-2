5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E
5|$|The regiment's two {{composite}} companies {{served with}} the Main Army during its retreat across New Jersey in late 1776, in the ensuing Battles of Trenton and Princeton in Brig. Gen. Hugh Mercer's Brigade, {{and in the early}} 1777 skirmishing in northern New Jersey, a period termed the Forage War. While in winter quarters at Morristown during the winter and spring of 1777, the two-company force and other riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia Line regiments supported detached elements of line infantry units in front-line positions and conducted patrols in northern New Jersey, primarily to keep the enemy's aggressive foraging activities in check. Because the two units under Captains Smith and Long provided an experienced, if small, force, Washington also used them to bolster the new 11th Virginia Regiment commanded by Col. Daniel Morgan after its arrival at Morristown in early April by formally attaching them to this Virginia regiment. Washington's decision to join the two composite companies with the 11th Virginia Regiment was based on Morgan's earlier direct association with the original three independent Continental rifle companies of 1775 that formed the core element of Rawlings' regiment. <b>Inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the attachment of one military unit to another was technically a temporary arrangement, however, the permanent unit of Smith's and Long's composite companies remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. The first muster rolls of the two companies taken after the Battle of Fort Washington, both dated May 16, 1777, were compiled by the army staff {{as a result of the}} attachment process and show that the units comprised about 110 officers and enlisted men on active duty in the spring of 1777. The rolls also document that the units had lost a number of men over the winter months following the battle, primarily through desertion and a few deaths due to illness or wounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{first chapter}} is {{preceded by a}} haggadic introduction, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it is {{considered}} desirable to begin so mournful a treatise with a sentence of a lighter character (comp. Brüll, l. c. p.27, note 41).|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} Sinai Peninsula contains archaeological discoveries but {{to place}} them with the exodus from Egypt is a daunting task <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the proposed dates of the Exodus vary so widely. The Exodus has been dated from the Early Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age II.|$|E
25|$|The whole {{population}} of the Dutch Republic {{did not have the}} choice of voting for the representative of the Country <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> there was not a choice between a democracy and an aristocracy but rather between an aristocracy and a monarchy.

25|$|In the 18th century, {{military}} service {{was considered a}} privilege of only the burghers. However, as the century {{came to a close}} the essence of {{military service}} changed <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> city authorities imposed the service on all townspeople regardless of whether they were burghers or not. This is similar to changes {{that took place in the}} sphere of citizenship rights.|$|E

25|$|While both Strashelye and Lubavitch {{consider}} Rabbi Shneur Zalman to {{have been}} the first rebbe of their respective schools, the former considered Rabbi Aharon HaLevi Horowitz to be his successor. The latter consider Rabbi Dovber Schneuri (the son of Rabbi Schneur Zalman) the second rebbe. <b>Inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> that is the case, the Strashelye branch of Chabad Chassidus began in 1812, when Rabbi Shneur Zalman died.|$|E
25|$|Sociologist David Gibson has {{explored}} the ExComm's deliberations from a discourse-analytic, or conversation-analytic, perspective.

25|$|The little theatre {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of interest among local playwrights <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> Glaum had received some 15 plays by January 27. One of the most intriguing was Eulalia Andreas's A Friendly Divorce, which went into rehearsal with Johnstone White directing. Noted stars were lured to perform. In March 1935, Glaum and Betty Blythe, another star of the silent screen, starred in Angel Cake, which was written by Ansella Hunter, who had three plays staged by the Shuberts.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, the Anglican Church of Nigeria {{declared}} {{itself to}} be in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, followed by the House of Bishops of the Anglican Church of Uganda in June 2009 and the Episcopal Church of Sudan in December 2011. <b>Inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> these churches report approximately 30,500,000 members, and the Anglican Communion reports over 80,000,000 members, the ACNA is in communion with churches comprising somewhat over one-third of {{the membership of the}} Anglican Communion.|$|E
25|$|Supporters included, {{but were}} not limited to, media {{companies}} and industry associations such as the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the Entertainment Software Association. Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, athletic shoes, and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> they originated outside the United States.|$|E
25|$|Meston {{relished the}} upending of {{cherished}} Western fiction clichés {{and felt that}} few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as chattels were touched on well ahead {{of their time in}} most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up Hopalong Cassidy.|$|E
25|$|The temple can be {{seen from}} afar, but passers-by can only see the cella, the {{foundations}} of which are decoratively rusticated. Seven columns are spaced along the cella, linking to the lateral door, which opens onto the staircase. The tetrastyle temple is built in Tuscan order in antis. The temple's design is unusual <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> temples of the imperial cult are generally Corinthian and located {{in the middle of a}} vast courtyard with a portico; the Tuscan order was thus quite rare in the provinces.|$|E
25|$|From {{these results}} {{we see that}} Shaftesbury, opposed to Hobbes and Locke, is in close {{agreement}} with Hutcheson, and that he is ultimately a deeply religious thinker, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> he discards the moral sanction of public opinion, the terrors of future punishment, and the authority of the civil authority as the main incentives to goodness, and substitutes the voice of conscience and the love of God. These two alone move men to aim at perfect harmony for its own sake in the man and in the universe.|$|E
25|$|The city of Zimnicea was {{reported}} in ruins: 175 houses collapsed, while 523 sustained serious damage, 4,000 people were displaced, and {{there were hundreds of}} victims. <b>Inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> 80% of the city was destroyed, Zimnicea was rebuilt from the ground. In Craiova, more than 550 buildings were severely damaged, among them the Museum of Art, the Oltenia Museum, the University and the County Library. Initial estimates indicate a total of 30 dead and 300 wounded. Vaslui also suffered heavy losses, both human – 7 people dead, and material.|$|E
25|$|The theatre, {{which was}} built in 168 or 169 CE, {{is one of the}} best {{preserved}} examples in Roman Africa. It could seat 3500 spectators, even though Dougga only had 5000 inhabitants. It was one of a series of imperial buildings constructed over the course of two centuries at Dougga which deviate from the classic “blueprints” only <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> they have been adapted to take account of the local terrain. Some minor adjustments have been made and the local architects had a certain freedom with regard to the ornamentation of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|In 1579, the Treaty of Utrecht {{was signed}} unifying the {{northern}} provinces of the Netherlands. An {{outcome of the}} Dutch Revolt, the republic was not yet internationally recognized, but soon gained that status with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The idea of patriotism was widespread but was not a strong force. Similarly, {{the concept of the}} ‘fatherland’ was also general but created both unity and disunity within the population <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it was a debated concept. In the 1780s the national consciousness present for centuries was converted to modern nationalism.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} protests {{in support of}} the mining project. Organized only in the {{exploitation}} area, the largest protest attracted up to 5,000 locals and 33 miners blocked underground, who were fighting for the jobs promised by Roșia Montană Gold Corporation, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the unemployment rate in the area is very high. In an attempt to defuse the tense situation of Roșia Montană, Prime Minister Victor Ponta descended into the underground to discuss with miners. However, during massive protests against Roșia Montană Project, Ponta – main target of protests – didn't conduct any conversation with the representatives of the protesters.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the next}} {{parliamentary}} sitting after this incident occurred, Rhodes tabled a bill that he had drafted that was the shortest {{in the history of the}} House. It stated that all civil cases were to be tried by magistrates and that appeals could be launched to the chief magistrate of the territory with an assessor. Criminal cases were to be tried before supreme court judges on circuit. The bill passed with the effect that, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the magistrates practised according to native law, that native marriage customs and laws, including polygamy, were legalised in the colony.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{essential}} aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The {{observation of the}} patient's behavior is {{an important aspect of}} emergency psychiatry <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation {{for a period of time}} may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for trial, {{the court}} {{threw out the}} plaintiff's real estate expert and {{approved}} the government's real estate expert, applying the Daubert standard. He also clarified his prior ruling, to note that testimony on laches would be permitted <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it related to pre-judgement interest. In 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the Cayuga, calculating damages the current fair {{market value of the}} land and the fair rental value of the land over 204 years in excess of $36 million; with the addition of pre-judgement interest, the damages reached $247,911,999.42. The court also denied the defendant's post-trial motions, but stayed the collection of the judgement pending appeal.|$|E
25|$|Presumptions whereupon persons may be committed, and, much more, {{convictions}} whereupon persons may {{be condemned}} as guilty of witchcrafts, ought certainly {{to be more}} considerable than barely the accused person's being represented by a specter unto the afflicted; <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> it is an undoubted and notorious thing, that a demon may, by God's permission, appear, even to ill purposes, {{in the shape of}} an innocent, yea, and a virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made in the sufferers, by a look or touch of the accused, to be an infallible evidence of guilt, but frequently liable to be abused by the Devil's legerdemains.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of {{close ties to}} France since independence in 1960, diversification of agriculture for export, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in the economic growth of Ivory Coast. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices {{in the global marketplace}} for its primary agricultural crops: coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labor force, <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> instances of indentured labor {{have been reported in the}} cocoa and coffee production in every edition of the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor since 2009.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza's {{philosophy}} has {{much in common}} with Stoicism <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that reason could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{were the}} first European {{settlers}} {{to the area of}} Daphne arriving in 1557. Spanish control in the area was weak and in 1710 French explorers claimed Mobile Bay, the Eastern Shore of the Bay including Daphne, and land east to Perdido Bay. The French claim was largely uncontested by the Spanish. In 1763, the British were ceded land, including the future Daphne, from the French in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The community of Daphne was established the same year and was known simply as the Village. <b>Inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> the British occupied nearby Mobile {{at the end of the}} Seven Years' War, Daphne passed into British hands, and served as the eastern terminal of a ferry across Mobile Bay.|$|E
25|$|The decrees of {{the council}} were {{acknowledged}} in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the Diet of Augsburg in 1566. Philip II of Spain accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily <b>inasmuch</b> <b>as</b> they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognised by the king only in their doctrinal parts. The disciplinary sections received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. No {{attempt was made to}} introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to Mary, Queen of Scots, with a letter dated 13 June 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she dared not do it in the face of John Knox and the Reformation.|$|E
