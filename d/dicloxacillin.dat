5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or <b>dicloxacillin</b> if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin {{has similar}} pharmacokinetics, {{antibacterial}} activity, and indications to <b>dicloxacillin,</b> {{and the two}} agents are considered interchangeable. It {{is reported to have}} higher, though rare, incidence of severe hepatic adverse effects than <b>dicloxacillin,</b> but a lower incidence of renal adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems. It should also {{not be used in}} the eye, or administered to those with a history of cholestatic hepatitis {{associated with the use of}} <b>dicloxacillin</b> or flucloxacillin.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcal {{resistance}} to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of β-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam {{ring of the}} penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, <b>dicloxacillin,</b> and flucloxacillin, are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.|$|E
25|$|More {{severe cases}} require oral antibiotics, such as <b>dicloxacillin,</b> flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, {{amoxicillin}} combined with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) {{and many others}} may {{also be used as}} an antibiotic treatment. Alternatives for people who are seriously allergic to penicillin or infections with MRSA include doxycycline, clindamycin, and SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice.|$|E
25|$|In {{those cases}} of abscess which do require {{antibiotic}} treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria {{is a common}} cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as flucloxacillin or <b>dicloxacillin</b> is used. The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess {{is not enough to}} address community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as <b>dicloxacillin</b> or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> is commercially {{available}} as the sodium salt, <b>dicloxacillin</b> sodium, in capsules {{and as a}} powder for reconstitution.|$|E
50|$|Subinhibitory {{concentrations}} (subminimum inhibitory concentrations) of {{the antibiotic}} <b>dicloxacillin</b> also affect {{the growth of}} S. haemolyticus biofilms. Biofilms formed {{in the presence of}} subinhibitory concentrations of <b>dicloxacillin</b> contain less biomass and have an altered composition. They are thinner, cover less surface area, and are less hydrophobic, but they also have an increased level of resistance to <b>dicloxacillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> is used {{to treat}} mild-to-moderate staphylococcal infections. To {{decrease}} the development of resistance, <b>dicloxacillin</b> is recommended to treat infections that are suspected or proven {{to be caused by}} beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> is a narrow-spectrum β-lactam {{antibiotic}} of the penicillin class. It is used {{to treat}} infections caused by susceptible (non-resistant) Gram-positive bacteria. It is active against beta-lactamase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, which would otherwise be resistant to most penicillins. <b>Dicloxacillin</b> is available {{under a variety of}} trade names including Diclocil (BMS).|$|E
50|$|An isoxazolyl {{group is}} found in many beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics, such as cloxacillin, <b>dicloxacillin</b> and flucloxacillin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy (hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction) to any penicillins.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Specific approved indications include: ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{patients}} {{may benefit from}} systemic narrow-spectrum penicillinase-resistant penicillins (such as <b>dicloxacillin</b> in US, or flucloxacillin in UK) ...|$|E
50|$|Meticillin is {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} because the more stable and similar penicillins such as oxacillin (used for clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing), flucloxacillin, and <b>dicloxacillin</b> are used medically.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>dicloxacillin</b> being {{insensitive}} to beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance {{to it and}} other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin. Such organisms include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).|$|E
5000|$|... {{penicillin}} antibiotics such as amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin), ampicillin (Omnipen, Principen), <b>dicloxacillin</b> (Dycill, Dynapen), oxacillin (Bactocill), or penicillin (Beepen-VK, Ledercillin VK, Pen-V, Pen-Vee K, Pfizerpen, V-Cillin K, Veetids, and others); or ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{the correct}} term is [...] "OXACILLINASE". These enzymes {{are able to}} {{inactivate}} the oxazolylpenicillins like oxacillin, cloxacillin, <b>dicloxacillin.</b> The enzymes belong to the molecular class D not molecular class A.|$|E
50|$|Its role {{in therapy}} {{has been largely}} {{replaced}} by flucloxacillin and <b>dicloxacillin,</b> but the term methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues {{to be used to}} describe S. aureus strains resistant to all penicillins.|$|E
50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} the use of <b>dicloxacillin</b> include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin.|$|E
50|$|In {{lactation}} mastitis, antibiotics are {{not needed}} in {{the overwhelming majority of}} cases and should be used only for bacterial infections. <b>Dicloxacillin</b> or cephalexin are sometimes recommended, because of the high rates of penicillin resistant staphylococci.|$|E
50|$|Like other β-lactam antibiotics, <b>dicloxacillin</b> acts by {{inhibiting}} {{the synthesis}} of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains {{that make up a}} major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> {{is similar}} in pharmacokinetics, {{antibacterial}} activity, and indications to flucloxacillin, and the two agents are considered interchangeable.

50|$|The {{first major}} {{development}} was ampicillin in 1961. It offered a broader {{spectrum of activity}} than either of the original penicillins. Further development yielded β-lactamase-resistant penicillins, including flucloxacillin, <b>dicloxacillin,</b> and methicillin. These were significant for their activity against β-lactamase-producing bacterial species, but were ineffective against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains that subsequently emerged.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotic {{spectrum}} of activity is a component of antibiotic classification. A broad-spectrum antibiotic is active against {{a wide range of}} bacteria, whereas a narrow-spectrum antibiotic is effective against specific families of bacteria. An example of a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic is ampicillin. An example of a narrow spectrum antibiotic is <b>Dicloxacillin,</b> which acts on beta-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.|$|E
50|$|More {{severe cases}} require oral antibiotics, such as <b>dicloxacillin,</b> flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. Alternatively, {{amoxicillin}} combined with clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins (first-generation) {{and many others}} may {{also be used as}} an antibiotic treatment.

When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice.|$|E
50|$|On rare occasions, cholestatic {{jaundice}} (also {{referred to}} as cholestatic hepatitis) {{has been associated with}} <b>dicloxacillin</b> therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is 1 in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people over 55 years old, females, and those with treatment longer than 2 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicloxacillin</b> is {{insensitive}} to beta-lactamase (also known as penicillinase) enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The {{presence of the}} isoxazolyl group on the side chain of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase resistance, since they are relatively intolerant of side-chain steric hindrance. Thus, {{it is able to}} bind to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamase ...|$|E
5000|$|Multiple-week {{antibiotic}} therapies have cured actinomycotic infections {{caused by}} A. viscosus in every recorded case. Therapies include treatment with penicillin, sulfadimethoxine, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and ticarcillin. A. viscosus is usually resistant to vancomycin, metronidazole, cefalexin, and <b>dicloxacillin.</b> Treatments last {{at least three}} weeks, with some exceptions. Although A. viscosus is difficult to distinguish from other closely related actinomycetes, the general determination of being an actinomycete is sufficient for treatment of infections.|$|E

50|$|Many common {{antibiotics}} {{can successfully}} treat P. canis infections in both humans and animals. P. canis has shown sensitivity to ampicillin (penicillin), cefuroxime (second-generation cephalosporin), most third-generation cephalosporins (cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone), ciprofloxacin (quinolones), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (sulfonamides), chloramphenicol, most aminoglycosides, and tetracycline. However, the bacterium is also resistant to numerous drugs, such as <b>dicloxacillin</b> (penicillin), some aminoglycosides (spectinomycin and neomycin), vancomycin (glycopeptides), cephalexin and cefadoxil (first-generation cephalosporin), erythromycin (macrolides), and imipenem (carbapenem).|$|E
5000|$|Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It {{is similar}} to methicillin, and has {{replaced}} methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, cloxacillin, <b>dicloxacillin,</b> and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA is treated using vancomycin.|$|E
