5|$|The new castle needed {{constant}} {{investment to}} maintain its quality as a military fortification. Winter floods in 1315–16 damaged the soil {{at the base of}} the motte, requiring immediate repairs. Around 1358–60, the heavy stone keep again suffered from subsidence and the south-eastern lobe cracked <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom.</b> Royal officials recommended that the keep be completely rebuilt, but, instead, the lobe was repaired at a cost of £200.|$|E

5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc {{is close to the}} boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom,</b> right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. <b>From</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the {{sole of the foot}} venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom.</b> In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (<b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom).</b> A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E

5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom,</b> were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Chicago were mostly shot on location, as Bay {{believed}} the plates had {{to really be}} shot in the actual city. Farrar was always fascinated {{with the idea of}} shooting on location, and then blending the film with computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team used aerial plates of the city's actual buildings and added destruction elements such as smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, and torn up streets. Four ILM employees also travelled to Chicago and photographed buildings <b>from</b> <b>top</b> <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> at six different times of the day {{in order to create a}} digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes. ILM's crew designed many major action scenes, with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.|$|E
