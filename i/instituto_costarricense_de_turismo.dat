40|$|Executive {{summary of}} {{certification}} marketing lessons learned Costa Rica has become positioned {{in the world}} tourist market as a nature-based and ecotourism destination, with a large component of complementary offerings in beaches and adventure tourism (canopy activities, rafting, surfing, etc.). There is an additional component of all-inclusive beach resorts, golf, and congresses and conventions. The country’s comparative advantage has been ecotourism, {{but some of the}} market is shifting to more traditional resort tourism. In order to preserve the country’s positioning, the Costa Rican Tourist Board (<b>Instituto</b> <b>Costarricense</b> <b>de</b> <b>Turismo</b> – ICT) developed a sustainable tourism certification scheme for lodging enterprises, called Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST). This system was explicitly designed to certify all lodging sectors, not just ecotourism, in order to motivate all of the industry, including large beach and urban hotels, into exemplary environmental and sociocultural practices and protect the country’s image as nature-friendly and conservationist. CST became a prestigious program within the small world of certification and it was proposed and accepted as possible system for all of Central America, but has now been restricted to Costa Rica and the border areas of Panama and Nicaragua.

40|$|Artículo científico [...] Universidad de Costa Rica. Centro de Investigaciones Geofísicas, 2012 Bahía Culebra, at Gulf of Papagayo on {{the north}} Pacific coast of Costa Rica, {{is an area of}} {{seasonal}} upwelling where more intense cooling events may occur during some boreal winter weeks mainly. To study these extreme cool events, records of nine sea subsurface temperature stations from 1998 to 2010 were analyzed. Five events associated with extremely cool temperatures in this region were identified from these records and taken as study cases. Sea temperatures decreased about 8 - 9 ºC during these events and occurred while cold fronts were present in the Caribbean, with strong trade wind conditions over Central America. These strong wind conditions may have favored the offshore displacement of the sea surface water. The axis of Bahía Culebra runs northeastsouthwest, a condition that favors and triggers cool water events, mainly because the displaced water is replaced by water from deeper levels. Rev. Biol.

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Bachillerato en Ingeniería Electrónica) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería Electrónica, 2001. This work {{presents}} {{a solution for}} the automation of measurements of time for cycling competitions in the National Bicycles Velodrome and their traceability to the National Time and Frequency Standards of <b>Instituto</b> <b>Costarricense</b> <b>de</b> Electricidad. It was decided to use PC based systems due to the resources available in these. These resources include manipulation of timing devices and communications with external circuitry via parallel port. An external circuit was designed to control the sensors that detect the crossing of bicycles in several parts of the Velodrome track. This circuit also provides protection for the parallel port against short circuits and over voltages. The correction in precision of the PC based clock implemented was checked against time standards of the Metrology Laboratory. The programming allows this correction {{to be included in}} the calculations in order to have a minimal error in the reported results. The final prototype can handle improved timing precision compared with a normal PC and the different combinations of measurements according to different competitions.
