5|$|In 1368, the Hongwu Emperor (Zhu Yuanzhang, r.136898) ousted the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty from China to inaugurate the Ming dynasty. The Mongols fled back to Mongolia, but <b>even</b> <b>after</b> {{numerous}} campaigns, the Mongol problem remained.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{the play}} was a {{tremendous}} financial success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out <b>even</b> <b>after</b> the addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $ 20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold four weeks of tickets to local ticket brokers, which helped the box office totals, but the brokers were left with unsold seats <b>even</b> <b>after</b> offering deep discounts. After leaving New York, the show returned to strong sales on the road.|$|E

5|$|The chief Roman {{contributions}} to architecture were the arch, vault and the dome. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, {{due in part}} to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman roads are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> the collapse of the central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} the missionaries were {{considered}} saints, including Augustine, who became another cult figure; the monastery he founded in Canterbury was eventually rededicated to him. Honorius, James the Deacon, Justus, Lawrence, Mellitus, Paulinus, and Peter, were also considered saints, along with Æthelberht, of whom Bede said that he continued to protect his people <b>even</b> <b>after</b> death.|$|E

5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover <b>even</b> <b>after</b> apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E

5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism <b>even</b> <b>after</b> viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies {{on the surface of the}} virus particle.

5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required <b>even</b> <b>after</b> a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin became Bishop of Worcester on 10 August 1180. While at Worcester, he {{impressed}} King Henry II by {{intervening in}} a secular case {{to prevent a}} hanging on a Sunday.

The Albanian National Lyceum remained active until 1939; a French Military Cemetery was built and can still {{be seen in the}} city.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was {{developed}} during the period when Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb, the intellectual rights to Q*bert remained with Columbia <b>even</b> <b>after</b> they divested themselves of Gottlieb's assets in 1984.

Q*bert appeared in Disney's computer-animated film Wreck-It Ralph under license from Sony, and later appeared in Columbia's live-action film Pixels in 2015.|$|E
