40|$|We {{constructed}} an overlapping-generations {{model with}} endogenous fertility {{to analyze the}} effects of <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> and pensions on the welfare of current and future generations. The following results were obtained. First, in the case without pension and accelerated fiscal reforms, the best policy to improve the welfare of future generations is to finance the provision of <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> by capital taxation, followed by issuing government debt, consumption taxation (VAT), and wage taxation, in that order. Second, debt reduction coupled with increasing <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> is preferable to debt reduction alone to reduce public debt for future generations. In particular, coupling increased <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> and fiscal reform simultaneously stands out as the most desirable option. Third, {{from the viewpoint of}} pension reform, maintaining pension benefits by increasing VAT is better than cutting benefits coupled with increasing <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> for future generations...|$|R

40|$|The NSW Government is {{considering}} how {{to establish a}} community <b>benefits</b> <b>fund</b> from the potential development of a coal seam gas (CSG) industry in the state. The Australia Institute made a submission. Key points: 	Gas company contributions to a Community <b>Benefits</b> <b>Fund</b> must be compulsory, as recommended by the Chief Scientist, not voluntary, as currently proposed by the NSW Government in its Gas Plan. 	Any Community <b>Benefit</b> <b>Fund</b> payments should be paid by gas companies on top of royalties paid to the government - otherwise these payments are effectively a taxpayer subsidy to support the CSG industry to enter a region. Diverting funding from other State Government uses to <b>fund</b> CSG community <b>benefits</b> is ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ and brings zero net benefit to the state. Funding should not be “matched” by the government, which also diverts state government funding from other priorities. 	Any Community <b>Benefits</b> <b>Fund</b> should be administered completely independently of gas companies, with strong governance, transparency and accountability. 	Any Community <b>Benefits</b> <b>Fund</b> should not allow spending on "CSG Infrastructure" i. e. Spending on public or private infrastructure designed to facilitate or enable CSG development or spending on infrastructure that can be substituted for company funded infrastructure. State governments in Australia have spent over $ 2 billion in recent years on measures that assist the gas industry, spending that reduces funds available for education, health and other major priorities of state governments. 	Any Community <b>Benefits</b> <b>Fund</b> {{should not be used}} to maintain public infrastructure that has deteriorated {{as a result of the}} development or expansion of CSG in the region. This should be funded separately in a works program funded by the Gas companies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset records the number of UK families that are claiming a <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> {{and the number of}} children for whom the benefit is received from 2003. On average, more than 98 per cent of children in the UK are estimated to receive the <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit,</b> which is paid directly into claimants’ bank, building society or post office accounts. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset contains details {{of the total number of}} claimants, by age of child, sex of child and household composition. Geographic referencing is possible allowing records to be linked to Ward, District or Government Office Region. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> was introduced in 1977 and administered by the Department for Work and Pensions until 2003. Thereafter, responsibility for the collection of <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> information was passed from the DWP to the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in April 2003. Hence HMRC only hold <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> data from 2003. In 2007 / 08 <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> was paid to the carers of more than 13 million children in 7. 5 million families in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> is available for the majority of children in the UK (around 98 %) and so the dataset holds information relating to claims in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset is obtained from the HMRC computer systems that administer the benefit. Data scans are carried out quarterly. National Level quarterly data is scheduled for release approximately three months after the relevant period. Responsibility Quarterly datasets based on a 5 % sample are available from May 2003 to October 2007. In addition annual datasets which give complete coverage of <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> recipients are available from 2003 to 2006, and quarterly from May 2009. The annual dataset can be geographically referenced to the Lower Layer Super Output Area, as can quarterly datasets from June 2009. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset geographical areas are calculated using the postcode and address information reported on the claim. Accurate linking using the National Insurance Number, <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> Number, or names and addresses can then occur. More specifically, most HMRC data do contain names and addresses. Variables within the dataset may be subject to statistical disclosure control techniques to prevent disclosure and confidentiality issues being breached. Published counts of <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> data at a small area level are also rounded so the published total number of claimants in a larger area may possibly not match the summed totals from data tables produced at a smaller geography. The HMRC also carry out a number of standard checks to ensure overall quality of the data. However, many people now receive <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> directly into bank or Post Office accounts. Although people should inform the HMRC when they move home, the address information may not always be up to date. The dataset information comes from a scan of the computer systems that are used to administer <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit.</b> Anyone attempting to defraud the system is liable to prosecution. Therefore the quality of the dataset is believed to be of a high standard. Please note that families with children may choose not to claim <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> (take up rates are estimated to be around 98 %) and there are some circumstances where a child might be ineligible. Research Usage and Linkage As the <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> data are restricted in scope, the potential for research purposes is limited. However, it does provide a good basis for assessing the overall number of claimants at specified times, the geographical distribution of claimants and estimating the size of the child population. For example, the Office for National Statistics use this dataset to create population estimates at the lower layer super output area level. The data has been used to estimate the number of children living in low income households (English Indices of Deprivation 2007, Economic Deprivation Index 2008 and the Child Well-being Index 2009), and also to estimate the proportion of children post 16 years old staying in full-time education (English Indices of Deprivation 2007 and Child Well-being 2009). In the past the data also formed the basis of sampling frames for the Millennium Cohort Study. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset is linked by the HMRC to other datasets that they hold, to help with the administration of tax credits. This includes the Tax Credit Claimants dataset which has the same referencing in order for comparisons to be made. Linking is made using the National Insurance number, <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> Number or names and addresses. In theory, it is possible to link the <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset with other individual tax records and DWP benefit data. These linked datasets have the potential to be used for in-depth research of family income, work and worklessness patterns. Finally, the initial wave of the Families and Children Study was drawn from <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> records. </div...|$|R
