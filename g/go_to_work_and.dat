25|$|The family goes to {{the local}} YMCA to attend one-time-only free classes, {{along with many other}} Springfieldians who admit they will never return to pay for regular classes. Lisa takes {{gymnastics}} and gets yelled at by the Russian coach for being too old. Bart gets tricked into taking an etiquette class by a black man dressed as a gangsta rapper, who happens to be the husband of the prim and proper etiquette teacher. Homer participates in a basketball class for men over the age of 35, but suffers a torn ACL after a dunk attempt ends with the backboard crashing down on his leg. After Homer gets his surgery, he is told by Dr. Hibbert that he cannot <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> must stay home. Homer finds himself extremely bored, even going so far as attempting to cross-breed Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. One evening, Ned wants Marge to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a Chris Rock concert (that he misinterprets to be an abbreviation for a christian rock concert and after is surprised by the language). But Marge is out identifying the body of her Uncle Lou (which ends up being a very much alive Hans Moleman, although the morgue attendant seems convinced that he is dead), so Ned asks Homer instead. Rod and Todd enjoy having Homer take care of them, which gives Homer the idea to establish his own day care center.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 1875, the Anglo-American Times {{published}} {{a letter written}} by Blue Horse to President Grant. “The President has received letters from Sioux chiefs unable to accompany the delegation, of which the following from Blue Horse may {{be taken as a}} sample: ‘There are fifty families of my people who wish to go to farming. We wish to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> do not want white men to run over us. We intend to remain here and we want neat houses and fences and everything that the white men use. We want a cow, two yoke of oxen, and a wagon, also chickens. Whatever the President may give those who visit Washington, I wish a share also. I also want a sewing machine and other farming implements. The Great Father has promised us that we should not starve, and I wish to make a living for myself on these rivers in this way.'” ...|$|E
2500|$|Lincoln had {{supported}} a middle position to allow some black men to vote, especially army veterans. Johnson {{also believed that}} such service should be rewarded with citizenship. Lincoln proposed giving the vote to [...] "the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks." [...] In 1864, Governor Johnson said, [...] "The better class of them will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> sustain themselves, and that class ought {{to be allowed to}} vote, on the ground that a loyal negro is more worthy than a disloyal white man." [...] As President in 1865, Johnson wrote to the man he appointed as governor of Mississippi, recommending, [...] "If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color who can read the Constitution in English and write their names, and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at least two hundred and fifty dollars, and pay taxes thereon, you would completely disarm the adversary , and set an example the other states will follow." ...|$|E

[...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that the inspiration for the song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But I think with that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> he'd play his video games– but also it was maybe too regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E
60|$|As {{well you}} may conceive, we {{wasted no time}} in compliments, but {{straightway}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> that with a zest that drew sparks from our rapiers at the first contact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{continued}} Thatcher, suppressing a yawn; [...] "yes, I guess you're right,--Wiles. Well, {{the stage}} driver, finally believing this, <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> quietly and unostentatiously steals--I say, {{have you got}} a cigar?" ...|$|R
60|$|I didn't {{know just}} what to do--but then I thought. I {{scratched}} around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe {{and give it to}} him, and he took it <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> never said a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Max," [...] {{interrupted}} my friend, [...] "don't get sentimental {{till after}} supper. <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> pluck that bird while I fill the kettle." ...|$|E

60|$|As for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison {{never made}} any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came. Then he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> washed them all at once in the {{rainwater}} hogshead, and left them to drain dry.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{specially}} begged {{that you}} would establish Lord's-day schools," [...] said Mrs. Smith; and then they all <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> picked Mrs. Proudie to pieces from the top ribbon of her cap down to the sole of her slipper.|$|R
50|$|Chola {{was born}} in Lubumbashi where his father <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> he {{reportedly}} played for local club Solbena F.C. before moving to Ndola as a teenager. After a brief stay, he left for Mufulira and signed with Division II side Mufulira Blackpool in 1974.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Phonny, [...] "we won't feed him. I {{will leave}} him to himself, {{and let him}} do what he pleases, and I'll <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> make my cage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Gayther,' said he, 'it's ten to {{one that}} them ships has got {{treasure}} aboard, and what we've {{got to do is}} to form a company and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> get it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Saying {{this the}} worthy ranchero <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> speedily {{supplied}} the travellers with a meal consisting of hard biscuit and rancid pork, {{with a glass}} of bitter brandy to wash it down; for which he charged them the sum of eight shillings a head.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I often tell my owners, but 'go ahead' is the order. When I was a youngster, a ship {{remained}} in port for a fair wind; but, now, she <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> makes one. The world {{seems to get}} young, as I get old." ...|$|R
5000|$|Soon after, LCDR Robinson {{visits the}} Sullivan home and tells Katherine Mary, Tom, Alleta, and Gen that {{all five of}} the {{brothers}} were killed in action.

6000|$|... "Yes, in the morning, {{when they}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> <b>And</b> {{out of the}} Chippering Mill, especially. Ditmar, the agent of that mill, is the ablest of the lot, I'm told. He's the man we want to cripple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Zook, {{you have}} at all events the means {{to make a good}} supper, so sit down and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> I'll talk to you while you eat,--but, stay, hand me the bundle of old clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be calculated," [...] replied Cardatas. Then the two <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> calculate, <b>and</b> spent {{an hour or two}} at it.|$|R
