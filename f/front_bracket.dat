Prvi del diplomske naloge zajema samo zasnovo in analizo visokoregalnega dvigala, poseben poudarek je na pripravi tehnologije za proizvodnjo dvigala. Pri izdelavi sem se osredotočil na določen sklop, in sicer čelni nosilec, saj je dvigalo preveč kompleksno. V drugem delu diplomske naloge je poudarek na ustrezni izbiri obdelovalnega orodja. Organizacija v proizvodnji daje velik pomen praktični izdelavi, zato sem predstavil potek tehnoloških korakov skozi proizvodnjo. Na koncu je predstavljena sestava sklopov visokoregalnega dvigala.

The diploma thesis is focused on a specific component of high-shelf lift, in our case only on the <b>front</b> <b>bracket</b> of high-shelf lift. The entire high-shelf lift is too complex to be analysed in diploma thesis. The second part of diploma thesis is focused on appropriate tool selection for production of high-shelf lift components. In the diploma thesis is also presented proper production management which gives great importance in the manufacturing of the high-shelf lifts. This is the reason why technological steps through production of high-shelf lift were also presented in the diploma thesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the proposed optimum design of tractor <b>front</b> axle <b>bracket</b> for varying load conditions. Due to brittleness of the cast component material, it is subjected to sudden failure under dynamic load condition causing potential danger. The <b>front</b> axle <b>bracket</b> is designed for high strength and stiffness. The existing design has no field failure reports and hence its parameters were taken as basis for comparison with results of the proposed designs. Based on the finite element analysis results, optimum design was carried out for the bracket for weight optimization and easy manufacturability. The proposed design was evaluated for selected worst load cases of the existing design. The finite element analysis of proposed models yielded displacement and stresses close to the existing design. The increase in displacement was not significant and the proposed design met the structural requirement. It was also observed that the proposed design has significant reduction in weight and did not involve welding, thereby significantly saving manufacturing cost. The assembly components like smaller diameters bearing, smaller knuckle size, etc were also found to be cost effective. The present work showcases the use of finite element analysis as a method for reduction of cost in terms of materials & manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Car cabin <b>front</b> {{suspension}} <b>bracket</b> (CCFSB) plays {{a supporting}} role of cab which connected cab cabin and chassis parts. In the conventional design, CCFSB is large and heavy usually to ensure its design strength. Therefore, structure optimization design is becoming {{the focus on the}} design of CCFSB. To solve the problem, this paper presents a structure optimization design method of CCFSB based on HyperWorks. The “Analysis-OptiStruct-Refine-Analysis-Contrast ” method is proposed to realize the structure optimization. By the process of “meshing-loading- calculating- view of results”, the result of structure optimization of CCFSB is got which shows materials distribution. Trough taking OptiStruct optimization, the weight of CCFSB is reduced about 39 % but stiffness is increased. The performance of product is improved and the cost is reduced greatly...|$|R

The analysis begins with g-loads and proceeds with time-dependent loads. It is investigated how simulated strains in the cylinder block correspond to measured strains from the test track at Scania. Finally, it is investigated how component tests corresponds to actual loads by comparing the results. The results from the first part of the thesis indicate that worst load case is loading in the negative z -direction and the model of the powertrain with isolators modelled as spring elements is the best for g-loads lower than - 3 g and the model is sufficient for loads lower than - 8 g. The results from the second part of the thesis indicate that the simulated strains generally correspond to the measured strains, but with a slight difference in strain amplitude...|$|R
