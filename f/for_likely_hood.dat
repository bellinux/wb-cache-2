40|$|Tracking {{maneuvering}} targets introduce {{two major}} directions {{to improve the}} Multiple Model (MM) approach: Develop a better MM algorithm and design a better model set. The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimator is a suboptimal hybrid filter that {{has been shown to}} be one of the most cost-effective hybrid state estimation schemes. The main feature of this algorithm is the ability to estimate the state of a dynamic system with several behavior modes which can "switch" from one to another. In particular, the use of too many models is performance-wise as bad as that of too few models. In this paper we show that the use of too many models is performance-wise as bad as that of too few models. To overcome this we divide the models into a small number of sets, tuning these sets during operation at the right operating set. We proposed Hierarchal Switching sets of IMM (HSIMM). The state space of the nonlinear variable is divided into sets each set has its own IMM. The connection between them is the switching algorithm which manages the activation and termination of sets. Also the re-initialization process overcomes the error accumulation due to the targets changes from one model to another. This switching can introduce a number of different models while no restriction on their number. The activation of sets depends on the threshold value of set <b>likely</b> <b>hood.</b> As the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of the set is higher than threshold it is active otherwise it is minimized. The result is the weighted sum of the output of active sets. The computational time is minimum than introduced by IMM and VIMM. HSIMM introduces less error as the noise increase and there is no need for re adjustment to the Covariance as the noise increase so it is more robust against noise and introduces minimum computational time...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the industrialized world and in the future is expected to be the number one killer worldwide. The main cause underlying CVD is atherosclerosis. A key event in atherosclerosis initiation and progression is oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species as well as endothelial dysfunction. Several pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and proteins are involved in this process, complemented by activation of adhesion molecules that promote leukocyte rolling, tethering and infiltration into the sub-endothelial space. Statins represent the agent of choice since numerous clinical trials have verified that their pharmacological action extends beyond lipid lowering. Statins demonstrate direct anti-oxidant effects by scavenging free radicals and stimulating anti-oxidant enzymes while acting as regulators for cytokine, protein and adhesion molecule expression, all of which are involved in the atherosclerotic process. Statin use is considered one of the most efficient currently used interventions in managing CVD with the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of remaining so in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Mobility {{serves as}} an {{indicator}} of the relationship between short and long run inequality. Understanding mobility is crucial for deriving policies that affect household’s incomes. Since long run income is more equally distributed than short run income {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics of income mobility. In this paper we have used a unique household dataset spanning more than 3 decades from rural India to derive what may be broadly classified as the triggers of income mobility. We believe and wish to show that location and outcome of location place a crucial role in determining the magnitude of income mobility. Given that in low income countries migration is a significant cause for income mobility, we show that its magnitude is influenced by the relationship between income premium (benefits accruing to the household due to location) and migration. There is thus a three way relationship between income premium, migration and income mobility. We find that increases in household income premium will reduce the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of a given household (members of that household migrating). Consequently we are more likely to observe a reduction in overall income mobility. A policy implication of this finding is that if development is not uniform across the economic space.

40|$|An Empirical Investigation of Discrimination in the Hispanic Mortgage Market This Master's Thesis empirically investigates whether Hispanics are {{discriminated}} against in the mortgage market. The {{use of the}} 1989 Metropolitan file of the American Housing Survey allows me to test the effects of borrower race and default risk in mortgage lending. The empirical analysis {{is based on a}} probit model of whether Hispanics, blacks and non-Hispanic whites households obtain FHA or conventional mortgages. FHA mortgages are fully insured and generally require a lower down payment, but are typically more expensive. Given a choice between FHA and conventional mortgages, borrowers will prefer the relatively cheaper conventional mortgages. Therefore, households obtaining FHA mortgages will tend to be rationed in the conventional market. After controlling for various socioeconomic characteristics any remaining race effect in the probit model may be reflective of events unrelated to default risk. Results from this investigation indicate that the <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> of Hispanics obtaining FHA mortgages is not significantly different from that of white households. However, blacks are more likely to obtain FHA loans than Hispanic and white borrowers. These results suggest that Hispanics are not rationed as are blacks in the conventional mortgage market.

40|$|Despite {{claims that}} we exist in an “Age of Acquiescence” (Fraser, 2015) to {{historically}} {{high levels of}} inequality, Americans across wage, gender, and political leaning all desire a more equal distribution of wealth (Norton 2 ̆ 6 Ariely, 2011). However, this apparent consensus doesn’t necessarily translate into support for redistribution, {{at least in terms}} of greater taxation. Rather, according to recent findings by Northwestern University Professor Leslie McCall, Americans prefer instead to address wealth inequality through the expansion of opportunity (McCall, 2011). It may be that as individual perceptions of autonomy and the availability of opportunity increases, support for traditional redistribution decreases, since life outcomes are attributed to individual effort and responsibility as opposed to an un-level playing field (Naito, 2007). In addition, differences in individual moral priorities place certain morals intuitions above others, with liberals placing a greater emphasis on fairness and reciprocity than conservatives, potentially explaining their greater <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> to support traditional redistribution in addition to opportunity expansion (Graham et al, 2011).

Bivariate analysis was done and all explanatory variables associated with first line treatment failure with P<. 05 were entered in to multivariable logistic regression analysis using back ward stepwise <b>likely</b> <b>hood</b> ratio method to identify independent predictors. Result: One hundred three cases and two hundred six controls were included in the study. Treatment interruption (Adjusted odds ratio 5. 4, 95 % confidence interval 2. 33 to 12. 13), base line clusters of differentiation cell count < 50 cells/µl (Adjusted odds ratio 2. 7, 95 % confidence interval 1. 24 to 5. 64), pulmonary Tuberculosis treatment (Adjusted odds ratio 2. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 55 to 5. 34) and history of gastric problem (Adjusted odd...|$|R
40|$|Homeownership {{is widely}} {{advocated}} and believed to contribute towards economic activity, employment, wealth creation, economic, political, and neighbourhood stability and financial independence. Despite government’s interventions to advance homeownership {{there is currently}} a declining trend in homeownership {{and an increase in}} renting experienced in South Africa. As the government does not have the resources to provide adequate housing to all South Africans, identifying the factors which attribute to non-subsidised homeownership will assist in implementing interventions and strategies to increase access to non-subsidised homeownership and reduce reliance on government subsidised housing. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the comparative odds of variables contributing to non-subsidised homeownership in South Africa from secondary data obtained from a South African household survey. Compared to the heuristic model, the following variables were found to align closely with the expectation created; non-subsidised homeownership attainment was most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households within high-income groups and least for households within the low-income groups, more <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households who have access to credit than those without, more <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households with no accounts in arrears than those with accounts in arrears, more <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households with an ability to save than those without, most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households consisting of seven or more household members and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> single member households, most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households where FKP (Financially Knowledgeable Person) has completed a tertiary education level and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households with primary not completed education levels, most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households where the FKP is older (aged 65 and older) and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> young FKP households (aged between 18 and 24), most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households residing in rural areas and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households residing in metropolitan areas, most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> female FKP households and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> male FKP households. Unexpectedly the regression model indicated that non-subsidised homeownership is most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households where the Financially Knowledgeable Person (FKP) is not economically active (for example pensioners) and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> employed households, most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households from the African population group and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> Indian households, most likely where the FKP is never married or single and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> separated or divorced FKP households (which is expected) and most <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households residing in Limpopo (which is expected) and least <b>likely</b> <b>for</b> households residing Western Cape.
