5|$|Edward did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> any of this; after around 1375 {{he played}} a limited role in the {{government}} of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.|$|E
5|$|There are countless {{subjects}} that {{are affected by}} the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind.

The fact that the Crown Prince had, before 1914, never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, and was now supposedly commanding both an army and an army group {{at the same time}} should have been a clue that his role in German decision-making was mostly nominal. Zelle's contact with the Deuxième Bureau was Captain Georges Ladoux, who was later to emerge as one of her principal accusers.|$|E
25|$|From the Hopkins Grammar School {{he went to}} Yale College, {{from which}} he was {{graduated}} with the class of 1861. There is scant information as to his four years at college. During that period he kept a diary from which he read extracts on the fifty-fifth reunion of his class, but this diary is not at present available. That the studious traits which he later manifested were not altogether lacking at this time may be inferred {{from the fact that}} he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Skull & Bones. Such records as we have do not indicate that there was anything unusual about this young student who had among his classroom contemporaries the poet Edward Rowland Sill, and two others who like himself were later to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the life of the university, his friends Tracy Peck and Franklin Bowditch Dexter.|$|E
25|$|Matters are {{complicated}} further {{with the arrival}} of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and the secret daughter of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (though Jessica herself is unaware of her parentage). Jessica is presented to Leto as a gift from the Bene Gesserit, although the sisterhood has the ulterior motive of using the pair in their breeding program. At first, Leto refuses to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Jessica and tries to remain faithful to Kailea. However, as he and Kailea grow farther apart, he begins to seek out Jessica's company. Finally, Kailea is driven to make an attempt on Leto's life by having an explosive device planted on his skyclipper. At the last minute, Leto decides to take Victor and Rhombur along with him, and the boy dies instead. Leto is relatively unharmed, but Rhombur is reduced to little more than a charred lump of flesh. Fearing that Leto will guess that she is {{responsible for the death of}} their son and driven by guilt, Kailea kills her lady-in-waiting and then commits suicide by jumping out a window. The Tleilaxu offer to grow a ghola of Leto's deceased son in exchange for the barely alive body of Rhombur Vernius. Leto ultimately refuses, after much soul-searching, knowing that the Tleilaxu intend only harm towards House Vernius. Instead, Leto hires Dr. Wellington Yueh, an expert in the field of cybernetics, to fashion a cybernetic replacement body for Rhombur. Leto and Jessica fall deeply in love, leading Jessica to decide to conceive a son for Leto's sake, directly disobeying the Bene Gesserit's order that she have a daughter.|$|E

500|$|The {{music and}} sound effects {{received}} similar praise. GameSpot {{pointed out that}} [...] "explosions erupt with lots of satisfying, floor-rattling bass, lasers ping nicely, flamethrowers emit appropriate rumbling whooshes, and there's plenty of ambient beeping, hissing, and mechanical humming". Game Revolution praised the graphics for their [...] "modeling, colored lighting, incredible special effects, wonderful animation, [...] sheer overall feel". Victor Lucas of Electric Playground stated similar pros, but also admitted that the game's hardware requirements were relatively high. Criticism was leveled at the game's story. GameSpot considered it not compelling, while Jason Cross, writing for Computer Games Magazine, felt that it [...] "really doesn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> actual gameplay". PC Gamer reviewer Stephen Poole also criticized the Guide-Bot's efficiency, remarking that sometimes it can get lost or trapped while leading the player to a destination.|$|E

The matter was tabled until the following Sunday (June 17, 1838) when Sidney Rigdon preached his Salt Sermon, in which he likened the dissenters to [...] "salt that had lost its savor." [...] He went on to state that the dissenters would be [...] "trodden under the foot of men." [...] Corrill stated that [...] "although [...] did not give names in his sermon, yet it was plainly understood that he meant the dissenters or those who had denied the faith." [...] Rigdon's strongly worded sermon may have {{played a significant role in}} encouraging the dissenters to leave the county.|$|E

2500|$|In 1667, Johann Joachim Becher {{published}} his book Physica subterranea, which contained {{the first instance}} of {{what would become the}} phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire, water, and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of earth: terra lapidea, terra fluida, and terra pinguis. [...] Terra pinguis was the element that imparted oily, sulphurous, or combustible properties. [...] Becher believed that terra pinguis was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned. Becher did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> phlogiston theory as we know it now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher's main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much it was changed after him. Becher's idea was that combustible substances contain an ignitable matter, the terra pinguis.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the themes}} in the story {{involves}} the tension between destiny and self-determination. According to Richard Gillmore, the main characters are torn between a sense of inevitability, [...] "that the world goes on its way {{and that it does}} not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> human desires and concerns", and the notion that our futures are inextricably connected to our own past actions. Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ignores repeated reminders that he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands [...] "responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{only one}} chapter was {{contemplated}} by the founders. And although the germ of expansion arrived early, its {{period of gestation}} consumed 13 years. As early as 1875 [...] an inquiry had been received from a group at Maine Agricultural College, {{and a few years}} later there was an unexpected letter from the University of New Mexico-but nothing came of either [...] "feeler." [...] In 1878, John A. Cutter was inducted into the group, a man destined to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the preservation of the order's early records and with its expansion beyond the confines of the Massachusetts campus. He later attended Albany Medical College (in 1873 merged with Union College) and established a group, which became Beta Chapter (1888). Cutter was also instrumental in the establishment of Gamma at Cornell (1889). The transition to a national order was accomplished. These same early years saw the pin (or badge) adopted essentially as it is today; an induction ritual, which embodied the concept of universal brotherhood and expanded the order's horizons beyond Massachusetts, was written in 1890; the establishment of the Fraternity's magazine, The Signet, and the first chapter out of the Northeast came into being at West Virginia University (1891).|$|E

2500|$|... (1992) {{sees the}} Avatar {{entangled}} in the plan of an ostensibly virtuous and benevolent organization named the Fellowship (inspired by Scientology) to create a gateway for the evil entity known as the Guardian to enter Britannia. Though all of the main line of Ultima games are arranged into trilogies, Richard Garriot later revealed that Ultima VII was the first game where he did any sort of planning ahead for future games in the series. He elaborated that [...] "the first three didn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> each other, they were 'Richard Garriott learns to program'; IV through VI were a backwards-designed trilogy, {{in the sense that}} I tied them together as I wrote them; but VII-IX, the story of the Guardian, were a preplanned trilogy, and we had a definite idea of where we wanted to go." [...] An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate. The tie-in storyline was limited to this island, where a piece of Exodus (his data storage unit) had resurfaced. To leave the island again, the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus. In the process of doing so, he also created The Black Sword, an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon.|$|E
2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes {{in the structure of the}} melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give me good music, I'll give you a great show," [...] implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going [...] "Heya-heya-heya-heya" [...] sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.|$|E
