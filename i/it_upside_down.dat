25|$|Using a flag unconventionally, such as hanging <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> or reversed, may be {{regarded}} as desecration. Flying a flag at half-mast is considered desecration in Saudi Arabia. In some countries, however, flying a flag upside-down is conventional protocol to indicate an emergency or problem, or to indicate a state of war. Moreover, some flags (such as the flag of Austria) when hung upside down and/or reversed look the same because they are vertically and/or horizontally symmetrical.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 1898, {{during the}} Spanish–American War, U.S. troops (from the 5th. Cavalry, 11th. Infantry and 19th. Infantry, under Gen. Theodore Schwan) entered Mayagüez. Spanish troops encircled the city however. A battle never occurred, and the invading troops were well received. According to chronicles {{of the day}} a young local boy was given the task of raising the Star and Stripes at the Casa del Rey (City Hall) and raised <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> with the canton to the floor, without knowing this {{was a symbol of}} distress. A few of the American troops {{eventually}} settled in Mayagüez, including Sgt. Frank Cole, the father of later mayor Benjamin Cole.|$|E

Some of Zhuangzi's reasoning, such as his renowned argument with his philosopher friend Huizi (Master Hui) about the joy of fish (chapter 17), have been compared to the Socratic and Platonic dialogue traditions, and Huizi's paradoxes {{near the end of}} the book have been termed [...] "strikingly like those of Zeno of Elea." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hammond {{was a key}} {{instrument}} in progressive rock music. Author Edward Macan thinks {{this is because of}} its versatility, allowing both chords and lead lines to be played, and a choice between quiet and clean, and what Emerson described as a [...] "tacky, aggressive, almost distorted, angry sound." [...] Emerson first found commercial success with the Nice, with whom he used and abused an L-100, putting knives in the instrument, setting fire to it, playing <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> or riding it across stage {{in the manner of a}} horse. He continued to play the {{instrument in}} this manner alongside other keyboards in Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include the Zombies' and Argent's Rod Argent, Yes's Tony Kaye and Rick Wakeman, Focus's Thijs van Leer, Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley, Pink Floyd's Rick Wright, Kansas's Steve Walsh, and Genesis's Tony Banks. Banks later claimed he only used the Hammond because a piano was impractical to transport to gigs.|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cleaning {{laboratory}} glassware is sometimes necessary {{and may be}} done using multiple methods. [...] Glassware can be soaked in a detergent solution to remove grease and loosen most contaminations. These contaminations are then scrubbed with a brush or scouring pad to remove particles which cannot be rinsed. Sturdy glassware {{may be able to}} withstand sonicated as an alternative to scrubbing. For certain sensitive experiments glassware may be soaked in solvents, such as aqua regia or mild acids, to dissolve a trace quantities of specific contaminations known to interfere with an experiment. When cleaning is finished it is common practice to triple rinse glassware before suspending <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> on drying racks.|$|E

[...] Doyle explained, [...] "Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, {{we thought it would}} look even cooler if we turned it over and used <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were actually using the knife upside down." [...] Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 2010 hiatus, holiday {{specials}} were {{a regular}} {{feature of the}} site, released to coincide with popular holidays, specifically Halloween and Decemberween (a fictional holiday similar to Christmas also celebrated on December 25). Halloween shorts typically feature the main characters celebrating a traditional aspect of the holiday (such as ghost stories, trick-or-treating or pumpkin carving) in costume, often making obscure pop culture references. Similarly, Decemberween cartoons typically satirise Christmas traditions such as gift-giving and carol-singing. The fact that it takes place {{on the same day}} as Christmas has been presented as just a coincidence, having been stated that Decemberween takes place [...] "55 days after Halloween". April Fools' Day features various gags, such as turning the site into a paid subscription service, or turning <b>it</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Because many {{echinoderms}} of {{this group}} have only simple nervous systems without a controlling [...] "brain", they are limited in their actions and responses to stimuli.
