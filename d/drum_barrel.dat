5000|$|The lack of {{precedent}} in using limestone as a host formation for a DGR {{makes it very}} difficult to predict potential failures of the DGR that is not constructed in granite formation. OPG’s presentation of  assumptions about the DGRs geochemistry is an underestimation of the potential risks of constructing a DGR in limestone formation, as seen {{in the case of the}} Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico that leaked radioactive plutonium to the surface after a <b>drum</b> <b>barrel</b> leaked: “These accidents illustrate how difficult it is to predict potential failures of such a disposal system over millennia. For example, assumptions about the repository's geochemistry or the likelihood of drilling into it can lead to underestimation of the risks." [...] Western University professor, Erika Simpson observed that DGRs constructed in geological formations other than limestone have a risky track record. In an op-ed for a London newspaper, she wrote, “It didn’t help soothe critics that the only example OPG offered of a similar DGR — the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico — is no longer operating, after an underground fire and loss of containment resulted in radioactive releases to the surface in 2014. Likewise, Germany’s vaunted salt mine solution for low-level nuclear waste has also proven to be full of holes as thousands of litres of groundwater continue to leak into the Asse mine every day mixing with radioactive waste." [...] Furthermore, research conducted in China revealed that Exposure to mechanical and chemical weathering has been proven to mechanically destabilize limestone, leading to geohazards including sinkholes and rapid erosion of limestone into soil. This could occur during construction and in the highly extended lifetime of the DGR.|$|E
