40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose that <b>external</b> <b>reports</b> may be {{assessed}} not only by their content but also by the affordances provided to assist the reader’s understanding. To operationalise this idea, it is applied to statements of service performance issued by New Zealand universities in 2000. Design/methodology/approach – Using concepts drawn from information systems design, the authors develop an index which is applied to archival reports. Findings – The index is negatively correlated with existing disclosure indices applied to the same set of reports, implying that it captures a distinct dimension of performance reporting. A trade-off is demonstrated between providing more disclosure and more cognitive affordances. The index is fairly robust to certain arbitrary choices in its construction. Research limitations/implications – The concept of assessing the quality of <b>external</b> <b>reports</b> by their cognitive affordances is shown to be feasible by applying it to one kind of report in a particular setting. Further research will be needed to establish how it could be operationalised in other settings, such as social and environmental accounting. Practical implications – With further development, the index may provide a way of assessing the presentation of <b>external</b> <b>reports,</b> and hence of improving accounting standards. It may also be helpful to preparers by providing a second dimension (besides content) on which they can evaluate and improve the quality of their <b>reporting.</b> Originality/value – <b>External</b> <b>reports</b> have previously been assessed in terms of content and of the sentence structure employed. This paper suggests a way of assessing how the structure and presentation of reports affects their usability...|$|R

When moving from traditional accounting methods to lean accounting there is no [...] "change of accounting" [...] because the <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> outcome of lean accounting uses the same accrual based actual costing required by GAAP and statutory regulations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether auditors' job stress, job satisfaction, {{and performance}} {{are affected by}} the congruence (or fit) between auditors' personality and characteristics of the work environment they face. The personality measure used in this study is locus of control, which classifies individuals as either "internals" or "externals. " The work environment is measured by using auditor assessments of role stress and imposed control and by noting whether the auditors work for a more or less structured auditing firm. Locus of control theory and prior research suggest that internals adapt better to environments that impose relatively little control on the individual or that are high in role stress. Conversely, externals adapt better to environments that impose high levels of control or that are low in role stress. In order to obtain the necessary data, a questionnaire was distributed to staff and senior-level auditors from four of the "Big 6 " accounting firms (the two most structured and the two most unstructured as defined by prior research). The principal results can be summarized as follows. First, auditors' job stress was affected by the congruence between their locus of control and the amount of role conflict they perceived. Internals reported less job stress than externals when role conflict was high, and <b>externals</b> <b>reported</b> less job stress than internals when role conflict was low. Second, auditors' job satisfaction was affected by the congruence between (1) their locus of control and the amount of role ambiguity they perceived and (2) their locus of control and the amount of role conflict they perceived. In each case, internals reported higher job satisfaction than externals when role stress was high. On the other hand, when role stress was low, internals and <b>externals</b> <b>reported</b> similar levels of job satisfaction. Finally, auditors' self-reported performance was affected by the interaction between auditors' locus of control and audit firm structure. At relatively unstructured firms, internals reported higher performance than externals; at relatively structured firms, internals and <b>externals</b> <b>reported</b> similar performance levels. The interaction also reveals that internals reported higher performance at unstructured firms than at structured firms and that <b>externals</b> <b>reported</b> higher performance at structured firms than at unstructured firms...|$|R

50|$|Variable costing is a {{managerial}} {{accounting cost}} concept. Under this method, manufacturing overhead is incurred {{in the period}} that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of absorption costing that allows income to rise as production rises. Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits {{in the period of}} production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system. Variable costing is generally not used for <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP.|$|E

As a core terminology for the EHR, SNOMED CT provides a common language that enables a consistent language that enables a consistent way of capturing, sharing, and aggregating health data across specialties and sites of care.

Classification systems such as ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, and ICD-10-PCS group together similar diseases and procedures and organise related entities for easy retrieval. They are typically used for <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements or other uses where data aggregation is advantageous, such as measuring the quality of care monitoring resource utilisation, or processing claims for reimbursement. SNOMED is clinically-based, documents whatever is needed for patient care and has better clinical coverage than ICD.

SNOMED CT is used directly by healthcare providers during the process of care, whereas ICD is used by coding professionals after the episode of care.

40|$|Customers {{monitor their}} suppliers’ {{internal}} information processes to reduce {{uncertainty about the}} suppliers’ ability to fulfill their commitments. In this paper, I argue that these monitoring procedures improve the suppliers’ internal information, which in turn leads to higher quality <b>external</b> <b>reporting.</b> Using a dataset of U. S. government contracts, and employing both cross–sectional and within–firm research designs, I find a positive relation between government contracts {{and the quality of}} firms’ <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> environment. Consistent with government monitoring driving this relation, I find that firms improve their <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> when they first start contracting with the government, and that the magnitude of the improvement varies predictably with contract characteristics and is largest for contracts that entail a greater degree of government scrutiny. Finally, I use the establishment of the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) in 1970 as an exogenous shock to contractor monitoring, and find greater improvements in the <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> environment among firms affected by the CASB’s monitoring requirements. Overall, these results suggest that customer monitoring can play a role in shaping the firm’s <b>external</b> <b>reporting</b> environment. ...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Accounting Research Foundation (AARF) {{recently}} issued Legislative Policy Discussion Paper No. 4 which {{proposes a}} framework for financial reporting by Australian incorporated associations. This paper comments on both the merits and deficiencies of the proposal. In particular it notes that the proposal simply advocates that the application of differential reporting, accounting standards, and the conceptual framework be imposed on incorporated associations by amended statutes. It is noted that in light of long experience in the corporate sector, he espoused benefits of such a move may not eventuate. Further, concern is expressed that the proposal is a blank cheque one because of the inadequacy of existing relevant accounting standards and the proposal to introduce new relevant standards. Another major defect in the proposal is that it emanates from accountants who acknowledge in their conceptual framework, the need for <b>external</b> <b>reports</b> to report on performance through both financial and non-financial reporting methods. Despite that acknowledgment, the standard set of <b>external</b> <b>reports</b> prepared by accountants do not measure performance as defined in their own conceptual framework (SAC 2) and in their auditing pronouncements (AUP 33), and they have restricted their domain to financial reporting (SAC 2). Accordingly the proposal appears to be seriously deficient and {{it is suggested that}} it be rejected and a new proposal be prepared by a multi-party group free from vested interests...|$|R
