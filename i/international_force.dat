5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide {{that the future of}} Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an <b>international</b> <b>force</b> organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any <b>international</b> <b>force</b> in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E

In 1913, Edgar Quinet participated in an international naval demonstration that also included British, German, and Austro-Hungarian vessels off Albania. The demonstration was a protest of the Siege of Scutari during the First Balkan War; it succeeded in forcing the Serbian army to withdraw and allowing an <b>international</b> <b>force</b> to occupy the city.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an <b>international</b> <b>force</b> of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E

5|$|Carlo Alberto {{acted as}} the royal yacht for King Victor Emmanuel III when he {{attended}} the coronation ceremony for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1902. Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route. When the coronation was delayed by Edward's illness, the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt. She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Nova Scotia for experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean. After 15 December, when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Canada to England, Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, when an <b>international</b> <b>force</b> of British, German, and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country's refusal to pay foreign debts. From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, 2,000 ADF {{personnel}} were again deployed to East Timor {{as part of}} Operation Astute, following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force. Australian forces {{were involved in a}} number skirmishes during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by Alfredo Reinado at Same on 4 March 2007. However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small <b>international</b> <b>force.</b> Following a drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from Timor-Leste in November 2012, a process which was completed in April 2013.|$|E

5|$|In September 1999, about 20 SBS {{members were}} {{involved}} in the Australian led <b>International</b> <b>Force</b> for East Timor (INTERFET) in East Timor. Together with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service they formed INTERFET's special forces element named Response Force. Response Force departed from Darwin by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and flew into Dili tasked with securing the airport, a seaport and a heli-port to enable regular forces to land and deploy with the SBS filmed driving a Land Rover Defender out of a Hercules. Response Force was then utilised to perform to a variety of tasks including direct action and special reconnaissance throughout East Timor. The British forces withdrew in December 1999, including the SBS. A Sergeant was awarded the Military Cross after his patrol came under fire from pro-Indonesian militia.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its {{period at}} Ubon, No.79 Squadron formed {{part of an}} <b>international</b> <b>force</b> tasked with {{defending}} Thailand's air space against intruders. At {{the start of the}} deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that they were at war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No.79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled Air America. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Alberto {{served as}} the royal yacht for Victor Emmanuel III when he {{attended}} the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom in 1902. Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route. Originally scheduled for 26 June, the coronation was delayed by Edward's illness and rescheduled for 9 August. In the meantime, the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt. She returned to England before the coronation ceremony and then participated in the fleet review at Spithead on 16 August. On the return voyage Marconi conducted more long-range experiments with his site in Poldhu, Cornwall. The King then loaned Carlo Alberto to Marconi in September for more testing. She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Glace Bay, Nova Scotia for further experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean. After 15 December, when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Glace Bay to Poldhu, Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, when an <b>international</b> <b>force</b> of British, German, and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country's refusal to pay foreign debts. She returned in early 1903 and was briefly deployed in Salonica later that year. From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.|$|E

5|$|On August 5, 1824, {{the pirate}} and a {{skeleton}} crew captured the sloop María {{off the coast}} of Guayama as she completed a run between Guayanilla and Ponce under the command of Juan Camino. After boarding the ship they decided not to plunder her, since a larger craft was sailing towards them. The pirates fled west, intercepting a second sloop (La Voladora) off Morillos. Cofresí did not plunder her either, instead requesting information from captain Rafael Mola. That month a ship commanded by the pirates stalked the port of Fajardo, taking advantage of the lack of gunboats capable of pursuing their shallow-draft vessels. Shortly afterwards, the United States ordered captain Charles Boarman of the USS Weasel to monitor the western waters of Puerto Rico as part of an <b>international</b> <b>force.</b> The schooner located a sloop commanded by the pirates off Culebra, but it fled to Vieques and ran inland into dense vegetation; Boarman could only recover the ship.|$|E
5|$|The former-Portuguese {{colony of}} East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, however, {{following}} years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie subsequently {{agreed to allow}} the East Timorese to vote on autonomy in 1999. The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct the vote, which {{was held at the}} end of August 1999 and resulted with 78.5% of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro-Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed, while perhaps more than 500,000 were displaced. Unable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to UNAMET, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the <b>International</b> <b>Force</b> for East Timor (INTERFET), a non-UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions. The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5,500 personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{years were}} {{busy with the}} unit {{creating}} a structure and recruiting members suitable for commando training, while conducting sub-unit and unit training activities. B Company was raised in 1997, followed by C Company in 1999, both of which took 24 months to reach full maturity. A small team from 4 RAR (Cdo) deployed to East Timor {{as part of the}} <b>International</b> <b>Force</b> for East Timor (INTERFET) in September 1999 providing close personal protection for the media and also as interpreters in the initial months. In 2000, elements were involved in the evacuation of Australian nationals from the Solomon Islands in June. While later that year, 4 RAR (Cdo) assisted with counter-terrorism at the Sydney Olympic Games as part of Joint Task Force 114, with C Company on standby as a response force such as providing a cordon around an incident site in support of the SASR. In 2000, it was decided that the counter terrorist role should remain with the SASR. A period of rapid capability development, equipment acquisition and training subsequently followed. The unit that was developed as a result is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad, and has conducted operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also been awarded a number of citations for bravery and meritorious service.|$|E
50|$|In April 2007, {{more than}} 1,000 <b>international</b> <b>forces</b> {{took part in}} Operation Silver, with the {{objective}} of relieving Sangin. NATO gave advance warning of the coming assault by dropping leaflets, and through the town elders, who were charged with spreading the word.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} was to contain the offensive of the invading forces at the border {{for at least three}} months, while waiting for the arrival of <b>international</b> <b>forces,</b> similar to the police action by <b>international</b> intervention <b>forces</b> under the directive of United Nations during the war on Korean peninsula. However, the conventional strategy under the concept of total war was undermined by the lack of appropriate command and control system, proper logistical support structure, sound economic bases and efficient civil defence organisations.|$|R
25|$|French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) Mirage 2000Ds later {{served with}} the <b>International</b> Security Assistance <b>Force</b> during the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan in 2001–2002, operating in close conjunction with <b>international</b> <b>forces</b> and performing precision attacks with laser-guided bombs. In the summer of 2007, after the Dassault Rafale fighters {{had been removed from}} the theater of operations, three French Mirage 2000s were deployed to Afghanistan in support of NATO troops.|$|R
5|$|The overall British {{operation}} was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic sanctions, were exerted on Liberia—which had supported the RUF {{in exchange for}} conflict diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged the latter to enter the Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an <b>international</b> <b>force,</b> the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued {{to be involved in}} Sierra Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring of Sierra Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests were made by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The success of British operations in Sierra Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several European Union Battlegroups for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.|$|E
5|$|East Timor's {{ballot in}} favour of {{independence}} after 24 years of Indonesian occupation on 30 August 1999 resulted {{in a wave of}} violence by militia groups and pro-integration factions within the Indonesian military. 2, 3 and 5/7 RAR were subsequently deployed from 20 September 1999 as part of the UN-sanctioned <b>International</b> <b>Force</b> for East Timor (INTERFET), charged with restoring peace and overseeing the Indonesian departure. Despite minor clashes, including a contact at Motaain on the Indonesian border on 10 October 1999, control was quickly established and INTERFET handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in February 2000. At this time, 5/7 RAR become the first battalion of the regiment to serve under UN command since the Korean War. From 1999 to 2004, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/7, and 6 RAR would all serve in East Timor twice, giving the regiment a wealth of operational experience. One soldier was accidentally killed during these operations, while several more were wounded. Two years after being withdrawn, the deteriorating situation in the country—by then known as Timor Leste—again saw units of the regiment deployed to conduct stabilisation and security operations, this time under Operation Astute. In response to the initial crisis, 3 RAR was deployed along with special forces from 4 RAR (Commando) and the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in May 2006. It was replaced in early September by a combined Australian and New Zealand battle group based on 6 RAR, designated the ANZAC Battle Group. Subsequent rotations included elements of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8/9 RAR in the years that followed. After a phased drawdown, the last elements were withdrawn in 2013. Events in East Timor largely overshadowed developments in Solomon Islands, where elements of the regiment also served periodically from 2003 onwards. One member of the regiment died during operations in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{played a}} key role in the Australian-led {{international}} peacekeeping force (INTERFET) in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry at the airport and seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the <b>international</b> <b>force</b> during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from HMAS Brunei into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after the insertion of Navy Clearance Divers by submarine the previous night to conduct a reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site. It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.|$|E
5|$|During late 1999 No.75 Squadron {{was placed}} on alert to provide close air support and air defence to protect the <b>international</b> <b>forces</b> which had {{deployed}} to East Timor as part of INTERFET. However, despite {{the threat posed by}} Indonesian forces, ultimately they were not required.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s {{as part of}} the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (26th MEU) the {{battalion}} took part in Operation Joint Guard as part of IFOR (<b>International</b> <b>Forces</b> of Readiness) and then SFOR (Supplementary Forces of Readiness) while in the Balkans and their surrounding waters.|$|R
