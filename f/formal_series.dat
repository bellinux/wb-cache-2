5000|$|Generating {{functions}} are often expressed in closed form (rather {{than as a}} series), by some expression involving operations defined for <b>formal</b> <b>series.</b> These expressions {{in terms of the}} indeterminate x may involve arithmetic operations, differentiation with respect to x and composition with (i.e., substitution into) other generating functions; since these operations are also defined for functions, the result looks like a function of x.

However such interpretation is not required to be possible, because <b>formal</b> <b>series</b> are not required to give a convergent series when a nonzero numeric value is substituted for x. Also, not all expressions that are meaningful as functions of x are meaningful as expressions designating formal series; for example, negative and fractional powers of x are examples of functions that do not have a corresponding formal power series.|$|E
