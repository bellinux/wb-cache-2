5|$|At 1200UTC on October23, about 24hours before Wilma {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to the archipelago, the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. The <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many failed to fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through {{the region as a}} tropical storm. Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters, as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. As most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, hardware stores and food markets were generally well-stocked.|$|E

We develop {{a series of}} related theoretical linkages between partisan orientation, policy choice, and terrorist behavior to explain why <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left should {{be more likely to}} see higher numbers of terrorist attacks than govern-ments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right. We test our expectations using two different datasets; <b>the</b> Database <b>of</b> Political Institutions and the Party Manifesto data against the ITERATE terrorism dataset between the years 1975 and 1997. The results suggest that <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left {{are more likely to be}} <b>the</b> targets <b>of</b> terrorism than <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right and that the causal mechanisms behind this outcome might be context dependent...|$|R

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to Port-au-Prince.

When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the Dominican Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E
