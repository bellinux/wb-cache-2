50|$|The <b>Generalized</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Model</b> for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) {{is about}} {{statistical}} modelling and learning. GAMLSS {{is a modern}} distribution based approach to (semiparametric) regression analysis. A parametric distribution is assumed for the response (target) variable but the parameters of this distribution can vary according to explanatory variables using linear, nonlinear or smooth functions. In data science language GAMLSS is about supervised machine learning.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{though the}} Kolmogorov-Arnold {{representation}} theorem asserts {{the existence of}} a function of this form, it gives no mechanism whereby one could be constructed. Certain constructive proofs exist, but they tend to require highly complicated (i.e. fractal) functions, and thus are not suitable for modeling approaches. It is not clear that any step-wise (i.e. backfitting algorithm) approach could even approximate a solution. Therefore, the <b>Generalized</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Model</b> drops the outer sum, and demands instead that the function belong to a simpler class.|$|E
50|$|Backfit GAMs were {{originally}} {{provided by the}} `gam' function in S , now ported to the R language as the `gam' package. SAS proc GAM also provides backfit GAMs. The R recommended package for GAMs is `mgcv' (mixed gam computational vehicle) {{which is based on}} the reduced rank approach with automatic smoothing parameter selection. SAS proc GAMPL is an alternative implementation. There are many alternative packages. Examples include R package `mboost' implements a boosting approach, `gss' provides the full spline smoothing methods, `VGAM' provides vector GAMs, while package `gamlss' provides <b>Generalized</b> <b>additive</b> <b>model</b> for location, scale and shape. `BayesX' and its R interface provides GAMs and extensions via MCMC and penalized likelihood methods.

40|$|Logistic Regression {{has been}} widely used in the {{financial}} service industry for credit scoring models. Despite its advantages in easy interpretation and low computing cost, Logistic Regression is under the criticism of failure to model the nonlinear features of the predictors effect on the dependent variable and therefore might lead to unsatisfactory results. Modern statistical techniques such as Neural Network and Projection Pursuit Regression have been proven successful in the nonlinear modeling. However, this success comes {{with the price of}} interpretability. Introduced by Hastie and Tibshirani, <b>Generalized</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Model</b> provides the ability to detect the nonlinear patterns without sacrificing interpretability.

The modeling strategies for both Logistic Regression and <b>Generalized</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Model</b> with SAS/STAT are investigated to guide readers from Logistic Regression through <b>Generalized</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Model.</b> The comparison of predictive performance of the two modeling techniques shows the superiority of the <b>Generalized</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Model.</b> We hope that statistical analysts will be able to implement Generalize Additive Model with SAS/STAT in real business world by following the practical guidance outlined in this paper...|$|E

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the problem of criminal incident modeling formally, describes ST-GAM and LST-GAM in detail, and discusses how to estimate parameters as well as evaluate spatial prediction performance. Section 3 applies both ST-GAM and LST-GAM to model the breaking and entering incidents in Charlottesville, VA and evaluates the prediction performance.

30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the spatio-temporal <b>generalized</b> <b>additive</b> <b>model</b> (ST-GAM) and show its extension into the local spatio-temporal <b>generalized</b> <b>additive</b> <b>model</b> (LST-GAM) to predict criminal incidents. Both ST-GAM and LST-GAM can fully utilize {{many different types of}} data, such as spatial and temporal data, geographic data, demographic data, etc. ST-GAM can be easily estimated by available algorithms and has good interpretability. LST-GAM models the different criminal patterns based on different regions, and thus is more flexible than ST-GAM. We also showed that ST-GAM is a special case of LST-GAM. Methods to estimate LST-GAM are described in Section 2.4.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between concentrations of air pollutants and admissions for respiratory causes in children. METHODS Ecological time series study. Daily figures for hospital admissions of children aged < 6, and daily concentrations of air pollutants (PM 10, SO 2, NO 2, O 3 and CO) were analyzed in the Regi&# 227;o da Grande Vit&# 243;ria, ES, Southeastern Brazil, from January 2005 to December 2010. For statistical analysis, two techniques were combined: Poisson regression with generalized additive models and principal model component analysis. Those analysis techniques complemented each other and provided more significant estimates in the estimation of relative risk. The models were adjusted for temporal trend, seasonality, day of the week, meteorological factors and autocorrelation. In the final adjustment of the model, {{it was necessary to}} include models of the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (p, q) type in the residuals in order to eliminate the autocorrelation structures present in the components. RESULTS For every 10 : 49 &# 956;g/m 3 increase (interquartile range) in levels of the pollutant PM 10 there was a 3. 0 % increase in the relative risk estimated using the <b>generalized</b> <b>additive</b> <b>model</b> analysis of main components-seasonal autoregressive &# 8211; while in the usual <b>generalized</b> <b>additive</b> <b>model,</b> the estimate was 2. 0 %.
