25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field of obstetrics {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. <b>Gynaecology</b> directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Placental {{expulsion}} can {{be managed}} actively or it {{can be managed}} expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance.

In a joint statement, World Health Organization, the International Federation of <b>Gynaecology</b> and Obstetrics and the International Confederation of Midwives recommend active management of the third stage of labour in all vaginal deliveries to help to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
