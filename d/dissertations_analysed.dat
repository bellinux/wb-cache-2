40|$|Section 195 (1) (a) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 {{provides}} that, {{in public}} administration, {{a high standard}} of professional ethics must be promoted and maintained. The South African Police Service’s (SAPS) Code of Conduct (1997) provides that “the police service should work actively towards preventing any form of corruption and bringing those guilty of unethical conduct to justice”. The Service Integrity Framework of the SAPS Strategic Plan Document (2002 / 5) provides that “police officers {{should be encouraged to}} resist and expose any form of unethical conduct and to improve management and supervision thereof”. This means that the individual police officer should display a high level of professional ethics in the provision of safety and security to members of the public. However, according to the Independent Complaints Directorate’s (ICD) Annual Report (2003 / 4 : 8) “there is a rising level of unethical conduct amongst individual police officers nationally”. This <b>dissertation</b> aims to <b>analyse</b> the implementation of an ethical framework in the SAPS with specific reference to the Crime Prevention Unit (CPU) of the Johannesburg Central Police Station (JCPS). In this dissertation, both ethics and ethos are conceptualised as cornerstones of effective service delivery. The <b>dissertation</b> <b>analyses</b> the environmental conditions that affect the conduct and behaviour of individual police officers. It focuses on the impact of both internal and external environmental conditions on police officers during their provision of safety and security. The <b>dissertation</b> <b>analyses</b> the causes of negative work ethics and ethos among individual police officers. The <b>dissertation</b> <b>analyses</b> the manifestations of these negative work ethics and ethos in order to suggest effective comprehensive remedial strategies. This dissertation identifies instruments for the effective implementation of an ethical framework on the CPU of the JCPS and further assesses the efficacy of the existing constitutional institutions towards the effective implementation of an ethical framework in the CPU. Furthermore, this dissertation presents recommendations for the CPU of the JCPS to effectively implement its ethical framework. The enhancement of positive work ethics and ethos is critical for an effective service delivery. Dissertation (MAdmin (Public Administration)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Money {{laundering}} {{has been}} studied for many years, but mainly by lawyers and criminologists. This dissertation presents {{a number of ways}} on how an economist – mainly in a multidisciplinary fashion – can contribute to this field of research. This dissertation answers four important questions about money laundering: Why should we fight money laundering? How is money laundered? In which sectors is money laundered? And how can we fight money laundering? The literature mentions 25 effects of money laundering that can hurt or enrich our society. This <b>dissertation</b> <b>analyses</b> one of these effects, of which the conclusion is that anti-money laundering policy can not only reduce the amount of money laundering, but also crime in general. There are multiple ways to launder money. This <b>dissertation</b> <b>analyses</b> the behavior of money launderers that use the relatively new method of trade-based money laundering. Trade-based money laundering is a specific type of money laundering where import and export prices are falsified. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} money laundering flows can be explained with a model based on the gravity equation of Isaac Newton. Trade-based money laundering flows increase when the mass (measured in GDP) of a country increases and when the distance between the countries decrease. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that money launderers that want to send their money to countries that fiercely fight money laundering in the financial sector, use trade-based money laundering as an alternative. With the potential size of money laundering, all this laundered money should appear in certain sectors in our economy. The real estate sector with its size and money laundering possibilities is one of the potential candidates. This <b>dissertation</b> <b>analyses</b> the real estate sector and concludes that money laundering happens significantly more often with real estate that has the following properties: price fluctuations, the involvement of just-established companies and foreign owners of real estate. At the moment there is international policy that basically forces countries to fight money laundering. This dissertation shows that countries can pretend to fight money laundering, without actually doing it, because the effectiveness of their policy is measured with statistics that are not uniformly collected and have vague definitions. Therefore countries are able to produce high statistics without exerting any additional effort. This dissertation suggest an alternative audit policy...|$|R
