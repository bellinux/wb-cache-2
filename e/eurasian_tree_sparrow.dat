5|$|When the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> and {{the larger}} house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow {{generally}} breeds in urban areas while the smaller <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows {{may be found in}} settlements. In Australia, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer montanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} sparrow {{family with}} a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it {{is known as the}} tree sparrow, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} to the Philippines, mostly in the Mindanao and raises its tail to attract females. They are mostly black and white in color and normal in shape. It flies together/commonly with <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> and {{chestnut}} munias.|$|R
5|$|The iris is {{chestnut}} in colour. The legs of {{both sexes}} are pale brown to pinkish-brown. The flight of all sparrows is swift, {{and that of the}} russet sparrow is described as swifter and more direct than that of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Australia, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is present}} in Melbourne, towns in central and {{northern}} Victoria and some centres in the Riverina region of New South Wales. It is a prohibited species in Western Australia, where it often arrives on ships from Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet sparrow has been {{recorded}} as a captive bird, kept with the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow's</b> untidy nest {{is built}} in a natural cavity, a hole in a {{building}} or the large nest of a European magpie or white stork. The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} outside its native range, but has not always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> and white wagtail in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E
5|$|P. d. bactrianus Zarudny and Kudashev, 1916, {{described}} from Tashkent, {{is found}} in southern Kazakhstan to the Tian Shan and northern Iran and Afghanistan. It intergrades with persicus in Baluchistan and with indicus across central Afghanistan. Unlike most other house sparrow subspecies, it is almost entirely migratory, wintering in the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. It {{is found in}} open country rather than in settlements, which are occupied by the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> in its range. There is an exceptional record from Sudan.|$|E
500|$|In {{many aspects}} of its behaviour, the russet sparrow {{is similar to the}} house and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows.</b> Like them, it feeds on the ground, but spends most of its time {{perching}} on branches. Unlike those species, it prefers open, exposed branches for perching. The russet sparrow is described as shy and wary by some observers, but J. Denis Summers-Smith found it approachable in Indian hill stations. Flocking russet sparrows feed close to the ground, moving forward as birds from the rear of a flock move to the front, in what is called [...] "roller feeding".|$|R
50|$|On a paper {{report on}} the survey {{conducted}} on the island on 16-20 July 1990. A total of 18 species of birds representing 7 orders and 15 families have been identified and reported. The most common species observed were glossy swiftlets (Collocalia esculenta), white-collared kingfishers (Halcyon chloris), pied trillers (Lalage nigra), black-naped orioles (Oriolus chinensis), Philippine mapgie robins (Copsychus saularis), Malaysia fantails (Rhipidura javanica), white-breasted woodswallows (Artamus leucorhynchus), glossy starlings (Aplonis panayensis), yellow-breasted sunbirds (Nectarinia jugularis) and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer montanus). For {{the rest of the}} species either only one or two individuals were seen or only either calls were heard.|$|R

5|$|The male {{calls from}} near the nest site in spring to {{proclaim}} ownership and attract a mate. He may also carry nest material into the nest hole. The display and nest building is repeated in autumn. The preferred locations for the autumn display are old <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> nests, particularly those where nestlings had hatched. Empty nest boxes, and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds, such as tits, pied flycatchers or common redstarts, are rarely {{used for the}} autumn display.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> has no true song, but its vocalisations {{include an}} excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps {{are used in}} social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh teck. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> is {{widespread}} in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure {{that it is not}} endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow's</b> natural {{breeding}} range comprises most of temperate Europe and Asia south of about latitude 68°N (north of this the summers are too cold, with July average temperatures below 12°C) and through Southeast Asia to Java and Bali. It formerly bred in the Faroes, Malta and Gozo. In South Asia {{it is found}} mainly in the temperate zone. It is sedentary over most of its extensive range, but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for the winter, and small numbers leave southern Europe for North Africa and the Middle East. The eastern subspecies P. m. dilutus reaches coastal Pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern China in autumn.|$|R
5|$|This sparrow is {{distinctive}} {{even within}} its genus {{in that it}} has no plumage differences between the sexes; the juvenile also resembles the adult, although the colours tend to be duller. Its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages; the smaller size and brown, not grey, crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow. Adult and juvenile <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> undergo a slow complete moult in the autumn, and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat. The change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth, and a generally higher water content in the body.|$|R
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} are recognised, differing chiefly in the yellowness {{of their}} underparts. The subspecies rutilans and intensior breed {{in parts of}} eastern Asia, where they are usually found in light woodland, and the subspecies cinnamomeus breeds in the Himalayas, where it is usually associated with terrace cultivation. The russet sparrow is the typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where the house and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> are absent. In {{the southern part of}} its range, the russet sparrow prefers higher altitudes, but in the north it breeds by the sea. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages, and is depicted in Japanese art.|$|R
5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was first}} {{collected}} by Charles Darwin {{during the first}} stop of the second voyage of HMS Beagle at the island of Santiago (St. Iago). It was described for him in 1837 by zoologist John Gould, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, and given the name of Pyrgita iagoensis. By the time Gould wrote The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle with Darwin and three other zoologists in 1841, he had placed the Iago sparrow in the genus Passer, where it remains. The genus, among the sparrows of the Old World in the family Passeridae, also contains at least 20 other species, among them the house sparrow and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow,</b> an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow,</b> which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E

25|$|Winter {{populations of}} bald eagles are found along the Mississippi River around the Chain of Rocks Bridge. The city {{is on the}} Mississippi Flyway, used by {{migrating}} birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern US. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow,</b> an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. The city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species, including Tower Grove Park.|$|E
500|$|It tolerates {{a variety}} of climates, but prefers drier conditions, {{especially}} in moist tropical climates. It has several adaptations to dry areas, including a high salt tolerance {{and an ability to}} survive without water by ingesting berries. In most of eastern Asia, the house sparrow is entirely absent, replaced by the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow.</b> Where these two species overlap, the house sparrow is usually more common than the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow,</b> but one species may replace the other in a manner that ornithologist Maud Doria Haviland described as [...] "random, or even capricious". In most of its range, the house sparrow is extremely common, despite some declines, but in marginal habitats such as rainforest or mountain ranges, its distribution can be spotty.|$|E
500|$|The russet sparrow has {{usually been}} placed in the genus Passer, and within this genus {{it is seen as}} a part of the [...] "Palearctic black-bibbed sparrow" [...] group, which {{includes}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> as well as the house sparrow. It has generally been seen as a close relation of the house sparrow, and Richard Meinertzhagen even considered it to be the same species as the Somali sparrow, one of the house sparrow's closest relatives.|$|E
50|$|Sparrows are {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds, Passeridae. They are also known as true sparrows, or Old World sparrows, names also used for a particular genus of the family, Passer. They are distinct from both the American sparrows, in the family Emberizidae, and from a few other birds sharing their name, such as the Java sparrow of the family Estrildidae. Many species nest on buildings, and the house and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> in particular inhabit cities in large numbers, so sparrows {{are among the most}} familiar of all wild birds. They are primarily seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects. Some species scavenge for food around cities and, like gulls or rock doves, will happily eat virtually anything in small quantities.|$|R
5|$|The saxaul sparrow is less social {{than other}} sparrows while breeding, {{due to its}} dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks. Isolated pairs are usual, though it {{sometimes}} breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows.</b> The breeding season is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June. Unusually for a sparrow, {{it has not been}} recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack of published records. Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together. Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons. Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed. Nests may be quite close to the ground, especially when they are built in trees.|$|R
50|$|Sparrows may be {{the most}} {{familiar}} of all wild birds worldwide. Many sparrow species commonly live in agricultural areas, and for several, human settlements are a primary habitat. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>tree</b> and house <b>sparrows</b> are particularly specialised in living around humans and inhabit cities in large numbers. 17 of the 26 species recognised by the Handbook of the Birds of the World are known to nest on and feed around buildings.|$|R
