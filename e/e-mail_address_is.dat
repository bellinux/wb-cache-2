The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze frequency of usage of the inse-cure free {{e-mail services}} for professional communication among biomedical, economical and technical researchers, who published papers in one of three different journals: Croatian Medical Journal, Automatika and Economic Research. Methods Contact details of the authors who provided their <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> from the papers published in those three journals during one year period <b>were</b> collected. These <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>were</b> co-llected from the electronic archive of the journals in question.

40|$|Résumés are {{screened}} rapidly, {{with some}} reports stating that recruiters form their impressions within 10 seconds. Certain résumé characteristics {{can have a}} significant impact on the snap judgments these recruiters make. The main goal of the present study was to examine the effect of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> (formal vs. informal) used in a résumé on the hirability perceptions formed by professional recruiters (N= 73). In addition, the effect of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on hirability perceptions was compared to the effects of spelling errors and typeface. Participants assessed the cognitive ability, personality, and the hirability of six fictitious applicants for the job of an HR specialist. The hirability ratings for the résumés with informal <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>were</b> significantly lower than the hirability ratings for résumés that featured a formal <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> The effect of <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> <b>was</b> as strong as the effect of spelling errors and stronger than that of typeface. The effect of <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> on hirability <b>was</b> mediated by perceptions of conscientiousness and honesty-humility. This study among actual recruiters shows for the first time that the choice of the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> used on a résumé might make a real difference...|$|R
5000|$|Servers that accept all {{e-mail address}} at RCPT TO stage but reject invalid ones at DATA stage.

50|$|Later {{anonymous}} remailer designs, {{such as the}} Cypherpunk and Mixmaster designs, adopted more sophisticated techniques to try and overcome these vulnerabilities, {{including the use of}} encryption to prevent eavesdropping, and also the technique known as onion routing to allow the existence of pseudonymous remailers in which no record of a user's real <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> stored by the remailer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{non-standard}} but {{widely used}} way to request return receipts {{is with the}} [...] "Return-Receipt-To:" [...] (RRT) e-mail header.

5000|$|The {{reserved}} {{top-level domain}} [...]invalid is appended {{to ensure that}} a real <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> not inadvertently generated.

50|$|A {{directory}} harvest attack (DHA) is {{a technique}} used by spammers {{in an attempt to}} find valid/existent <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain by using brute force. The attack is usually carried out by way of a standard dictionary attack, where valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> found by brute force guessing valid <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> at a domain using different permutations of common usernames. These attacks are more effective for finding <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> of companies since they are likely to have a standard format for official e-mail aliases (i.e. jdoe@example.domain, johnd@example.domain, or johndoe@example.domain).|$|R
50|$|Another type of spamware is {{software}} used {{to search}} for <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> to build lists of <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> to <b>be</b> used either for spamming directly or {{to be sold to}} spammers.|$|R
