After the town became a hub of gold and silver mining, Basin's population peaked at about 1,500 in first decade of the 20th century but gradually declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
25|$|The type of <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> is {{important}} as well. Most {{of the large}} sea caves on the Western U.S. coast and Hawaii are in basalt, a strong <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> compared to sedimentary rock. Basaltic caves can penetrate far into cliffs {{where most of the}} surface erodes relatively slowly. In weaker rock, erosion along a weaker zone may not greatly outstrip that of the cliff face. However, the world's largest sea cave has formed in the heavily fractured Caversham sandstone (Barth, 2013) changing our understanding of which host rocks can form large sea caves.|$|E

25|$|Littoral caves may {{be found}} {{in a wide variety of}} host rocks, ranging from {{sedimentary}} to metamorphic to igneous, but caves in the latter tend to be larger due to the greater strength of the <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> However, there are some notable exceptions as discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{structures}} {{can also}} form by diagenesis or {{the formation of}} a soil (pedogenesis) when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a stylolite. Stylolites are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain chemical species producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of concretions. Concretions are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to small differences in composition or porosity of the <b>host</b> <b>rock,</b> such as around fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots. In carbonate based rocks such as limestone or chalk, chert or flint concretions are common, while terrestrial sandstones can have iron concretions. Calcite concretions in clay are called septarian concretions.|$|E
25|$|Elongate concretions form {{parallel}} to sedimentary strata {{and have been}} studied extensively due to the inferred influence of phreatic (saturated) zone groundwater flow direction on {{the orientation of the}} axis of elongation (e.g., Johnson, 1989; McBride et al., 1994; Mozley and Goodwin, 1995; Mozley and Davis, 2005). In addition to providing information about the orientation of past fluid flow in the <b>host</b> <b>rock,</b> elongate concretions can provide insight into local permeability trends (i.e., permeability correlation structure; Mozley and Davis, 1996), variation in groundwater velocity (Davis, 1999), and the types of geological features that influence flow.|$|E

25|$|Dolomite {{is used as}} an {{ornamental}} stone, {{a concrete}} aggregate, {{and a source of}} magnesium oxide, {{as well as in the}} Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} form a sea cave, the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> must first contain a weak zone. In {{metamorphic}} or igneous rock, this is typically either a fault as in the caves of the Channel Islands of California, or a dike as in the large sea caves of Kauai, Hawaii’s Na Pali Coast. In sedimentary rocks, {{this may be a}} bedding-plane parting or a contact between layers of different hardness. The latter may also occur in igneous rocks, such as in the caves on Santa Cruz Island, California, where waves have attacked the contact between the andesitic basalt and the agglomerate.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{temperature}} and pressure, and composition alter the mineralogy {{of a rock}} sample. Changes in composition {{can be caused by}} processes such as weathering or metasomatism (hydrothermal alteration). Changes {{in temperature}} and pressure occur when the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> undergoes tectonic or magmatic movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in thermodynamic conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the rock cycle. An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.|$|E

40|$|The East Carpathian {{volcanic}} arc {{is made up}} of two extrusive sectors {{separated by}} a subvolcanic zone. The East Carpathian Subvolcanic Zone (ECSZ) consists of calc^alkaline shallow intrusions (sills, laccoliths and dykes) emplaced in the Precambrian metamorphic basement or in its Paleogene cover during the Pannonian^Pontian time span. All intrusions contain enclaves of magmatic, metamorphic or sedimentary origin. The magmatic rocks in the ECSZ have been divided into three groups. Group I rocks are ubiquitous but occur only as mafic cognate enclaves showing cumulate features. Group II rocks (basaltic andesites, andesites, microdiorites and dacites) are the most widespread occurring both as enclaves and <b>host</b> <b>rocks.</b> Group III comprises only enclave-poor rhyolitic <b>host</b> <b>rocks.</b> Major and trace element analyses of both cognate enclaves and their <b>host</b> <b>rocks,</b> have been done in order to get information about the evolution of the magmas in the ECSZ. Microprobe analyses of the main mineralogical phases and microscopic investigation of the relationships between the enclaves and their <b>host</b> <b>rocks</b> have been used to decipher the processes that took place during magma differentiation. Differentiation trends and mineralogical composition of cognate enclaves and <b>host</b> <b>rocks</b> indicate that clinopyroxene and amphibole fractionation in mid-crustal magmatic chambers represented the most widespread evolutionary process in the study area. Xenolith assimilation, evidenced at microscopic scale, took place mostly by liquid^liquid and solid^liquid interdiffusion and locally may be quantitatively important. Mixing processes have been inferred for dacites and for garnet-bearing andesites...|$|R
25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} Cretaceous (roughly 81 to 74 million years ago), molten rock (magma) {{rose to the}} Earth's surface in and near what later became Jefferson County and {{eventually}} formed an intrusive body of granitic rock up to [...] thick and [...] in diameter. This body, known as the Boulder Batholith, extends from Helena to Butte, and is the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> for the many valuable ores mined in the region. As the granite cooled, it cracked, and hot solutions infiltrated the cracks to form mineral veins bearing gold and other metals. Millions of years later, weathering allowed gold in the veins to wash down to the gravels in Basin Creek, Cataract Creek, and the other creeks near Basin, {{as well as the}} Boulder River.|$|E

[...] The <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> of the garnet here is garnetiferous mica schist and the total percentage of garnet is not more than 7% to 10%, which makes the material extremely costly and non-economical to extract for non-gemstone applications.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main body}} of copper ore formed between two {{geological}} faults in broken dolomite rocks.

2500|$|The Garnet {{group is}} a key mineral in {{interpreting}} the genesis of many igneous and metamorphic rocks via geothermobarometry. Diffusion of elements is relatively slow in garnet compared to rates in many other minerals, and garnets are also relatively resistant to alteration. Hence, individual garnets commonly preserve compositional zonations {{that are used to}} interpret the temperature-time histories of the rocks in which they grew. Garnet grains that lack compositional zonation commonly [...] are interpreted as having been homogenized by diffusion, and the inferred homogenization also has implications for the temperature-time history of the <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E

The orientation of many of the pseudotachylite fault veins parallels a pre-existing set of mylonitic faults. These pseudotachylite fault veins most commonly occur in sub parallel southward dipping pairs and are accompanied by injection veins. If treated on a statistical basis, the vergence concept can be extended to injection veins to give the approximate movement direction of the fault system.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{radioactive}} waste management is to develop methods of radioactive waste containment that will eliminate any negative influence on {{the public and the}} environment. Since 1997 MosNPO "Radon " has been testing large diameter wells (LDW) as low and intermediate level waste (LILW) repositories, a new technique for the "Radon " system. In the case of LDW applications for LILW storage, the wastes are removed from the scope of human activity into a stable geological medium. Wastes are placed below the frost zone where damage to engineered barriers due to climatic factors is practically impossible. Construction of the repository by means of drilling prevents large disturbances of the <b>hosting</b> <b>rocks,</b> as happens during excavation work.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the colloid nature, concentration and size distribution in the pore water of Opalinus Clay and other sedimentary <b>host</b> <b>rocks</b> identified for a potential radioactive waste repository in Switzerland. Because colloids could not be measured in representative undisturbed porewater of these <b>host</b> <b>rocks,</b> predictive modelling {{based on data from}} field and laboratory studies is applied. This approach allowed estimating the nature, concentration and size distributions of the colloids in the pore water of these <b>host</b> <b>rocks.</b> As a result of field campaigns, groundwater colloid concentrations are investigated {{on the basis of their}} size distribution quantified experimentally using single particle counting techniques. The colloid properties are estimated considering data gained from analogue hydrogeochemical systems ranging from mylonite features in crystalline fissures to sedimentary formations. The colloid concentrations were analysed as a function of the alkaline and alkaline earth element concentrations. Laboratory batch results on clay colloid generation from compacted pellets in quasi-stagnant water are also reported. Experiments with colloids in batch containers indicate that the size distribution of a colloidal suspension evolves toward a common particle size distribution independently of initial conditions. The final suspension size distribution was found to be a function of the attachment factor of the colloids. Finally, calculations were performed using a novel colloid distribution model based on colloid generation, aggregation and sedimentation rates to predict under in-situ conditions what makes colloid concentrations and size distributions batch- or fracture-size dependent. The data presented so far are compared with the field and laboratory data. The colloid occurrence, stability and mobility have been evaluated for the water of the considered potential <b>host</b> <b>rocks.</b> In the pore water of the considered sedimentary <b>host</b> <b>rocks,</b> the clay colloid concentration is expected to be very low (< 1 ppb, for 10 – 100 nm) which restricts their relevance for radionuclide transport...|$|R
