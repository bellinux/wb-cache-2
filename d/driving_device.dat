40|$|The {{operation}} {{capabilities of}} robot in the amphibious environments (such as shallow water fields, surf zones, and beaches) {{are critical for}} military and civilian. In this paper, we introduce a novel amphibious robot with wheel-propeller-leg integrated <b>driving</b> <b>devices,</b> developed by Shenyang Institute of Automation, which can realize both crawling locomotion {{on the ground and}} swimming locomotion in the water without changing its <b>driving</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper describes the design of the overall robot structure, the design of the novel <b>driving</b> <b>devices,</b> and the design of the embedded control system, respectively.

50|$|The {{engineers}} of the Islamic world developed several {{solutions to}} achieve the maximum output from a water wheel. One solution was to mount them to piers of bridges {{to take advantage of}} the increased flow. Another solution was the shipmill, a type of water mill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream. This technique was employed along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in 10th-century Iraq, where large shipmills made of teak and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from corn every day for the granary in Baghdad. The flywheel mechanism, which is used to smooth out the delivery of power from a <b>driving</b> <b>device</b> to a driven machine, was invented by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038-1075) of Al-Andalus; he pioneered the use of the flywheel in the saqiya (chain pump) and noria. The engineers Al-Jazari in the 13th century and Taqi al-Din in the 16th century described many inventive water-raising machines in their technological treatises. They also employed water wheels to power a variety of devices, including various water clocks and automata.|$|E
5000|$|The Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (ENKA) was {{a member}} of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce's heavy {{industry}} division whose president at the time was Rento Hofstede Crull, the Dutch electrical pioneer who already had founded several companies. Hartogs and Hofstede Crull had become friends over the years; and Hartogs turned to him about the problem with the spinning devices. By May 1925, Hofstede Crull already had formulated a solution for the problem - <b>Driving</b> <b>Device</b> For A Centrifugal Spinning Machine and filed for patents in the Netherlands on May 6, 1925 and in the United States on May 3, 1926; thereafter it became fully patented in the United States on March 31, 1931 by the United States Patent office, (Patent No: 1,798,312; inventor R.W.H.H. Crull; by his international law firm, Marks & Clerk-Electric motor-INT SPINPOT EXPLOITATIE MIJ NV) [...] Thereafter, one of Hofstede Crull's companies, De Vijf and the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek formed a joint venture, De Internationale Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij(ISEM) to manufacture and market Hofstede Crull's machines. This solution in the mid twenties for the rayon manufacturing problem was the means for the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek to enter the American market with its subsidiary, the American Enka Company in 1928 and with its creation thereby simultaneously circumventing trade protectism (See AkzoNobel). Two years later, the American Enka Company would become a free standing one. With the death of Hofstede Crull in 1938, the ISEM was fully integrated with the AKU, the Algemene Kunstzijde Unie which had resulted when the German Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken merged with the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek in 1929.|$|E
5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the <b>driving</b> <b>device</b> {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|E
