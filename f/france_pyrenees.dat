50|$|After the Second World War {{the areas}} where Leiden {{students}} did their field work became more varied, and this meant also more variety in the collections brought to the Museum. In the first place may bementioned the Netherlands itself, which until the war had not attracted many students.

40|$|For Spain and <b>France,</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} active seismic zones. Seismic risk {{mitigation}} is then a priority in this area. In this context, European project SIPYR aimed at developing rapid response systems to help planning emergency interventions in case of major seismic crisis. One of the developed tools for seismic risk mitigation is seismic risk scenario to help evaluating consequences of a seism on a limited area. In this study, we will focus on the Luchon - Val d'Aran area, which constitutes one of the pilot zones of the project, chosen by its specific seismicity and its issue as a main touristic area. We present here the seismic risk scenario performed in this area through the three main steps of the study: local hazard calculation and mapping, vulnerability assesment, seismic risk scenario calculation...|$|E
