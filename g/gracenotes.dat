50|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of small pipes dating back to 15th century, in its current form it is perhaps the youngest bagpipe with any popularity, having only existed in this form since the early 1980s.

50|$|While {{standard}} practice in pipe bands {{is for the}} pipe section to perform the traditional or standard arrangements of the melodies, including <b>gracenotes,</b> drum scores are very often composed by the lead drummer of the band. In competition, one of the adjudicators grades a band on how creative their scores are and how well they fit the piping. This aspect of the judging is known as 'ensemble'.|$|E
50|$|Roxio and <b>Gracenote</b> {{signed an}} {{agreement}} making <b>Gracenote</b> the exclusive CD-recognition service for Roxio's software. In this way, Roxio was able to maintain access to the CDDB that they (and their customers) had relied on, while <b>Gracenote</b> was able to maintain access to their customer-base through Roxio without having to compete with free online databases.|$|R

Lawsuit is about <b>Gracenote's</b> CD recognition system; Roxio/Adaptec has used the technology in its Easy CD Creator and has paid all the licensing fees as they were supposed to, but now they didn't continue their contract that expired 22nd of April with <b>Gracenote</b> and have plans to use similar open-source database called FreeDB.org. <b>Gracenote</b> says that FreeDB, and therefore also Roxio, violates its patents and trademarks.|$|R
50|$|Most pibroch are {{commonly}} {{assumed to have}} been written during the 16th to 18th centuries. The entire repertoire comprises approximately 300 tunes. In many cases the composer is unknown, however pibroch continues to be composed {{up to the present}} day. Recent research suggests that the style of ornamentation in pibroch points to earlier origins in wire-strung Gaelic harp music, in particular the use of rapid descending arpeggios as <b>gracenotes.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Though Leopold Mozart {{did not use}} {{the term}} Schleifer in his Gründliche Violinschule (1756), his {{description}} and musical examples indicated that the slide could be used as an elaboration of and ascending or descending appoggiaturas: [...] "It is frequently the custom to make the ascending appoggiatura from the third below, even if it should appear to flow from the neighbouring note. But in such cases one makes it mostly with two notes. ... To the passing appoggiature belong also those improvised ornamentations which I will call [...] and [...] and falling intermediate <b>gracenotes.</b> They occur between the appoggiatura and the principal note, descending quite smoothly from the appoggiatura to the principal note." ...|$|E
50|$|Music {{information}} company <b>Gracenote</b> {{changed its}} database terms to closed-source in 2001. This caused some controversy because <b>Gracenote's</b> ancestor, CDDB, had previously said its database was released under the GPL.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly CDDB (Compact Disc Data Base), <b>Gracenote</b> {{maintains}} and licenses an Internet-accessible database containing {{information about}} the contents of audio compact discs and vinyl records. It provides software and metadata to businesses which enables their customers to manage and search digital media. <b>Gracenote</b> provides its media management technology and global media database of digital entertainment information to the mobile, automobile, portable, home, and PC markets. Several software applications which were capable of playing CDs (i.e.; Media Go and iTunes,) used <b>Gracenote's</b> CDDB technology. Winamp, once a major licensee, no longer has access to Gracenote; the legacy media player program lost access to <b>Gracenote</b> when SHOUTcast and Winamp were sold by AOL in 2014. Redevelopment of Winamp continues by its new owner Radionomy who have said future Winamp versions {{will have access to}} an online music database.

50|$|In bagpipe music {{there is}} {{extensive}} use of grace notes. Indeed, because the chanter is not tongued but supplied by a continuous air source from the bag, grace notes are sometimes {{the only way to}} differentiate between notes. For example, inserting a grace note between two crotchets (quarter notes) played at the same pitch {{is the only way to}} indicate them as opposed to them sounding like a single minim (half note). Various multiple grace note ornaments are formalised into distinct types, such as doublings, throws, and birls. A single grace note is played on the beat as is the first grace note of a complex ornament such as a doubling. Some complex ornaments, such as taorluath can be played starting or ending on the beat. <b>Gracenotes</b> are typically played as short as possible by lifting the fingers quickly and a short distance off the chanter.|$|E
5000|$|The single type of [...] "trì-lugh" [...] is {{composed}} of three [...] "low A"s graced by [...] "G", [...] "D" [...] and [...] "E" [...] <b>gracenotes,</b> and it precedes the note embellished. An {{example of this is}} [...] "hininindo", the syllable [...] "do" [...] being [...] "C" [...] graced by [...] "D". This type is called [...] "fosgailte" [...] (open), and is opposed by the double or closed form, represented by such a form as [...] "hindirinto". The latter is called [...] "a-steach" [...] (inside), which is taken to a type like [...] "hodorito", which is said to be [...] "a-mach" [...] (outside), as the grips are taken from the note played. The types last named are also [...] "breabach" [...] (kicking) forms, having a [...] "kick” note at the finish. The [...] "crùn-lugh" [...] or [...] "ceithir-lugh" [...] forms are also [...] "fosgailte", [...] "a-mach" [...] and [...] "a-steach". The word [...] "hadatri" [...] is [...] "a-steach" [...] when opposed to [...] "hadatri" [...] which is [...] "a-mach".|$|E
50|$|The first {{reference}} to the instrument in Ireland is provided by John O'Keefe in (1760) {{as an instrument of}} polite society and the emerging 'Pastoral' and prototype Union pipe influenced the folk tradition of the 18th and 19th century in Scotland and Ireland. This {{can be thought of as}} a shared tradition which served a Neo-baroque orchestral and concert fashion but also drew strongly on the ‘native traditions’ of both Scotland and Ireland and the music styles of the times.The pastoral pipes can be played either standing or in a seated position using a set of bellows, and the chanter is similar to the later Union pipes, but it had an added foot joint that extended its range one tone lower. This added foot joint had holes in its sides in addition to the hole at the bottom of the bore. The pastoral pipes are like the Highland pipes in that the sound is continuous; notes are articulated by finger techniques such as <b>gracenotes.</b> The Union pipes, which evolved from the pastoral pipes, enable the player to interrupt the flow of air by stopping the end of the chanter on his knee; this doesn't work for the Pastoral instrument because of the side tone holes. Many later Pastoral sets, though, have a dismountable foot joint; when this is removed they can be played as union pipes. The surviving instruments indicate that the Pastoral pipes had two or three drones and generally one regulator.|$|E
