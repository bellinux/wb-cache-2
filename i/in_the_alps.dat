5|$|Although P. rebeli {{is found}} across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is {{difficult}} to determine exactly where they inhabit because of their similarity with P. alcon. In Western Europe they are thought to be concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> and in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>alps</b> since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can be identified.

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world.

No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E

5|$|In Southern Europe, wolf {{extermination}} was not {{as complete}} as in Northern Europe, because of greater cultural tolerance of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th-century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour {{returned}} to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs {{officers and the}} delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted. During the stage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> Émile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification. Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead. In the seventh stage, Marcel Cadolle, {{at that time in}} second place, fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.|$|E

5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps.</b> To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (chalky) and moraine. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alps.</b> The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
