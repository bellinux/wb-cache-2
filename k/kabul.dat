5|$|From Rahim Khan, Amir {{learns that}} Ali {{was killed by}} a land mine and that Hassan and his wife were killed after Hassan refused to allow the Taliban to {{confiscate}} Baba and Amir's house in <b>Kabul.</b> Rahim Khan further reveals that Ali, being sterile, was not Hassan's biological father. Hassan was actually Baba's son and Amir's half-brother. Finally, he tells Amir that the reason he called Amir to Pakistan was to rescue Sohrab, Hassan's son, from an orphanage in <b>Kabul.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Afghanistan {{was seen}} as an {{important}} buffer state to the north-west of British-ruled India. In 1866 Sher Ali Khan came to power and was initially well disposed towards Britain. During the next 10 years, {{relations between the two countries}} deteriorated, primarily over the issue of Russian encroachment on Afghanistan. In 1878, Sher Ali reluctantly allowed a Russian mission to <b>Kabul,</b> and refused entry to the Viceroy Lord Lytton. After this refusal, Britain sent him an ultimatum that demanded a British envoy be accepted into Afghanistan; when this was ignored, Britain sent in three columns of British troops. The three British columns proceeded over the Bolan Pass to Kandahar, the Khyber Pass to Ali Masjid and through the Kurram Valley to <b>Kabul.</b> After several large victories for the British in 1878, fighting continued in the harsh mountainous terrain through the early months of 1879. As the British marched on <b>Kabul,</b> Sher Ali fled, leaving Yakub Khan to sign the Treaty of Gandamak on 26 May 1879 which required a British envoy in <b>Kabul</b> and the relinquishing of foreign affairs to the British. When the Afghan army mutinied in late 1879, Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts launched punitive actions and he occupied <b>Kabul</b> on 6 October 1879. After a popular uprising in December, Roberts withdrew to Sherpur where they were besieged for three weeks before launching a major attack on 2223 December where they returned to <b>Kabul</b> and occupied it once again. Abdur Rahman Khan was instated as Emir in July 1880 but Ayub Khan led a rebel force which defeated the British at the Battle of Maiwand and besieged Kandahar. Roberts led a force from <b>Kabul</b> to Kandahar that defeated the rebels at the Battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. British forces withdrew in 1887 after Abdur Khan confirmed the initial Treaty of Gandamak and Britain's control over foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{consequently}} {{founded the}} Basej-e Milli (National Movement), {{also known as}} Afghanistan Green Trend, a political movement which has successfully established itself in Afghanistan.

5|$|Civilian deaths {{caused by}} allied {{operations}} had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban, who {{were allowed to}} move into the Quam. The residents may have been further dismayed by the failure of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to address the concerns of a delegation of elders and maliks in <b>Kabul</b> two days previously.|$|E

5|$|Hafizullah Amin {{was born}} to a Ghilzai Pashtun family in Paghman on 1 August 1929. His father, a civil servant, {{died when he was}} still very young. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both primary and {{secondary}} school, which in turn allowed him to attend <b>Kabul</b> University (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the Darul Mualimeen Teachers College in <b>Kabul,</b> and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious Avesina High School, and in 1957 left Afghanistan for Columbia University in New York City, where he earned M. A. in education. It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to Marxism, and in 1958 he {{became a member of the}} university's Socialist Progressive Club. When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at <b>Kabul</b> University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School. During this period Amin became acquainted with Nur Muhammad Taraki, a communist. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School in order to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} in Kamari, a village close to <b>Kabul.</b> He {{attended}} Nejat High School, a German-speaking school, and graduated from it in 1948, and applied to enter the Faculty of Law and Political Science of <b>Kabul</b> University. Karmal's application was turned down because of his student union activities. He studied at the College of Law and Political Science at <b>Kabul</b> University from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 Karmal was arrested because of his student union activities, but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by Muhammad Daoud Khan. Shortly after, in 1957, Karmal found work as an English and German translator, before quitting and leaving for military training. Karmal graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960, and in 1961, he found work as an employee in the Compilation and Translation Department of the Ministry of Education. From 1961 to 1963 {{he worked in the}} Ministry of Planning. When his mother died, Karmal left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else. His father disowned him because of his leftist views. Karmal was involved in much , which was controversial in the mostly conservative Afghan society.|$|E
5|$|Nur Muhammad Taraki (15 July 1917 – 8 or 9 October 1979) was an Afghan statesman {{during the}} Cold War. Taraki was born near <b>Kabul</b> and educated at <b>Kabul</b> University, {{after which he}} started his {{political}} career as a journalist. He later {{became one of the}} founding members of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) and was elected as the party's general secretary at its first congress. He ran as a candidate in the 1965 Afghan parliamentary election but failed to secure himself a seat. In 1966 he published the first issue of Khalq, a party newspaper, but it was closed down shortly afterwards by the Afghan Government. The assassination of Mir Akbar Khyber led Taraki, along with Hafizullah Amin (the organiser of the revolution) and Babrak Karmal, to initiate the Saur Revolution and establish the communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December 2013, Captain Richard Holloway {{was serving}} with the SBS {{when he was}} killed by Taliban small arms fire while {{conducting}} an operation to suppress the Taliban in a joint SBS-Afghan forces raid (with air support) on Taliban insurgents in a valley east of <b>Kabul</b> ahead of the Afghanistan elections.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, revolutionary unrest increased in India. Some Hindu and Muslim leaders secretly left to seek {{the help of the}} Central Powers in fomenting revolution. The pan-Islamic movement in India, particularly the Darul Uloom Deoband, made plans for an insurrection in the North-West Frontier Province, with support from Afghanistan and the Central Powers. Mahmud al Hasan, the principal of the Deobandi school, left India to seek the help of Galib Pasha, the Turkish governor of Hijaz, while another Deoband leader, Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi, travelled to <b>Kabul</b> to seek the support of the Emir of Afghanistan. They initially planned to raise an Islamic army headquartered at Medina, with an Indian contingent at <b>Kabul.</b> Mahmud al Hasan was to command this army. While at <b>Kabul,</b> Maulana {{came to the conclusion that}} focusing on the Indian Freedom Movement would best serve the pan-Islamic cause. Ubaidullah proposed to the Afghan Emir that he declare war against Britain. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was also involved in the movement prior to his arrest in 1916.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events that {{followed}} {{the passage of the}} Rowlatt Act were influenced by the conspiracy. At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India. The Ghadar Conspiracy of 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still garnering public attention. News was also beginning to reach India of the Indian Voluntary Corps who, influenced by Ghadarites, fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate. Mahendra Pratap was shadowed by British agents—among them Frederick Marshman Bailey—during his journeys to and from Germany and Bolshevik Russia. The Third Anglo-Afghan war began in 1919 in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah, in a system blatantly influenced by the <b>Kabul</b> mission. When news of the outbreak of war reached Pratap in Berlin, he returned to <b>Kabul,</b> using air transport provided by Germany.|$|E
5|$|Abdullah is an Afghan {{growing up}} in the fictional village of Shadbagh.

Following his wife's death, Abdullah is diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is later unable to remember his sister after being reunited with her.|$|E
5|$|Bahadur Shah (—) (14 October 1643–27 February 1712), {{the seventh}} Mughal emperor of India, ruled from 1707 {{until his death}} in 1712. In his youth, he conspired to {{overthrow}} his father and ascend to the throne a number of times. Shah's plans were intercepted by the emperor, who imprisoned him several times. From 1696 to 1707, he was governor of Akbarabad (later known as Agra), <b>Kabul</b> and Lahore.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the Taliban from power in <b>Kabul,</b> by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|ISAF was {{initially}} charged with securing <b>Kabul</b> and surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, {{so as to}} allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Thomas is an Australian citizen. On 23 March 2001 he left Australia and {{travelled}} by air to Pakistan, crossing into Afghanistan by land. For {{the next}} three months, he was alleged to have trained at the Al Farouq training camp {{near the city of}} Kandahar, before travelling to <b>Kabul</b> in July 2001. Over the next eighteen months or so, Thomas stayed in various Al Qaeda safe houses, and is alleged to have made contact with several Al Qaeda officials.|$|E

Parts {{of the conspiracy}} included efforts to subvert the British Indian Army in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Political {{events and}} {{progress}} attained during December 1915 allowed {{the mission to}} celebrate at <b>Kabul</b> on Christmas Day with wine and cognac {{left behind by the}} Durand mission forty years previously, which Habibullah lay at their disposal. These events included the foundation of the Provisional Government of India that month and a shift from the Emir's usual aversive stance to an offer of discussions on a German-Afghan treaty of friendship.|$|E
5|$|Tariq, {{an ethnic}} Pashtun born in 1976, {{is a boy}} {{who grew up in}} <b>Kabul</b> with Laila. He lost a leg to a land mine at the age of five.

5|$|The Kite Runner is {{the first}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2003 by Riverhead Books, it {{tells the story of}} Amir, a young boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan {{district}} of <b>Kabul,</b> whose closest friend is Hassan. The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention, the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, {{and the rise of the}} Taliban regime.|$|E
5|$|Under Mohammad Daoud Khan's prime ministership, {{suppression}} of radicals was common. However, {{because of his}} language skills, Taraki {{was sent to the}} Afghan Embassy in the United States in 1952. Within several months Taraki began denouncing the Afghan government under King Zahir Shah and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of the Afghan government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavorable attention from authorities back home, who relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated but stopped short of placing him under arrest. After a short period of unemployment Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission in <b>Kabul</b> as an interpreter. He quit that job in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy in <b>Kabul,</b> but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.|$|E
5|$|With the {{partitions}} of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century, vast {{markets in}} Russia and Central Asia opened to Polish cochineal, which became an export product againthis time, to the East. In the 19th century, Bukhara, Uzbekistan, became the principal Polish cochineal trading center in Central Asia; from there the dye was shipped to Kashgar in Xinjiang, and <b>Kabul</b> and Herat in Afghanistan. It is possible that the Polish dye was used to manufacture some of the famous oriental rugs.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, Laila {{gives birth to}} Zalmai, Rasheed's son. The Taliban has risen to power and imposed harsh rules on the Afghan population, prohibiting women from {{appearing}} in public without a male relative. There is a drought, and living conditions in <b>Kabul</b> become poor. Rasheed's workshop burns down, and he is forced to take jobs {{for which he is}} ill-suited. He sends Aziza to an orphanage. Laila endures a number of beatings from the Taliban when caught alone on the streets in attempts to visit her daughter.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from her injuries, Laila discovers {{that she is}} pregnant with Tariq's child. After being informed by Abdul Sharif that Tariq has died, she agrees to marry Rasheed, a man eager to have a young and attractive second wife in hopes of having a son with her. When Laila gives birth to a daughter, Aziza, Rasheed is displeased and suspicious. This results in him becoming abusive towards Laila. Mariam and Laila eventually become confidants and best friends. They plan {{to run away from}} Rasheed and leave <b>Kabul</b> but are caught at the bus station. Rasheed beats them and deprives them of water for several days, almost killing Aziza.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Taliban, Laila and Tariq return to Afghanistan. They stop in the village where Mariam was raised, and {{discover}} a package that Mariam's father left behind for her: a videotape of Pinocchio, a small sack of money, and a letter. Laila reads the letter and discovers that Jalil had regretted sending Mariam away. Laila and Tariq return to <b>Kabul</b> and use the money to fix up the orphanage, where Laila starts working as a teacher. Laila is pregnant with her third child, and if it is a girl, Laila has already named her Mariam.|$|E
5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in <b>Kabul,</b> an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E
5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside <b>Kabul.</b> The older one, who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed {{the foundation of the}} relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile action from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in <b>Kabul</b> in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) and Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East, British {{counter-intelligence}} {{was directed}} at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy {{in the face of}} Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort {{was directed at}} intercepting the <b>Kabul</b> Mission. The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan, and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916.|$|E
5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from <b>Kabul</b> who is thirty-years her senior. In <b>Kabul,</b> Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E
