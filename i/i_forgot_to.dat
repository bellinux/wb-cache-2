500|$|Reagan {{assumed the}} role of {{unofficial}} [...] "protector" [...] for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen [...] "emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this – with my husband in it." [...] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, [...] "Honey, <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, I decided I was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} Robert Dudley was short {{of money and}} he and Amy were helped out financially by their families. Their {{lifestyle}} had to remain modest, though, and Lord Robert (as he was known) was heaping up considerable debts. Sir John Robsart died in 1554; his wife {{followed him to the}} grave in the spring of 1557, which meant that the Dudleys could inherit the Robsart estate with the Queen's permission. Lady Amy's ancestral manor house of Syderstone had been uninhabitable for many decades, and the couple were now living in Throcking, Hertfordshire, at the house of William Hyde, when not in London. In August 1557 Robert Dudley went to fight for Philip II of Spain (who was then Mary I's husband) at the Battle of St. Quentin in France. From this time a business letter from Amy Dudley survives, settling some debts of her husband's in his absence, [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> move my lord thereof before his departing, he being sore troubled with weighty affairs, and I not being altogether in quiet for his sudden departing".|$|E

500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in the wallet, and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic blood pressure was 60 versus the normal 140, indicating {{that he was in}} shock, and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, tetanus toxoid, and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E

2500|$|The match {{ended in}} an upset, with Dempsey losing his title on points in 10 rounds. Attendance for this fight {{was a record}} 120,557, the largest {{attendance}} ever for a sporting event outside motor racing and soccer. When the defeated Dempsey returned to his dressing room, he explained his loss to his wife by saying, [...] "Honey, <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> duck." [...] Fifty-five years later president Ronald Reagan borrowed this quote when his wife Nancy visited him {{in the emergency room}} after the attempt on his life.|$|E

Reubens responded with, [...] "Ha, that's so funny <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> laugh!" [...] Pee-wee appeared once more in 1992, when he participated in a Grand Ole Opry tribute to Minnie Pearl. Reubens then avoided interviews and according to a 1991 Rolling Stone article had indeed become weary of the character and wanted to explore new territory.|$|E

[...] As the {{audience}} chuckles slightly in anticipation, Fibber explains: [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> tell you, Molly, I straightened out the hall closet this morning!" [...] This was certainly {{not the end of}} the gag, though, as the closet soon became cluttered once again, leading to many more disasters.|$|E
