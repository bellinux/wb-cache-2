5|$|Michael is {{inspired}} by the fellow churchgoers and, following inappropriate comments {{from the rest of}} the office staff, angrily lashes out at them for being disrespectful. As the church's youth ministry—which is going to Mexico to <b>help</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> school—leave, Michael decides to go with them. The other employees try to talk him out of it, but Michael refuses. Just before they leave, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) boards the bus with him in an attempt to impress his ex-girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Both get cold feet 45 minutes into the trip, and force the bus to stop. They then have Erin drive them home.|$|E
5|$|The priory was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to <b>help</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups would eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.|$|E

5|$|G-Dragon {{has shown}} support for {{numerous}} charity organizations over the years, notably {{at the final}} concert of his world tour in 2013, a booth was erected, where fans could donate to build a fishery in Haiti, as a collaboration with YG Entertainment's With Campaign which he previously worked with to <b>help</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> school in Nepal. At the same event he and his fans from 14 different {{countries around the world}} donated a 9.9 tons rice, which was sent to help malnourished children, elderly living on their own, and other people in need. He's reportedly donated ₩81.8 million ($80,000 USD) every year on his birthday. G-Dragon donated ₩50 million ($43,400 USD) in 2011 (when fans donated under his name) and in 2012 (privately by himself) to Seoul National University Hospital to help children with diseases get treatment, it was revealed accidentally in 2017 as his name was engraved on a plaque honoring those who had contributed ₩100 million or more.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to <b>help</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

Chapin appeared in print advertisements where he was interviewed by John Bond, publisher of Road & Track and Car Life about product and corporate strategy to assure the success of AMC. Chapin continued making changes for the 1968 model year, and took the bold step to make air conditioning standard on all the AMC Ambassador models {{at a time when}} this comfort feature was still an option on the expensive Cadillac and Lincoln brand luxury vehicles.|$|E
25|$|After the 1930s, Dallas was {{controlled}} {{in all aspects}} by the Dallas Citizens Council, {{a group of about}} two hundred men who had both achieved unusual success in their careers and demonstrated an unusual willingness to work on projects they believed would <b>help</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> great city. In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought {{to make the best of}} it. The first step was the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided what to do, and the Biracial Committee helped get it done. They decided to prepare for school desegregation by desegregating the community bit by bit.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{lived in}} a caravan (trailer) with his mother, who insisted on {{accompanying}} him, while canvassing (selling Christian books). Ford was sent to <b>help</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new church in the coastal town of Coffs Harbour, NSW. In 1951, still {{in his first year}} of service as a pastor, he was sent to Newcastle, NSW, then an industrial city, to assist evangelist George Burnside. While Burnside was a dynamic presenter, Ford's biographer Milton Hook describes him as a fundamentalist (see: historic Adventism), and draws an analogy with a rugged, gung-ho cowboy, like a John Wayne character. Ford questioned him on some end-times interpretations, resulting in conflict between the pair – a sign of further things to come. Later he sold books in the Lake Macquarie and nearby Upper Hunter regions, which he found challenging work.|$|E
