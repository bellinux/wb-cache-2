40|$|Introduction Homeopathy is {{a system}} of {{therapeutics}} based on the Law of Similars where ‘like cures like’, using highly diluted substances that cause, in healthy persons, symptoms like those to be treated. Patients are prescribed for on an individual rather than diagnosis specific basis. This case report describes the progress of two siblings with multiple diagnoses (including ADHD), on multiple medications, receiving homeopathic treatment during one year. Multi-morbidity is a growing problem. Separate medicines are prescribed for each complaint resulting in polypharmacy, which is associated with increased incidence of adverse drug reactions. Methods The siblings received a variety of individualised homeopathic medicines, prescribed according to classical, clinical and isopathic methodologies. <b>DSMIV</b> ADHD total scores were measured every 4 months; and self-selected symptoms were measured using ‘Measure Your Own Medical Outcome Profile’ (MYMOP) during the 6 weekly consultations. Results Before treatment Sibling 1 ’s <b>DSMIV</b> total T score was 90 + (highest possible), MYMOP score was 5. 25. Sibling 2 ’s DMSM total T score was 86, MYMOP score was 5. 25. The siblings were on 8 medications each. After one year Sibling 1 ’s <b>DSMIV</b> total T score was 50 (normal range), MYMOP score 0. 25. Sibling 2 ’s <b>DSMIV</b> total T score was 53, MYMOP score 0. 00. Sibling 1 was not taking any conventional medications and sibling 2 was taking one medication. Conclusion Treatment by a homeopath employing a variety of homeopathic methodologies and medicines over 1 year was associated with improvements in ADHD status, patient generated outcomes, parent reported pathology and reduction in conventional medication. No causal conclusions on treatment efficacy can be derived, nor the effects of homeopathic medicines separated out from the reduction in conventional medicines. More systematic research is warranted to tease out these effects, and should document treatment by homeopaths as experienced in clinical practice to explore therapeutic potential...|$|E

Neuropsychiatric adverse events are associated with hepatitis C treatment and interferon alpha-induced major depressive disorder is commonly reported [2]. This study examined the rate and predictors of depression during interferon alpha plus ribavirin treatment in a Brighton, UK cohort of HCV-infected patients including a subsample with HIV coinfection. Depressive disorder was explored at baseline and monthly up to 6 months using the Structured Clinical Interview for <b>DSMIV</b> and the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression. Six month treatment response was determined using viral load assay (clearance achieved if HCV RNA&# 60; 400 IU/mL). A cohort of 237 HCV patients consented to participate in the study, including 38 coinfected with HIV. The HCV monoinfected group had a mean age of 45. 60 years (SD= 8. 93) and 64. 3 % were male. The HIV/HCV coinfected group had a mean age of 41. 34 (SD= 9. 8) and 94. 7 % were male. The most common mode of HCV transmission was intravenous drug use in both groups. Notably, clearance rates at 6 months were equivalent in both groups: 88. 3 % in the HCV group vs 86. 5 % in the coinfected group. Baseline <b>DSMIV</b> depressive disorder rates and mean HAMD scores were not significantly different between groups. For Hamilton depression scores over time, a significant multivariate effect was found [Wilks&#x 2019; Lambda=. 33, F (6, 203) = 67. 73, p&# 60;. 001, =. 67] with the co-infected group having lower scores. For the whole sample, post-hoc comparisons revealed that all depression scores after week 8 were significantly different from baseline scores and scores at week 4. Multiple regression analysis revealed <b>DSMIV</b> depressive disorder at week 4 was significantly predicted by baseline <b>DSMIV</b> depression (&#x 03 B 2;=. 30), past psychiatric history (&#x 03 B 2;=. 25), and not being coinfected (&#x 03 B 2;=&#x 2212;. 16).

Moross Centre. A total of 20 eating disorder patients between the age range of 13 and 29 years admitted to the Tara between the periods 1998 - 2004 were studied. Of the 20 patients, 5 black and 5 white patients with a <b>DSMIV</b> diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa were used; and 5 black and 5 white patients with a <b>DSMIV</b> diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa. Psychometric profiles of each patient were established through the use of the EDI (Eating Disorder Inventory) the BITE (Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh) and the BECK Depression Inventory.

40|$|Introduction. ADHD is {{a common}} and growing problem which manifests and is {{diagnosed}} via a cluster of behaviours such as inability to regulate emotions or manage motivational delay and problems with executive functioning. It frequently accompanies autism spectrum disorders and dyslexia. Homeopathy is a system of therapeutics based on the Law of Similars where ‘like cures like’. Conditions are treated by highly diluted substances that cause, in healthy persons, symptoms {{like those of the}} condition to be treated. The aim of this case report is to describe the homeopathic treatment and progress of one 16 year old youth with diagnoses of ADHD, Asperger’s syndrome and dyslexia subjected to in-utero cannabis exposure. Methods. The youth received individualised homeopathic medicines and additional ultra-molecular dilutions of cannabis. Outcome was measured using the parent completed Conner’s Parent Rating Scale – Revised – Long version (CPRS:R-L) every 4 months, with <b>DSMIV</b> total score selected for analysis; and Measure Your Own Medical Outcome Measure (MYMOP) every 6 weeks, completed by parent and patient. Results. At start of treatment the patient’s <b>DSMIV</b> total T score was 90 + (highest possible); after 18 months it was 59 (within normal range). MYMOP score at start of treatment was 4. 5 and 1. 75 after 18 months. Conclusion. Treatment by a homeopath over 1 ½ years was associated with improvements in ADHD status and patient generated outcomes. Ultra molecular dilutions of a recreational drug the patient was subjected to in-utero appear to have contributed to improvements.

40|$|There is now strong {{evidence}} that Neuregulin 1 (NRG 1) is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. NRG 1 mediates some of its effects through the tyrosine kinase receptor erbB 4, and analysis of gene knock-out animals suggests that the functional interaction of NRG 1 and erbB 4 mediates behaviors that may model {{some aspects of the}} schizophrenia phenotype in mice. Given these findings, we have sought evidence for association between schizophrenia and erbB 4. Mutation screening of erbB 4 in 14 <b>DSMIV</b> schizophrenics revealed 15 SNPs, none of which were nonsynonymous. Analysis of the allele frequencies of each SNP in pools of 368 <b>DSMIV</b> schizophrenics and 368 controls provided modest evidence for association with two of the SNPs, although individual genotyping in an extended sample of 680 cases did not confirm this. However, we did find evidence for a significant interaction between the NRG 1 "Icelandic" schizophrenia risk haplotype and erbB 4 (P = 0. 019). The NRG 1 and erbB 4 interacting marker was further genotyped in an independent sample of 290 cases and 634 controls from Dublin. Interaction between NRG 1 and erbB 4 remained significant in the combined sample of 970 cases and 1, 341 controls, OR = 2. 98 (CI: 1. 16 - 7. 64), P = 0. 01, although it only showed a trend in the Dublin sample alone (P = 0. 11, two tailed). Our data require independent replication, but tentatively suggest that NRG 1 may mediate its effects on schizophrenia susceptibility through functional interaction with erbB 4, and that genetic interaction between variants at the two loci increases susceptibility to schizophrenia...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{operational}} diagnostic {{systems have}} substantial limitations for lifetime diagnostic classification of bipolar spectrum disorders. Issues include: (1) It {{is difficult to}} operationalize the integration of diverse episodes of psychopathology, (2) Hierarchies lead to loss of information, (3) Boundaries between diagnostic categories are often arbitrary, (4) Boundaries between categories usually require a major element of subjective interpretation, (5) Available diagnostic categories are relatively unhelpful in distinguishing severity, (6) "Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) " categories are highly heterogeneous, (7) Subclinical cases are not accommodated usefully within the current diagnostic categories. This latter limitation is particularly pertinent {{in the context of}} the increasing evidence for the existence of a broader bipolar spectrum than has been acknowledged within existing classifications. Method We have developed a numerical rating system, the Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimension Scale, BADDS, that can be used as an adjunct to conventional best-estimate lifetime diagnostic procedures. The scale definitions were informed by (a) the current concepts of mood syndrome recognized within <b>DSMIV</b> and ICD 10, (b) the literature regarding severity of episodes, and (c) our own clinical experience. We undertook an iterative process in which we initially agreed scale definitions, piloted their use on sets of cases and made modifications to improve utility and reliability. Results BADDS has four dimensions, each rated as an integer on a 0 – 100 scale, that measure four key domains of lifetime psychopathology: Mania (M), Depression (D), Psychosis (P) and Incongruence (I). In our experience it is easy to learn, straightforward to use, has excellent inter-rater reliability and retains the key information required to make diagnoses according to <b>DSMIV</b> and ICD 10. Conclusions Use of BADDS as an adjunct to conventional categorical diagnosis provides a richer description of lifetime psychopathology that (a) can accommodate sub-clinical features, (b) discriminate between illness severity amongst individuals within a single conventional diagnostic category, and (c) demonstrate the similarity between the illness experience of individuals who have been classified into different disease categories but whose illnesses both fall near the boundaries between the two categories. BADDS may be useful for researchers and clinicians who are interested in description and classification of lifetime psychopathology of individuals with disorders lying on the bipolar spectrum. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The authors used proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopic imaging (1 H-MRSI) to assess potential reductions of N-acetylaspartate (a marker of neuronal integrity) in the hippocampal area and {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} of patients with schizophreniform disorder. In addition, they assessed the relationship between N-acetylaspartate levels and working memory deficits. Method: Twenty-four patients with <b>DSMIV</b> schizophreniform disorder and 24 healthy subjects were studied. Subjects underwent 1 H-MRSI and were given the N-back working memory test. Results: The schizophreniform disorder patients had selective reductions of Nacetylaspartate ratios in the hippocampal area and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and a positive correlation was seen between N-acetylaspartate ratios in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and performance during the 2 -back working memory condition. Conclusions: Similar to findings reported in schizophrenia studies, N-acetylaspartate reductions in the hippocampal area and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were seen in patients with schizophreniform disorder. Moreover, the results support other evidence that neuronal pathology in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex accounts for a proportion of working memory deficits already present at illness outset...|$|E

Early attention components include orienting and alerting, as well {{as executive}} control networks. Previous studies have shown mainly executive control deficits, while few of them found orienting and alerting abnormalities.

RESULTS: Patients showed an abnormal alerting effect and slower overall reaction time compared to controls. Moreover, there was an interaction between orienting and alerting: patients are helped more than controls by the alerting signal in a valid orientation to solve the incongruent condition. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that patients with schizophrenia have altered alerting abilities. However, the orienting and alerting cues interact to improve their attention performance in the resolution of conflict, creating possibilities for cognitive remediation strategies...|$|E

At our tertiary psychiatric hospital in South Africa, where standard Western teachings are followed, clinicians are often confronted by patients who have a markedly different interpretation of their psychiatric symptoms compared with the clinician’s perspective. For instance, “ifufunyane ” (plural “amafufunyana”), a ritualized”“possession state, ” often thought to result from witchcraft, is frequently reported by South African (Xhosa) patients with psychosis (including schizophrenia) and their families. This condition, which was not included as a culture-bound syndrome in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th edition, is characterized by a confused mental state 5 and was originally described as a self-contained “hysterical condition characterized by people speaking in a strange muffled voice in a language that cannot be understood (speaking in tongues), and strange and unpredictable behaviour. ” However, recent work suggests that “ifufunyane ” may cover a range of different disorders and phenomena including trance states (diagnosed in <b>DSMIV</b> as dissociativ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{patients}} with Alzheimer disease (AD) share clinical and histological features {{regardless of age}} of onset, the hypothesis that early onset AD constitutes a distinct subgroup prevails. Some authors suggest that early attention or language impairment con-stitute patterns of differentiation in terms of neuropsychological profile, between these groups. However, investigations are not consensual in terms of cognitive domains affected in each group. Aim: To investigate whether there is early neuropsychological difference between two types of AD using the conventional dividing line of 65 years. Methods:We evaluated the results obtained in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and in a com-prehensive neuropsychological battery – Battery of Lisbon for theAssessment of Dementia (BLAD), at a Dementia clinic in the University Hospital of Coimbra and a Memory Clinic. The study was developed in consecutive {{patients with}} a clinical probable diagnosis of mild to moderate AD, using standard criteria (<b>DSMIV</b> and NINCDS-ADRDA). Statistical analysis was performed using Qui-square and U-Mann–Whitney, for categorical and non-categorical variables. The degree of relation between variables, was measured using the coefficient of correlation r s de Spearman. Results:The total sample included 280 patients: 109 wit...|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper {{reports a}} study of the psychometric {{properties}} of the brief version of Lehman’s Quality of Life Interview (QoLI), an instrument which evaluates both subjective and objective components of quality of life. Method: One hundred and twenty eight patients who met <b>DSMIV</b> criteria for schizophrenia were evaluated with the brief QoLI in its French version. The internal structure of the QoLI was explored in terms of an analysis of items, {{a study of}} correlations between items and item dimensions, and a principal component analysis of the subjective and item dimensions, and a principal component analysis of the subjective and objective domains. The internal consistency of the scale was evaluated by Cronbach’s α. Results: The individual items all discriminated strongly between subjects. Items showed high correlations with the subscales of which they were part, and much lower correlations with the other subscales, confirming the relevance of the domains defined a priori, particularly for the subjective domains. Principle component analysis also strongly supported the separation between the different domains of quality of life. Analysis of internal consistency did not reveal items that could be dropped from the interview...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{specific}} {{sense of}} self and sensitivity to self-threatening situations among alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals has often been reported by clinicians. Unpleasant self-awareness of situations of personal failure may lead to relapse, especially for AD individuals with high self-consciousness. However, the implication of Higgins’ self-discrepancy theory for alcohol-dependence has not yet been empirically investigated. This study tested the relation between self-discrepancies evaluated by the Self-Discrepancy Questionnaire and different self-related dimensions (i. e., self-consciousness, depression, emotional regulations strategies) in alcohol-dependence. Methods: Forty-four AD inpatients (28 men) presenting with an Axis- 1 diagnosis of alcohol-dependence (<b>DSMIV)</b> and recruited during detoxification process completed Self-Discrepancy Questionnaire and others self-related questionnaires. Results: High self-discrepancies and associated distress were related to more negative affect, depression, abstract-analytical ruminations, and to lower adaptive emotion regulation strategies and higher alcohol craving and alcohol intake. Self-discrepancies and associated distress predicted alcohol intake but only in high selfconsciousness AD population. Conclusion: Self-discrepancies lead to discomfort and to emotional distress, which may results of more nonadaptive ruminations and less adaptive emotion regulation strategies. This unpleasant awareness of self-discrepancy predicted higher alcohol craving and alcohol intake. Two subpopulations were distinguished by the sensitivity to selfdiscrepancy according to their level of self-consciousness...|$|E
40|$|Blackground: Five {{percent of}} {{children}} and adolescents consults in mental health services in one year. Approximately one every ten children has a mental health problem. Aim To assess clinical and demographic factors {{of children and adolescents}} hospitalized by psychiatric cause in a university psychiatric clinic. Patients and Methods: Review of medical records of 167 subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 97 women, admitted to a Psychiatric Service in the period 2001 - 2004. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) manual of the World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians (WONCA) was used to classify admission complaints and symptoms and <b>DSMIV</b> to classify psychiatric disorders. Results: Mean hospital stay was 11 + 8 days. The main admission causes were suicidal attempts and psychomotor agitation/impulsive behavior in 54 % and 26 % of cases, respectively. The main psychiatric diagnoses were depressive disorder, suicide attempt and bipolar disorder. In 69 % of patients, the personality diagnosis was deferred. Only 25 % of families were considered functional. Conclusions: Affective disorders and suicidal behavior are the main psychiatric diagnoses at discharge in children and adolescents admitted to a psychiatric impatient servic...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{identifies}} {{the prevalence of}} emotional and behavioral problems and the associated factors in orphanage children. Methods. This cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} three private orphanages in Cairo. Two hundred sixty-five children of ages ranging from 6 to 12 years living in three different orphanages care systems were included in the study. A sociodemographic information form and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used. Children were clinically interviewed and psychiatric disorders were identified. Diagnoses were done according to the manual for diagnosis and statistics of mental disorder fourth version (<b>DSMIV).</b> A written formal consent from the director of social solidarity was obtained before inclusion in the study. Results. The prevalence of behavioral disturbances was 64. 53 % among those in institutional care and the most prominent psychiatric disorders were nocturnal enuresis (23. 3 %), attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) (19. 62 %), oppositional defiant disorder (17. 36 %). Age at first admission, causes of receiving institutional care, and moves 2 or more times between institutions were significantly associated with an increased risk of behavioral and emotional problems. Conclusion. Our study showed that children living in institutions are prone to suffer from psychiatric disorders. Stability of the caregiver acts as a protective variable...|$|E
40|$|Background: Suicide is {{the third}} cause of death among {{adolescents}} in United States and between 5 to 12 % of teenagers {{have a history of}} suicide attempt. Therefore, suicide is a public health problem in this age group. Aim: To compare the clinical characteristics of hospitalized adolescents who attempted suicide with those without a history of suicide attempt. Material and Methods: The clinical records of adolescents aged less than 18 years, hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic, were analyzed. Forty six patients aged 15 ± 2 years (72 % females) had a history of suicide attempt and were considered cases and 81 patients aged 15 ± 2 years (52 % females) did not have a history of suicide attempt and were considered controls. Demographical and clinical characteristics of both groups were compared. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (<b>DSMIV).</b> Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} groups in the length of hospital stay. The most common psychiatric diagnosis was depressive disorder, found in 71 and 35 % of suicide and non-suicide attempters, respectively (p < 0. 01). Personality diagnosis was deferred in most studied cases. Conclusions: Depression is more common among hospitalized adolescents who attempt suicide...|$|E
40|$|Microduplication of the 22 q 11. 2 {{chromosomal}} region {{has been recognized}} since 1999 and {{has been associated with}} a highly variable phenotype. Neurodevelopmental impairment and behavioural problems are very common in patients with 22 q 11. 2 duplication. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have previously been reported in only two patients with 22 q 11. 2 duplication and striking dysmorphic features. We report here on a 4 -year-old male of healthy consanguineous parents presenting with ASD according to <b>DSMIV,</b> revised, criteria as a primary manifestation. The child walked at 16 months and started to say one word and some sounds. Parents noticed a subsequent developmental arrest. At 4 years his functional development age, evaluated by the Psychoeducational Profile, was roughly 6 months. Mild non-specific facial dysmorphism was noted. Genetic analyses of the child demonstrated a de novo microduplication of the 22 q 11. 2 {{chromosomal region}}. This genetic anomaly was best seen in interphases of blood lymphocytes and in buccal smear nuclei. Our case illustrates once again the clinical heterogeneity of the 22 q 11. 2 duplication as well as the wide genetic complexity of ASD. We suggest that genetic evaluation of ASD should include fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis of the 22 q 11. 2 chromosomal region...|$|E
