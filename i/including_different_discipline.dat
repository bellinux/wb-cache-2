40|$|Applied {{research}} in complex integrated settings {{should be recognized}} as an endeavor that requires transdisciplinary and multisectoral stakeholder interactions. The problems faced in society are quite complex, requiring participation and knowledge from diverse aspects of society, <b>including</b> <b>different</b> <b>disciplines</b> (academia), communities, civil society, and government. Successful applied research relies on nurturing these key stakeholder relationships and interactions. This paper explores the key challenges of stakeholder interaction in applied {{research in}} three disciplines in the South African context, based on literature {{and the experience of}} authors in their disciplines. The three disciplines include information and communication technology for development, town and regional planning, and natural resource management. We attempt to also compare and contrast these challenges across the disciplines, to identify any commonalities and differences. After considering the mutual challenges and adaptive solutions to address these challenges in the <b>different</b> <b>disciplines,</b> we identify that all three areas in relation to stakeholder interaction appear to exhibit characteristics of complex systems, hence motivating to view applied research as a complex system. In this sense, complexity theory may provide a common language between the <b>different</b> <b>disciplines</b> examining transdisciplinary stakeholder interaction in applied research from a shared perspective...|$|R

40|$|The COLIBRI study {{considers}} the preliminary {{design of a}} semiballistic vehicle for reentry experiments. The study report comprises the results obtained. Firstly, {{the requirements of the}} experimental capsule are defined that emerge from the research and technology objectives. The vehicle derived from these requirements is a sphere-cone configuration with a flattened bottom surface and tail flaps for trimming. The reference mission considers a piggy-back flight on a Russian FOTON capsule. This concept is the point of departure for an extensive mission and system analysis. Numerical simulation and optimization methods are the main tools used in iterative sequential design steps. They <b>include</b> <b>different</b> <b>disciplines,</b> among these are e. g. the determination of aerodynamic properties, aerodynamic stability analysis, aerothermodynamic load analysis, flight simulation, guidance and control analysis, together with system and mass layout. For these purposes typical engineering methods are applied that provide a compromise between numerical effort required and accuracy obtained. Therefore a verification in points by detailed analyses and wind tunnel experiments is necessary. As a result, a vehicle and mission concept is proposed that could provide a basis for a further detailed development and the construction of an experimental capsule. (orig.)

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of urban marketing {{has been increasing}} today, when a rivalry between products and enterprises has arisen based on cities in terms of development of countries by the help of globalization and brand strategies applied for products are being adapted to cities, which aims to highlight cities. Cities are significant actors in efforts of economic, {{social and cultural development}} of countries. Branding, which means being different in the eyes of target mass, more chance of being recognized, and establishing values, is preferred. For a city, what being a brand means to attract local and foreign tourists, encourage investments, to increase the life standards of local public, and so to add value. Branding process is to create an identity for the city and position. In this study which <b>includes</b> three <b>different</b> <b>disciplines,</b> which are public management, economics and business administration, closely related to the issue, during the process of identity creation, MuÄŸla's potential of being a brand city was evaluated and interviews were made in depth with the shareholders having a role in its being a brand city and results obtained have been suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} large space {{structures}} (LSS) requires {{the use of}} design and analysis tools that <b>include</b> <b>different</b> <b>disciplines.</b> For such a kind of spacecrafts it is in fact mandatory that mechanical design and GNC design are developed within a common framework. One of the keypoints in the development of LSS is related to the dynamic phenomena. These phenomena usually lead to two different interpretations. The former one is related to the overall motion of the spacecraft, i. e. the motion of the center of gravity and motion around the center of gravity. The latter one is related to the local motion of the elastic elements that leads to oscillations. These oscillations have in turn a disturbing effect on the motion of the spacecraft. From an engineering perspective, the structural model of flexible spacecrafts is generally obtained via FEM involving thousands of DOFs. Many of them are not significant from the attitude control point of view. One of the procedures to reduce the structural DOFs is tied to the modal decomposition technique. In the present paper a technique to develop a control-oriented structural model will be proposed. Starting from a detailed FE model of the spacecraft and using a special modal condensation approach, a Continuous Model is defined. With this transformation the number of DOFs necessary to study the coupled elastic/rigid dynamic is minimized. The final dynamic model will be suitable for the control design implementation. In order to properly design a satellite controller, it is important to recall that the characteristic parameters of the satellite are uncertain. The effect that uncertainties has on control performance must be investigated. A possible solution is that, after the altitude controller is designed on the nominal model, a Verification and Validation (V&V) process is performed to guarantee a correct functionality under a large number of scenarios. The V&V process can be very lengthy and expensive: difficulty and cost do increase because of the overall system dimension that depends on the number of uncertainties. Uncertain parameters have to be parametrically investigated to determine an estimate of the worst case stability and performance of the control laws. A gridding approach can be used and the V&V can be obtained with the Worst-Case Analysis, i. e. an optimization process, to find an estimation of the true worst-case behavior, such to verify that the design is robust enough to meet the system performance specification under worst-case conditions and tolerances...|$|R

40|$|During unimanual motor tasks, muscle {{activity}} {{may not be}} restricted to the contracting muscle, but rather occurs involuntarily in the contralateral resting limb, even in healthy individuals. This phenomenon {{has been referred to}} as mirror electromyographic activity (MEMG). To date, the physiological (non-pathological) form of MEMG has been observed predominately in upper extremities (UE), while remaining sparsely described in lower extremities (LE). Accordingly, evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms and modulation capability of MEMG, i. e., the extent of MEMG in dependency of exerted force during unilateral isometric contractions are insufficiently investigated in terms of LE. Furthermore, it still remains elusive if and how MEMG is affected by long-term exercise training. Here, we provide novel quantitative evidence for physiological MEMG in homologous muscles of LE (tibialis anterior (TA), rectus femoris (RF)) during submaximal unilateral dorsiflexion in healthy young adults. Furthermore, endurance athletes (EA, n = 11) show a higher extent of MEMG in LE compared to non-athletes (NA, n = 11) at high force demands (80 % MVC, maximum voluntary contraction). While the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of MEMG still remain elusive, our study indicates, at least indirectly, that sport-related long-term training might affect the amount of MEMG during strong isometric contractions specifically in trained limbs. To support this assumption of exercise-induced limb-specific MEMG modulation, future studies <b>including</b> <b>different</b> sports <b>disciplines</b> with contrasting movement patterns and parameters should additionally be performed...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{adaptation}} projects often involve joint knowledge production, <b>including</b> <b>different</b> stakeholders and <b>disciplines.</b> One of {{the main}} challenges of transdisciplinary research projects is to balance the convergence and divergence of epistemic contributions. We explore to what extent organisational embedding of project teams, input in the project, and project governance influence project performance in climate adaptation projects. Our results indicate that aligning incentive systems and lower partner diversity lead to higher effectiveness and satisfaction. Project size enhances effectiveness, but decreases satisfaction. Satisfaction is enhanced by committed project members. Furthermore, dealing with diverse partner sets and large teams is not eased by careful management {{in the course of}} the project. Careful balancing of divergence and convergence should be taken into account during the design stage of these projects. In the context of knowledge co-production for environmental challenges, project management should proactively consider project structure, required level of partner diversity and project size.

40|$|Ecosystem {{services}} (ES), {{the benefits}} that humans obtain from nature, are of great importance for human well-being. The challenge of meeting the growing human demands for natural resources while sustaining essential ecosystem functions and resilience requires an in-depth understanding of the complex relationships between ES. These conflicting ('trade-offs') or synergistic ('synergies') relationships mean that changes in one ES can cause changes in other ES. By synthesizing the growing body of literature on ES relationships, we identified the following four main study objectives: (i) the identification and characterization of co-occurrences of ES, (ii) the identification of drivers that shape ES relationships, (iii) the exploration of biophysical constraints of landscapes and limitations to their multifunctionality, and (iv) the support of environmental planning, management and policy decisions. For each of these objectives we here describe the key concepts, <b>including</b> viewpoints of <b>different</b> <b>disciplines,</b> and highlight the major challenges {{that need to be}} addressed. We identified three cross-cutting themes being relevant to all four main types of studies. To help guiding researchers towards more systematic analyses of ES trade-offs and synergies, we conclude with an outlook on suggested future research priorities. </p...|$|R
