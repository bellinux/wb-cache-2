40|$|Accuracy {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{principles}} of journalism. However, it is increasingly hard to manage due to the diversity of news media. Some editors of online news tend to use catchy <b>headlines</b> which trick readers into clicking. These <b>headlines</b> are either ambiguous or misleading, degrading the reading experience of the audience. Thus, identifying inaccurate news <b>headlines</b> is a task worth studying. Previous work names these <b>headlines</b> "clickbaits" and mainly focus on the features extracted from the <b>headlines,</b> which limits the performance since the consistency between <b>headlines</b> and news bodies is underappreciated. In this paper, we clearly redefine the problem and identify ambiguous and misleading <b>headlines</b> separately. We utilize class sequential rules to exploit structure information when detecting ambiguous <b>headlines.</b> For the identification of misleading <b>headlines,</b> we extract features based on the congruence between <b>headlines</b> and bodies. To make use of the large unlabeled data set, we apply a co-training method and gain an increase in performance. The experiment results show the effectiveness of our methods. Then we use our classifiers to detect inaccurate <b>headlines</b> crawled from different sources and conduct a data analysis. Comment: Accepted by IJCAI 201...|$|R
