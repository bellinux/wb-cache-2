25|$|Stuttering is {{typically}} a developmental disorder beginning {{in early childhood}} and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children. The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months. Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours</b> are absent. Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech. With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.|$|R
50|$|The giant axons {{carry the}} fastest signals along the nerve cord. These are {{emergency}} signals that initiate reflex <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, {{from the rear}} {{to the front of}} the animal. If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract. This causes the worm shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear. Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird).|$|R
40|$|Fear {{is the key}} {{emotion of}} {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD). Fear 2 ̆ 7 s evolved function is motivating survival via defensive behaviours. Defensive behaviours have been highly conserved throughout mammalian species; hence much may be learned from ethology. Predation pressure drove the early evolution of defences, laying foundations in the more ancient brain structures. Conspecific (same species) pressure has been a more recent evolutionary influence, but along with environmental threats it has dominated PTSD research. Anti-predator responses involve both avoiding a predator 2 ̆ 7 s sensory field and avoiding detection if within it, as well as <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours.</b> More effective avoidance results in less need for <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours,</b> suggesting that avoidance is biologically distinct from flight. Recognizing the predation, environmental and conspecific origins of defence may result in clearer definition of PTSD phenomena. Defence can also be viewed in the stages of no threat, potential threat, encounter and circa strike. Specific defences are used sequentially and according to contexts, loosely in the order: avoidance, attentive immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defence, appeasement and tonic immobility. The DSM-IV criteria and PTSD research show substantial congruence with the model proposed: that PTSD is a disorder of heightened defence involving six key defences {{used in conjunction with}} vigilance and risk assessment according to contexts. Human research is reviewed in this respect with reference to laboratory and wild animal observations providing new insights. Understanding individual perceptual issues (e. g. predictability and controllability) relevant to these phenomena, combined with defence strategy recalibration and neuronal plasticity research goes some way to explaining why some traumatized individuals develop PTSD when others do not...|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{a simple}} {{withdrawal}} reflex, the flatworm, Notoplana aticola, displays a locomotory <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> following pin pricks to the posterior end. Touching the larvae of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, with a probe causes them to pause and {{move away from the}} stimulus, however, stronger mechanical stimulation evokes a more complex corkscrew-like rolling behaviour, i.e. the response is plastic. When a weak tactile stimulus is applied to the siphon of the sea-hare Aplysia californica, the animal rapidly withdraws the siphon between the parapodia. It is sometimes claimed this response is an involuntary reflex (e.g. see Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex), however, the complex learning associated with this response (see 'Learned Avoidance' below) suggests this view might be overly simplistic.|$|E
50|$|They nest {{in mixed}} species heronries where they build a stick {{platform}} on the nest tree {{which is usually}} surrounded by water. Several pairs may nest close to each other. The branch is flattened by the birds prior to {{the placement of the}} sticks that form the nest platform. The nest sites are defended from other birds with posturing and thrusts of the neck. The breeding season is June to August (during the rainy season) in northern India, April-May in southwestern India and in winter in southeastern India (during the northeast monsoon). The usual clutch consists of three to six spindle shaped bluish-green eggs with a white chalky covering that gets soiled over time. Both parents incubate the eggs, beginning after the first egg is laid which leads to asynchronous hatching of the young. The newly hatched chicks are bare and covered with some down on the head. As they grow, they become covered in white down. The chicks feed by thrusting their heads down the throat of their parents.Adults go through a synchronous moult of their flight feathers after the breeding season resulting in the loss of flying ability for a brief period of time. When disturbed from their perches during this period, they dive into the water below and attempt to escape underwater. This <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> is also employed by chicks at the nest. They are very silent except at the nest where they produce grunts and croaks and a disyllabic chigi-chigi-chigi. Chicks are noisy when begging for food. Adults roost communally in trees close to or over water.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) {{and one of its}} target structures, the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), produces a typical behaviour in rats consisting of vigorous running and jumping which is known as "escape behaviour". <b>Escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> in rodents closely mimics panic attacks in humans. Since electrical stimulation at higher frequencies generally inhibits the stimulated region, we tested in this study the hypothesis that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the dlPAG and VMH at higher frequencies (> 100 Hz) would not induce <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour.</b> More specifically, we evaluated whether experimental DBS could be used to inhibit panic-like behaviour. Rats underwent implantation of DBS-electrodes {{at the level of the}} dlPAG and VMH and the effects of various stimulation parameters were assessed. In addition, we studied the neural activation pattern resulting from DBS of the dlPAG and VMH using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We found that stimulation amplitude is the most important stimulation parameter in the induction of <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Remarkably, stimulation frequency (1 - 300 Hz) had no effect on stimulation-induced <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> and therefore it was not possible to prevent the induction of <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> with higher frequencies. The neuronal activation pattern resulting from dlPAG and VMH DBS was similar. These findings suggest that DBS of the dlPAG and VMH induces panic-related behaviours even at higher frequencies. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{salinization}} {{has been}} identified as a major stressor to amphibians. Exposure to elevated salinity necessitates physiological adjustments and biochemical changes that may be energetically demanding. As such, exposure to non-lethal levels of salinity during development could potentially alter anuran metabolic rates and individual performance in both pre- and post-metamorphic life stages. We investigated the effects of non-lethal levels of salinity on metamorphic traits (time to reach metamorphosis and metamorphic mass), tadpole oxygen consumption, <b>escape</b> response <b>behaviour</b> (pre- and post-metamorphosis) and foraging ability post-metamorphosis in two native Australian frog species, the southern brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii) and the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii). We found that both Lit. ewingii and Lim. peronii exhibited differences in metamorphic traits in response to elevated salinity. Neither species showed significant change in oxygen consumption during development in response to salinity, relative to freshwater controls. Both species displayed impaired <b>escape</b> response <b>behaviours</b> in response to salinity during larval development, but flow-on effects to adult <b>escape</b> response <b>behaviours</b> and foraging performance were species-specific. Our results show that the influence of stressors during development can have consequences for anuran physiology and behaviour at multiple life stages, and emphasize the need for studies that examine the energetics of anuran responses in order to better understand the responses of biota to stressful environments...|$|R
40|$|While {{the effects}} of global {{atmospheric}} changes on vegetation and resulting insect populations(‘bottom-up interactions’) are being increasingly studied, how these gases modify interactions among insects and their natural enemies (‘top-down interactions’) is less clear. As natural enemy efficacy is governed largely by behavioural mechanisms, altered prey finding and prey defence may change insect population dynamics. Here we show that pheromone-mediated <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and hence the vulnerability of insects to natural enemies, are divergent under atmospheric conditions associated with global climate change. Chaitophorus stevensis, a common aphid on trembling aspen trees, Populus tremuloides, have diminished escape responses in enriched carbon dioxide (CO 2) environments, while those in enriched ozone (O 3) have augmented escape responses, to alarm pheromone. These results suggest that divergent pheromonemediated behaviours could alter predator–prey interactions in future environments...|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with riding and handling of horses, many accidents {{that can cause}} severe injuries to both horses and humans are existent. The cause is in most cases that the horse is frightened. The horse's fear also affects its usefulness {{and it has been}} shown to have adverse effects on the horse's welfare. To increase safety and improve the welfare of both humans and horses, it is important to find appropriate training methods to reduce the fear of horses in frightening situations. This experimental study compares handled habituation to free habituation. The aim was to study the impact of these training methods on the horse's behaviour and habituation, and to find out which method is most successful to reduce the fear of horses in frightening situations. Twenty horses were randomly divided into groups of ten horses per training method. The horses had three training sessions each and then they were tested for the task, to go over a bridge consisting of assembled plywood boards lying on the ground. About half of the horses passed the task, to go over the bridge, either correctly or with some small error. Only a very small difference between the two training methods were observed, handled habituation was found to be slightly better. Instead, a difference between horses with different use/breed and personality could be observed. The results indicate that the horses in the both training methods were calm during the test, all went with lowered heads and without any signs of <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours</b> or tenseness. During the training sessions the horses in handled habituation were closer to the bridge (P< 0, 05), and at the both training methods the horses were closer to the bridge for each training session. The study also found that horses with handled habituation showed more interest in the bridge compared to horses that were trained with free habituation, which had more interest to trot/canter and neigh to connect with other horses. Snorting and defecation were observed in more horses trained with free habituation while lowered head and <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours</b> were observed in more horses trained with handled habituation. Snorting, defecation and <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours</b> decreased from day one to day three. It was concluded that training with habituation, both handled and free, can reduce fear in horses. It's a calm training method where the horses showed few behavioral signs of fear and these were of low accident risk. More research on habituation could be undertaken to develop the method so that accidents in riding and handling of horses can be reduced and horse welfare improved. Handled habituation was shown both in terms to cross the bridge, close to the bridge and behaviorally to be slightly more effective than free habituation. But the difference was very small and to draw any conclusions, further studies are required. This study suggests that humans may have a calming effect on the horses, but the training method that is best also seems to depend on the horse's personality...|$|R
40|$|The <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{of organisms}} that retreat to shelter to avoid predators is {{influenced}} by availability and quality (e. g. appropriate size) of shelters.

Larger crabs tended to be nearer to larger shelters than smaller crabs and fled sooner and further than smaller crabs. Larger crabs often fled past the nearest shelters if they were too small. Group size increased at the site with fewer shelters, but this did not influence flight behaviour. We conclude that the availability of shelters and body size influences <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> of these crabs...|$|E
40|$|In lizards, {{males are}} {{predicted}} to sprint faster {{and run for}} longer than females by virtue of higher testosterone levels and differences in morphology. Consequently, <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> is also predicted {{to be associated with}} sex and locomotor performance, yet these links have rarely been explored. Here, we tested whether <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> is associated with locomotor performance in the toad-headed agama, Phrynocephalus vlangalii, and whether it is sex-dependent. This species is also characterized by elaborate tail displays, which we examined as a potential pursuit-deterrent signal. Tail waves were performed by a very small proportion (2 / 58, 3 %) of individuals during predatory trials, suggesting that tail signalling functions exclusively in a social context. To understand the relationships between sex, <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> and performance, we first measured <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> (flight initiation distance, flight distance - measured differently compared to previous studies of lizard <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and refuge use) in the field before measuring maximal sprint speed and endurance on the same individuals in the laboratory. Flight initiation distance did not differ between the sexes and was unrelated to performance capacity (maximal endurance and sprint speed) but was positively related to body size with larger individuals fleeing earlier. Males fled farther than females, but flight distance was also unrelated to either endurance or sprint speed. Interestingly, faster females were less likely to enter a refuge than slower females, whereas sprint speed and the probability of taking refuge were unrelated for males. Our results suggest that when males and females are not obviously sexually dimorphic, {{they are more likely to}} overlap in escape tactics. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{predator}} evasion {{is essential}} to the fitness of many animals. Variation in <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> may be adaptive as it reduces predictability, enhancing escape success. High escape velocities and accelerations also increase escape success, but biomechanical factors likely constrain the behavioural range over which performance can be maximized. There may therefore be a trade-off between variation and performance during escape responses. We have used bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) escape responses to examine this potential trade-off, determining the full repertoire of <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> for individual bluegill sunfish and linking this to performance as indicated by escape velocity and acceleration. Fish escapes involve an initial C-bend of the body axis, followed by variable steering movements. These generate thrust and establish the escape direction. Directional changes during the initial C-bend were less variable than the final escape angle, and the most frequent directions were associated with high escape velocity. Significant inter-individual differences in escape angles magnified the overall variation, maintaining unpredictability from a predator perspective. Steering in the latter stages of the escape to establish the final escape trajectory also affected performance, with turns away from the stimulus associated with reduced velocity. This suggests that modulation of <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> by steering may also have an associated performance cost. This has important implications for understanding the scope and control of intra- and inter-individual variation in <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the associated costs and benefits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} whether the <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> of lizard species could be predicted by {{knowledge of their}} functional capabilities. In the laboratory, the eVect of perch support diameter on sprinting and jumping ability was measured in five species of Anolis lizards. In all species, sprint speed declined with decreasing perch diameter, but decreased perch diameter had little eVect on jumping ability. The <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a lizard on a particular-sized support in nature was then evaluated {{as a function of}} the lizard’s sprinting and jumping capabilities. As diameter decreased, lizards in all but one species tended to escape by jumping more frequently because jumping ability is less aVected by diameter than is sprinting ability. It was also predicted that species in which running ability declines greatly as diameter decreases should switch to escape by jumping more often than species that experience less of a decline in running ability. This prediction was not confirmed. Consequently, functional capabilities play a role in determining <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Anolis lizards, but other factors may be important as well. ? 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Physiological ecologists and evolutionary biolo-gists have recently focused on studies of whole organism performance capability to understand whether and how organisms are adapted to thei...|$|E
40|$|A prey animal {{may have}} the {{alternative}} of flying away or feigning death when it encounters predators. These alternatives have a genetic base as anti-predator strategies in the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis. A negative genetic correlation between death-feigning intensity and flying ability was found in C. chinensis, i. e. lower flying ability is genetically connected to escaping by dropping from a perch and then feigning death, whereas higher flying ability does not correspond to death-feigning behaviour. Two bidirectional artificial selections for death-feigning duration and flying ability were conducted independently in C. chinensis. The strains selected for shorter (longer) duration of death-feigning had higher (lower) flying ability, while the strains selected for lower (higher) flying ability showed longer (shorter) duration of death-feigning. When the two traits were compared in 21 populations of C. chinensis derived from different geographical regions, a significant negative correlation was found between death-feigning intensity and flying ability.

Despite the occupation of generally similar rocky habitats, the habitat of Carlia scirtetis was more open and composed of larger boulders with more regular surfaces, whereas the habitat of Carlia mundivensis was composed of more undergrowth and leaf litter, consisting of smaller boulders with irregular surfaces. The longer legs, flatter body, and greater sprinting and climbing ability of C. scirtetis, supports ecomorphological predictions. By contrast to predictions based on habitat openness, C. scirtetis allowed a potential threat to approach closer and ran further to a refuge than C. mundivensis, suggesting that <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> as determined by performance may be species-specific or decoupled in these two species. The increased sprint speed of C. scirtetis highlighted a performance trade-off, with climbing speed lagging behind that of sprint speed.

Although potentially effective for evading predators, the decision-making process used by cowbirds in our study appears maladaptive in the context of avoiding fast-moving vehicles.

Most (88 %) P. fenestralis initially landed on sand, but after repeated approaches an increasing proportion landed in grass and hid. Both species therefore changed <b>escape</b> <b>behaviour</b> with persistent pursuit but used different tactics, suiting their flight ability or camouflage, and optimised habitat use. Three grasshopper species have now been examined for responses to repeated approach by predators and all show different tactics supporting escape decision theory. Our results emphasise the variety of escape responses across species and how the dynamic nature of escape responses vary according to an animal's situation. Rather than single optimum escape options, each grasshopper species shows a range of responses, which vary with risk from persistent predators. Although grasshoppers provide an excellent model, it would be profitable to examine responses of a range of species according to levels of predation risk...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{animals are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable to predation. Hence, precocial young of many taxa develop predator escape performance that rivals that of adults. Ontogenetically unique among vertebrates, birds transition from hind limb to forelimb dependence for <b>escape</b> <b>behaviours,</b> so developmental investment for immediate gains in running performance may impair flight performance later. Here, in a three-dimensional kinematic study of developing birds performing pre-flight flapping locomotor behaviours, wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) and a newly described behaviour, controlled flapping descent (CFD), we define three stages of locomotor ontogeny in a model gallinaceous bird (Alectoris chukar). In stage I (1 – 7 days post-hatching (dph)) birds crawl quadrupedally during ascents, and their flapping fails to reduce their acceleration during aerial descents. Stage II (8 – 19 dph) birds use symmetric wing beats during WAIR, and in CFD significantly reduce acceleration while controlling body pitch to land on their feet. In stage III (20 dph to adults), birds are capable of vertical WAIR and level-powered flight. In contrast to altricial species, which first fly when nearly at adult mass, we show that in a precocial bird the major requirements for flight (i. e. high power output, wing control and wing size) convene by around 8 dph (at ca 5 % of adult mass) and yield significant gains in escape performance: immature chukars can fly by 20 dph, at only about 12 per cent of adult mass...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to investigate the differences in anti-predator behavioural and acoustic response to terrestrial and aerial predators {{as well as the}} behavioural differences between sexes in the red-legged partridge. To this aim we observed the response of 114 partridge (57 males and 57 females) to dummy terrestrial and aerial predators, a raptor and a fox. We divided behavioural responses to predators into four mutually exclusive categories: vigilance, freezing, <b>escape</b> and non-anti-predator <b>behaviours.</b> We also recorded and analysed the vocalizations emitted during tests. The animals reacted differently to aerial and terrestrial stimuli. The reactions elicited by the terrestrial predator were ranked as follows: vigilance, <b>escape,</b> non-anti-predator <b>behaviours,</b> and freezing. Those elicited by the aerial predator were ranked as follows: vigilance, freezing, <b>escape</b> and non-anti-predator <b>behaviours.</b> Vigilance and <b>escape</b> were elicited more frequently by the terrestrial predator than by the aerial predator (vigilance: p 0. 001; escape: p 0. 001). Freezing was the most frequent behaviour following the appearance of the aerial predator (p 0. 001). In fact, freezing may represent an effective strategy in an open space, combining camouflage from and detection by the predator. On the other hand, vigilance is an effective behaviour to detect and avoid a terrestrial predator hunting by ambush. We did not find clear-cut differences between sexes. The analysis of vocalizations revealed that the fox and the raptor elicited significantly different calls (p = 0. 003); the fox evoked significantly more vocalizations than the raptor (p 0. 001), differing in addition in frequency parameters. Thus partridges not only discriminate between aerial and terrestrial predators and behave consequently, but are also able to tune alarm calls in relation to the context of predation...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{response}} to a predator is to release pseudomorphs ("false bodies"), smaller clouds of ink with a greater mucus content, which allows them to hold their shape for longer. These are expelled slightly away from the cephalopod in question, which will often release several pseudomorphs and change colour (blanch) in conjunction with these releases. The pseudomorphs are roughly the same volume as and look similar to the cephalopod that released them, and many predators have been observed attacking them mistakenly, allowing the cephalopod to <b>escape</b> (this <b>behaviour</b> {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "blanch-ink-jet manoeuvre").|$|R
