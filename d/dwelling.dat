40|$|The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) of Israel {{produces}} an official monthly hedonic nationwide home price index starting in 1994. The Index of Prices of <b>Dwellings</b> is constructed {{using data from}} the Catalog of Real Estate Prices, a system through which information about purchases of <b>dwellings</b> is gathered by the Capital Gains Tax Bureaus throughout the country. These data on transactions include new <b>dwellings</b> and <b>dwellings</b> whose ownership changed. The sample consists of 67 urban localities which have: 1) 20, 000 or more residents, 2) 5, 000 or more <b>dwellings,</b> according to the inventory of <b>dwellings</b> in Israel as listed in the Municipal Taxation List, and 3) a reasonable number of transactions relative to the number of <b>dwellings.</b> The index excludes <b>dwellings</b> built by individuals, transactions performed through a group of buyers, transactions from public companies, and <b>dwellings</b> with no market value. The Index of Prices of <b>Dwellings</b> is calculated using a hedonic regression that considers the characteristics of the <b>dwellings</b> and adjusts for differences in their quality. We average the monthly observations (with a simple arithmetic average) to obtain quarterly observations. In order to reflect house prices prior to 1994, we follow Dovman, Ribon, and Yakhin (2012) and splice the current Index of Prices of <b>Dwellings</b> with a historical monthly index from the CBS...|$|R
