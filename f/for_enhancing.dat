5|$|The {{city has}} {{recognized}} {{the historic district}} in its zoning code. It divides the area into six separate districts — the Riverfront, First, Second, Third, Fourth Street and Fifth Avenue local historic districts. The Riverfront district includes the neighborhood to the northwest listed on the National Register as the Northern River Street Historic District. The other five are roughly aligned with the eponymous streets, with the First Street district consisting of two detached areas, the Second and Third street districts taking {{up most of the}} central area and the other two occupying the northeastern corner of the district. The city has also made some grants and tax exemptions available to qualified property owners. The city's current master plan calls <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> the district's mixed-use character, by encouraging both residential use and businesses that serve consumers, particularly retailers, and providing tax incentives for the rehabilitation of historic homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E

25|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{utilization}} of high-conductivity materials (inserts) {{have been proposed}} for electronic cooling and <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> the heat removal from small chips to a heat sink.

25|$|Due to {{the dual}} role of ROS, both prooxidant and antioxidant-based anticancer agents have been developed. However, {{modulation}} of ROS signaling alone {{seems not to}} be an ideal approach due to adaptation of cancer cells to ROS stress, redundant pathways for supporting cancer growth and toxicity from ROS-generating anticancer drugs. Combinations of ROS-generating drugs with pharmaceuticals that can break the redox adaptation could be a better strategy <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> cancer cell cytotoxicity.|$|E

25|$|Floating wind {{turbines}} {{can be used}} to provide motive power for achieving artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather. Though deep seawater (below 50 metres depth) is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the phytoplankton growth is poor due to the absence of sunlight. The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse thermocline temperatures. The electricity generated by the floating wind turbine would be used to drive high–flow and low–head water pumps to draw cold water from below 50 meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by eductors before releasing into the sea. Mediterranean sea, Black sea, Caspian sea, Red sea, Persian gulf, deep water lakes/reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> fish catch economically. These units can also be mobile type to utilise the seasonal favourable winds all around the year.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} {{penalization}} of one eye by means of patching or atropine drops does not provide the conditions that are necessary in order to develop or improve binocular vision. Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of amblyopia that do allow for the improvement of binocular sight, for example using binasal occlusion or partially frosted spectacles in place of any eye patch, using alternating occlusion goggles or using methods of perceptual learning based on video games or virtual reality games <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> binocular vision.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{fermentation}} {{usually takes}} 2856 days, {{after which the}} must is placed in a secondary fermentation vessel for 6–9 months of aging. Durations of primary and secondary fermentation producing satisfactory mead may vary considerably according to numerous factors, such as floral origin of the honey and its natural sugar and microorganism contents, must water percentage, pH, additives used, and strain of yeast, among others. Although supplementation of the must with nitrogen, salt or vitamins has been tested to improve mead qualities, {{there is no evidence}} that adding nutrients reduced fermentation time or improved quality. Cell immobilization methods, however, proved effective <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> mead quality.|$|E
25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and <b>for</b> <b>enhancing</b> properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E
