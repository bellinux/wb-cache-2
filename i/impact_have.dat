5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant <b>impact</b> <b>have</b> produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E

The March 14 Alliance, dominated by Christian- and Sunni-based parties, is broadly {{sympathetic to the}} Syrian opposition to Bashar Al-Assad. In August, youth members of 14 March parties including Kataeb, Lebanese Forces, National Liberal Party, Future Movement and Islamic Group held a rally to demand the expulsion of the Syrian Ambassador. 8 March parties generally supported {{the continuation of the}} Assad government, but analysts believe some groups within the coalition may seek new alliances if the Assad government falls. More moderate members of the coalition in government have begun distancing themselves from the Assad government.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites requires the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism {{for the formation of}} tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity <b>impact,</b> <b>have</b> been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified Impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required in order for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.|$|E
500|$|Objections to its {{potential}} environmental <b>impact</b> <b>have</b> stalled governmental support for extraction of shale oil in some countries, such as Australia. [...] Shale oil extraction may involve {{a number of}} different environmental impacts that vary with process technologies. Depending on the geological conditions and mining techniques, mining impacts may include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. [...] Surface mining for ex situ processing, as with in situ processing, requires extensive land use and ex situ thermal processing generates wastes that require disposal. Mining, processing, spent oil shale disposal, and waste treatment require land to be withdrawn from traditional uses. Depending on the processing technology, the waste material may contain pollutants including sulfates, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are toxic and carcinogenic. [...] Experimental in situ conversion processes may reduce some of these impacts, but may instead cause other problems, such as groundwater pollution.|$|E
500|$|The game's premise {{and writing}} were warmly received; a {{review in the}} New York Times noted [...] "The game's level of detail and its {{emotional}} <b>impact</b> <b>have</b> prompted some players to cast about for literary peers."

In 2005, GameSpot stated [...] "Planescape: Torment has quite possibly the best implementation of role-playing an evil character ever to appear in a computer or video game to date". The heavily tattooed, egocentric and potentially selfish Nameless One was welcomed as a change of pace from the conventional RPG hero, who was considered a predictable do-gooder. Reviewers also approved of the protagonist's ability to gain new powers by [...] "remembering" [...] past lives. The dark and diversified representation of the D setting of Planescape was lauded as a fresh departure from the traditional high fantasy of computer role-playing games. A review in NextGen praised the game, saying that [...] "Torment offers the best RPG gameplay anyone can find on store shelves, hands down." [...] Uros Jojic of Actiontrip commented that [...] "Planescape: Torment proves {{that it is possible to}} make an inventive, fun and refreshing game in this [...] "sea of clones". Creating a computer edition of Planescape system is another triumph for Black Isle Studios." ...|$|E

Two incidents occurred with the Tesla Model S in October 2013, one when a Model S caught fire after the electric car hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington, and another involving a loss of control and collision with a tree in Merida, Mexico. A Tesla Model S being driven on a highway near Murfreesboro, Tennessee caught fire in November 2013 after it struck a tow hitch on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Following Dale Earnhardt’s fatal wreck in 2001, NASCAR {{commissioned}} Sicking {{to determine}} the specific cause of Earnhardt’s worst injuries. Sicking use video footage to analyze and reconstruct the crash, as well as NASCAR’s worst crashes over the 10 years prior. Ultimately, the investigation contributed {{to the development of}} the Sicking’s best-known invention, the SAFER Barrier, an energy management system that reduces the impact felt by the driver by flexing and absorbing energy. Prior to the barrier, NASCAR and IndyCar averaged approximately 1.5 driver fatalities yearly.
