50|$|Each {{platform}} {{has three}} staircases and one {{elevator to the}} main mezzanine on the north <b>half</b> and another <b>staircase</b> at the extreme south end to 32nd Street. North of the station are diamond crossovers in both directions that are used by N trains on weekdays when they operate express in Manhattan.|$|R
50|$|The {{full-time}} mezzanine at 86th Street and Avenue X has two staircases to the street, and one {{staircase to}} each platform. There {{was a second}} mezzanine that was abandoned and removed years ago, but little evidence of it remains. The platform stairs are narrower {{today than they were}} when the station first opened. The width is more than two feet shorter than normal at the top <b>half</b> of each <b>staircase.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Vann {{stairway}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} examples of cantilevered construction in Georgia. This was on one side of the main entrance, which originally faced the Federal Road, and works like a set of scales. To get a set of scales to balance themselves, an equal weight must be applied to each side. Though <b>half</b> of the <b>staircase</b> is suspended over the first floor hallway, roughly six inches of the opposite side of the stairway is in a solid brick wall. The brick wall is far denser than the second landing; this means there will never be enough weight on the landing to “tip the scale.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} two tracks and one island platform, built {{with a slight}} curve, as is Jackson Avenue at this location. The {{trackside}} wall trim line is Hunter green with a black border and [...] "21" [...] underneath in white numbering on a black background. The platform and mezzanine columns are painted a matching shade of Hunter green (they had previously been painted violet) with every other column having the standard black and white name signs. A booth for NYPD Transit Police District 20 {{is located at the}} southern end of the platform. There is a full length mezzanine above the platform; however, only the northern half is open and has two staircases from the platform. The southern <b>half</b> had three <b>staircases</b> to the platform and is used for storage and employee offices.|$|R
5000|$|The nearby 100-foot (30m) clock {{tower was}} added in 1861 {{and is the}} work of the {{architect}} Henry Clutton. As a functioning water tower it still provides water for the house today. It is rendered in Roman cement {{like the rest of the}} house, and features four clock faces framed by gilded surrounds and a <b>half</b> open <b>staircase</b> on its north side. It was described by the architectural critic Nicholas Pevsner as [...] "the epitome of Victorian flamboyance and assertiveness." [...] The tower is topped with a modern reproduction of Augustin Dumont's 19th century winged male figure Le Génie de la Liberté (the Spirit of Liberty). The original is atop the July Column in the Place de la Bastille, Paris. This replaces two earlier versions, the first having fallen from the tower during a storm in the 1950s. The new statue is made of bronze and was created using Dumont's original mould from the 1860s found in a museum in Semur-en-Auxois, France. It measures 2.2 metres in height, is covered in two layers of 23.5 carat gold leaf and cost a total of £68,000. It is an allegorical sculpture which holds the torch of civilization in its right hand and the broken chain of slavery in its left. It was affixed to the tower in spring 2012.|$|R
50|$|A spacious hall {{runs the}} depth of the house with a large double arch {{dividing}} it equally. The front half has a chair rail and corner cupboard while the other <b>half</b> contains the <b>staircase.</b> The hall, while {{in the middle of the}} house, is not centered, being offset to the right and lit by the window to the right of the entrance door. The hall narrows at the stair hall, which contains an unusually fine curved walnut staircase. To the right of the hall, in front, is a small reception room with a larger dining room behind, connected by a narrow hall with a service stair. On the left side of the hall are two paneled drawing rooms. The second floor is similarly arranged, except that a small chamber occupies the end of the hall opposite the stairs. The two large eastern bedrooms are paneled.|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor Thesis is {{a project}} of a family house in Hněvotín. It is a {{detached}} house built in the “L shape” with one underground and two aboveground floors. The building is designed {{for a family of}} four. In the basement of the building there is a playroom, a gym, a bathroom and a utility room. On the ground floor there is a vestibule with an entry to the garage and the hall. From the hall we can enter the toilet or the living room which is connected to the kitchen and the dining room. There is a <b>half</b> landing <b>staircase</b> leading from the living room to the first floor or the basement. On the first floor there is another hall, which leads to the storage room, two nurseries, bathroom and a bedroom with an on suite bathroom. The whole first floor is designed as a loft. The roofing is made of clay roofing tiles Tondach. Vertical peripheral masonry in the basement consists of concrete formwork blocks Dito ZB 400 x 300 x 250 mm. The basement internal bearing wall and the bearing wall above ground both consist of ceramic bricks Porotherm 30 P+D 247 x 300 x 238 mm. The horizontal structural frame consists of ceiling beams Pot and inserts Miako from the Porotherm system. The only exception is the ceiling system in the garage where it is stylized into a monolithic reinforced concrete panel...|$|R
5000|$|The Vermont Square Branch was {{designated}} as a Historic-Cultural Monument (#264) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in June 1983 as the oldest remaining library in the city system. [...] In 1987, the Lincoln Heights Branch and several other branch libraries in Los Angeles {{were added to the}} National Register of Historic Places as part of a thematic group submission. [...] The application noted that the branch libraries had been constructed in a variety of period revival styles to house the initial branch library system of the City of Los Angeles. With respect to the Vermont Branch, the application described the building as [...] "a one-story structure designed in the Italian Renaissance Revival and Mediterranean Revival style with Prairie style proportions." [...] It rests on a raised foundation and is topped by a red tile roof supported by broad overhanging eaves. The symmetrical facade is divided into three sections with the center portion protruding slightly. The center portion is fronted with terra cotta blocks with geometric patterns reminiscent of Classical motifs. The entry is located on a landing midway up the stairs. The top <b>half</b> of the <b>staircase</b> is located inside the building. Both wings are horizontally divided with two different facing materials. Cream-colored glazed brick covers the exterior walls below the window sills. Long vertical windows are arranged high on the walls, grouped in bands of five {{on either side of the}} entry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} text {{came from}} a newspaper interview with Brian Rabbitt :"The Barton Homestead was {{a constant reminder of}} the area's first settler, Richard Barton, when Brian was a lad. It started as a slab in 1841 and was probably added onto. Here it is seen standing in what is now the native bush in Trentham Memorial Park facing Fergusson Drive at the intersection of Camp Road. Mr Rabbit remembers the house being demolished around 1939 (actually 1938).The timber was going to be used to build huts for a Scout Jamboree where General Motors stands today. But war intervened. The Jamboree was never held and the shortage of eggs due to the war led the wood to be used for building fowl houses by farmer Ken Geange."The house is described in another 'Leader' article, by one of the Scouts who demolished it in 1938; some walls were 20 cm thick, filled with shingle; the kitchen and basement had shingle floors, possibly from a former river bed. Eventually the house had five front doors, <b>half</b> a dozen <b>staircases,</b> 22 rooms and a two-seater outside toilet.The house was full of borer, and had been abandoned and vandalised {{for a number of years}} before being demolished by Scouts for use in a Jamboree; they discovered that all the timber had been pit-sawn and planed by hand, and that walls had not been removed when the various additions were made. In two cases, tree trunks had been left standing, and walls had been built around them." ...|$|R
