5|$|John Rhys-Davies {{was asked}} to reprise his role as Sallah as a guest in the wedding scene. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down as he felt his {{character}} deserved a more substantial role.|$|E
5|$|The {{lead part}} of Pemberton was {{initially}} offered to Jack Warner. He {{turned down the}} role because he was committed to another film, and so the part was instead offered to Stanley Holloway. Alastair Sim was offered the role of Professor Hatton-Jones, but after <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down, Margaret Rutherford was cast instead.|$|E
50|$|Consider a lamp with a toggle switch. Flicking {{the switch}} once turns the lamp on. Another flick will turn the lamp off. Now suppose {{that there is}} a being able to perform the {{following}} task: starting a timer, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> the lamp on. At the end of one minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> off. At the end of another half minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> on again. At the end of another quarter of a minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> off. At the next eighth of a minute, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> on again, and he continues thus, flicking the switch each time after waiting exactly one-half the time he waited before flicking it previously. The sum of this infinite series of time intervals is exactly two minutes.|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech {{defensive}} coordinator Bud Foster also was targeted by other teams {{prior to the}} Music City Bowl. Rumors circulated about the University of Florida's interest in hiring Foster to fill its {{defensive coordinator}} position, but Foster declined to comment until after Florida's Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game. Foster proceeded through the interview process and was offered the job, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down in favor of remaining at Tech, which offered him contract incentives.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and on 3 November {{the same}} year Ashmole married Elizabeth Dugdale (1632–1701), the much younger {{daughter}} of his friend and fellow herald, the antiquarian Sir William Dugdale. All of Elizabeth's pregnancies ended in stillbirths or miscarriages, and Ashmole remained childless. In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms. He was offered the post of Garter Principal King of Arms, which traditionally came with a knighthood, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down in favour of Dugdale.|$|E
5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, the bar was located in the {{basement}} of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> into a showplace for vaudeville-style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance permit and closed down.|$|E
50|$|The party {{goes well}} and Crowther gets his {{telegram}} {{telling him he}} has the captaincy of the new ship. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> down as <b>he</b> recognises {{it does not have}} the personal touch of a cruise ship, and prefers the company of his own crew.|$|R

5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} {{the voice of the}} dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline was supposed to be O. J. Simpson, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down, much to the relief of the writers when Simpson was later tried for murder.|$|E
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
6000|$|... 'His {{father is}} dead, he is wholly {{ignorant of the}} world, has no {{resources}} whatever, and wants something to do,' said Ralph.

5|$|On 27 August 1970, Barnes curtailed a brief spell {{as manager}} of Bangor City to return to Manchester City {{as a member of}} the {{coaching}} staff. When Malcolm Allison departed the club in 1973, Barnes was offered the role of caretaker manager, but, soured by his experiences at Wrexham, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down. Instead he became assistant to the eventual managerial appointee Johnny Hart. Seven months later ill health forced Hart to step down. In the reorganisation that followed the appointment of Hart's replacement Ron Saunders, Barnes became chief scout, a role he retained for two decades until he was sacked by Peter Reid in 1991. In his role he oversaw the development of a large number of successful young players, including Paul Lake, David White and Steve Redmond, the stars of the Manchester City youth team which won the 1986 FA Youth Cup. In 1994, he returned to the club at the invitation of Francis Lee, who had recently become chairman. Barnes served in a part-time scouting position for a further six years.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E
