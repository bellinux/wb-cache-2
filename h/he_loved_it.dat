25|$|Kailasam's {{life was}} {{dedicated}} to local theater and his contributions revolutionised it. His humor left an impression on Kannadigas. He opposed the company theatre's obsession with mythology and stories of royalty and shied away from loading his plays with music. Instead, he introduced simple, realistic sets. Kailasam chaired the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held at Madras in 1945. He spent almost 10 years in a place he called 'NOOK'. It was a very dirty place, yet <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and wrote many dramas in there. He dictated his stories to his students at the 'NOOK', usually starting after 10 pm. He was a chain smoker.|$|E

It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, {{and learning how to}} play under pressure in front of all those people. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> and I'm looking forward to it, too.|$|E

We were having lunch one day in Los Angeles and I was telling him about my concept for the video and <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> so much he said, [...] "You gotta use the Pussy Wagon." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Andrew Hanson {{questioned}} whether the writers had been using drugs lately because of the surge of drug-related episodes; though <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> he acknowledged that the episode was one [...] "you are either going to love or hate", explaining that it [...] "got a little crazy using Olivia’s mind as a setting, [...] it stays grounded through the emotional current running underneath... {{you have to give}} Fringe credit for taking a risky, bold move." [...] SFScope writer Sarah Stegall called the episode [...] "brilliant, risky, fascinating, and dangerous. It's not a tack this show can afford to take very often, but I like it when it does." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, admitting that despite its faults, he [...] "enjoyed {{the hell out}} of" [...] it. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> for several reasons: he is {{a big fan of}} Anna Torv's Bellivia {{performance}} and its plotline, the drugs incorporated into the plot, its Inception-like qualities, the animation, and Bell's final goodbye. IGN Fringe reviewer Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, calling it [...] "one of the most memorable Fringe episodes to date." [...] Like Murray, Isler also noted the similarities to Inception {{as well as to the}} 1968 film Yellow Submarine and the 1977 science fiction novel A Scanner Darkly. Isler did however remark that [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] "end a string of episodes that didn't really have much point", though it was a [...] "beautiful episode that doesn't really do much for the mythology of the series... it sure was a blast to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen {{to me in the}} first place, but if he could give me the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re never going to have it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

[...] Seminal American jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of [...] "his deep, charismatic voice;" [...] Scott-Heron {{was the first person to}} see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to Pesci, {{improvisation}} and ad-libbing {{came out}} of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors {{came up with that}} he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him — the [...] "Funny how? Do I amuse you?" [...] scene — is based on an actual event that happened to Pesci. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Her painting of the bearded man with the dogs was based on a photograph from National Geographic magazine. The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot until a few weeks before it premiered. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's {{bodyguard}} {{and assistant}} for several years, {{and was a}} friend of the singer. He stated, [...] "The last time my father left his house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time... was with Michael Jackson. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it...</b> He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service." [...] "Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. For that I will always be indebted to him. Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days, and he was on oxygen much of the time. He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. Dad could name all the trees there, and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and see them all, it's such a big place. So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland. They'd just drive around—Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando, with an oxygen tank in a golf cart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> himself also.

He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone.

Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2016, Khan {{was seen}} in a {{supporting}} role in Shakun Batra's family drama Kapoor & Sons. The film, which featured Khan with an ensemble cast including Rishi Kapoor, Ratna Pathak Shah, Rajat Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, and Alia Bhatt, became a commercial success upon its release, and Khan received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics for his portrayal of Rahul Kapoor, a writer who is revealed to be a closeted homosexual. Bollywood Hungama's review praised Khan's performance saying, [...] "As far as performances are concerned, the film totally belongs to Fawad Khan, Ratna Pathak Shah and Rajat Kapoor." [...] It continued, [...] "He surprises everyone with his exceptionally sensitive performance that can be rightly termed as a 'straight-from-the-heart' act. The emotional bond that his character develops with the audiences {{is so strong that}} almost everyone will want to have a son and a brother like him." [...] Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chaterjee said, [...] "On the acting front, Fawad Khan steals the show with an impressively modulated, confident performance as an achiever condemned to perpetually carry the burden of expectation and hide his true self behind a wall of falsehoods." [...] Kapoor & Sons also earned him the Diversity Award at Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Six actors, including Karan Johar, rejected the role of Rahul Kapoor. The film's producer said, [...] "We went to six actors and after six rejections, I told Shakun Batra (director) that we should drop the idea and he started developing another screenplay. Later, in a flash of thought Fawad came to my mind. I sent him the script, <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it</b> and said he would do it." [...] Later in 2016, he appeared in a small role opposite Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Karan Johar's romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Critics noted that Khan's role was too short to judge. Raja Sen of Rediff.com said, [...] "As the princely DJ, Fawad Khan has far too little to do in this film —though even a role with him on-screen throughout the film wouldn't have justified the ridiculous kerfuffle his casting has caused — but looks perfect for the part." [...] Subhash K. Jha of Deccan Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fawad's entry is welcome and his exit baffling. Why does he reject Anushka’s love? If you are a Fawad fan, his meagre presence and sketchy role would infuriate you." [...] Following the Uri terror attack, bilateral relations between India and Pakistan took a downturn resulting in the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA) and The Film Producers Guild of India deciding to ban all Pakistani artists from working in India until the situation normalises.|$|E
