50|$|N-cadherin, {{also known}} as Cadherin-2 (CDH2) or neural cadherin (NCAD) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CDH2 gene. CDH2 has also been {{designated}} as CD325 (cluster of differentiation 325). N-cadherin is a transmembrane protein expressed in multiple tissues and functions to mediate cell-cell adhesion. In cardiac muscle, N-cadherin is an integral component in adherens junctions residing at intercalated discs, which function to mechanically and <b>electrically</b> <b>couple</b> adjacent cardiomyocytes. While mutations in CDH2 have not thus far been associated with human disease, alterations in expression and integrity of N-cadherin protein has been observed in various forms of disease, including human dilated cardiomyopathy.|$|E
50|$|Gap {{junctions}} {{allow the}} action {{potential to be}} transferred from one cell to the next (they are said to <b>electrically</b> <b>couple</b> neighbouring cardiac cells). They are made from the connexin family of proteins, that form a pore, through which ions (including Na+, Ca2+ and K+ can pass). As potassium is highest within the cell, it is mainly potassium that passes through. This increased potassium in the neighbour cell, causes the membrane potential to increase slightly, activating the sodium channels and initiating an action potential in this cell. These connections allow for the rapid conduction of the action potential throughout the heart and is responsible for allowing all of the cells in the atria to contract together {{as well as all}} of the cells in the ventricles. Uncoordinated contraction of heart muscles is the basis for arrhythmia and heart failure.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, we {{introduced}} a new electrochemical imaging technique called fluorescence-enabled electrochemical microscopy (FFEM). The central idea of FEEM is that a closed bipolar electrode is utilized to <b>electrically</b> <b>couple</b> a redox reaction of interest to a complementary fluorogenic reaction converting an electrochemical signal into a fluorescent signal. This simple strategy enables one to use fluorescence microscopy to observe conventional electrochemical processes on very large electrochemical arrays. The initial demonstration of FEEM focused {{on the use of}} a specific fluorogenic indicator, resazurin, which is reduced to generate highly fluorescent resorufin. The use of resazurin has enabled the study of analyte oxidation reactions, such as the oxidation of dopamine and H 2 O 2. In this report, we extend the capability of FEEM to the study of cathodic reactions using a new fluorogenic indicator, dihydroresorufin. Dihydroresorufin is a nonfluorescent molecule, which can be electrochemically oxidized to generate resorufin. The use of dihydroresorufin has enabled us to study a series of reducible analyte species including Fe(CN) ...|$|E

We used connexin- 36 knock-out mice (Cx 36 (-/-)) {{to study the}} importance of electrical coupling between interneurons for spatial coding in the hippocampus and for different forms of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory.

Temporal coding, assessed by determining the presence and characteristics of theta phase precession, had different dynamics in Cx 36 (-/-) mice compared with controls. At the behavioral level, Cx 36 (-/-) mice displayed impaired short-term spatial memory but normal spatial reference memory.

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} between fine unmyelinated axons can <b>electrically</b> <b>couple</b> {{groups of}} brain neu-rons to synchronise firing {{and contribute to}} rhythmic activity. To explore the distribution and significance of electrical coupling, we modelled a well analysed, small population of brain-stem neurons which drive swimming in young frog tadpoles. A passive network of 30 multi-compartmental neurons with unmyelinated axons was used to infer that: axon-axon gap junctions close to the soma gave the best match to experimentally measured coupling coefficients; axon diameter had a strong influence on coupling; most neurons were coupled indirectly via the axons of other neurons. When active channels were added, gap junctions could make action potential propagation along the thin axons unreliable. Increased sodium and decreased potassium channel densities in the initial axon segment improved action po-tential propagation. Modelling suggested that the single spike firing to step current injection observed in whole-cell recordings is not a cellular property but a dynamic consequence of shunting resulting from electrical coupling.

40|$|Background—Traditional {{pharmacological}} therapies aiming {{to modify the}} abnormal electrophysiological substrate underlying cardiac arrhythmias may be limited by their relatively low efficacy, global cardiac activity, and significant proarrhythmic effects. We suggest a new approach, in which transfected cellular grafts expressing various ionic channels {{may be used to}} manipulate the local electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue. To examine the feasibility of this concept, we tested the hypothesis that transfected fibroblasts expressing the voltage-sensitive potassium channel Kv 1. 3 can modify the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytic cultures. Methods and Results—A high-resolution multielectrode mapping technique was used to assess the electrophysiological and structural properties of primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The transfected fibroblasts, added to the cardiomyocytic cultures, caused a significant effect on the conduction properties of the hybrid cultures. These changes were manifested by significant reduction in extracellular signal amplitude and by the appearance of multiple local conduction blocks. The location of all conduction blocks correlated with the spatial distribution of the transfected fibroblasts assessed by vital staining. All electrophysiological changes were reversed after the application of Charybdotoxin, a specific Kv 1. 3 blocker. In contrast, conduction remained uniform in the control hybrid cultures when nontransfected fibroblasts were used.

Oxidant stress, reduced Cx 43 expression, and altered subcellular localization are present in many forms of structural heart disease. These changes in Cx 43 lead to alterations in electrical conduction in the ventricle and predispose to lethal cardiac arrhythmias. In their study {{in this issue of}} the JCI, Smyth et al. tested the hypothesis that oxidant stress perturbs connexon forward trafficking along microtubules to gap junctions (see the related article beginning on page 266). Failing human ventricular myocardium exhibited a reduction in Cx 43 and the microtubule-capping protein EB 1 at intercalated discs. Oxidant stress in the adult mouse heart reduced N-cadherin, EB 1, and Cx 43 colocalization. In HeLa cells and neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes, peroxide exposure displaced EB 1 from the plus ends of microtubules and altered microtubule dynamics. Mutational disruption of the EB 1 -tubulin interaction mimicked the effects of oxidant stress, including a reduction in surface Cx 43 expression.

However, evidence demonstrating current can passively spread across scar {{tissue in the}} intact heart remains elusive. We hypothesize electrotonic conduction occurs across non-myocyte gaps in the heart and is partly mediated by Connexin 43 (Cx 43). We investigated whether non-myocytes in ventricular scar tissue are electrically connected to surrounding myocardial tissue in wild type and fibroblast-specific protein- 1 driven conditional Cx 43 knock-out mice (Cx 43 fsp 1 KO). Electrical coupling between the scar and uninjured myocardium was demonstrated by injecting current into the myocardium and recording depolarization in the scar through optical mapping. Coupling was significantly reduced in Cx 43 fsp 1 KO hearts. Voltage signals were recorded using microelectrodes from control scars but no signals were obtained from Cx 43 fsp 1 KO hearts. Recordings showed significantly decreased amplitude, depolarized resting membrane potential, increased duration and reduced upstroke velocity compared to surrounding myocytes, suggesting that the non-excitable cells in the scar closely follow myocyte action potentials. These results were further validated by mathematical simulations. Optical mapping demonstrated that current delivered within the scar could induce activation of the surrounding myocardium. These data demonstrate non-myocytes in the scar are electrically coupled to myocytes, and coupling depends on Cx 43 expression...|$|E

This idea has recently come into {{the reach of the}} established domain of silicon technology, leading to the realization of single-atom transistors and to the first measurements of electron spin dynamics in single donors. Here we show that we can <b>electrically</b> <b>couple</b> two donors embedded in a multi-gate silicon transistor, and induce coherent oscillations in their charge states by means of microwave signals.

The lowest energy states, corresponding to a single electron located on either of the two donors, form a two-level system (TLS) well separated from all other electronic levels. Gigahertz driving of this TLS results in a quantum interference pattern associated with the absorption or the stimulated emission of up to ten microwave photons. We estimate a charge dephasing time of 0. 3 nanoseconds, consistent with other types of charge quantum bits. Here, however, the relatively short coherence time can be counterbalanced by fast operation signals (in principle up to 1 terahertz) as allowed by the large empty energy window separating ground and excited states in donor atoms.
