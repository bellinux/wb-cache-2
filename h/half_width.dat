40|$|The {{strengths}} and self-broadened <b>half</b> <b>widths</b> of 18 {{lines of the}} first overtone band of hydrogen fluoride have been measured using a direct measurement method. The lines were assumed to have the Lorentz or combination Lorentz-Doppler shape. Matrix elements have been calculated for a dipole moment function of the form [mu](r) = [Sigma]kMk(r-re) k. Best values of M 1 and M 2 {{were found to be}} M 1 = 1. 51 x 10 - 10 esu and M 2 = - 3. 74 x 10 - 3 esu/cm for a rotating Morse oscillator and M 1 = 1. 52 x 10 - 10 esu and M 2 = - 2. 15 x 10 - 3 esu/cm for the rotating anharmonic oscillator. Line widths were calculated using the Anderson theory. The first-order effect of the vibrational quantum number on the <b>half</b> <b>widths</b> has been taken into account, and a comparison with measurements on the pure rotation and fundamental bands has been made. The measurements show good agreement with theory in that the <b>half</b> <b>widths</b> tend to decrease with increasing [Delta]v. Also in agreement with theory, measured values in the P branch are greater than in the R branch for moderate values of |m|. As |m| increases and the shorter range forces become more important, the R-branch widths tend to become greater than the corresponding lines in the P branch...|$|R

5000|$|The main drift chamber (MDC) is {{the first}} inner {{detector}} layer around the beam pipe and collision point. The MDC's main purpose is to measure the momentum and energy loss per unit distance (dE/dx) from charged particles. The chamber is 2.4 meters long and contains 6796 gold coated 25-micron tungsten signal wires that are arranged in 44 cylindrical layers. The <b>half</b> <b>width</b> of the inner 8 layers is 6 mm and the <b>half</b> <b>width</b> of the outer layers are 8.1 mm. Between the wires, a mixture of Helium and Propane gas are mixed together {{at a ratio of}} 60/40, designed to minimize multiple scattering and maintain a high dE/dx. Aluminum 110-micron wires are strung across the chamber for field shaping. As a charged particle passes through the chamber the gas becomes ionized along the path of the particle and the ions drift to the nearest wires. The particles path will be curved because of the magnetic field the solenoid creates. The amount of curvature allows for the momentum of the particle to be calculated.|$|E

50|$|Today, the {{perimeter}} track {{has been largely}} reduced to a single-lane farm road {{as much of the}} airfield has been returned to agricultural use. A large section of the 06/24 secondary runway still exists, although reduced to <b>half</b> <b>width.</b> In aerial photography, however, much of the former wartime airfield's runways and hardstands can be seen as disturbances on the landscape, giving a ghostly appearance to the area. A large Type B.1 hangar also survives in agricultural use on the Leckford Estate which occupies the SW corner of the former airfield.|$|E
5000|$|Resolution {{enhancement}} in spectroscopy. Bands in {{the second}} derivative of a spectroscopic curve are narrower than the bands in the spectrum: they have reduced half-width. This allows partially overlapping bands to be [...] "resolved" [...] into separate (negative) peaks. The diagram illustrates how this may be used also for chemical analysis, using measurement of [...] "peak-to-valley" [...] distances. In this case the valleys are a property of the 2nd derivative of a Lorentzian. (x-axis position is relative {{to the position of}} the peak maximum on a scale of <b>half</b> <b>width</b> at half height).|$|E
5000|$|Location of maxima and minima in {{experimental}} data curves. This was the application that first motivated Savitzky. The first derivative of a function is zero at a maximum or minimum. The diagram shows data points {{belonging to a}} synthetic Lorentzian curve, with added noise (blue diamonds). Data are plotted {{on a scale of}} <b>half</b> <b>width,</b> relative to the peak maximum at zero. The smoothed curve (red line) and 1st. derivative (green) were calculated with 7-point cubic Savitzky-Golay filters. Linear interpolation of the first derivative values at positions either side of the zero-crossing gives the position of the peak maximum. 3rd. derivatives can also be used for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} {{high order}} derivative spectroscopy technique {{has been developed}} for deriving wavelength positions, <b>half</b> <b>widths,</b> and heights of absorption bands in reflectance spectra. The technique is applicable to laboratory spectra as well as medium resolution (100 - 200 /cm) telescope or spacecraft spectra with moderate (few percent) noise. The technique permits absorption band positions to be detected with an accuracy of better than 3 %, and often better than 1 %. The high complexity of radiative transfer processes in diffusely reflected spectra can complicate the determination of absorption band positions. Continuum reflections, random illumination geometries within the material, phase angle effects, composite overlapping bands, and calibration uncertainties can shift apparent band positions by 20 % from their actual positions or mask them beyond detection. Using multiple high order derivative analysis, effects of scattering continua, phase angle, and calibration (smooth features) are suppressed. Inflection points that characterize the positions and <b>half</b> <b>widths</b> of constituent bands are enhanced by the process and directly detected with relatively high sensitivity...|$|R

Ghostly outlines of large numbers of loop dispersal hardstands can be seen in aerial photography, with the perimeter track being reduced to a single lane road.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10.5-11.0 mm. The head, thorax and tegula are olive. The forewings are broadly rounded triangular, dark olive with inconspicuous slender whitish transverse fascia at one-fifth {{length of}} the wing and a relatively large transversely elongate white discal spot. The distal one-sixth is darkened, diffused with eight small pink-violet metallic spots along the termen.

50|$|The {{national}} flag of Antigua and Barbuda was adopted on 27 February, 1967 {{to mark the}} achievement of self-government. A competition to design the flag was held {{in which more than}} 600 local people entered. The winning design was put forth by nationally acclaimed artist and sculptor Sir Reginald Samuel. The design is a red field with an inverted isosceles triangle based on the top edge of the field pointed toward the bottom edge of the field bearing the horizontal tricolour of black, light blue (<b>half</b> <b>width)</b> and white with the rising sun centred on top of the black band. The rising sun symbolises the dawning of a new era. The colours have different meanings, the black is for the African ancestry of the people, the blue for hope, the red for energy or dynamism of the people. The successive colouring of yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) also stands for the sun, sea, and sand. The blue also represents the Caribbean Sea, and the V-shape is the symbol of victory. The state ensign, which is used only by the national coast guard, consists of a white field, a red cross, and the state flag in the canton.|$|E
50|$|When a {{continuum}} radiation source {{is used for}} AAS measurement it is indispensable {{to work with a}} high-resolution monochromator. The resolution has to be equal to or better than the <b>half</b> <b>width</b> of an atomic absorption line (about 2 pm) in order to avoid losses of sensitivity and linearity of the calibration graph. The research with high-resolution (HR) CS AAS was pioneered by the groups of O’Haver and Harnly in the USA, who also developed the (up until now) only simultaneous multi-element spectrometer for this technique. The break-through, however, came when the group of Becker-Ross in Berlin, Germany, built a spectrometer entirely designed for HR-CS AAS. The first commercial equipment for HR-CS AAS was introduced by Analytik Jena (Jena, Germany) {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, based on the design proposed by Becker-Ross and Florek. These spectrometers use a compact double monochromator with a prism pre-monochromator and an echelle grating monochromator for high resolution. A linear charge coupled device (CCD) array with 200 pixels is used as the detector. The second monochromator does not have an exit slit; hence the spectral environment at both sides of the analytical line becomes visible at high resolution. As typically only 3-5 pixels are used to measure the atomic absorption, the other pixels are available for correction purposes. One of these corrections is that for lamp flicker noise, which is independent of wavelength, resulting in measurements with very low noise level; other corrections are those for background absorption, as will be discussed later.|$|E
