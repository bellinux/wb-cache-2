500|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 January 1386, Dame Nicole de Carrouges {{departed}} her chateau at Capomesnil for the neighbouring town of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives where she had legal business to attend to. Although the journey was only a short one, she apparently took {{some or all of}} the household servants with her, leaving her daughter-in-law unattended during the day. Marguerite's testimony then alleged that a man-at-arms named Adam Louvel knocked on the chateau door, which Marguerite opened herself in the absence of servants. According to Marguerite, Louvel then made enquiries about a loan he owed Jean de Carrouges before suddenly announcing that Jacques Le Gris was outside the door and insisted on seeing her. At her refusal, Louvel exclaimed that [...] "he loves you passionately, he will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and he greatly desires to see you". Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris then forced his way into the house and propositioned her, offering money if she would remain silent of their affair. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris then violently raped her with the aid of Louvel and threatened her not to tell anyone what had occurred on pain of death.|$|E

6000|$|... "You quite understand, Mr. Hilliard, {{that you}} are taking your life in your hands? And {{that there is no}} possibility, whatever, of our <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> if you get into trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens, I don't want a return. If I've <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> I've <b>done</b> {{it because}} I love you. You owe me nothing. I don't {{want you to}} <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> unless you love me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Madam Mother?" [...] asked Laurie, {{leaning over}} Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Mollett; if I could <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{it would}} gratify me, for I {{sincerely}} feel for you,--both {{for you and}} for your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{talk like}} {{a man in the}} dark; which is what you are. Did she ever <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> Risk her name, for instance, for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They've {{let you do}} anyhow {{and they}} haven't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> I've only to look and see that much. I'll come, and I'll be glad to come, but you must go and be shaved, and you must get some other clothes--those ones aren't fit to be seen.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{the girl}} said; [...] "I would have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Harry. To {{think of your}} being hidden so close to us, while we were {{sleeping}} quietly. I will at once get you some food, and then you and Herbert can talk over what is best to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's made a-purpose,' {{said the}} Djinn, 'all because you missed those three days. You {{will be able}} to work now for three days without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don't you ever say I never <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Did I do so much?" [...] {{asked the}} boy with {{innocent}} wonder; [...] "I never knew it, and always thought you had grown happier and kinder because I had learned to love you more. I'm very glad if I <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> who <b>do</b> so much for us. But tell me of the book; you never would before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the way to}} talk, Mr. Grisley. You {{give him}} ten dollars and you keep the fifteen dollars for your own trouble," [...] cried Tom. [...] "So far as I can see he hasn't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{excepting}} {{to come here to}} see Mr. Sanderson, and certainly such a trip as this isn't worth more than ten dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For goodness' sake,' he said, irritably, 'don't {{look like}} that. I'm {{not asking you}} to commit murder. What's the matter with you? Look here, Mary; you'll admit you owe me something, I suppose? I'm the only man in New York that's ever <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Didn't I get you your job?

6000|$|... "Ah, yes; I see," [...] said Butterwell. [...] "It's very unfortunate; very. I don't {{know that}} I can <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Will you {{come before the}} Board to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand. You asked {{just now}} if <b>you</b> could <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> me. <b>You</b> can <b>do</b> {{me a great}} service--you can {{recommend}} me a trustworthy lawyer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> my poor fellow?" [...] she said, {{approaching}} where Tom lay; [...] "shall I {{give you}} some more water?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't hurt them, my lord; {{and people}} make allusion to {{everything}} now-a-days. The bishop can't <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>For</b> aught <b>you</b> know he and Fenwick may be bosom friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's human nature! I {{can tell}} a lie if you want it. I'd <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> But you may tell him this: I'm very sorry I struck him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, there's no hurry," [...] he said lazily. [...] "Life {{is rather}} a long affair--if you live. There {{appears to be}} plenty of time, though people say not, and I {{think it would be}} rather odious to make every day of use. Let a few of them go by without <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you!</b> And as <b>for</b> reading, why not read when you're hungry, just as you eat? Shouldn't you hate to take up a course of roast beef, or a course of turkey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, {{when you}} said just now that <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> father, <b>you</b> didn’t mean it, then?" [...] said Joan. [...] "And {{when you said}} you’d die for me, you—" ...|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} at him with a gleam of {{comprehension}} in his watery eyes. [...] "Jimmy," [...] he said, [...] "you have been a good son--and it wasn't quite my fault I never <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Your mother was often ailing, and when I sent her East twice to the specialists the freights I was getting would scarcely foot the bill. Oh, yes, things were generally tight with me. Now they're tight again; but when Merril wants my blood you've come back to see it out with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have come}} {{to thank you for}} your berries, and to ask if we can <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> because this is our holiday and we can become visible to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going out}} to get some little matters for my girls. Can I <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> young ladies?" [...] asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like an {{elephant}} in silk and lace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Legal fiction," [...] said Mr. Blendershin. [...] "Everyone understands. If {{you don't}} do that, my dear chap, we can't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> It's Journalism, or London docks. Well, {{considering}} your experience,--say docks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think they}} would <b>do</b> maist <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> sir," [...] Mac-witty said. [...] "They have that {{confidence}} in you, they would go through fire and water {{if you were to}} lead them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And yet <b>you</b> won't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> us? <b>You</b> ain't above {{taking all}} our money and seeing us starve; {{and that when}} you have got {{everything}} round you here like an estated gentleman, as you are?' ...|$|R
