500|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the durability of Radioactive Man #1000, Comic Book Guy pours soda on it, which bounces off and instead damages a batch of [...] "lesser" [...] comics. On top of the batch {{is an issue of}} Bongo Comics, a comic book written by Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons. The comedian Gallagher is shown doing his routine with a watermelon during a flashback. [...] While in The Android's Dungeon, Nelson examines a comic book called The Death of Sad Sack, a reference to both the American comic strip The Sad Sack and the [...] "Death of Superman" [...] story arc. When Homer and Comic Book Guy enter Moe's Tavern, Moe says [...] "Get out and take your Sacagawea dollars with you" [...] to one of his customers. A Sacagawea dollar is a United States dollar coin which has been minted since 2000. After he is thrown out of Moe's Tavern, Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>says</b> the word [...] "loneliness" [...] in Klingon, a language used by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe. While arguing with Agnes, Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Now I know what ever happened to Baby Jane." [...] The line is a reference to the 1960 suspense novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Martin's mother tries to sell Comic Book Guy several items relating to the Star Wars film series including Carrie Fisher's [...] "anti-jiggle breast tape", George Lucas' handwritten original script of [...] and a film of a supposed alternate ending for the series where it is revealed that [...] "Luke's father is Chewbacca." ...|$|E
500|$|The creators called [...] "Sinestro Corps War" [...] "World War II {{with the}} entire universe". In a September 2007 interview, Johns {{compared}} [...] "Sinestro Corps War" [...] to the Star Wars trilogy, with [...] as A New Hope and [...] "Sinestro Corps War" [...] as The Empire Strikes Back. References to other science fiction stories were made by artist Ivan Reis, who inserted characters such as E.T., ALF and a Predator into large two-page illustrations. The writers also included the sound [...] "EPA" [...] in Green Lantern #25 as a direct reference to a scene in The Simpsons Movie where Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>says</b> it is the sound Green Lantern made when Sinestro [...] threw him in a vat of acid.|$|E
500|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} Wenger's first without Rice, {{who retired in}} late spring. Bould was named as his replacement, who {{specialised}} in defensive work. Arsenal struggled to find consistency {{in the league and}} were 12 points behind leaders Manchester United by November 2012. A month later, Wenger came under strong criticism following his side's exit in the League Cup to Bradford City, when a full-strength team lost on penalties to opposition three divisions below. Further cup defeats to Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich in the FA Cup and Champions League, respectively, ended Arsenal's trophy chances for an eighth consecutive season. Before the first leg, Wenger had criticised the media for reporting he was about to sign a contract extension, and said of the Blackburn game: [...] "We lost it in the last 20 minutes, {{so there are a lot}} of superficial analyses that you cannot accept. Because one <b>guy</b> <b>says</b> something, everybody goes the same way".|$|E

500|$|Although Butch Trucks {{recalls the}} entire {{ensemble}} as comfortable with studio recording, another source claims that Johanson, Betts and Oakley were unfamiliar with studio recording, but nevertheless not intimidated. [...] "They {{were out of}} their element in New York, hustled by a chap with an English accent," [...] said Dowd of Barber. He spoke of Barber's direction as [...] "perhaps intimidating, or push-push, shove-shove. 'Do what the <b>guy</b> <b>says</b> and let’s get out of here.'" [...] "Dreams", which later gained regard among band members as {{the high point of}} the record, was the only song in which the group got stuck, due to Duane Allman's displeasure with his guitar solo. The performance captured on record came when Duane instructed the other members to turn off all the lights in the studio after the day's session, and sat in a corner beside his amp and baffle. Allman played slide guitar (which was not employed in previous attempts) and improvised the overdubbed performance, bringing all of the members to tears. [...] "It was unbelievable," [...] recalled Trucks. [...] "It was just magic. It’s always been that the greatest music we played was from out of nowhere, that it wasn’t practiced, planned, or discussed." ...|$|E

Also, Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>says</b> he is not jolly because San Diego Comic-Con International might be moving to Anaheim.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars [...] "generally {{agree that}} the early church baptized by immersion", but {{sometimes}} used other forms. Howard Marshall says that immersion was the general rule, but affusion and even sprinkling were also practised, [...] His presentation of this view {{has been described by}} Porter and Cross as [...] "a compelling argument". Laurie <b>Guy</b> <b>says</b> immersion was probably the norm, but that at various times and places full immersion, partial immersion and affusion were probably in use.|$|E

5000|$|Webb {{called the}} song a [...] "succinct tale" [...] with an [...] "O. Henry-esque twist at the end, which {{consists}} merely of the <b>guy</b> <b>saying,</b> 'She didn't {{really think that}} I would go,' but he did." [...] Although the protagonist in the song left his lover, Webb did not leave Horton.|$|R
2500|$|Kenny G has {{attracted}} significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Pat Metheny {{stated that he}} was a [...] "pop" [...] saxophonist, [...] "but was not really an advanced player, even in that style", adding that he had [...] "major rhythmic problems" [...] and that his [...] "harmonic and melodic vocabulary was extremely limited, mostly to pentatonic based and blues-lick derived patterns". Metheny believes that the main reason why Kenny G has become unpopular and easy to attack by accomplished jazz musicians is due to the [...] "fact that he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years". [...] Branford Marsalis once stated in an interview with Jazziz magazine: [...] "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz. The audience he has wouldn't be caught dead at a real jazz concert or club. It's not like some <b>guy</b> <b>says,</b> ‘You know, I used to listen to Miles, 'Trane and Ornette. And then I heard Kenny G, and I never put on another Miles record.' It's a completely different audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The <b>guy</b> <b>says</b> he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E
