25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham. Field {{was held in}} police custody for more than the {{lawfully}} prescribed 24 hours in order to assist the investigation. He denied knowing Tutill or having {{anything to do with}} his death, and whilst admitting to his historic offences against boys said he had put that behaviour behind him. Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field could not sleep that night and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill. He said he had seen a boy get off a bus and thumb for a lift and that he had picked him up. He said he drove the boy to a layby where he anally raped him over the front seat. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finished he panicked and then strangled the boy with his own school tie, he kept the body in his car's boot for several days before dumping him in woodland.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{dialogue}} {{system was}} inspired by Shin Megami Tensei (1992), particularly the gameplay mechanic whereby players can talk to monsters to avoid conflict. Fox intended to expand upon this mechanic, as failing to negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight. [...] "I {{want to create a}} system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> began developing this mechanic, the concept of completing the game without killing any enemies [...] "just evolved naturally". However, he never considered removing the option to fight throughout development. When questioned on the difficulty of playing the game without killing, Fox responded that it is [...] "the crux of one of the major themes of this game", asking players to think about it themselves.|$|E

500|$|John Bishop {{has been}} the most vocal {{supporter}} of treating Finnegans Wake absolutely, in every sense, as a description of a dream, the dreamer, and of the night itself; arguing that the book not only represents a dream in an abstract conception, but is fully a literary representation of sleep. On the subject Bishop writes: [...] The greatest obstacle to our comprehension of Finnegans Wake [...] the failure on the part of readers to believe that Joyce really meant what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> spoke of the book as a [...] "reconstruction of the nocturnal life" [...] and an [...] "imitation of the dream-state"; and as a consequence readers have perhaps too easily exercised on the text an unyielding literalism bent on finding a kind of meaning in every way antithetical to the kind of meaning purveyed in dreams [...] Bishop has also somewhat brought back into fashion the theory that the Wake is about a single sleeper; arguing that it is not [...] "the 'universal dream' of some disembodied global everyman, but a reconstruction of the night – and a single night – as experienced by 'one stable somebody' whose 'earwitness' on the real world is coherently chronological." [...] Bishop has laid the path for critics such as Eric Rosenbloom, who has proposed that the book [...] "elaborates the fragmentation and reunification of identity during sleep. The masculine [...] mind of the day has been overtaken by the feminine night mind. [...] The characters live in the transformation and flux of a dream, embodying the sleeper’s mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> heard the two gunshots, he looked {{through the window and}} saw a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him to tell him about the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E

[...] <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> played in the field, he liked to wear a very loose glove — i.e., one that was floppy.

He {{took an interest in}} computing and learned to program from one of the laboratory's engineers.

He presented a demonstration of his compiler to the members of a Danish computer trade delegation.

2500|$|Serialism allowed Copland a {{synthesis}} of serial and non-serial practices. Before he did this, according to musicologist Joseph Straus, the philosophical and compositional difference between non-tonal composers such as Schoenberg and tonal composers like Stravinsky had been considered too wide a gulf to bridge. Copland wrote that, to him, serialism pointed in two opposite directions, one [...] "toward the extreme of total organization with electronic applications" [...] and the other [...] "a gradual absorption into what had become a very freely interpreted tonalism [...]" [...] The path he said he chose was the latter one, which <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> described his Piano Fantasy, allowed him to incorporate [...] "elements able {{to be associated with}} the twelve-tone method and also with music tonally conceived." [...] This practice differed markedly from Schoenberg, who used his tone rows as complete statements around which to structure his compositions. Copland used his rows not much different than how he fashioned the material in his tonal pieces. He saw his rows as sources for melodies and harmonies, not as complete and independent entities, except at points in the musical structure that dictated the complete statement of a row.|$|E

2500|$|Most Meccans {{ignored it}} and a few mocked him, while some others became his followers. According to Ibn Sad, in this period the Quraysh [...] "did not criticize what <b>he</b> <b>said...</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> passed by them as they sat in groups, they would point out to him and say [...] "There is the youth of the clan of Abd al-Muttalib who speaks (things) from heaven." [...] According to Welch, the Qur'anic verses at this time were not [...] "based on a dogmatic {{conception}} of monotheism but on a strong general moral and religious appeal". Its key themes include the moral responsibility of man towards his creator: {{the resurrection of the}} dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in hell and pleasures in paradise; the wonders of nature and everyday life, particularly the phenomenon of man, as signs of God to show the existence of a greater power who will take into account the greed of people and their suppression of the poor. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill new-born & under-aged girls.|$|E
2500|$|Kaká is {{a devout}} evangelical Christian {{who was an}} active member of the São Paulo-based Rebirth in Christ Church. He became engrossed in {{religion}} at the age of 12: [...] "I learnt that it is faith that decides whether something will happen or not." [...] He removed his jersey to reveal an [...] "I Belong to Jesus" [...] T-shirt and openly engaged in prayer moments after the final whistle of Brazil's 2002 World Cup, and Milan's 2004 Scudetto and 2007 Champions League triumphs. He also had the same phrase, along with [...] "God Is Faithful," [...] stitched onto the tongues of his boots. During the post-match celebration following Brazil's 4–1 win over Argentina in the 2005 Confederations Cup final, he and several of his teammates wore T-shirts that read [...] "Jesus Loves You" [...] in various languages. While receiving the FIFA World Footballer of the Year award in 2007, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was young he just wanted to be a professional player for São Paulo and play one game for the Brazil national team, but that [...] "God gave [...] more than he ever asked for." [...] Though sharing a common goal, Kaká is not currently a formal member of the organization Atletas de Cristo ("Athletes of Christ"). In goal celebrations, he usually points to the sky as a gesture of thanks to God. Kaká's favourite music genre is gospel, and his favourite book is the Bible. In an interview with the Brazilian television O Globo, Kaka manifested the will to become an evangelical pastor.|$|E
