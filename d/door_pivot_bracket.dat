50|$|After 13 {{years of}} production, 1997 saw the Cherokee receive updated {{exterior}} and interior styling. Both the two- and four-door bodies remained in production, receiving a steel liftgate (replacing the fiberglass one used previously), restyled taillights, additional plastic molding along the doors, {{as well as a}} new front header panel that featured more aerodynamic styling. The spare tire was moved from a rear exterior bumper mount to an interior location due to de-contenting the rear bumper. A new, unique spare tire carrier was invented by Peter Gruich while working for Jeep Special Programs that utilized the trailer hitch bar and a unique <b>pivot</b> <b>bracket</b> and although it was the only external spare tire carrier to pass the full Jeep durability test, it was not offered for sale.|$|R

50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle cylinder gear of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the front valve spindles. This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and <b>pivot</b> <b>bracket,</b> affecting the valve events when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination lever assembly to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|R
50|$|The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was {{designed}} by E. S. Samozhenkov and entered service in 1961 and weighs 7.5 kg. The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was earlier envisioned for the Nikitin-Sokoiov machine gun that was not adopted by the Soviet Union. All types of ammunition belt boxes are carried and mounted separately. The Rakov device is used for loading ammunition belts. The PK machine gun {{is attached to a}} cradle on the 6T2 Samozhenkov mount. The cradle is hinged to a plug-in swivel equipped with a rack-and-pinion traversing mechanism, and a rod-and-screw elevation mechanism. The traversing mechanism is fitted with stops to limit the field of fire. For anti-aircraft fire or fire against ground targets from a kneeling position the cradle mounts a collapsible pole with a <b>pivoting</b> <b>bracket.</b> The mount features non-digging-in spades — sliding spades affect the accuracy of fire less than a «jumping» tripod with dug-in spades. There is an extra folding spade on the front leg for slippery and moving ground. Hinged tripod legs allow a gunner to fire the machine gun from a prone, a sitting, or a kneeling position.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept has}} {{butterfly}} <b>doors</b> and <b>pivoted</b> {{up to the}} front to allow passengers to exit from the car in places that ordinary conventional doors cannot handle.

5000|$|Dual and tri-operating gates: Ford's {{full-size}} wagons for 1966 {{introduced a}} system marketed as [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] — a conventional tailgate with retracting rear glass, where the tailgate could either fold down or pivot open {{on a side}} hinge — with the rear window retracted in either case. Competitors marketed their versions as a Drop and Swing or Dual Action Tailgate. [...] For 1969, Ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the <b>door</b> <b>pivoted</b> open on its side hinge, marketing the system, which had been engineered by Donald N. Frey as the [...] "Three-Way Magic Doorgate". Similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate wagons from GM, Ford, and Chrysler. GM added a notch in the rear bumper that acted as a step plate; to fill the gap, {{a small portion of}} bumper was attached to the doorgate. When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a [...] "step" [...] to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper [...] "whole".|$|R
25|$|A <b>pivot</b> <b>door,</b> {{instead of}} hinges, is {{supported}} on a bearing {{some distance away}} from the edge, {{so that there is}} more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.|$|R

This was due to legislation introduced in some markets regarding the rear <b>pivot</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other common {{devices for}} {{containing}} water spray include a highly flexible, waterproof shower curtain, or more recently, a shower door, {{which is a}} permanently installed sliding or <b>pivoting</b> <b>door</b> made from glass or plastic. Containing water spray, leaks, and splashes within the bathtub is particularly important in bathrooms constructed with wooden under-flooring because water causes the wooden floor boards and floor joists to rot or decay over time, if left unattended.|$|R
50|$|The Drift Sight {{was mounted}} {{to the side}} of the {{aircraft}} using two brackets at the front and back of the sights. The forward <b>bracket</b> had a <b>pivot</b> point, and the rear a screw jack that rotated the entire sighting system up or down around the front <b>bracket's</b> <b>pivot.</b> This allowed fine adjustment of the levelling of the sight during flight to account for changes in trim; after making these adjustments the system was locked in position using wingnuts. This mounting system was common among early British bombsights, notably the Equal Distance Sight that led to the Drift Sight.|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for the steady-state measurement of {{poloidal magnetic field}} near a tokamak plasma, where the tokamak is configured {{with respect to a}} cylindrical coordinate system having z, phi (toroidal), and r axes. The method is based on combining the two magnetic field principles of induction and torque. The apparatus includes a rotor assembly having a pair of inductive magnetic field pickup coils which are concentrically mounted, orthogonally oriented in the r and z directions, and coupled to remotely located electronics which include electronic integrators for determining magnetic field changes. The rotor assembly includes an axle oriented in the toroidal direction, with the axle mounted on <b>pivot</b> support <b>brackets</b> which in turn are mounted on a baseplate. First and second springs are located between the baseplate and the rotor assembly restricting rotation of the rotor assembly about its axle, the second spring providing a constant tensile preload in the first spring. A strain gauge is mounted on the first spring, and electronic means to continually monitor strain gauge resistance variations is provided. Electronic means for providing a known current pulse waveform to be periodically injected into each coil to create a time-varying torque on the rotor assembly in the toroidal direction causes mechanical strain variations proportional to the torque in the mounting means and springs so that strain gauge measurement of the variation provides periodic magnetic field measurements independent of the magnetic field measured by the electronic integrators...|$|R
50|$|Architecture firm HKS, Inc., also {{responsible}} for the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium and the Indianapolis Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium, {{decided to go for}} a lightweight translucent roof and glazed entrances with giant <b>pivoting</b> <b>doors,</b> aiming to get as much natural light from the outside as possible. The roof is made up of 60% Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a fluorine-based clear plastic, and is the largest in North America, spanning 240000 sq ft supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec. ETFE's low R-factor and the roof's slanted design, inspired by Nordic vernacular architecture, allows the stadium to endure heavy snow loads. Snow accumulates in areas that are more safely and easily accessible, and also moves down the slanted roof into a heated gutter, the water from which drains to the nearby Mississippi River.|$|R

50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type C/T2, Block C retains important fabric that identifies {{it as an}} early Department of Public Works design. It is a high-set, timber-framed building with a northern and southern verandah and a gable roof. Four sets of timber stairs provide access to the verandahs and the northern verandah is connected to Block D to the east. The walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. Both the gable end walls have a panel of ventilating weatherboards. The verandah walls are single-skin, lined internally, with chamfered stud framing exposed externally. The verandah walls have a ventilation flap at floor level and retain original double leaf <b>doors</b> with <b>pivoting</b> fanlights. The southern verandah retains a hat room enclosure at its southern end. The interior is partitioned into two rooms connected by a large opening; this partition is not of cultural heritage significance. The interior walls and ceiling are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. The ceiling is coved and has a latticed ventilation panel. Timber tie beams at cornice level are exposed in the space. The fenestration pattern remains intact with windows only in the eastern and western walls sheltered by original timber hoods with timber brackets and battened cheeks. The northern verandah is enclosed at the western end. A small teacher's room projects from both verandahs. A small enclosure of the northern verandah accommodates a store room that is not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
500|$|On {{the north}} side of the {{building}} was a fortified standard gauge railway station, linked to the main Calais-Saint-Omer line at Watten via a [...] spur line. Missiles, warheads and other components would be shipped to the station and transported on trucks into the main area of the bunker. Here the rockets were to be assembled, raised into a vertical position and fuelled and armed. From the arming halls, they would be moved to either end of the building through <b>pivoting</b> <b>doors</b> [...] high. They would exit through the south face of the building and would be moved on tracks to the launch pads. There were no doors on the exit portals so chicanes were installed in the exit passage to deflect the blast of rockets being launched from outside. Launches would be overseen from a command tower located in the centre of the south side of the bunker, overlooking the launch pads.|$|R

Paired timber panelled <b>doors</b> surmounted by <b>pivoting</b> fanlights are located below each arched window and open from the nave and sanctuary onto the side verandahs. The fanlights are glazed to match the arched windows above. Three bays of the southern verandah are enclosed to form a side chapel adjacent to the sanctuary. This side chapel has five narrow reinforced concrete arched window units which are separated by brick piers. All windows in the Cathedral were originally glazed with a burgundy red field and an amber border; however the eastern windows {{and a number of}} the northern windows to the nave and sanctuary have been reglazed with stained/painted glass. Two sets of paired confessionals, which are the same height as the side doors and are surmounted by fanlights, are located on both side verandahs.|$|R
