40|$|In {{order to}} reduce noise and <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> by <b>means</b> of {{flexible}} routing of aircrafts around airports, very high safety standards have to be applied. This is especially true when idle or near idle thrust approach profiles for the operation of aircraft {{in the vicinity of}} airports and cities are applied. Moreover, the accuracy of the flight path to be followed demands highly automated operation of the aircraft, i. e. the aircraft is under direct control of a flight management system (FMS) supervised by the pilot. Depending on individual characteristics, the pilot of the approaching aircraft will be either in a state of medium or standard workload if he is not relying on the automatic flight systems, or reduced to minimum workload if he is relying on those systems. In general, a pilot has very few operation alternatives either to continue the approach or e. g. to start a go-around procedure. Under such conditions, the validation of such a flight procedure represents a scientific challenge since the evaluation will have to be based on each pilot individually. ...|$|R

Thus the standardized diesel fuel was used as reference fuel, and it was compared with the newly developed biofuel called TBK.

40|$|Abstract â€” The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the gaseous <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> along with {{an analysis of the}} size and mass distribution of particulate matter from a Euro V compliant road tractor. The vehicle was fitted with an engine of the displacement of 15, 6 dm 3, maximum power output 412 kW generating a maximum torque of 2700 Nm (1991 lb/ft). For the tests the authors used portable <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> analyzers (PEMS: SEMTECH DS and AVL Micro Soot Sensor. The measurements were conducted under actual operating conditions in traffic typical of long distance European haulage. The analysis of the obtained results was divided into two parts.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of investigations of the influence of vehicle age on traffic <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission.</b> The measurements of the test group of 500 different vehicles have been made in accordance with ECE Regulations and the methodology of periodical car inspection. Those measurements provided information about the level of emission from each vehicle and allowed to identify high polluting vehicles. The percentage of faulty vehicles and the type of faults were estimated. Next, the percentage of high polluting vehicles has been estimated. The results of investigations were compared to the requirements of each model of a given year. The percentage of high polluting vehicles for each model of a given year has been presented. The vehicles have been divided into different <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> legislation classes. The percentage of high polluting vehicles for each <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> legislation class has been elaborated. Next, the relation between <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> and the vehicle age has been made and presented. The probability of exceeding the standardized <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> for each model of a given year of vehicles has been calculated. The calculations included the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. The likelihood of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emission violations have been estimated applying logit analysis. The calculations have been made in two cases, for manufactures and national emission standards.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the test results}} of <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> from the engine of a wheeled harvester. On {{the basis of the}} present analysis, the ranges of most frequently used engine loads and speeds were determined. The obtained time density characteristics (distribution of engine speeds and loads in time) of the engines were referred to the measuring points of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> homologation test. During the measurement of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions,</b> the machine was in the forest engaged in tree cutting. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> tests from non-road vehicle engines are currently performed on engine test beds in the NRSC and NRTC tests. The present methodology is a new solution {{that could be used in}} the future as a basis for the development of harvesting technology aimed at reducing <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> from engines. During the tests, the authors also measured the amount of timber harvested during the felling process in order to be able to relate the emission results to the amount of the generated product. Harvesters are more and more often used in forest operations but they still have to compete with handheld (gasoline powered) chainsaws and that is why in this paper the authors included a comparison of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> from a chainsaw with the emissions from the engine of a harvester.

40|$|Albeit vehicle {{analytical}} {{models are}} often favorable for explainable mathematical trends, no analytical {{model has been}} developed of the regulated diesel <b>exhaust</b> CO <b>emission</b> rate for trucks yet. This research unprecedentedly develops and validates for trucks {{a model of the}} steady speed regulated diesel <b>exhaust</b> CO <b>emission</b> rate analytically. It has been found that the steady speedâ€“based CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> rate is based on (1) CO 2 dissociation, (2) the waterâ€“gas shift reaction, and (3) the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon. It has been found as well that the steady speedâ€“based CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> rate based on CO 2 dissociation is considerably less than the rate that is based on the waterâ€“gas shift reaction. It has also been found that the steady speedâ€“based CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> rate based on the waterâ€“gas shift reaction is the dominant source of CO <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission.</b> The study shows that the average percentage of deviation of the steady speedâ€“based simulated results from the corresponding field data is 1. 7 % for all freeway cycles with 99 % coefficient of determination at the confidence level of 95 %.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the shipping industry has brought great economic benefits but at a great environmental cost; <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> originating from ships are increasing, causing serious atmospheric pollution. Hence, the mitigation of ship <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> {{and the establishment of}} the sustainable ecosystem have become urgent tasks, which will require complicated and comprehensive systematic approaches to solve. We address this problem by establishing a System Dynamics (SD) model to help mitigate regional ship <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> without restricting economic growth and promote the {{development of the}} sustainable ecosystem. Factors correlated with ship <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> are identified, and a causal loop diagram is drawn to describe the complicated interrelations among the correlated factors.

The variation trends of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> and economic benefits for Qingdao port under different scenarios were predicted for the years 2015 â€“ 2025.
