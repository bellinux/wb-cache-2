50|$|In Derivatives trading, a term <b>diagonal</b> <b>spread</b> {{is applied}} to an options spread {{position}} that shares features of both a calendar spread and a vertical spread. It is established by simultaneously buying and selling equal amount of option contracts of the same type (call options or put options) but with different strike prices and expiration dates.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS) generally remains {{restricted to}} one limb but occasionally may {{spread to other}} limbs. Knowledge of the spreading pattern of CRPS may lead to hypotheses about underlying mechanisms but to date {{little is known about}} this process. The objective is to study patterns of spread of CRPS from a first to a second limb and the factors associated with this process. One hundred and eighty-five CRPS patients were retrospectively evaluated. Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to evaluate factors that influenced spread of CRPS symptoms. Eighty-nine patients exhibited CRPS in multiple limbs. In 72 patients spread from a first to a second limb occurred showing a contralateral pattern in 49 %, ipsilateral pattern in 30 % and diagonal pattern in 14 %. A trauma preceded the onset in the second limb in 37, 44 and 91 %, respectively. The hazard of spread of CRPS increased with the number of limbs affected. Compared to patients with CRPS in one limb, patients with CRPS in multiple limbs were on average 7  years younger and more often had movement disorders. In patients with CRPS in multiple limbs, spontaneous spread of symptoms generally follows a contralateral or ipsilateral pattern whereas <b>diagonal</b> <b>spread</b> is rare and generally preceded by a new trauma. Spread is associated with a younger age at onset and a more severely affected phenotype. We argue that processes in the spinal cord as well as supraspinal changes are responsible for spontaneous spread in CRPS...|$|E
50|$|<b>Diagonal</b> <b>spreads</b> are {{constructed}} using options of the same underlying security but different strike prices and expiration dates. They are called <b>diagonal</b> <b>spreads</b> because they are a combination of vertical and horizontal spreads.|$|R
40|$|Documenting {{spread and}} {{combination}} trading {{in a major}} options market for the first time, we find that spreads and combinations collectively account for over 55 % of large trades (trades of 100 contracts or more) in the Eurodollar options market and almost 75 % of the trading volume due to large trades. In terms of total volume, the four most heavily traded combinations are (in order) : straddles, ratio spreads, vertical spreads, and strangles. These four represent about two thirds of all combination trades. On the other hand, condors, horizontal spreads, guts, iron flys, box spreads, guts, covered calls or puts, and synthetics are very rarely traded while trading is light in collars, <b>diagonal</b> <b>spreads,</b> butterflies, straddle spreads, seagulls, doubles, and delta-neutral combinations. Significant differences in size, cost, and time-to-expirations are found among the various combination types. Our results confirm that traders use spreads and combinations to construct portfolios which are highly sensitive to some risk factors and much less sensitive to other risk factors. The most popular combination designs are those yielding portfolios which are quite sensitive to volatility and less sensitive to directional changes in the underlying asset value- thoug...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{separated}} BI-RL is {{to combine}} separately deblurred sub-image blocks into the resulting output image without block artifacts. Obviously, {{this is not}} a new approach. What is new in the proposed separated BI-RL is that the proposed method can suppress block artifacts efficiently for arbitrarily shaped blocks. This flexibility is important for the success of separated BI-RL; simulation results of this paper will show that diagonally shaped blocks produce better results than rectangularly shaped blocks for separated BI-RL in the deblurring problem modeled by a <b>diagonal</b> point <b>spread</b> function (PSF).|$|R
5000|$|The Irano-Anatolian {{region is}} a {{significant}} biodiversity hotspot in the Near East and Anatolia is the transition point between the European and Turko-Iranian floras. Turkey was beyond the southern limit of ice in the last ice age, and Anatolia may {{be considered to be}} a potential glacial refugium for species of plants and animals in Europe. In the late Pleistocene, sea levels in this region were lower than they are today by as much as 130 m and land bridges intermittently formed across the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. [...] After the end of the most recent ice age, plants surviving {{to the west of the}} Anatolian <b>diagonal</b> could <b>spread</b> back into Europe while those to the east could spread into Syria, Iraq and the Near East.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cover for}} {{this issue is}} a {{dramatic}} black-and-white design by Abraham Walkowitz that presaged Jackson Pollock's techniques of the 1940s. The magazine opens to a two-page spread designed by de Zayas that incorporated poems by Rhoades and Meyer. It {{is one of the}} most forceful designs of any issue, in part because the lower right <b>diagonal</b> of the <b>spread</b> is nothing but black ink, but the interplay between the verbal and visual elements was not as compelling as in [...] "Mental Reactions".|$|R
5000|$|The 1908 equipment, when fully assembled, {{formed a}} single piece and could be put on or taken off like a jacket. Ammunition was stored in two sets of pouches {{attached}} to the belt at the front, and the straps from these passed over the shoulders, crossing diagonally at the back. The back pack, or [...] "valise", was attached to these <b>diagonal</b> straps, thus <b>spreading</b> its weight. The [...] "D" [...] shaped buckles and the strap ends were made of brass. The whole set consisted of: ...|$|R
30|$|The HPFRCC {{specimen}} HC- 3.5, {{which was}} reinforced with bundled diagonal reinforcement and one-half {{the amount of}} code-specified transverse steel, showed early flexural cracks at 0.25 % drift. By about 2 % drift, numerous <b>diagonal</b> tension cracks <b>spread</b> over the entire span (Fig.  9 d), and most diagonal bars underwent yielding. However, the cracks were less than 0.5  mm wide at 2 % drift, only one-fourth the width of cracks in RC- 3.5 at the same drift. As in the specimens of aspect ratio 2.0, the cracks in HC- 3.5 were much narrower and fewer than those in RC- 3.5, as shown in Figs.  9 d–f. No buckling in diagonal bars was observed in HC- 3.5. Also, HC- 3.5 did not suffer any spalling damage, until it started to collapse with the rupture of some diagonal bars at 10 % drift (Fig.  9 f).|$|R
