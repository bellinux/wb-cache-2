40|$|ABSTRACT. Fowl {{adenovirus}} (FAdv) serotype 2 causes <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (IBH) disease which adversely {{affects the}} broiler industry in Thailand. We developed an indirect ELISA {{based on the}} recombinant hexon protein produced by E. coli. The recombinant hexon protein was tested with sera, in both infected and noninfected chickens. The recombinant hexon protein was standardized with an antigen concentra-tion of 3. 75 µg/ml and test sera. The intra- and inter-assays were repeatable. The cutoff value from TG-ROC curve analysis was 0. 106. The specificity and sensitivity were 80 and 80 %, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) of absorbance values from this ELISA compared with the serum neutralization test was 0. 76. This ELISA might be helpful for IBH diagnosis and surveillance.
