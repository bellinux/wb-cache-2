5|$|It {{appears that}} Nri had an artistic {{as well as}} {{religious}} influence on the lower Niger. Sculptures <b>found</b> <b>there</b> are bronze like those at Igbo-Ukwu. The great sculptures of the Benin Empire, by contrast, were almost always brass with, over time, increasingly greater percentages of zinc added.|$|E
5|$|Pots and vessels {{were also}} recovered. Pots {{were used for}} cooking, while the large vessels for food import from Oman and Mesopotamia. Artifacts <b>found</b> <b>there</b> {{indicates}} the location.

5|$|Regular bus {{services}} with minivans and taxis {{also can be}} <b>found.</b> <b>There</b> are three bus terminals operating in the town such as the Buses to Sepilok, Local Bus Terminal and the Long Distance Bus Terminal. The long-distance bus terminal is located about 4km north of the town while the local bus connects with {{the centre of the}} town.|$|E

In addition to Afrasia, primates <b>found</b> <b>there</b> include the eosimiid Bahinia; the amphipithecids Pondaungia, Ganlea, and Myanmarpithecus; and the sivaladapids Paukkaungia and Kyitchaungia.|$|E

5|$|The nunatak {{areas have}} a {{scarcity}} of flora, limited to lichen, bryophyte and algae. Flowering plants are not <b>found</b> <b>there.</b> The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.|$|E

5|$|A monumental and {{technically}} complex {{border protection}} area gord of over 3 hectares in size was built around 770–780 in Trzcinica near Jasło {{on the site}} of an old Bronze Age era stronghold, probably the seat of a local ruler and his garrison. Thousands of relics were <b>found</b> <b>there,</b> including a silver treasure of 600 pieces. The gord was set afire several times and ultimately destroyed {{during the first half of}} the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be <b>found</b> <b>there.</b> A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still <b>found</b> <b>there</b> today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E

The Museum of Jewish culture was <b>founded</b> <b>there</b> in 1919, and YIVO – Institute for Jewish Research, was <b>founded</b> <b>there</b> in 1924. A number of important Jewish cultural institutions including theatres, newspapers and magazines, museums and schools, and Jewish PEN-Club were created before Second World War in Vilnius. Four YIVO directors emigrated to New York.|$|R
5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched {{and the other half}} is <b>found</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

Classic music from both series {{is available in the}} gallery once all levels in a category are cleared. The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to display the best times and scores in each event.|$|E
5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods <b>found</b> <b>there.</b> On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being <b>found</b> <b>there),</b> Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|Farm Fields, a {{site near}} Kinloch, {{provides}} some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized hazelnut shells <b>found</b> <b>there</b> have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this hunter-gatherer community may have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{an almost}} {{pristine}} ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be <b>found</b> <b>there.</b> More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.|$|E

5|$|In 1539, {{the fledgling}} colonial town of Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos was moved three leagues {{to the south}} and was given the new name of San Pedro de Puerto Caballos. At this time it {{consisted}} of just twelve palm-thatched houses imitating the native style of construction; in 1541 it had 35 Spanish residents. Montejo also moved Santa María de Comayagua to a more suitable location and assigned 35 conquistadors as its citizens. Rich silver deposits were soon <b>found</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting {{those they}} <b>found</b> <b>there</b> and {{uncovering}} paperwork documenting MK's activities, {{some of which}} mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being <b>found</b> <b>there</b> on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
