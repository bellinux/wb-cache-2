During {{prototyping}} we order a custom <b>flight</b> <b>case</b> - not even a very sturdy one - and place the console in it. The <b>flight</b> <b>case</b> is stood on end, and then tipped over in both directions and allowed to fall to the floor. If the console powers up immediately and works flawless after that ordeal, then it passes the test." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Guitar World, Keeley Electronics {{has grown}} into [...] "one of the world’s top sellers of guitar effects pedals". Keeley claims {{that part of his}} success is due to {{carefully}} selecting electronic components with low tolerance. They opened up a second factory, where they make <b>flight</b> <b>cases</b> and guitar pickups; in 2009, the company briefly moved production of effect pedals there after a fire in the first factory.|$|E
50|$|Larger GCS {{units are}} also {{available}} that typically fit inside <b>flight</b> <b>cases.</b> As with the smaller units, they feature an internal computer running the GCS software, along with video and data links. Large single or dual screens are also fitted that can be high-brightness or treated with an anti-glare coating to increase visibility in bright sunlight. They can either {{be placed on the}} ground, on a portable table, or feature integrated folding legs.|$|E
5000|$|Travel {{bags are}} {{available}} with many combinations of size and features, but are distinguished by rigid and/or heavily padded construction, including the clubhead cover (which on most other bags is simply an unpadded [...] "rain fly"), and locks on the zippers and bag cover. These features protect the clubs from abuse and theft, and generally makes the bag suitable for checked airline luggage. Travel bags are generally used by amateur players that travel occasionally, such as business executives; rigid <b>flight</b> <b>cases</b> that enclose the actual golf bag are generally preferred by touring players, as these cases can enclose any golf bag, are more discreet as to their contents thus further deterring theft, and the case's weight and bulk can be left behind while on the course where it's not needed.|$|E
50|$|Portable {{stage is}} the second most {{important}} products in RaykGlobal after <b>flight</b> <b>case.</b> This series was introduced by the company in 1998. Up to now, the product line is enriched with the introduction of folding stage, steel stage, smart stages and dance floor.|$|R
50|$|The term road case {{is mostly}} {{used in the}} United States and implies that the case is {{primarily}} for road based travel, unlike a <b>flight</b> <b>case.</b> The term originates from its use for storing and shipping band equipment while the musicians were on the road.|$|R
50|$|Batio was the {{inventor}} of the Double-Guitar, a V-shaped, twin-neck guitar which can be played both right- and left-handed. The first version of this instrument was actually two separate guitars simply played together, as opposed to being one entity. A Flying V was fastened to a snare drum in a left-handed position, while another one was strapped around his shoulder. The next version of the guitar, as designed by Batio and guitar technician Kenny Breit, featured a <b>flight</b> <b>case</b> latch attached to the back of each guitar, which could reportedly be assembled in five seconds. By far his most famous and definitely his most photographed double guitar is his USA Dean Mach 7 Jet Double-Guitar along with its custom Anvil <b>flight</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R

50|$|The double bass's {{large size}} and {{relative}} fragility make it cumbersome to handle and transport. Most bassists use soft cases, {{referred to as}} gig bags, to protect the instrument during transport. These range from inexpensive, thin unpadded cases used by students (which only protect against scratches and rain) to thickly padded versions for professional players, which also protect against bumps and impacts. Some bassists carry their bow in a hard bow case; more expensive bass cases have a large pocket for a bow case. Players also may use a small cart and end pin-attached wheels to move the bass. Some higher-priced padded cases have wheels attached to the case. Another option found in higher-priced padded cases are backpack straps, {{to make it easier}} to carry the instrument.Hard <b>flight</b> <b>cases</b> have cushioned interiors and tough exteriors of carbon fiber, graphite, fiberglass, or Kevlar. The cost of good hard cases-several thousand US dollars-and the high airline fees for shipping them tend to limit their use to touring professionals.|$|E
5000|$|George Woodard is an actor, musician, {{and dairy}} farmer in Waterbury Center Vermont. He experimented with acting in high school, {{taking part in}} high school and local summer stock plays and musicals, while {{rebuilding}} the family dairy business. Later, seeking to see what the acting [...] "thing" [...] was all about, he moved to Hollywood, California for approximately four years. During this time, he worked on low budget and student films, learning the mechanics of film production along with screenplay writing, and directing. He also delivered JAN-AL ATA grade <b>flight</b> <b>cases</b> to various rock and roll royalty...to pay the bills. The need for someone to lead the operation of the Woodard family farm brought him home to Vermont. He took over the dairy business and has been doing it ever since.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} procedures typically used to predict convective heating rates to hypersonic reentry vehicles using the two-layer method. These procedures were used to compute the pitch-plane heating distributions to the Apollo geometry for a wind tunnel test case and for three <b>flight</b> <b>cases.</b> Both simple engineering methods and coupled inviscid/boundary layer solutions were used to predict the heating rates. The sensitivity of the heating results {{in the choice of}} metrics, pressure distributions, boundary layer edge conditions, and wall catalycity used in the heating analysis were evaluated. Streamline metrics, pressure distributions, and boundary layer edge properties were defined from perfect gas (wind tunnel case) and chemical equilibrium and nonequilibrium (<b>flight</b> <b>cases)</b> inviscid flow-field solutions. The results of this study indicated that the use of CFD-derived metrics and pressures provided better predictions of heating when compared to wind tunnel test data. The study also showed that modeling entropy layer swallowing and ionization had little effect on the heating predictions...|$|E
30|$|Perhaps {{the impact}} of a “millionaire’s tax” in Europe, if applied Europe-wide, would not lead to {{substantial}} emigration. The introduction of a millionaire tax in France in 2012 with a number of high-publicity <b>flight</b> <b>cases</b> will perhaps be a good case study, albeit that this was a tax only for residents in France thus evasion was easy by moving across the border to nearby European countries. Zoutman (2014) argues that top rates are already beyond revenue maximizing.|$|E
40|$|The Zircon is a loudspeaker-microphone probe for {{measuring}} in situ absorption and reflection properties of surfaces.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of free-jet facility into equivalent flyover results is discussed. The essential {{problem is to}} 'calibrate out' the acoustic influence of the outer free-jet shear layer on the measurement, since this is absent in the <b>flight</b> <b>case.</b> Results are presented which illustrate the differences between current simplified models (vortex-sheet and geometric acoustics), and a more complete model based on the Lilley equation. Finally, the use of geometric acoustics for facility-to-flight data conversion is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of an open-loop control law of a civilian aircraft for the compensation of the pitching moment generated by the extension of airbrakes. The proposed method uses in-flight recorded data {{and is based on}} impulse response identification and inverse simulation, whose results are used to design the controller upon qualitative assumptions. Results are then given for both the inversion and the synthesis for different <b>flight</b> <b>cases.</b> The robustness of the method to measurement noise is also assessed...|$|E

40|$|A 3 D CFD {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} study the effect of thermal and chemical nonequilibrium on slender and blunt body aerothermodynamics. Both perfect gas and reacting gas air models are used to compute the flow over a generic transatmospheric vehicle and a proposed lunar transfer vehicle. The reacting air {{is characterized by a}} translational-rotational temperature and a vibrational-electron-electronic temperature and includes eight chemical species. The effects of chemical reaction, vibrational excitation, and ionization on lift-to-drag ratio and trim angle are investigated. Results for the NASA Ames All-body Configuration show a significant difference in center of gravity location for a reacting gas <b>flight</b> <b>case</b> when compared to a perfect gas wind tunnel case at the same Mach number, Reynolds number, and angle of attack. For the same center of gravity location, the wind tunnel model trims at lower angle of attack than the full-scale <b>flight</b> <b>case.</b> Nonionized and ionized results for a proposed lunar transfer vehicle compare well to computational results obtained from a previously validated reacting gas algorithm. Under the conditions investigated, effects of weak ionization on the heat transfer and aerodynamic coefficients were minimal...|$|R
