5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} <b>ejector</b> half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the <b>ejector</b> half contains the <b>ejector</b> pins to push the casting out of that die half. The <b>ejector</b> pins are driven by an <b>ejector</b> pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The <b>ejector</b> pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough <b>ejector</b> pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the <b>ejector</b> seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of <b>ejector</b> seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the <b>ejector</b> seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of <b>ejector</b> seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's <b>ejector</b> seat if the aft <b>ejector</b> seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|All 60 of {{the class}} were {{originally}} built with Westinghouse air brakes. Forty-two were fitted with vacuum <b>ejectors</b> in a programme during 1929 and 1930. However, withdrawal {{of the class}} had begun in 1928 and 18 of the class never received vacuum <b>ejectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Experimentation and {{modeling}} of the selectivity of DIBA-1, ADA, and other zinc <b>ejectors</b> {{found that this}} safety concern was essentially unfounded. All zinc <b>ejectors</b> were found to effectively combat the replication of HIV at concentrations that did not exhibit cytotoxic effects denoting that they specifically targeted NCp7 and did not target other zinc fingers. It is thought that factors such as ligand binding affinity, ligand reactive proximity, and the general saddleshape necessary for the compound {{to fit into the}} binding pocket all {{play a role in the}} selectivity shown by zinc <b>ejectors.</b>|$|R
5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the <b>ejector</b> (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. <b>Ejector</b> pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the <b>ejector</b> half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with <b>ejector</b> type exhausts. Later {{marks of the}} Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. <b>Ejector</b> exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} the area of <b>ejectors.</b> These {{machines}} are included {{in a group of}} a jet pumps, introduced {{in the first part of}} thesis. In the next part is an introduction of <b>ejectors,</b> their principal, characteristic, its design and function and differences of using gas and liquid in different combinations of driving or drifting medium. The most extensive part is about utilization in industry, medical care and other parts of life. In concluding part are some equations and laws using in design of <b>ejectors.</b> The biggest problem is their efficiency...|$|R
50|$|There {{was concern}} over whether these zinc <b>ejectors</b> were {{safe to use}} due to the {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} zinc <b>ejectors</b> had sufficient selectivity to target only the CCHC binding sites of the zinc fingers in NCp7. Zinc finger domains are not unique to HIV but rather are ubiquitous in cell biology, and play important roles in many processes such as cellular replication, protein-protein interactions, and DNA replication. If these zinc <b>ejectors</b> unintentionally bind to the wrong zinc finger domains they have the potential to adversely affect other cellular functions that could be essential for proper bodily functions.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle <b>ejector</b> (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy <b>ejector</b> switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the <b>ejector</b> pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{scenario}} for compound chondrule formation named as “fragment-collision model, ” {{in the framework}} of the shockwave heating model. A molten cm-sized dust particle (parent) is disrupted in the high-velocity gas flow. The extracted fragments (<b>ejectors)</b> are scattered behind the parent and the mutual collisions between them will occur. We modeled the disruption event by analytic considerations in order to estimate the probability of the mutual collisions assuming that all <b>ejectors</b> have the same radius. In the typical case, the molten thin (∼ 1 mm) layer of the parent surface will be stripped by the gas flow. The stripped layer is divided into about 200 molten <b>ejectors</b> (assuming that the radius of <b>ejectors</b> is 300 µm) and then they are blown away by the gas flow {{in a short period of}} time (∼ 0. 01 s). The stripped layer is leaving from the parent with the velocity of ∼ 4 cm s − 1 depending on the viscosity, and we assumed tha...|$|R

5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the <b>ejector</b> in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six <b>ejector</b> tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an <b>ejector</b> seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E

5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic <b>ejector.</b> The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
