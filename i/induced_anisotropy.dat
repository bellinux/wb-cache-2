5000|$|The {{origin of}} seismic {{anisotropy}} is non-unique, {{a range of}} phenomena may cause Earth materials to display seismic anisotropy. The anisotropy may be strongly dependent on wavelength if it {{is due to the}} average properties of aligned or partially aligned heterogeneity. A solid has intrinsic anisotropy when it is homogeneously and sinuously anisotropic down to the smallest particle size, which may be due to crystalline anisotropy. Relevant crystallographic anisotropy {{can be found in the}} upper mantle. When an otherwise isotropic rock contains a distribution of dry or liquid-filled cracks which have preferred orientation it is named crack <b>induced</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> The presence of aligned cracks, open or filled with some different material, is an important mechanism at shallow depth, in the crust. It is well known that the small-scale, or microstructural, factors include (e.g. Kern & Wenk 1985; Mainprice et al. 2003): (1) crystal lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of constituent mineral phases; (2) variations in spatial distribution of grains and minerals; (3) grain morphology and (4) aligned fractures, cracks and pores, and the nature of their infilling material (e.g. clays, hydrocarbons, water, etc.). Because of the overall microstructural control on seismic anisotropy, it follows that anisotropy can be diagnostic for specific rock types. Here, we consider whether seismic anisotropy can be used as an indicator of specific sedimentary lithologies within the Earth’s crust.In sedimentary rocks, anisotropy develops during and after deposition. For anisotropy to develop, there needs to be some degree of homogeneity or uniformity from point to point in the deposited clastics. During deposition, anisotropy is caused by the periodic layering associated with changes in sediment type which produces materials of different grain size, and also by the directionality of the transporting medium which tends to order the grains under gravity by grain sorting. Fracturing and some diagenetic processes such as compaction and dewatering of clays, and alteration etc. are post depositional processes that can cause anisotropy [...]|$|E

For the stress <b>induced</b> <b>anisotropy,</b> time delays normalized by the path length in the anisotropic upper crust is proportional to the differential strain rate. We estimate a spatial variation in stressing rate of the upper crust beneath the high strain rate zone based on a response of the normalized time delay to a step-wise stress change caused by a moderate-sized earthquake. The variation in the stressing rate of 3 kPa/year estimated from shear wave splitting is coincident with that from GPS data. We conclude, together with other seismological features in the NKTZ reported previously, that the high strain rate in the NKTZ is attributed to the high deformation rate below the brittle-ductile transition zone in the crust.|$|E
