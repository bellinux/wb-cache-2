5|$|In the Tour de France, Cancellara came {{in third}} of stage one's {{individual}} time trial.

5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, {{one can see the}} solidified lava (igneous rock) most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E

50|$|Distal {{fracture}} of the radius {{is the most}} commonly occurring <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> adults. It is common in the elderly because of the frequent osteopenia and osteoporosis in this age group. This is also a common injury in children which may involve the growth plate. A similar <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> children involving the growth plate is called a Salter-Harris <b>fracture.</b> <b>In</b> young adults, the injury is often very severe because it requires greater force to produce the injury.|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bevin faced state Attorney General Jack Conway, marking the first gubernatorial race {{in state history}} {{featuring}} two candidates from Louisville, the state's largest city.

Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E

40|$|In macro-scaled plastic {{deformation}} processes, viz., macroforming, the so-called ductile fracture {{has been extensively}} studied {{in terms of the}} physics, mechanisms, affecting factors and the prediction criteria of ductile <b>fracture.</b> <b>In</b> micro-scaled {{plastic deformation}} processes, or microforming, all of these are relatively new and have not yet been extensively investigated. In tandem with this, the applicability of the traditional <b>fracture</b> criteria <b>in</b> micro-scaled plastic deformation and how the size effect affects the deformation and <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> the microforming processes are critical. Using micro scale flanged upsetting as a case study process, the <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> the process is studied via experiment and finite element (FE) simulation. The FE simulation is conducted using the established model based on the widely accepted surface layer model in microforming. Both the physical experiment and simulation show that the size factor has a significant effect on <b>fracture</b> formation <b>in</b> micro-scaled plastic deformation. Based on the proposed surface layer model, the <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> micro scaled plastic deformation is predicted by considering the size factor <b>in</b> Cockcroft <b>fracture</b> criterion and the results are corroborated and verified by experiments. It is found that the ductile fracture affected by size effect is difficult to occur in microforming in the same deformation conditions under which the <b>fracture</b> happens <b>in</b> macroforming scenario. The research thus provides an in-depth understanding of the <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> micro-scaled plastic deformation. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Change in {{body weight}} is an {{important}} determinant of risk of osteoporotic hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> aging adults. Weight loss {{has been associated with}} an increased risk of hip fracture and weight gain has been associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture.. Weight gain cannot be recommended as appropriate prevention against hip fracture, however, because it is associated with such adverse health outcomes as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and weight loss is commonly recommended in the treatment of these types of diseases. Clarification of how weight loss is related to risk of hip fracture is needed to resolve this issue. An extensive review of published literature was completed to assess the relationships between hip fracture and body weight, weight change, and involuntary and voluntary weight loss. Change in body weight and weight lll loss that was either intentional or unintentional were then assessed for their effects on risk of hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> a population-based case-control study of risk factors for osteoporotic hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> aging Utah residents. Analyses of risk of hip fracture by quintile of weight change since age 18 and according to weight loss intention were performed through logistic regression modeling. Weight loss after age 18 was associated with an increased risk of hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> men and women, and above average weight gain after age 18 was protective against hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> women. Involuntary weight loss of more than 20 pounds was associated with an increased risk of hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> men and women aged 50 to 69 years, but was not related to risk of hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> participants aged 70 to 89. Voluntary weight loss of more than 20 pounds did not significantly increase risk of hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> either age group. It was concluded that involuntary weight loss may be an important predictor of risk of hip <b>fracture</b> <b>in</b> aging adults and that voluntary weight loss may be safely recommended to aging adults without increasing their risk of hip fractur...|$|R
5|$|Cancellara's 2015 {{campaign}} started strong with {{a victory}} on Stage 2 of the Tour of Oman. He outsprinted a leading ten-man group to take the honours. In the Italian race Tirreno–Adriatico, {{he had a good}} prologue, taking second place behind Adriano Malori by a single second. He {{went on to win the}} final 10km time trial of the race. In Milan–San Remo, Cancellara was in the leading group, sprinting to seventh place. The following week, Cancellara crashed badly in E3 Harelbeke, suffering two minor <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> the transverse processes of his lower vertebrae. His injuries prevented him from defending his Tour of Flanders title, thereby ending his spring classics campaign. He came back at the Tour des Fjords in late May without registering a significant result. On home soil at the Tour de Suisse, he was second in the opening prologue and third in the final individual time trial, both times behind new time trial star Tom Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists. <b>Fractures</b> <b>in</b> their wing bones also {{indicate that they}} were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline {{runs through}} the western {{lower part of the}} Kettle Creek {{watershed}} in a southwest-to-northeast direction. North of this syncline lies the Wellsboro Anticline. South of it lies the Hyner Dome. A set of <b>fractures</b> <b>in</b> the watershed causes the tributary Huling Branch to have a straight and narrow valley and for Kettle Creek itself to make a sharp 90-degree turn near the mouth of the tributary Twomile Run. Lateral bars that are nearly or completely devoid of vegetation can be found throughout the main stem of Kettle Creek. In the southern reaches of the watershed, where Pennsylvanian-epoch sandstones are located, the creek flows through steep valleys with narrow floodplains. In the central and northern reaches of the watershed, the main rocks are Mississippian and Devonian rocks. This part of the watershed is characterized by wider floodplains, less steep valleys, and some plateaus, enabling agricultural and residential development to a limited extent. Several miles upstream of the Alvin R. Bush Dam, the creek makes two 180-degree turns. This may eventually cause an oxbow lake to form.|$|E
