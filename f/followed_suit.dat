5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} moderate Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after traveling to the Midwest to gain delegates.

Richard Nixon <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> and endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of the play is to win tricks. A trick consists of four cards, one from the hand of each player, in rotation, the first card played to a trick generally being called the lead. A player is required to <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> to the card led, if possible. Failure to <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> when a player has a card of the suit played is called a renege (see Renege below). If the player cannot <b>follow</b> <b>suit,</b> he may play any card.|$|R

50|$|Players must <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> if possible.

If the player cannot <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> or play trumps, the player can play any card. If possible within the previous restrictions, the player must always beat the high card in the trick. The trick is won by the highest trump, or {{if there are no}} trumps in the trick, by the highest card of the suit led.|$|R
50|$|In {{a variant}} {{described}} for dehla pakad, trick-play begins {{after the first}} five cards have been dealt. The first player who cannot <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> determines the trump suit with the card played. This is the earliest chance {{to pick up the}} heap. At this point the remaining cards are dealt, potentially making it unverifiable that the player was in fact unable to <b>follow</b> <b>suit.</b> Therefore, this game requires honest players. In the event that all players were able to <b>follow</b> <b>suit</b> in the first five tricks, a random card is drawn from the heap.|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} Kammuri are uncertain; they were {{possibly}} {{related to the}} monsoon trough that moved across the Philippines toward Guam. In late July, a large area of convection persisted in the Philippine Sea, organizing enough for the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Lagalag on August1. Around that time, the system had several weak circulations, one of which persisted in the South China Sea; this center was located east of an area of thunderstorms due to moderate wind shear. Early on August2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression to the north of Luzon. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> by initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 17W, and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> early on August3. Initially, it moved generally to the west-northwest, owing to a mid-level ridge over eastern China. The convection became more concentrated, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kammuri late on August3, to the south of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code era is either dated {{to the start of}} the sound film era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E
5|$|Among Sophocles' {{earliest}} innovations was {{the addition}} of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters. Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles' early career, <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> and adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life. Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of skenographia, or scenery-painting. It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens.|$|E

Other breeders in England and North America soon <b>followed</b> <b>suit,</b> although at this time they were not focused on creating a new breed, and the cross became known as the Welara.|$|E

5|$|Deodato drew {{influence}} from {{the works of}} Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, and Franco Prosperi, documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan. Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries {{similar to the one}} made in Cannibal Holocaust. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato <b>followed</b> <b>suit</b> in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's Mondo Cane.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century the metric system of weights and {{measures}} proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the first country {{not part of the}} French Empire to officially adopt a metric system. Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the metric system. There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965, the Commonwealth <b>followed</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E

The partnership allows Fordham undergraduate and graduate science students to take classes, conduct research, and pursue early admission to select programs of Einstein. In addition, it involves a physician mentoring program, which permits students to shadow an attending physician at Einstein's Montefiore Medical Center.|$|E
