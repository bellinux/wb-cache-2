5|$|On March 17, the North Vietnamese High Command {{predicted}} that South Vietnamese units could withdraw into {{the cities of}} <b>Huế</b> and Da Nang, so the following orders were issued to North Vietnamese field commanders: General Lê Tự Đồng's forces were to capture Phu Bai Air Base to prevent aerial transportation, and cut off a section of Highway 1 north of <b>Huế,</b> and General Nguyen Huu An's 2nd Army Corps must secure Highway 1 south of the city, {{with the aim of}} isolating both <b>Huế</b> and Da Nang {{from the rest of the}} country.|$|E

At the age of 16 he entered the monastery at Từ Hiếu Temple near <b>Huế,</b> Vietnam, where his primary teacher was Zen Master Thanh Quý Chân Thật. A {{graduate}} of Báo Quốc Buddhist Academy in Central Vietnam, Thích Nhất Hạnh received training in Vietnamese traditions of Mahayana Buddhism, as well as Vietnamese Thiền, and was ordained as a monk in 1949.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} season of 1975, the Vietnam People's Army High Command in Hanoi made the {{decision}} to seize the major South Vietnamese cities of <b>Huế</b> and Da Nang, and also destroy the various South Vietnamese units in I Corps Tactical Zone, led by ARVN General Ngô Quang Trưởng. Originally, the campaign was planned to take place over two phases; during the seasons of spring-summer and autumn. However, as the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces rolled over South Vietnamese defences on the outskirts of <b>Huế</b> and Da Nang, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu ordered General Trưởng to abandon all territories under his control, and pull his forces back to the coastal areas of I Corps. However, the South Vietnamese withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps picked off one South Vietnamese unit after another, until <b>Huế</b> and Da Nang was completely surrounded. By March 29, 1975, North Vietnamese troops had full control of <b>Huế</b> and Da Nang, while South Vietnam lost all territories in I Corps and most of the units belonging to the ARVN 1st Brigade.|$|E
40|$|Since {{at least}} the 17 th century there has been {{the idea that there}} are four simple and {{perceptually}} pure “unique” hues: red, yellow, green, and blue, and that all other <b>hues</b> are perceived as mixtures of these four <b>hues.</b> However, sustained scientific investigation has not yet provided solid evidence for a neural representation that separates the unique <b>hues</b> from other colors. We measured event-related potentials elicited from unique <b>hues</b> and the ‘intermediate’ <b>hues</b> in between them. We find a neural signature of the unique <b>hues</b> 230 ms after stimulus onset at a post-perceptual stage of visual processing. Specifically, the posterior P 2 component over the parieto-occipital lobe peaked significantly earlier for the unique than for the intermediate <b>hues</b> (Z = - 2. 9, p =. 004). Having identified a neural marker for unique <b>hues,</b> fundamental questions about the contribution of neural hardwiring, language and environment to the unique <b>hues</b> can now be addressed...|$|R

5|$|General Trưởng was {{recalled}} to Saigon on 19 March {{to brief}} Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, {{which would be}} utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from <b>Huế</b> and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway {{and called for a}} withdrawal into three enclaves: <b>Huế,</b> Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to <b>Huế</b> and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of <b>Huế</b> was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} of the Treaty of Saigon have long been a subject of conjecture.

5|$|The {{situation}} was worse in <b>Huế,</b> where Diệm had banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those {{who engaged in}} civil disobedience. At 13:00, some 1,500 protestors attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm Pagoda in <b>Huế</b> for a rally, having gathered at the Bến Ngư Bridge near the Perfume River. A confrontation ensued when the protestors attempted to cross the bridge. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Robert <b>Hues</b> (1553 – 24 May 1632) was an English {{mathematician}} and geographer. He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford, {{and graduated}} in 1578. <b>Hues</b> {{became interested in}} geography and mathematics, and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh. During a trip to Newfoundland, he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of the compass. Between 1586 and 1588, <b>Hues</b> travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe, performing astronomical observations and taking the latitudes of places they visited. Beginning in August 1591, <b>Hues</b> and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation of the globe. During the voyage, <b>Hues</b> made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic, and continued his observations of the variation of the compass at various latitudes and at the Equator. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and <b>Hues</b> returned to England the following year.|$|R
5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in <b>Huế</b> on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of <b>Huế,</b> Diệm's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} <b>Huế,</b> and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese military authorities. The South Vietnamese military in <b>Huế</b> also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAll colors can be {{described}} in terms of four non-reducible ‘unique’ hues: red, green, yellow, and blue [1]. These four <b>hues</b> are also the most common ‘focal’ colors — the best examples of color terms in language [2]. The significance of the unique <b>hues</b> has been recognized since at least the 14 th century [3] and is universal [4, 5], although there is some individual variation [6, 7]. Psychophysical linking hypotheses predict an explicit neural representation of unique <b>hues</b> at some stage of the visual system, but no such representation has been described [8]. The special status of the unique <b>hues</b> “remains one of the central mysteries of color science” [9]. Here we report that a population of recently identified cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkey contains an explicit representation of unique <b>hues...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1958, Binney & Smith {{introduced}} the No. 64 box, with numerous {{changes to the}} existing palette, and a major revision of the color wheel, which expanded from twelve to eighteen colors. The six intermediate <b>hues</b> were doubled, so that there were now two intermediate <b>hues</b> between each of the principal <b>hues.</b> The 1935 blue was replaced with a more intense color, and a new, darker blue-green was substituted for the previous version; the 1930 version of violet returned, while the 1949 violet became blue-violet, and the original blue-violet became violet-blue. The 1958 color wheel remained a fixture of Crayola crayons until 1990, when four of the colors were discontinued: orange-red, orange-yellow, green-blue, and violet-blue. Without these colors, the Crayola color wheel includes fourteen colors; there are two <b>hues</b> between yellow and green, and two between violet and red, but only one between the other principal <b>hues.</b>|$|R
