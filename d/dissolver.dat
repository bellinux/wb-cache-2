40|$|Uranium dioxide {{dissolution}} in {{nitric acid}} {{is a complex}} reaction. On the one hand, the dissolution produces nitrous oxides (NOX), {{which makes it a}} triphasic reaction. On the other hand, one of the products accelerates the kinetic rate; the reaction is hence called autocatalytic. The kinetics for these kinds of reactions need to be formalized in order to optimize and design innovative dissolution reactors. In this work, the kinetics rates have been measured by optical microscopy using a single particle approach. The advantages of this analytical technique are an easier management of species transport in solution and a precise following of the dissolution rate. The global rate is well described by a mechanism considering two steps: a non-catalyzed reaction, where the catalyst concentration has no influence on the dissolution rate, and a catalyzed reaction. The mass transfer rate of the catalyst was quantified in order to discriminate when the reaction was influenced by catalyst accumulated in the boundary layer or uncatalyzed. This first approximation described well the sigmoid dissolution curve profile. Moreover, experiments showed that solutions filled with catalyst proved to lose reactivity over time. Results pointed out that the higher the liquid-gas exchanges, the faster the kinetic rate decreases with time. Thus, it was demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a link between catalyst and nitrous oxides. The outcome of this study leads to new ways for improving the design of <b>dissolvers.</b> Gas-liquid exchanges are indeed a lever to impact dissolution rates.

For at all greater sizes there is too much Light reflected to constitute this Colour. But if they be supposed a little less than is requisite to reflect the white and very faint blue of the first order, they will, according to the 4th, 8th, 17th and 18th Observations, reflect so very little Light as to appear intensely black, and yet may perhaps variously refract it to and fro within themselves so long, until it happen to be stifled and lost, by which means they will appear black in all positions of the Eye without any transparency. And from hence may be understood why Fire, and the more subtile <b>dissolver</b> Putrefaction, by dividing the Particles of Substances, turn them to black, why small quantities of black Substances impart their Colour very freely and intensely to other Substances to which they are applied; the minute Particles of these, by reason of their very great number, easily overspreading the gross Particles of others; why Glass ground very elaborately with Sand on a Copper Plate, 'till it be well polish'd, makes the Sand, together with what is worn off from the Glass and Copper, become very black: why black Substances do soonest of all others become hot in the Sun's Light and burn, (which Effect may proceed partly from the multitude of Refractions in a little room, and partly from the easy Commotion of so very small Corpuscles;) and why blacks are usually a little inclined to a bluish Colour. For that they are so may be seen by illuminating white Paper by Light reflected from black Substances. For the Paper will usually appear of a bluish white; and the reason is, that black borders in the obscure blue of the order described in the 18th Observation, and therefore reflects more Rays of that Colour than of any other.|$|E

To assure complete dissolution of uranium from these oxide materials, an additional dissolution step at 90 degrees C to boiling for at least one to two hours has been suggested. Only trace amounts of iron associated with Fe 2 O 3 and Fe/Cr/Ni particles will dissolve during the dissolution steps.

F-Canyon began to process plutonium-containing residues that were packaged in aluminum cans and thus required the use of mercury as a dissolution catalyst. Following processing to remove uranium and plutonium using the solvent extraction process termed the Plutonium-Uranium Recovery by Extraction (PUREX) process, the acidic waste solutions containing fission products and other radionuclides were neutralized with sodium hydroxide.

40|$|H-Canyon Engineering (HCE) is {{evaluating}} {{the feasibility of}} processing material from the Super Kukla Prompt Burst Reactor, which operated at the Nevada Test Site from 1964 to 1978. This material is comprised of 90 wt % uranium (U) (at approximately 20 % 235 U enrichment) alloyed with 10 wt % molybdenum (Mo). The objective is to dissolve the material in nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }) in the H-Canyon <b>dissolvers</b> and then to process the dissolved material through H-Canyon First and Second Cycle solvent extraction. The U product from Second Cycle {{will be sent to}} the highly enriched uranium (HEU) blend down program. In the blend down program, enriched U from the 1 EU product stream will be blended with natural U at a ratio of 1 part enriched U per 3. 5 parts natural U to meet a reactor fuel specification of 4. 95 % 235 U before being shipped for use by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in its nuclear plants. The TVA specification calls for < 200 mg Mo/g U (200 ppm). Since natural U has about 10 mg Mo/g U, the required purity of the 1 EU product prior to blending is about 800 mg Mo/g U, allowing for uncertainties. HCE requested that the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) define a flowsheet for the safe and efficient processing of the U- 10 Mo material. This report presents a computational model of the solvent extraction portion of the proposed flowsheet. The two main objectives of the computational model are to demonstrate that the Mo impurity requirement can be met and to show that the solvent feed rates in the proposed flowsheet, in particular to 1 A and 1 D Banks, are adequate to prevent refluxing of U and thereby ensure nuclear criticality safety. SASSE (Spreadsheet Algorithm for Stagewise Solvent Extraction), a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that supports Argonne National Laboratory's proprietary AMUSE (Argonne Model for Universal Solvent Extraction) code, was selected to model the U/Mo separation flowsheet. SASSE spreadsheet models of H-Canyon First and Second Cycle solvent extraction show that a standard unirradiated fuel flowsheet is capable of separating U from Mo in dissolved solutions of a U/Mo alloy. The standard unirradiated fuel flowsheet is used, except for increases in solvent feed rates to prevent U refluxing and thereby ensure nuclear criticality safety and substitution of higher HNO{sub 3 } concentrations for aluminum nitrate (Al(NO{sub 3 })) {sub 3 } in the feed to 1 A Bank. (Unlike Savanah River Site (SRS) fuels, the U/Mo material contains no aluminum (Al). As a result, higher HNO 3 concentrations are required in the 1 AF to provide the necessary salting.) The TVA limit for the final blended product is 200 {micro}g Mo/g U, which translates to approximately 800 mg Mo/g U for the Second Cycle product solution. SASSE calculations give a Mo impurity level of 4 {micro}g Mo/g U in the Second Cycle product solution, conservatively based on Mo organic-to-aqueous distributions measured during minibank testing for previous processing of Piqua reactor fuel. The calculated impurity level is slightly more than two orders of magnitude lower than the required level. The Piqua feed solution contained a significant concentration of Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 }, which is not present in the feed solution for the proposed flowsheet. Measured distribution data indicate that, without Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 } or other salting agents present, Mo extracts into the organic phase to a much lesser extent, so that the overall U/Mo separation is better and the Mo impurities in the Second Cycle product drop to negligible concentrations. The 1 DF U concentration of 20 g/L specified by the proposed flowsheet requires an increased 1 DX organic feed rate to satisfy H-Canyon Double Contingency Analysis (DCA) guidelines for the prevention of U refluxing. The ranges for the 1 AX, 1 BS, and 1 DX organic flow rates in the proposed flowsheet are set so that the limiting ratios of organic/aqueous flow rates exactly meet the minimum values specified by the DCA...|$|R

Vignesha at the southern gate, flanked by Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati (Uma) symbolises Artha (wealth and fame) and embodies the <b>dissolver</b> - Shiva. Cintamani at the western gate - representing Kama (desire, love and sensual pleasure) - is attended by the love god Kamadeva and his wife Rati and embodies the formless (asat) Brahman. Mahaganapati at the northern gate standing for moksha (salvation), is accompanied by Varaha (Vishnu's boar avatar) and his wife the earth goddess Mahi embodies Sat Brahman.|$|E
40|$|There is {{some concern}} that the FB-Line D 1 <b>dissolver</b> may have been {{pressurized}} above the liquid head pressure by a reaction {{that occurred in the}} <b>dissolver.</b> The D 1 Pu limit of 8. 8 kg is based on a tank with an inner slab thickness of 3. 34 inches and a wall thickness of 0. 40 inches for a total slab thickness of 4. 14 inches. When the incident occurred there was less than 1, 500 gm Pu (1, 323 gm) in the <b>dissolver.</b> Some calculations were made to determine the safe slab thickness for 1, 500 gm Pu in the D 1 <b>dissolver.</b> Calculations show that 1, 500 gm Pu can be safely contained in a 6 inch thick D 1 <b>dissolver</b> provided the cabinet panels are in place...|$|E
40|$|A model {{describing}} the liquid outlet response to perturbations {{in the flow}} to a compartmented rotary <b>dissolver</b> has been developed. The model incorporates stagewise differential material balances coupled with the general equation for flow over a weir to calculate acid concentrations and liquid volumes in each stage. Data were taken from step-change flow experiments conducted on a 0. 5 -t/d rotary <b>dissolver.</b> The predicted response of the model was in good agreement with {{the data from the}} <b>dissolver</b> experiments. All constants in the model were obtained by independent tests. The model appears to be applicable over a wide range of <b>dissolver</b> operating conditions; however, temperature fluctuations and the presence of solids were not addressed...|$|E
