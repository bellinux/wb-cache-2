2500|$|After {{the boom}} years of World War I, Baldwin's {{business}} would decline as the Great Depression gripped the country and diesel engines became the <b>growth</b> <b>market</b> on American railways {{at the end of}} the 1930s. During the 1920s the major locomotive manufacturers had strong incentives to maintain the dominance of the steam engine. Nevertheless, ALCO, while remaining committed to steam production, pursued R strategies in the 1920s and '30s that would ensure its competitiveness in the event that diesel locomotives would predominate. In contrast, Baldwin in the 1930s discounted the possibility that diesel could replace steam. In 1930 Samuel Vauclain, Chairman of the Board, stated in a speech that advances in steam technology would ensure the dominance of the steam engine until at least 1980. Baldwin’s Vice President and Director of Sales stated in December 1937 that [...] "Some time in the future, when all this is reviewed, it will be found that our railroads are no more dieselized than they electrified". Baldwin had deep roots in the steam locomotive industry, and may have been influenced by heavy investment in its Eddystone plant.|$|E
