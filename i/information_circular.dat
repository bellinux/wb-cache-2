50|$|Less than a {{year after}} the December 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism {{recommended}} improvements in FAA security bulletins, leading to the creation of Security Directives and <b>Information</b> <b>Circulars.</b> In 1990, section 9121 of the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508) broadened 14 CFR Part 191 to prohibit disclosure of “any information obtained in the conduct of security or research and development activities.” The Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-604) required minimizing the number of people with access to information about threats, often contained in security directives (SDs) and <b>information</b> <b>circulars</b> (ICs). On March 21, 1997, FAA revised 14 CFR Part 191, and changed its title to “Protection of Sensitive Security Information.” It also strengthened the existing rule to protect SSI from unauthorized disclosure, expanded its application to air carriers, airport operators, indirect air carriers, foreign air carriers, and individuals, and specified in more detail the information protected to include SDs, ICs, and inspection, incident, and enforcement-related SSI.|$|R

40|$|We here {{present one}} part of a generic spatial {{orientation}} and motion sickness model. The part focussed on here describes visual-vestibular interactions regarding motion and attitude perception. The key issue regarding the processing of vestibular cues concerns the way accelerations due to motion are separated from those by gravity. Here we take a simple low-pass filter to solve this problem. We separate visual <b>information</b> in <b>circular</b> and linear flow-information, and in frame <b>information.</b> The <b>circular</b> optic flow is just added to vestibular canal signals. Linear optic flow is weighted with high-pass filtered otolith afferents. Visual frame information is weighted with vestibular and longitudinal body-axis information. To evaluate this model, we simulated a simulator take-off experiment performed by Groen et al. (2000). These data gave motion filter parameters for a run that was judged to be good, and one that was judged to be bad. We here conclude that: 1) The presented theory of motion and attitude perception is applicable in optimizing motion filters. 2) Negative acceleration perceptions should be prevented. 3) With impeded vision linear velocity perception in a hexapod setup is inadequate. 4) Attitude perception is the most sensitive factor discerning good from bad simulator trials. 5) A good simulator run is probably one with linear velocity and attitude perception that are close to real, whereas acceleration or force perception is less important. 6) The presented theory can and should be extended for further optimization and to predict simulator sickness in addition...|$|R
