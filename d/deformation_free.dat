40|$|The <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> {{energy of}} a lipid bilayer is {{presented}} {{based on the principle}} of a continuum theory. For small deformations, the free energy consists of a layer-compression term, a splay-distortion term, and a surface-tension term, equivalent to the elastic free {{energy of a}} two-layer smectic liquid crystal with surface tension. Minimization of the free energy leads to a differential equation that, with boundary conditions, determines the elastic deformation of a bilayer membrane. When a dimeric gramicidin channel is formed in a membrane of thickness greater than the length of the channel, the membrane deformation reduces the stability of the channel. Previously this effect was studied by comparing the variation of channel lifetime with the surface tension of bilayers (Elliott, J. R., D. Needham, J. P. Dilger, and D. A. Hayden, 1983, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 735 : 95 - 103). The tension was assumed to pull a dimer for a distance z before the channel loses ion conductivity. To account for the data, z was found to be 18 A. With the <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy, the data can be accounted for with z less than or approximately to 1 A, which is consistent with the breaking of hydrogen bonds in a dimer dissociation. Increasing the strength of lipid-protein interactions is not the only consequence of the complete free energy compared with the previous discussions. It also changes the shape of membrane deformation around an embedded channel from convex to concave, and increases the range of deformation from less than 10 A to greater than 20 A. Clearly these will be important factors in the general considerations of lipid-protein interactions and membrane-mediated interactions between proteins. In addition, thermal fluctuations of a membrane are calculated; in particular, we calculate the relations between the intrinsic thickness and the experimentally measured values. The experimental parameters of monoolein-squalene membranes are used for quantitative analyses...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for predicting intrinsic and induced DNA superstructures {{as well as}} their thermodynamic properties is presented. Intrinsic sequence-dependent superstructures are evaluated by integrating local deviations from the canonical B-DNA of the different dinucleotide steps. Induced superstructures are obtained by adopting the principle of minimum <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy, evaluated in the Fourier space, in the framework of first-order elasticity. Finally dinucleotide stacking energies and melting temperatures are considered to account for local flexibility. In fact the two scales are strongly correlated. The model works very satisfactorily in predicting the sequence-dependent effects on the DNA experimental behavior, such as the gel electrophoresis retardation. the writhe transitions in topologically constrained domains, the thermodynamic constants of circularization reactions as well as the nucleosome thermodynamic stability constants.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of cancer {{drugs such as}} cisplatin (Cp) and oxaliplatin (Ox), which covalently bind to DNA to form drug-DNA adducts, is linked to their recognition by repair proteins such as HMGB 1 a. Previous experimental studies showed that HMGB 1 a's binding affinity for Cp- and Ox-DNA varies with the drug used and the local DNA sequence context of the adduct. We link this differential binding affinity to the free energy of deforming (bending and minor groove opening) the drug-DNA molecule during HMGB 1 a binding. Specifically, the minimal binding affinity of HMGB 1 a for Ox-DNA in the TGGA context is explained by its larger <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy compared with Cp-DNA or Ox-DNA in other sequence contexts. Methyl groups on neighboring thymine bases in Ox-TGGA crowd the minor groove and sterically hinder {{the motion of the}} diaminocyclohexane ring of Ox, leading to this reduced deformability and resultant decrease in HMGB 1 a's binding affinity...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} {{free energy}} between a hydrophobic, transmembrane, protein {{and the surrounding}} lipid environment {{is calculated based on}} a microscopic model for lipid organization. The protein is treated as a rigid hydrophobic solute of thickness dP, embedded in a lipid bilayer of unperturbed thickness doL. The lipid chains in the immediate vicinity of the protein are assumed to adjust their length to that of the protein (e. g., they are stretched when dP > doL) in order to bridge over the lipid-protein hydrophobic mismatch (dP-doL). The bilayer's hydrophobic thickness is assumed to decay exponentially to its asymptotic, unperturbed, value. The lipid <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy is represented as a sum of chain (hydrophobic core) and interfacial (head-group region) contributions. The chain contribution is calculated using a detailed molecular theory of chain packing statistics, which allows the calculation of conformational properties and thermodynamic functions (in a mean-field approximation) of the lipid tails. The tails are treated as single chain amphiphiles, modeled using the rotational isometric state scheme. The interfacial free energy is represented by a phenomenological expression, accounting for the opposing effects of head-group repulsions and hydrocarbon-water surface tension. The lipid <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy delta F is calculated as a function of dP-doL. Most calculations are for C 14 amphiphiles which, {{in the absence of a}} protein, pack at an average area per head-group ao approximately equal to 32 A 2 (doL approximately 24. 5 A), corresponding to the fluid state of the membrane. When dP = doL, delta F > 0 and is due entirely to the loss of conformational entropy experienced by the chains around the protein. When dP > doL, the interaction free energy is further increased due to the enhanced stretching of the tails. When dP < doL, chain flexibility (entropy) increases, but this contribution to delta F is overcounted by the increase in the interfacial free energy. Thus, delta F obtains a minimum at dP-doL approximately 0. These qualitative interpretations are supported by detailed numerical calculations of the various contributions to the interaction free energy, and of chain conformational properties. The range of the perturbation of lipid order extends typically over few molecular diameters. A rather detailed comparison of our approach to other models is provided in the discussion...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of boundary {{conditions on the}} deformation energy of a lipid membrane containing a gramicidin A channel was evaluated numerically. A liquid crystal model was {{used to calculate the}} relative contributions of compression, splay and surface tension. It is proposed that the nearest neighbor lipid molecules are displaced from the channel end in a direction perpendicular to the bilayer and it is concluded that surface tension is the major component of the <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy for monoolein (gmo) /n-alkane membranes. This unexpected result supports the validity of the liquid crystal models of membrane deformation since gramicidin lifetime has been shown to correlate with surface tension for gmo membranes. The theory accurately predicts the experimentally measured relative lifetimes without the use of adjustable parameters. For conditions where splay may be neglected surface tension is always the major component of the deformation energy, irrespective of the magnitude of the compression coefficient. The deformation may extend for hundreds of A from the peptide. The results obtained here are expected to be important for the characterization of protein-membrane interactions in general...|$|E
40|$|Storage and {{retrieval}} {{of the genetic}} information in cells is a dynamic process that requires the DNA to undergo dramatic structural rearrangements. DNA looping is a prominent {{example of such a}} structural rearrangement that is essential for transcriptional regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the speed of such regulations affects the fitness of individuals. Here, we examine the in vitro looping dynamics of the classic Lac repressor gene-regulatory motif. We show that both loop association and loop dissociation at the DNA-repressor junctions depend on the elastic deformation of the DNA and protein, and that both looping and unlooping rates approximately scale with the looping J factor, which reflects the system’s <b>deformation</b> <b>free</b> energy. We explain this observation by transition state theory and model the DNA–protein complex as an effective worm-like chain with twist. We introduce a finite protein–DNA binding interaction length, in competition with the characteristic DNA deformation length scale, as the physical origin of the previously unidentified loop dissociation dynamics observed here, and discuss the robustness of this behavior to perturbations in several polymer parameters...|$|E
