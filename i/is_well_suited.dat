5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains.

5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for {{the foundations of}} tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to drying—its flavour intensifies, it {{is easily}} reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution {{is done by}} soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Kathiawari was {{considered}} a good cavalry mount. It was used by Maratha cavalry, and later – {{until the end of}} the First World War – by the Indian Army. In modern times it is used as a riding horse or as a harness horse. Some are used by Indian police forces, sometimes for tent-pegging, to which the Kathiawari <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited.</b> In 1995, annual breed shows were hosted by the breed association.|$|E

50|$|They <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> {{for many}} {{recreational}} water {{sports such as}} tubing, water skiing, and swimming, however a Center Console or Walkaround type boat is more practical for fishing. Bow riders <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for lakes and inland water. In heavy seas the open bow and lower gunwales may cause the boat to take on more water into the bilge.|$|R
5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account}} the speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
5|$|A {{budget was}} {{prepared}} by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) in December 1989, and in April 1990, the Parliament of Norway passed a grant. In October, LOOC and Gjøvik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue. The municipal council took the decision to build underground on 24 January 1991 and the main planning was contracted to Fortifikasjon. Main architects were Moe–Levorsen. A research group was created, which had four main tasks: ventilation, energy, fire and safety; the environment; rock mechanism and geology; and laws and regulations. The group also made marketing information to promote Norwegian underground technology internationally. In preparation for construction, drilling samples were taken and sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute for testing. The rock is 800 to 1,100 million year-old gneiss which <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> for creating caverns. Computer models were created, and estimates {{were based on the}} Q-method.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
