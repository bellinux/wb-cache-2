500|$|The <b>group's</b> Korean <b>name</b> is So-nyuh Shi-dae ( [...] , RR: Sonyeo Sidae), {{from the}} Sino-Korean root meaning [...] "Generation of Girls"; {{they are also}} known as SoShi (Korean: [...] ) or SNSD, {{both of which are}} {{abbreviated}} forms of the <b>group's</b> Korean-language <b>name.</b> Because their name consists of Chinese roots, the <b>group's</b> <b>name</b> is similar in Chinese and Japanese: in Japan the <b>group's</b> <b>name</b> is pronounced as Shōjo Jidai (Japanese: 少女時代), and in Mandarin Chinese as Shàonǚ Shídài (Chinese: 少女时代).|$|R
5|$|Apatosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of {{gigantic}} sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including Diplodocus, Supersaurus, and Barosaurus. Apatosaurus is sometimes classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which may also include Suuwassea, Supersaurus, and Brontosaurus. Othniel Charles Marsh described Apatosaurus as allied to Atlantosaurus within the now-defunct group Atlantosauridae. In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including Apatosaurus, Atlantosaurus, Morosaurus (=Camarasaurus) and Diplodocus. He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 Elmer S. Riggs said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped Apatosaurus within Opisthocoelia. Sauropoda is still used as the <b>group</b> <b>name.</b> In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed Apatosaurus a more basal diplodocid, sometimes less basal than Supersaurus.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} of Rakoto Frah and his performance of traditional sodina music began {{with his first}} overseas voyage to Algeria in 1967. The artist led a troupe of 18Malagasy musicians selected to represent the island's various ethnic groups at the International Festival of Algiers. Among the 80 competitors hailing {{from a variety of}} countries, Rakoto Frah's troupe won the gold medal. This success was followed by performances in Japan, England, the United States, India, Germany, China, Norway, Finland, Australia and France, making him one of the first musicians to perform traditional Malagasy music at music festivals and concerts outside of Madagascar. At these performances, he was often accompanied by supporting musicians under the <b>group</b> <b>name</b> Orchestre Nationale. By exposing international audiences to sodina performances, Rakoto Frah promoted the instrument and the traditional musical heritage of Madagascar across the globe. The government of President Tsirananana fell into disfavor and was overturned in 1972, and Rakoto Frah's close association with the unpopular former head of state led the artist to be marginalized {{for the first half of}} the administration of his successor, Didier Ratsiraka (1975–1993).|$|E

25|$|The {{idea behind}} the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding {{with the names of}} various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present.

25|$|This bacterium, {{along with}} the closely related species Streptococcus sobrinus, can cohabit the mouth: Both {{contribute}} to oral disease, and the expense of differentiating them in laboratory testing is often not clinically necessary. Therefore, for clinical purposes they are often considered together as a group, called the mutans streptococci (plural, non-italic due to it being an informal <b>group</b> <b>name).</b> This grouping of similar bacteria with similar tropism {{can also be seen}} in the viridans streptococci, another group of Streptococcus species.|$|E

25|$|Following an {{unsuccessful}} {{move to the}} United States in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival. The band later acknowledged this to {{have been one of}} the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but the band re-formed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have shortened the <b>group</b> <b>name</b> back to Slade.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{personal}} mythology of Robert Graves, Persephone {{is not only the}} younger self of Demeter, she is in turn also one of three guises of the Triple Goddess– Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of <b>group</b> <b>name.</b> Before her abduction, she is called Kore; and once taken she becomes Persephone ('she who brings destruction').|$|E
25|$|Once {{the band}} began playing showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the {{attention}} of record executive Derek Shulman, who signed them to Mercury Records and who was part of the PolyGram company. Because Jon Bon Jovi wanted a <b>group</b> <b>name,</b> Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of Doc McGhee, suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen. This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric. Pamela's suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later they hit the charts under that name.|$|E

They went on to record Touched by Jesus in 1991 (which featured David Gilmour of Pink Floyd on guitar on two tracks), which made the UK Top 20, before changing record labels and releasing Ultraviolet, the year after. Released by MCA it reached UK No.46. The band continued working on new material, but Regan soon left. Although remaining members continued for a couple more months without Regan's input, they disbanded in early 1993, with the album they had been working on being subsequently released under the <b>group</b> <b>name</b> Seeing Stars.|$|E
25|$|After a {{break to}} recuperate, the band teamed up with {{engineer}} Joe Gibb to create a high-tech studio setup. Brown had been soaking up the Leeds dance scene, while Hussey's explorations were towards folk music. The band, asked to perform a lucrative headlining gig at Finsbury Park in 1991, brought out quite a different side, joined by Maartin Allcock of Fairport Convention and Anthony Thistlethwaite of The Waterboys. Many long-standing fans left the gig worried {{about the direction of}} the forthcoming release, Masque (produced by Mark Saunders). Masque was originally intended to be a solo release by Hussey, however the remaining band members contributed to the recording, and the album was released under the <b>group</b> <b>name</b> as a result. Adams left the group subsequent to the release of the album. Reduced to a duo, the Mission began searching for new members, even placing an ad in the Melody Maker.|$|E
25|$|The Drifters {{formed in}} 1953 with singer Clyde McPhatter and manager George Treadwell sharing the name equally. McPhatter sold his half to Treadwell in 1954, giving Treadwell {{full control of}} the Drifters' name. Treadwell died in 1967, leaving his widow, Faye Treadwell, as manager of the group. In 1969, the founder and editor of Rock Magazine, Larry Marshak, planned a series of concerts to be {{performed}} by classic vocal groups including the Drifters. Former Drifter Ben E. King responded {{that he would not}} perform, but he referred Marshak to Charlie Thomas, Elsbeary Hobbs and Doc Green, who agreed. Thomas, Hobbs and Green continued to perform as the Drifters under Marshak's management through the 1970s. However, starting in 1972, Faye Treadwell revived the Drifters in the UK. Faye Treadwell and Marshak sued each other several times over the rights to the <b>group</b> <b>name,</b> with Treadwell winning the rights to the Drifters name in July 1999, Judge Nicholas H. Politan presiding in the case Marshak v. Treadwell, et al.|$|E
