Material and Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2011, a total of 223 children (151 boys and 72 girls, aged 6 - 16 years; mean age: 10. 1 ± 3. 04 years) with PMNE were reviewed retrospectively. All of the children underwent physical examination, urine analysis, urinary tract ultrasonography and <b>kidney</b> <b>ureter</b> <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB)</b> scout film. All patients were initially treated with a timed voiding program and were given desmopressin acetate when necessary. Results: Spina bifida occulta was detected in 75 children (33. 6 %). Spina bifida occulta affected L 4 in 2 children, L 5 in 6 children, L 4 -L 5 in 3 children, S 1 in 52 children, S 2 in 7 children and S 1 -S 2 in 2 children. Treatment was successful in 79 % of the children without SBO, and in only 48 % of the children with SBO. Medical treatment success rates differed significantly between the study groups.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{treatment}} of ureteric stones by HO:YAG laser lithotripsy and pneumatic lithotripsy and to evaluate {{the results of the}} two treatment modalities to assess effectiveness and complications. Materials and Methods: Over 1 -year period, a total of 79 patients with 82 ureteral stones were randomized into two groups. In group 1 (39 cases with 41 ureteral stones) ureteroscopic HO:YAG laser lithotripsy was performed using a rigid 8 Fr-ureteroscope (LL group). In group 2 (40 cases with 41 ureteral stones) pneumatic lithotripsy was performed in like manner. Efficacy safety and complications in both groups were analyzed. Results: A total of 79 patients with 82 calculi were treated. Two cases in LL group and one in PL group had bilateral ureteral stones. Mean stone size was 12. 07 mm in LL group and 10. 2 mm in PL group. Stones located in lower ureter in 30 cases on LL group and 29 cases in PL group.

All patients were evaluated based on their history, a physical examination, <b>kidney,</b> <b>ureter,</b> <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB),</b> pelviabdominal U/S and spiral CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast or IVP in selected cases. The patients were followed up for postoperative pain, leakage and fever. Perinephric collection with ultrasound (U/S) was performed, and the Hb% and hematocrit were determined after 12 hours. Results: The access to the stones was achieved through the lower calyx (70. 8 %) and middle calyx (29. 2 %) with a stone clearance rate of 100 %, {{and there was no}} need for a 2 nd session. The mean operative time was (67. 1 ± 19. 2 min.), and the mean length of the hospital stay was (3. 4 ± 1. 7 days). Three cases had perinephric collections < 100 cc, which were managed conservatively and resolved within one week. Prolonged leakage occurred in three cases and also resolved spontaneously within five days. Three cases required a one-unit blood transfusion postoperatively.

40|$|Introduction and objectives: Despite being uncommon, {{infantile}} {{kidney stone}} remains a major health problem {{due to its}} higher recurrence rate and morbidity. The parents usually notice that their infants have recurrent fever and failure to thrive of unknown origin. Those patients comprise a big challenge for the urologist in management. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the outcome of shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) in management of renal stones in infants. Subjects and methods: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data performed between January 2009 and December 2012 for infants underwent SWL for single radio-opaque renal stones ≤ 15  mm at a single stone center. SWL was performed with Dorneir S lithotripter with a maximum of 1500 shocks per session. A single session was indicated for each infant, but a second session was performed when satisfactory disintegration was not achieved. Follow-up based on urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity, plain X-ray <b>kidney</b> <b>ureter</b> <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB)</b> and abdominal ultrasonography (US) was carried out 2 weeks post SWL and monthly for 3 successive months. Multislice Computed tomography (MSCT) was performed 3 -months post-SWL to confirm the stone-free status. Results: A total of 87 infants, less than 24 months of age were enrolled in this research. SWL success was defined as absence of any residual fragments on MSCT 3 -months after the last session. Stone free rate was 93. 1 % after the first SWL session and reached 100 % after the second session. Rate of retreatment with second session of SWL was 6. 9 %.

40|$|Oral PresentationObjective: To {{compare the}} detectabilities of {{ureteric}} stones in non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and planar radiography of <b>kidney,</b> <b>ureters</b> and <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB),</b> and to evaluate its associated radiation risks. Patients & Methods: A total of 106 patients who underwent NCCT and KUB for acute renal colic from Jan 2011 to Feb 2012 were reviewed and analyzed with paired t-test. Patient organ radiation absorbed doses were measured {{with the use}} of 35 lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) chips inside an Alderson-Rando standard adult phantom. The patient effective dose was calculated according to the ICRP- 103 approach. Results: Overall ureteric stone detection rate in KUB was 43 % of NCCT. NCCT significantly detected smaller (<= 5  mm) ureteric stones when compared to KUB (p <  0. 05). Patient effective doses in NCCT were calculated as 10. 1  mSv for male and 12. 2  mSv for female. The calculated cancer induction risk would not be more than 0. 8 cases in 1000 patients for each NCCT in renal colic. The calculated hereditary effect would not be more than 0. 028 cases in 1000 patients. Conclusion: Our unenhanced CT protocol is safe and superior to KUB in diagnosing ureteric stones.

40|$|Background: An {{intravenous}} urogram (IVU) {{has traditionally}} been considered mandatory before treating renal and ureteric stones by {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} (ESWL). This study was designed to see whether there is a difference in complications and the need for ancillary procedures in patients managed by ESWL for renal and ureteric calculi, according to preoperative imaging technique. Methods: This retrospective study compared 133 patients undergoing ESWL from January 2001 to July 2002. Patients were divided into three groups according to the preoperative imaging technique used: i) IVU; ii) non-contrast enhanced helical computed tomography (UHCT); and iii) ultrasound (US) + X-ray <b>kidney,</b> <b>ureter</b> and <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB).</b> The groups were matched in terms of age and gender, as well as location, side and size of stones. Results: There was no statistically significantly difference for number of ESWL sessions, number of shock waves and use of ancillary procedures between the three groups. The stone-free rate was 98 % for the IVU and UHCT groups, and 97 % for the US + X-ray KUB group. Conclusions: The complication rate and need for ancillary procedures was comparable across the three groups.

To put forward recommendations which would reduce the average radiation exposure. Patients & Methods: A retrospective review was performed for patients admitted between January 2011 and February 2012 to two acute hospitals on the Hong Kong Island, who had both KUB and non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) performed for the investigation of loin pain. The accuracy of KUB was determined using NCCT as the gold standard. Results: Urolithiasis was detected on NCCT in 458 patients out of 891 patients evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of KUB were 46. 9 %, 95. 8 %, 92. 3 % and 63. 1 % respectively. In in-patient setting, if NCCT was employed as the first-line investigation, omission of KUB in patients with no urolithiasis would result in 4. 4 % reduction in radiation exposure. In out-patient setting, if KUB was employed as the first-line investigation, the high positive predictive value would justify non-invasive stone management without confirmation by NCCT. The omission of NCCT resulted in 23. 8 % reduction in radiation exposure. Conclusion: KUB had low sensitivity, but high positive predictive value {{for the detection of}} urolithiasis.

Patients and methods: All Intravenous Urogram (IVU) request forms and reports for the month of February 1998 were audited. The case notes, urinalysis, KUB and IVU films were traced and reviewed. Results: There were 110 patients investigated, 61. 8 % (68) had normal IVU, 38. 2 % (42) had abnormal IVU. The sensitivity and specificity of KUB alone was 79. 4 % and 90 %. The sensitivity using urinalysis alone was 90. 9 % and its specificity 33. 8 %. The sensitivity of combined KUB and urinalysis was 100 % and its specificity 26 %, with a negative predictive value of 100 %. All the patients with both negative KUB and urinalysis in our study were found to have negative IVU. Conclusion: Our study shows that in patients with both negative KUB and urinalysis, the yield of IVU is very low and may not be necessary. This is important, as an IVU examination is not without risk. A combination of KUB with urinary analysis and careful evaluation of clinical symptoms will improve the cost-effectiveness of patient management...|$|R

Materials and Methods: From October 2005 to November 2007, 139 USE candidates were selected based on ultrasonography and KUB, and were randomly divided into two groups. Each group was assessed by an expert urologist to decide about the treatment plans. Thereafter, all the patients underwent an IVU pre-operatively and were evaluated for the second time by the other urologist considering IVU. Presence of a hydronephrotic kidney on the ultrasonography, existence of a density in the probable tract of the ureter on KUB, and previous episodes of renal colic were considered as inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were non-opaque stones on KUB, hypersensitivity to contrast media, and serum creatinine > 1. 5 mg/dL. Results: On the basis of ultrasonography and KUB assessement, all of the patients were identified candidate for USE. According to secondary IVU-based planning, of 139 patients, 127 (91. 3 %) required USE, 10 (7. 1 %) ureteroscopy, and 2 (1. 4 %) non-operative treatment. About 8. 7 % of treatment plans was changed by IVU, which was not statistically significant (P =. 35). Positive predictive value of ultrasonography plus KUB to diagnose a ureteral stone which needed USE was 92. 8 % while IVU is the gold standard (95 % confidence interval: 92. 38 to 93. 22). Conclusion: Intravenous urography is not useful enough to be performed routinely before entire USEs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Objectives: Sepsis {{remains one}} of the dreaded {{complications}} of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). To analyze prospectively the preoperative and intraoperative factors that predict the occurrence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in patients undergoing PCNL so that we can aggressively manage those patients from the preoperative period itself and avert the dangerous complications. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out between August 2012 and March 2013 including all patients who underwent PCNL. Patients with infected collecting system, synchronous ureteric stones, stents, or percutaneous nephrostomy drainage were excluded from the study. Patients were evaluated with physical examination, urine analysis, urine culture and sensitivity, complete blood count, renal function test, X-ray <b>kidney,</b> <b>ureter,</b> and <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB),</b> and plain and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography KUB. Patients who developed any two or above of the following in the postoperative period were considered to have developed SIRS. (1) Temperature > 100. 4 °F (38 °C) or 90 /min. (3) Respiratory rate > 20 /min. (4) White blood cell count > 12, 000 /ml or < 4000 /ml. Results: Of the 120 patients who underwent PCNL 29 (24. 1 %) developed features of SIRS. On univariate analysis, gender, diabetes mellitus, bladder urine culture, and serum creatinine were found to be statistically insignificant. Blood transfusion (P = 0. 009), no of access tracts (P = 0. 001), pelvic urine culture (P = 0. 04), stone culture (P = 0. 003), stone size (P = 0. 001), age (P = 0. 019), and operative time (P = 0. 004) were found to be statistically significant. On multivariate regression analysis stone size, no of access tracts, operative time, and stone culture were found to be statistically significant with regard to the occurrence of SIRS. Conclusion: Patients with above-identified risk factors must be aggressively treated to prevent the occurrence of sepsis postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is little}} {{information}} on the management of anuria secondary to severe volume depletion or as a rare manifestation of heat stroke {{in areas of the}} world with very hot summers. We present our experience with hot weather-induced hyperuricaemia in Kuwait. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients presenting to our urology unit as an emergency during the hot summer months of April to October (average temperature 40 - 55 oC) were suspected of having hot weather-induced anuria secondary to hyperuricemia if they had a history of working in the sun for 6 to 8 hours per day and a progressive decrease in urine output to complete anuria. The diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of elevated serum creatinine and uric acid, ultrasound findings of normal <b>kidneys,</b> <b>ureters,</b> and <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB)</b> or mild to moderate hydronephrosis, but no features of chronic renal disease and little or no urine in the bladder. Management consisted of emergency cystoscopy, retrograde pyelogram, ureterorenoscopy (URS), and J stents followed by rehydration, oral allopurinol and urinary alkalinization. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (27 males and 2 females, mean age, 44. 52 A &#x 002 B;/- 8. 3 years) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for anuria secondary to hot weather-induced hyperuricaemia. Twentyeight (97 &#x 0025;) patients worked outdoors on construction sites. Six patients had small radiopaque calculi on plain KUB X-ray. During cytoscopy and URS, uric acid crystals were encountered in all patients in the <b>ureters</b> and <b>bladder.</b> Recovery of renal function was complete in 23 / 29 (79. 3 &#x 0025;) patients, while 4 / 29 (13. 8 &#x 0025;) had partial recovery and 2 / 29 (6. 9 &#x 0025;) had no renal recovery. CONCLUSION: Hot weather-induced anuria secondary to hyperuricaemia is a complication of severe dehydration. Effective treatment will result in successful resolution of this rare but reversible cause of acute renal failure in about 80 &#x 0025; of cases. Ancillary treatment methods like haemodialysis or the use of PCN can be safely avoided in the majority of the patients. However, rehydration alone may be insufficient treatment in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} {{accuracy of}} ultrasound (US) <b>kidney,</b> <b>ureter</b> and <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB)</b> compared to un-enhanced helical CT (UHCT) {{in patients with}} renal failure in the diagnosis of stone and obstruction. Methods This is a case controlled study conducted in the period from June 2000 to July 2003 at a university hospital. All patients had both US and UHCT scan. Patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1. 8 mg/dl {{were included in the}} study. Only direct visualization of stone was considered as confirmatory. In both the studies, UHCT and US, presence of stone and obstruction were noted. The relevant biochemicals, radiological and clinical records of all the patients were analyzed. Data was analyzed using commercially available software. Results During the period of study 864 patients had UHCT for evaluation of the urinary tract in patients presenting with flank pain. Out of these 34 patients had both UHCT and US done within a span of one day and had serum creatinine of ≥ 1. 8 mg/dl. Mean age was 48 ± 15. 8 years and 59 % of patients were males. UHCT identified renal stones in 21 (62 %), whereas 17 of these were identified on US, with a sensitivity of 81 %. Of the four patients with renal stones missed on US, three were identified on plain x-ray; the mean size of stones missed was 6. 3 mm. Of the 22 (65 %) patients with ureteric stone on UHCT, US could only identify 10; a further 7 were identified on x-ray KUB, giving a sensitivity of 45 % (US alone) and 77 % (US with x-ray KUB). Conclusions US is sensitive and specific for renal stones, 81 % and 100 % and for hydronephrosis, 93 % and 100 %, respectively. Its sensitivity to pick ureteric stone (46 %) and to identify hydroureter (50 %) is low. Addition of x-ray KUB abdomen increases the sensitivity for ureteric stones to 77 %. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the diagnostic utility of computed tomography (CT) - scout film with an optimal non-contrast helical CT scan Hounsfield unit (HU) in predicting the appearance of urinary calculus in the plain <b>kidneys,</b> <b>ureter,</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> (<b>KUB)</b> -radiograph. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was executed and data were collected from June 2007 to June 2012 at a tertiary hospital. The included subjects were diagnosed to have < 10 mm urolithiasis with non-contrast helical CT scan and KUB X-ray, which were carried out on the same day. Both KUB radiographs and CT-scout film were read by two qualified radiologists with inter-observer standardization prior to the study. Urolithiasis characteristics such as stone location, CT attenuation value, CT-scout film and KUB radiograph appearance were recorded independently by two observers. Univariate logistic analysis with receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to determine the best cut-off HU value of urolithiases not identified in CT-scout film, but determined radio-opaque in KUB X-ray. Subsequently, its sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated. Statistical significance was set at P value of 0. 05 or less. Results: Two hundred and three valid cases were included. 73 out of 75 CT-scout film detected urolithiasis were identified on plain radiograph and determined as radio-opaque. The determined best cut off value of HU utilized for prediction of radiographic characteristics was 630 HU at which urinary calculi were not seen at CT-scout film and were KUB X-ray radio-opaque. The set HU cut-off was established of ideal accuracy with an overall sensitivity of 82. 2 %, specificity of 96. 9 % and a positive predictive value of 96. 5 % and negative predictive value of 83. 5 %. Conclusion: Urolithiases identified on the CT-scout film were also seen as radiopaque on the KUB radiograph while those stones not visible on the CT-scout film, but above the optimal HU cut-off value of 630 are also likely to be radiopaque...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} computed tomography (CT) identifiable Randall plaques in a CT explored population; to {{determine the}} clinical relevance of this radiological finding by a 7 -year follow-up; to determine a cut point to identify a population with high risk of developing calcium stone disease (SD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of all patients explored by abdominal CT in our center between January and March 2005. INCLUSION CRITERIA: age 30 - 60 years and no SD. Papillae attenuation was measured on nonenhanced CT in Hounsfield units (HU) and the mean of all papillae was calculated. Patients were re-evaluated after 7 years to identify calcium stone formers. Anamnesis and already available CT, ultrasound, <b>kidney,</b> <b>ureter,</b> and <b>bladder</b> radiograph (<b>KUB)</b> or intravenous urography (IVU) images performed {{as part of their}} follow-up were used. In patients with no follow-up, ultrasound and KUB were to be performed. Pearson correlation, Student t-test, and the receiver operator curve were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 362 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed; 12 developed calcium SD after 7 years. A significant difference was encountered between the papillae attenuation of stone formers (SF) versus non-SF (47. 2 HU vs. 35. 5 HU, p= 0. 001). There was good correlation between papillae attenuation and the possibility of developing SD (R= 0. 87). An optimal cut point of 43 HU with a sensitivity of 81 % and specificity of 97 %, area under the curve 0. 91, separated SF and non-SF. CONCLUSION: Patients with high papillae density have a higher risk of developing SD. A cut point of 43 HU could accurately be used to identify a high-risk population...|$|R
