40|$|Khaled Aldhwaihi, Fabrizio Schifano, Cinzia Pezzolesi, Nkiruka Umaru Department of Pharmacy, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK Background: <b>Dispensing</b> {{errors are}} common in {{hospital}} pharmacies. Investigating <b>dispensing</b> errors is important for identifying the factors involved and developing strategies to reduce their occurrence. Objectives: To review published studies exploring the incidence and types of <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies and factors contributing to these errors. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science were searched for articles published between January 2000 and January 2015. Inclusion criteria were: studies published in English, and studies investigating type, incidence and factors contributing to <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies. One researcher searched for all relevant published articles, screened all titles and abstracts, and obtained complete articles. A second researcher assessed the titles, abstracts, and complete articles to verify {{the reliability of the}} selected articles. Key findings: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria all of which were conducted in just four countries. Reviewing incident reports and direct observation were the main methods used to investigate <b>dispensing</b> errors. <b>Dispensing</b> error rates varied between countries (0. 015 %– 33. 5 %) depending on the <b>dispensing</b> system, research method, and classification of <b>dispensing</b> error types. The most frequent <b>dispensing</b> errors reported were <b>dispensing</b> the wrong medicine, <b>dispensing</b> the wrong drug strength, and <b>dispensing</b> the wrong dosage form. The most common factors associated with <b>dispensing</b> errors were: high workload, low staffing, mix-up of look-alike/sound-alike drugs, lack of knowledge/experience, distractions/interruptions, and communication problems within the dispensary team. Conclusion: Studies relating to <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies are few in number and have been conducted in just four countries. The majority of these studies focused on the investigation of <b>dispensing</b> error types with no mention of contributing factors or strategies for reducing <b>dispensing</b> errors. Others studies are thus needed to investigate <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies, and a combined approach is recommended to investigate contributing factors associated with <b>dispensing</b> errors and explore strategies for reducing these errors.

40|$|Powder {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most important parts in manufacturing industry when materials applied in large quantities of solid particles. <b>Dispensing</b> technology for powders can significantly improve operation efficiency in manufacturing processes. The powder <b>dispensing</b> technologies have a broad range of applications. The powders exhibit different flow behaviours due to different physical properties. This project aims to reveal the <b>dispensing</b> mechanism and pharmaceutical powder flow behaviour in a designed <b>dispensing</b> hopper under the ultrasonic mechanical vibration, and to develop a powder dosing system to achieve the precise <b>dispensing</b> of pharmaceutical powders. The experimental work focuses on the <b>dispensing</b> device design and pharmaceutical powder <b>dispensing</b> tests by using ultrasonic vibration dosing system. The experimental results indicate that the ultrasonic vibration dosing system is capable of fast (less than one second) and precise (RSD< 5 %) pharmaceutical powder <b>dispensing</b> in small-dose (milligram scale) and large-dose (gram scale). A dome-control mechanism is identified in the ultrasonic vibration <b>dispensing</b> process. Powder dome formed in the <b>dispensing</b> hopper as a “valve” of powder flow under the ultrasonic vibration. The <b>dispensing</b> results represent that the parameters of <b>dispensing</b> hopper, i. e. orifice size, hopper angle, and working voltage signal, i. e. vibration duration, are the critical factors for the powder flow rate and dosage uniformity of the <b>dispensing.</b> Additionally, the working voltage signal properties and mechanical vibration performance are investigated in the ultrasonic vibration <b>dispensing</b> device by using the digital oscilloscope and the 3 D scanning vibrometer...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} installing an original-pack automated <b>dispensing</b> system (ADS) on dispensary workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents in a hospital pharmacy. Methods: Data on dispensary workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents, defined as <b>dispensing</b> errors detected and reported before medication had left the pharmacy, were collected over 6 weeks at a National Health Service hospital in Wales before and after the installation of an ADS. Workload was measured by non-participant observation using the event recording technique. Prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents were self-reported by pharmacy staff on standardised forms. Median workloads (measured as items dispensed/person/hour) were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests and rate of prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents were compared using Chi-square test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to examine the association between workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents. A P value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Key findings Median dispensary workload was significantly lower pre-automation (9. 20 items/person/h) compared to post-automation (13. 17 items/person/h, P < 0. 001). Rate of prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents was significantly lower post-automation (0. 28 %) than pre-automation (0. 64 %, P < 0. 0001) but there was no difference (P = 0. 277) between the types of <b>dispensing</b> incidents. A positive association existed between workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents both pre- (ρ = 0. 13, P = 0. 015) and post-automation (ρ = 0. 23, P < 0. 001). <b>Dispensing</b> incidents were found to occur during prolonged periods of moderate workload or after a busy period. Conclusion: Study findings suggest that automation improves <b>dispensing</b> efficiency and reduces the rate of prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents. It is proposed that prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents frequently occurred during periods of high workload due to involuntary automaticity. Prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents occurring after a busy period were attributed to staff experiencing fatigue after-effects...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To identify, {{review and}} {{evaluate}} the published literature on the incidence, type and causes of <b>dispensing</b> errors in community and hospital pharmacy. Method: Electronic databases were searched from 1966 to February 2008. This was supplemented by hand-searching the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Analysis of the findings explored the research methods, operational definitions, incidence, type and causes of <b>dispensing</b> errors. Key findings: Sixty papers were identified investigating <b>dispensing</b> errors in the UK, US, Australia, Spain and Brazil. In general, the incidence of <b>dispensing</b> errors varied depending on the study setting, <b>dispensing</b> system, research method and operational definitions. The most common <b>dispensing</b> errors identified by community and hospital pharmacies were <b>dispensing</b> the wrong drug, strength, form or quantity, or labelling medication with the incorrect directions. Factors subjectively reported as contributing to <b>dispensing</b> errors were look-alike, sound-alike drugs, low staffing and computer software. High workload, interruptions, distractions and inadequate lighting were objectively shown to increase the occurrence of <b>dispensing</b> errors. Conclusions: Comparison of the reviewed studies was confounded by differences in study setting, research method and operational definitions for <b>dispensing</b> errors, error rate and classification of error types.
