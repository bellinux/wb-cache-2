50|$|<b>Heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used, and most self-build detectors are of this type. A heterodyne function is often also built into the other types of <b>detector.</b> A <b>heterodyne</b> bat <b>detector</b> simply shifts all the ultrasound frequencies downwards by a fixed amount so we can hear them.|$|R

50|$|On a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> {{this sounds}} like a ploppy click, but when it is slowed down by eight octaves, a sharply falling call can be heard, slowing to a single note.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "frequency modulation" [...] (FM) {{refer to}} the [...] "chirp" [...] type of bat call. On a bat {{detector}} {{it sounds like a}} sharp click. Tuning a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> does not change the sound much, but the level varies.|$|E
5000|$|These two pips are {{distinct}} species but {{the frequencies of}} their calls are very variable and are not an exact indication of the species. They are frequently referred to as [...] "45 Pips" [...] and [...] "55 Pips" [...] from the calls as heard on a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E
40|$|The recent {{availability}} of sensitive <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> in the submillimetre spectral region (300 - 1000 GHz) and large aperture optical infrared telescopes at high altitude observatories {{have led to}} sensitive astronomical observations {{of a number of}} molecular species in galactic star formation regions. The current state of progress in this newly developing field is examined both with regard to present day detectors and also astrophysical applications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} what is {{believed}} to be the first observation of coherent subterahertz (sub-THz) emission from a 1 -m string in the atmosphere. The sub-THz pulse emitted by the filamentary structure from an intense IR femtosecond laser pulse is detected perpendicularly to the laser propagation axis by use of two <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> at 94 ± 1 and 118 ± 1 GHz. We describe the characteristics of this emission and show evidence of constructive interference between two separate strings...|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of the arc converter radio transmitter in 1904, continuous wave (CW) modulation began to be used for radiotelegraphy. CW Morse code signals are not amplitude modulated, but rather consist of bursts of sinusoidal carrier frequency. When CW signals are received by an AM receiver, the operator does not hear a sound. The direct-conversion (<b>heterodyne)</b> <b>detector</b> was invented to make continuous wave radio-frequency signals audible.|$|E
50|$|HgCdTe {{can be used}} as a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector,</b> {{in which}} the {{interference}} between a local source and returned laser light is detected. In this case it can detect sources such as CO2 lasers. In heterodyne detection mode HgCdTe can be uncooled, although greater sensitivity is achieved by cooling. Photodiodes, photoconductors or photoelectromagnetic (PEM) modes can be used. A bandwidth well in excess of 1 GHz can be achieved with photodiode detectors.|$|E
50|$|The beat {{receiver}} or beat receptor is a direct-conversion <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> {{designed by}} inventor Nikola Tesla prior to 1896 to receive continuous un-modulated radio waves (CW) and produce an audible note through {{the mixing of}} locally generated radio-frequency currents with radio-frequency currents from an antenna or receiving structure. This is achieved by {{the application of a}} locally generated radio-frequency magnetic field to radio-frequency currents flowing in a conductor.|$|E
40|$|The present {{conference on}} advancements in IR-sensitive {{materials}} and detector technologies employing them gives attention to thermal detectors, {{focal plane array}} processing detectors, novel detector designs, general properties of IR optics materials, and preparation methods for such materials. Specific topics encompass the fabrication of InSb MIS structures prepared by photochemical vapor deposition, IR <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> employing cadmium mercury telluride, low microphony pyroelectric arrays, IR detection based on minority carrier extrusion, longwave reststrahl in IR crystals, and molecular beam techniques for optical thin film fabrication...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} and shot noise characteristics of high current density niobium su-perconductor- insulator- superconductor tunnel junctions suitable for heterodyne detection of THz radiation are studied. It is {{found that a}} significant part of the current at voltages V < 2 ilie is carried via barrier defects (pinholes). Due to the transport mechanism in these pinholes, the shot noise is considerably increased. The data presented clarifies an often-observed discrepancy between measured and expected heterodyne mixer noise temperatures and predicts a 25 % increase in the receiver noise temperature of Nb SIS <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> at 1 THz. ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{approach}} to implementing continuous-variable quantum information protocols {{in the laboratory}} is through the techniques of quantum optics. By modeling each mode of the electromagnetic field as a quantum harmonic oscillator with its associated creation and annihilation operators, one defines a canonically conjugate pair of variables for each mode, the so-called [...] "quadratures", which {{play the role of}} position and momentum observables. These observables establish a phase space on which Wigner quasiprobability distributions can be defined. Quantum measurements on such a system can be performed using homodyne and <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|A FD {{detector}} {{does not}} require manual tuning as it works on {{a full range of}} bat frequencies, but some, like the Duet, also have a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> built in. The entire call is preserved and can be recorded on an audio recorder and studied later on a computer. A spectrogram and other analysis software can also show the repetition rates and patterns of the calls which is also useful for species identification.|$|E
50|$|Advantages, As with a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>{{detector}},</b> an FD detector {{works in}} real time {{with or without a}} heterodyne function. Bat calls can be heard in their entirety over their whole range rather than over a limited frequency range. Retuning with an FD detector is not required although this is done with a dual type with heterodyne. By analysing the recording later, the entire call frequency range and the call pattern can be measured.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of a heterodyne bat detector is that it works in real time, exaggerates the frequency changes of a bat call, is easy to use, and is the least expensive. It is easy to recognise a doppler shift in CF calls of flying bats due to their speed of flight. Stereo listening and recording is possible with models such as the CSE stereo <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> (broken link!), and this can help to track bats when visibility is poor.|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of SOFIA, Herschel, and SAFIR, new {{wavelength}} regions will become routinely accessible for astronomical spectroscopy, particularly at submm frequencies (0. 5 - 1. 1 THz). Molecular emission dominates the spectra of dense interstellar gas at these wavelengths. Because <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> are major instruments of these missions, accurate knowledge of transition frequencies is crucial for their success. The Ziurys spectroscopy laboratory has been focusing on the measurement of the pure rotational transitions of astrophysically important molecules in the sub-mm regime. Of particular interest have been metal hydride species and their ions, as well as metal halides and cyanides. A new avenue of study has included metal bearing molecular ions...|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of a <b>heterodyne</b> bat <b>detector</b> {{are that it}} can only convert a narrow band of frequencies, typically 5 kHz, {{and has to be}} continually retuned, and can easily miss species out of its current tuned range.|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} the super broad band interferometer {{by applying the}} Fourier Transform Spectrometer(FTS) to aperture synthesis system in mm and sub-mm bands. We have constructed a compact system based on the Martin and Puplett type Fourier Transform spectrometer (MP-FT). We call this equipment Multi-Fourier Transform interferometer (MuFT). The band width of the system can be extended as large as one wants contrary to the severely limited band width of the usual interferometer due to {{the speed of the}} AD converter. The direct detectors, e. g. bolometer, SIS video detector, can be used as the focal plane detectors. This type of detectors have a great advantage in FIR band since they are free from the quantum limit of the noise which limits the sensitivity of the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> used in the usual interferometers. Further, the direct detectors are able to make a large format array contrary to the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> for which construction of a large format array is practically difficult. These three characteristics make one be possible to develop high sensitive super broad band FIR interferometer with wide field of view. In the laboratory experiments, we have succeeded in measuring the spectroscopically resolved 2 D image of the source in 150 GHz- 900 GHz band. The future application of this technique to the observations from the space could open new interesting possibilities in FIR astronomy.

50|$|Some FD {{detectors}} output {{this constant}} level signal which renders background noise and bat calls {{at the same}} high level. This causes problems with both listening and analysis. More sophisticated FD detectors such as the Batbox Duet measure the incoming volume level, limiting the noise threshold, and use this to restore the output level variations. This and other sophisticated FD detectors also include a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> and provide a jack output so that independent outputs can be recorded for later analysis.|$|E

50|$|As {{heterodyne}} bat detector only shifts {{a limited}} range of bat call frequencies, {{it needs to be}} constantly retuned so as not to miss some species and to identify those heard. One solution sometimes used in bat surveys is to use a second <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> tuned to a different frequency to detect other species such as Horseshoe bats if these are likely to be present. With Pipistrelles, if it is tuned too low or too high, the difference frequency rises as illustrated in the following example.|$|E
5000|$|Note the [...] "ploppy" [...] {{sound of}} the call and the [...] "feeding buzzes" [...] as it homed in on insects. The Soprano Pipistrelle's call sounds very similar, but at a higher {{frequency}} setting on the <b>heterodyne</b> bat <b>detector.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{doppler effect}} of the CF call from a moving bat is greatly exaggerated by a <b>heterodyne</b> bat <b>detector.</b> This {{can be used to}} {{estimate}} the speed of a flying bat or to identify bats which are echolocating while roosting.|$|R
5000|$|A bat {{survey was}} {{conducted}} {{in the vicinity of}} the abandoned village on 21 June 2010, using a Pettersson D100 <b>Heterodyne</b> Bat <b>Detector.</b> A single Common Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) was detected foraging around the village but its roost was not located.|$|R
50|$|Calculating {{flying speed}} {{involves}} some technicalities. A spectrogram can easily reveal a doppler shift in a passing bat. A <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> will show some {{shifts in the}} calls above, but doppler shifts are most readily heard in CF calls such as the Horseshoe's. A rough estimate {{the speed of a}} bat can be made from the doppler shift as it flies past. The rule of thumb is that at around 50 kHz a shift is 1 kHz indicates about 6.8 m/s. A passing bat will produce a total shift of about double this.|$|E
5000|$|A serious {{disadvantage}} {{with real}} time listening {{is that the}} speed of a bat call remains fast, often too fast for the species to be recognised. The frequency changes of CF calls are not exaggerated as with a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> and so are less noticeable. Also with some species such as the Lesser Horseshoe bat with a call around 110 kHz, the resulting frequency is still quite high although it can be recorded. The synthesising of the call means that only one bat call can be reproduced at a time and a muddle is caused by simultaneous calls. Surprisingly, this is not a great disadvantage when analysing a recording later ...|$|E
50|$|The superconducting tunnel {{junction}} (STJ) {{consists of two}} pieces of superconducting material separated by a very thin (~nanometer) insulating layer. It {{is also known as}} a superconductor-insulator-superconductor {{tunnel junction}} (SIS), and it is a type a Josephson junction. Cooper pairs can tunnel across the insulating barrier, a phenomenon known as the Josephson effect. Quasiparticles can also tunnel across the barrier, although the quasiparticle current is suppressed for voltages less than twice the superconducting energy gap. A photon absorbed on one side of a STJ breaks Cooper pairs and creates quasiparticles. In the presence of an applied voltage across the junction, the quasiparticles tunnel across the junction, and the resulting tunneling current is proportional to the photon energy. The STJ can also be used as a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detector</b> by exploiting the change in the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic that results from photon-assisted tunneling. STJs are the most sensitive heterodyne detectors available for the 100 GHz - 1 THz frequency range and are employed for astronomical observation at these frequencies.|$|E
40|$|Heterodyne {{detection}} techniques play {{an important}} role in high-resolution spectroscopy in astronomy and planetary science. In particular, heterodyne technology in the Terahertz range has rapidly evolved in recent years. Cryogenically cooled receivers approaching quantum-limited sensitivity have been developed up to 2 THz for large astronomy projects like ESA's Herschel Space Observatory and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) as well as other observing facilities. Future space- and ground-based submillimeter observatories require <b>heterodyne</b> <b>detectors</b> and receivers up to 6 THz and beyond. Recent developments in superconducting mixer as well as local oscillator technology bring such receivers into reach. This short article summarizes the main technological achievements of Terahertz heterodyne technology, and gives an outlook into future developments...|$|R

In particular, we describe the LO injection meander line, the constant slot-depth corrugated horns (including 15 GHz scale models), the radial-probe mixers, and various items of work relating to tolerance assessment and uniformity. ...|$|R
50|$|The FM call {{is heard}} as rapid dry clicks and the CF call as peeps. These vary in {{frequency}} {{due to the}} Doppler effect as the bat flies past. A <b>heterodyne</b> bat <b>detector</b> exaggerates the Doppler effect. As the bat making the CF calls flies toward the detector, the pitch falls.|$|R
