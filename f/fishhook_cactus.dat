50|$|This beetle {{lives in}} desert habitat, where it feeds on cactus plants, {{especially}} species of prickly pear (Opuntia) and cholla (Cylindropuntia). The beetle {{is a threat}} to several rare species of cactus, including the Mojave <b>fishhook</b> <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus polyancistrus), Wright's <b>fishhook</b> <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus wrightiae), Mesa Verde cactus (Sclerocactus mesae-verdae), Winkler’s pincushion cactus (Pediocactus winkleri), and San Rafael cactus (Pediocactus despainii).|$|E
5000|$|In adulthood, <b>fishhook</b> barrel <b>cacti</b> {{generally}} lean southward, {{toward the}} sun, earning them the nickname [...] "compass barrel cactus." [...] One theory about why this happens is, {{the afternoon sun}} is so intense it slows the growth on the exposed side, causing the plant to grow unevenly. Older barrels can lean so far they uproot themselves and fall over, especially after heavy rains when the soil is loose. Its life cycle is 50-100 years.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fishhook</b> barrel <b>cactus</b> is {{native to}} southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. More specifically, {{it can be found}} in {{southern}} Arizona, southern New Mexico, El Paso County, Texas and northern Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico. It grows in gravelly or sandy soil, more commonly on bajadas than steep slopes, at 1000 to 5300 feet (300-1600 m) elevation. It prefers full sun, and does well in hot arid climates. It is, however, frost-tolerant to 5 °F (-15 °C) ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fishhook</b> barrel <b>cactus</b> {{typically}} {{grows to}} {{a diameter of}} roughly two feet and three inches. A height of three to six feet. However, specimens as wide as three feet and tall as ten feet have been recorded. The common name comes from the spines, which are thick and hooked. It has a leathery asparagus green cortex (skin) with approximately 15-28 ribs per cactus. Its flowers are yellow to red-orange and appear atop the cactus fruit during the summer months. The fruits are green when unripe, yellow after the flower dries up, and persist atop the cactus long after the flower is gone, sometimes {{for more than a}} year.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fishhook</b> <b>cactus</b> is {{a common}} name for any hook-spined species of the genera Mammillaria, Echinomastus or Sclerocactus. They are small cacti, usually growing up to 6-7 inches (20 cm) high, and are shaped similar to a barrel cactus. They {{are not to be}} {{confused}} with the fishhook barrel cactus (Ferocactus wislizenii) of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. The <b>Fishhook</b> <b>cactus</b> is a large category of around 150 species.|$|E
40|$|In North American deserts, {{many species}} of cactus attract ants to their extrafloral nectaries; the ants {{actively}} defend the food source, and hence the plant, against herbivores. In thermally extreme environments, however, networks {{of positive and negative}} interactions like these are likely {{to be sensitive to the}} thermal limitations of each of the interacting species. We compared the thermal tolerance of a common phytophagous cactus bug, Narnia pallidicornis (Hemiptera: Coreidae), to that of the ants that defend the cactus Ferocactus wislizeni in the Sonoran Desert, USA. We used flow-through respirometry to experimentally determine the thermal limit of the herbivore and compared this to the thermal limits of the ant defenders, determined previously. In the field, we recorded herbivore frequency (proportion of plants with N. pallidicornis) and abundance (the number of N. pallidicornis per plant) in relation to ambient temperature, ant species presence and identity, and fruit production. We show that N. pallidicornis has a higher thermal tolerance than the four most common ant mutualists, and in the laboratory can survive very high temperatures, up to 43 °C. Herbivore frequency and abundance in the field were not related to the daily high temperatures observed. Plants that were not defended by ants were occupied by more N. pallidicornis, although they showed no reduction in fruit set. Therefore, herbivory is likely to continue on <b>fishhook</b> barrel <b>cacti</b> even at high temperatures, especially those temperatures beyond the thermal tolerance of the ant defenders. The consequences of increased herbivory, however, remain unclear. Mutualisms are essential for ecosystem functioning; it is important to understand the thermal sensitivity of these interactions, especially in light of expected increases in global temperature regimes...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{species was}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving its name from Latin mammilla, [...] "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are among the distinctive features of the genus.
