500|$|The show {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jon Pareles from The New York Times compared the concert with aerobics {{and said that}} the concert was more of a workout than being erotic. Isabel Albiston from The Daily Telegraph compared the tour with the 2006 Confessions Tour and said that [...] "two years later, Madonna's biceps are no smaller and, with the news that 100 pairs of fishnet pantyhose have been procured from eBay for the artist, her costumes no less raunchy. [...] Madonna seemed to have a point to prove." [...] Another review by Helen Brown from the same publication said that [...] "Sticky Sweet's highlights include a fresh, crunchy and gipsied-up 'La Isla Bonita' (complete with fiddles, flamenco and a spliced-in Romani folk tune) and a raved-up 'Like a Prayer'." [...] Sarah Liss from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commented that [...] "something about witnessing the 50-year-old crow's feet and wrinkles on Madonna's face, projected a hundred times larger than life, as she works <b>her</b> <b>ass</b> off (to paraphrase part of her stage banter) for a crowd of almost 20,000 feels more awe-inspiring than any of her old-school shock tactics." ...|$|E
500|$|During [...] "Off The Wall", {{the first}} episode of the fourth season, Natalie Nunn told Annie Andersen that Chris Brown was at a night club {{that she wanted to}} attend, and asked Anderson if she was a fan. Anderson said not, because of the {{domestic}} violence case that Brown was involved in. Nunn defended Brown, saying [...] "Who cares, Rihanna was a punk bitch, and she got <b>her</b> <b>ass</b> beat for a reason". Nunn called Rihanna a [...] "crazy bitch" [...] and claimed to know her, unlike Anderson. After the episode aired, Brown reportedly stated {{that he did not know}} who Nunn was. Nunn questioned this during the reunion show, claiming that Brown had said it because the cast of the show had not yet been revealed. Perez Hilton, the host of the reunion, asked Nunn if Rihanna had confronted her about her comments. Nunn answered yes, stating that the two had argued during a dinner party in New York City. During the reunion, Nunn claimed to have had a [...] "fling" [...] with Brown before the show. Shortly before the end of the reunion, Nunn said that she did not condone domestic violence and apologized if her comment had enraged fans and people who had been victims of it.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 14 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Billboard was positive toward the album, writing that {{the album is}} [...] "a must-heard recording rich with pleasantly surprising depth". In a mixed review, E! Online wrote, [...] "If she had just shown up and sang <b>her</b> <b>ass</b> off, Stripped would've been a better show". Josh Kun from Spin commented, [...] "As an artistic statement, Stripped {{is all over the}} placeit's a move toward hip-hop, it's a move toward rock, it's ghetto, it's Disney". Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone provided a three-out-of-five-stars rating for the album, calling it [...] "almost" [...] an album for grown-ups, yet criticized its lack of musical concentration. Blender wrote a mixed review, yet commenting that it is better than Britney Spears' works. Writing for BBC Music, Jacqueline Hodges said that the album [...] "is as full-on bold and over the top as most of Christina's outfits... much of this seems to be an exercise in stretching the vocal chords to weak backing tracks". Jim Wirth for NME commented that Stripped is a Mariah Carey album. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the album is [...] "so overproduced and overwrought that it could easily pass for a Janet album".|$|E

This is a motherfucking important evening and we are lucky to be sharing it with the World [...] This {{is the beginning of a}} whole new world. Are you ready?! Are you fucking ready?!" [...] The video screens displayed images of Obama along with the message, [...] "We Won". Madonna also publicly voiced her opposition for Republican Vice Presidential candidate for 2008, Sarah Palin. While performing on the tour, Madonna shouted [...] "Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal. [...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)." [...] While performing [...] "I Love New York" [...] during the request section, the line [...] "Get off my street" [...] was replaced by Madonna screaming [...] "You know who can get off of my street? Sarah Palin! I'm gonna kick <b>her</b> <b>ass</b> if she don't get off of my street." [...] Then she mocked Palin's accent and told the crowd that she loves her.|$|E

2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on <b>her</b> <b>ass.</b> I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E

2500|$|The video {{received}} 4.93 million hits in {{its first}} 24 hours. [...] It received positive reviews from critics with many noting Rihanna's indulgence into extended choreography. Kia Makarechi from The Huffington Post commented, [...] "Rihanna doesn't normally do extended dance scenes, so it's interesting to see the singer go {{the path of the}} Britneys and Christinas before her and delve into some deeper choreography." [...] Amanda Dobbins from New York Magazine echoed the review stating, [...] "Even though Rihanna is maybe not on a Beyoncé or Britney-circa-2000 level {{when it comes to the}} super-involved choreography, she at least leaves it all out on the floor." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard made note of the Hindu imagery displayed in the video and made comparisons of the video's distorted images to that of [...] "We Found Love". Nicole James of MTV praised the video stating that Rihanna [...] "dances <b>her</b> <b>ass</b> off" [...] and compared it to Jennifer Lopez's video for [...] "Waiting for Tonight".

The first assures all Moslems that a prayer at Kuba is equal to a Lesser Pilgrimage at Meccah in religious efficacy; and the second declares that such devotion is more acceptable to the Deity than prostrations at the Bayt al-Mukuddas (Jerusalem). Moreover, sundry miracles took place here, and a verset of the Koran descended from heaven. For which reasons the Mosque was much respected by Omar, who, once finding it empty, swept it himself with a broom of thorns, and expressed his wonder at the lukewarmness of Moslem piety.

My everlasting unbelief in people has punished itself this time. I might have got a search-warrant three months ago, and had that old witch safe in the bilboes.

[...] They were wild figures, not very ragged, but without shoes and [...] stockings. The hat of the elder was wreathed round with yellow [...] flowers; the younger, whose hat was only a rimless crown, had stuck it [...] round with laurel leaves. They continued at play till I drew very [...] near, and then they addressed me with the begging cant and the whining [...] voice of sorrow.

60|$|There was no lack {{of company}} along the road: donkeys numberless, camels by twos and threes; now a mule-driver, trudging along the road, {{chanting}} a most queer melody; now a lady, in white veil, black mask, and yellow papooshes, bestriding <b>her</b> <b>ass,</b> and followed by her husband,--met us on the way; and most people gave a salutation. Presently we saw Ramleh, in a smoking mist, on the plain before us, flanked to the right by a tall lonely tower, that might have held the bells of some moutier of Caen or Evreux. As we entered, about three hours {{and a half after}} starting, among the white domes and stone houses of the little town, we passed the place of tombs. Two women were sitting on one of them,--the one bending her head towards the stone, and rocking to and fro, and moaning out a very sweet pitiful lamentation. The American consul invited us to breakfast at the house of his subaltern, the hospitable one-eyed Armenian, who represents the United States at Jaffa. The stars and stripes were flaunting over his terraces, to which we ascended, leaving our horses to the care of a multitude of roaring ragged Arabs beneath, who took charge of and fed the animals, though I can't say in the least why; but, {{in the same way as}} getting off my horse on entering Jerusalem, I gave the rein into the hand of the first person near me, and have never heard of the worthy brute since. At the American consul's we were served first with rice soup in pishpash, flavoured with cinnamon and spice; then with boiled mutton, then with stewed ditto and tomatoes; then with fowls swimming in grease; then with brown ragouts belaboured with onions; then with a smoking pilaff of rice: several of which dishes I can pronounce to be of excellent material and flavour. When the gentry had concluded this repast, it was handed to a side table, where the commonalty speedily discussed it. We left them licking their fingers as we hastened away upon the second part of the ride.|$|E
