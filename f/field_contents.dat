40|$|Pure" {{homogeneous}} linear supermultiplets (minimal and non-minimal) of the N= 4 -Extended one-dimensional Supersymmetry Algebra are classified. "Pure" {{means that}} they admit at least one graphical presentation (the corresponding graph/graphs are known as "Adinkras"). We further prove the existence of "entangled" linear supermultiplets which do not admit a graphical presentation, by constructing an explicit example of an entangled N= 4 supermultiplet with <b>field</b> <b>content</b> (3, 8, 5). It interpolates between two inequivalent pure N= 4 supermultiplets with the same <b>field</b> <b>content.</b> The one-dimensional N= 4 sigma-model with a three-dimensional target based on the entangled supermultiplet is presented. The distinction between the notion of equivalence for pure supermultiplets {{and the notion of}} equivalence for their associated graphs (Adinkras) is discussed. Discrete properties such as chirality and coloring can discriminate different supermultiplets.

40|$|Vector-Like (VL) quarks {{arise in}} the main {{alternatives}} to the supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM). Given the experimental possibility of a 125 GeV Higgs boson with rates {{significantly different from the}} SM expectations, it is motivating to study the effects of VL quarks on the Higgs boson cross sections and branching ratios. We perform a systematic search for the minimal <b>field</b> <b>contents</b> and gauge group representations of VL quarks able to significantly improve the fit of the measured Higgs rates, and simultaneously, to satisfy the direct constraints on VL quark masses as well as the electro-weak precision tests. In particular, large enhancements can be achieved in certain diphoton channels - as pointed out by both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations - optimizing then the Higgs rate fit. This is a consequence of the introduction of VL quarks, with high electric charges of 8 / 3 or - 7 / 3, which are exchanged in the Higgs-to-diphoton loop. Interestingly, the <b>field</b> <b>contents</b> and formal Higgs couplings obtained here {{are similar to those of}} scenarios in warped/composite frameworks arising from different motivations.
