25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new cylinder head assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with rocker arms on shafts, whereas now the cylinder head assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by inverted buckets also serving as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> lash adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|E

2500|$|Milt Schornack joined Royal Pontiac {{and helped}} improve the {{performance}} enhancement package. The {{components of the}} kit varied, but generally included parts to modify the spark advance of the distributor, limiting spark advance to 34–36° at no more than 3,000rpm (advancing the timing at high rpm for increased power), a thinner copper head gasket to raise compression to about 11.23:1, special intake manifold gaskets to block the heat riser to the carburetor (keeping it cooler), larger carburetor jets, and locking rocker nuts to hold the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> lifters at their maximum point of adjustment, allowing the engine to rev higher without [...] "floating" [...] the valves. Properly installed, the kit could add between 30 and 50 horsepower (20–40kW), although it required high-octane superpremium gasoline of over 100 octane to avoid spark knock with the higher compression and advanced timing. Adhesive [...] "Royal Bobcats" [...] stickers were also included.|$|E

40|$|Valve in {{high flux}} {{hydraulic}} transmission systems causes {{a lot of}} pressure loss. Conventionally, the pressure loss of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valves</b> is calculated theoretically or by empirical formula. Recent development of the CFD technique makes it possible to achieve a better solution of the pressure loss within the complex channel of various <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valves.</b> In this paper, the flow behavior inside a <b>hydraulic</b> spool <b>valve</b> is investigated using CFD method. By comparing the computed pressure loss from different mass flux and chamber structures, the relation between flux, geometry and pressure loses is analyzed. The results show that the changes of a flux and geometry decrease significantly the pressure drops. The modification of the valve’s spool, however, contributes little improvement. ...|$|R

2500|$|Bel Air {{interiors}} had {{an optional}} massive expanse of chrome across {{the lower part}} of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with full chrome horn ring. Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. [...] Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six cylinder OHV engines, featuring <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons.
