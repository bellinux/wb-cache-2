40|$|Despite many {{advances}} in the generation of high producing recombinant mammalian cell lines {{over the last few}} decades, cell line selection and development is often slowed by the inability to predict a cell line's phenotypic characteristics (e. g. growth or recombinant protein productivity) at larger scale (large volume bioreactors) using data from early cell line construction at small culture scale. Here we describe the development of an intact cell MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry fingerprinting method for mammalian cells early in the cell line construction process whereby the resulting mass spectrometry data are used to predict the phenotype of mammalian cell lines at larger culture scale using a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model. Using MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry, a library of mass spectrometry fingerprints was generated for individual cell lines at the 96 <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> stage of cell line development. The growth and productivity of these cell lines were evaluated in a 10 L bioreactor model of Lonza's large-scale (up to 20, 000 L) fed-batch cell culture processes. Using the mass spectrometry information at the 96 <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> stage and phenotype information at the 10 L bioreactor scale a PLS-DA model was developed to predict the productivity of unknown cell lines at the 10 L scale based upon their MALDI-ToF fingerprint at the 96 <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> scale. This approach provides the basis for the very early prediction of cell lines' performance in cGMP manufacturing-scale bioreactors and the foundation for methods and models for predicting other mammalian cell phenotypes from rapid, intact-cell mass spectrometry based measurements...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Over {{the last}} few years High-Throughput Protein Production (HTPP) has played a crucial role for {{functional}} proteomics. High-quality, high yield and fast recombinant protein production are critical for new HTPP technologies. Escherichia coli is usually the expression system of choice in protein production thanks to its fast growth, ease of handling and high yields of protein produced. Even though shake-flask cultures are widely used, there is an increasing need for easy to handle, lab scale, high throughput systems. RESULTS: In this article we described a novel minifermenter system suitable for HTPP. The Air-Well minifermenter system is made by a homogeneous air sparging device that includes an air diffusion system, and a stainless steel 96 needle plate integrated with a 96 <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> where cultures take place. This system provides aeration to achieve higher optical density growth compared to classical shaking growth without the decrease in pH value and bacterial viability. Moreover the yield of recombinant protein is up to 3 -fold higher with a considerable improvement in the amount of full length proteins. CONCLUSIONS: High throughput production of hundreds of proteins in parallel can be obtained sparging air in a continuous and controlled manner. The system used is modular and can be easily modified and scaled up to meet the demands for HTPP...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{field of}} plasmid-based {{functional}} proteomics requires the rapid assay of proteins expressed from plasmid libraries. Automation is essential since large sets of mutant open reading frames are being cloned for evaluation. To date no integrated automated platform {{is available to}} carry out the entire process including production of plasmid libraries, expression of cloned genes, and functional testing of expressed proteins. Results We used a functional proteomic assay in a multiplexed setting on an integrated plasmid-based robotic workcell for high-throughput screening of mutants of cellulase F, an endoglucanase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces PC- 2. This allowed us to identify plasmids containing optimized clones expressing mutants with improved activity at lower pH. A plasmid library of mutagenized clones of the celF gene with targeted variations in the last four codons was constructed by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and transformed into Escherichia coli. A robotic picker integrated into the workcell was used to inoculate medium in a 96 -well <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate,</b> combining the transformants into a multiplexed set in each well, and the plate was incubated on the workcell. Plasmids were prepared from the multiplexed culture on the liquid handler component of the workcell and used for in vitro transcription/translation. The multiplexed expressed recombinant proteins were screened for improved activity and stability in an azo-carboxymethylcellulose plate assay. The multiplexed wells containing mutants with improved activity were identified and linked back to the corresponding multiplexed cultures stored in glycerol. Spread plates were prepared from the glycerol stocks and the workcell was used to pick single colonies from the spread plates, prepare plasmid, produce recombinant protein, and assay for activity. The screening assay and subsequent deconvolution of the multiplexed wells resulted in identification of improved CelF mutants and corresponding optimized clones in expression-ready plasmids. Conclusion The multiplex method using an integrated automated platform for high-throughput screening in a functional proteomic assay allows rapid identification of plasmids containing optimized clones ready for use in subsequent applications including transformations to produce improved strains or cell lines. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the cellular processes, {{knowledge of the}} localization and function of proteins are essential. There are several high throughput ventures examining the human proteome. However, there are some bottlenecks in these ventures. For example the production and expression of soluble proteins for analysis. Another obstacle for affinity proteomics is the generation of high quality antibodies, invaluable tools in biotechnological applications. The objective in this thesis was to facilitate protein purification and sample preparation before analysis and downstream applications. We also aimed to attain more information on what constitutes an ideal immunogen, and on how different immune systems respond to a common amino acid sequence.   In one of the projects an automated purification set-up was developed to ensure high recovery of up to milligram amounts of protein with high purity. The system allowed up to 60 recombinant proteins to be purified under both native and denaturing conditions. In another project, the same developed set-up was additionally shown to work with an alternative chromatography resin with small adjustments. Instead of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, used in the first project, ion exchange chromatography was applied under denaturing conditions, with good results. To further automate the production line in high throughput projects, an automated sample preparation was set up for mass spectrometry and e. g. gel electrophoresis analysis. We showed that a crude cell lysate {{could be used as}} input in the magnetic bead based system, and totally absent from manual handling, the output was purified and buffer exchanged samples ready for mass spectrometry analysis, as well as a fraction of sample {{that could be used for}} complementary analyses, for example gel electrophoresis to determine the protein concentration and purity.   The other objective was – as noted – to gain better comprehension of antibody generation to foreign proteins, and to shed more light over how to design a good antigen. First was a solubility assay developed that determined the remaining fraction of soluble protein after reduction of the concentration of denaturing agent. The assay was performed in a 96 <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate,</b> and only instrumentation available in a standard laboratory was necessary. The fact that the assay could be automated on a pipetting robot, increased the throughput and reduced the necessary manual handling. Obtained information on antigen solubility was correlated to the cognate antibody titers. At average the antibody yield was higher when a soluble antigen was used for immunization. Also, the probability of failing in eliciting an immune response was increased if an insoluble antigen was used. However, the antibody titers in each solubility class were highly diverse, and thus also some insoluble antigens were found that provoked the immune system. To further examine the differences between different B cell repertoires, a massive epitope mapping was performed with more than 400 different antisera reacting to the same amino acid sequence. Antigenic hot spot regions were discovered, as well as regions depleted in antibody recognition. However, in one third of the antisera the most abundant antigenic region did not elicit any binding of antibodies. This further validates the conclusion that good antigen design is essential, however is it not certain the outcome of immunizations can ever be determined a priori due to the variability between hosts. An alternative to immunization is selection of affinity reagents by phage display. In the last project an initial parallelized set-up selected antibody fragments that showed high specificity and were compatible with several biotechnological applications, making the set-up a promising alternative to conventional immunization in proteome-wide endeavors.  QC 2010110...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel direct screening method, assayed in 96 -well format, for evaluation of enzymatic alkyl glycoside production in a hexanol water two-phase system. Alkyl glycosides are surfactants with a range of applications and with good biodegradability and low toxicity. Enzymatic synthesis makes it possible to prepare beta-D-glucopyranosides with high purity. In the developed screening assay, hexyl-ss-D-glucopyranoside was chosen as a model product to be synthesised by reversed hydrolysis in a water-hexanol two-phase system. In a first step the model product is produced by glucosidases expressed in E. coli cells in 96 <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> <b>plates.</b> After phase separation, the hexyl-ss-D-glucopyranoside in the organic phase is degraded enzymatically and the released glucose detected spectrophotometrically at 405 nm utilizing peroxidase/glucose oxidase, and the reagent 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS). The aqueous phase is used to monitor hydrolysis of p-NPG at 405 nm, allowing use of a ratio of the two assays to compensate for expression differences.
