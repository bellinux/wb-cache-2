5|$|Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the {{seventeen}} dogs left Cape Denison {{early in}} the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half {{the weight of the}} party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second <b>dog</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a <b>dog</b> <b>team,</b> intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E

40|$|The {{visually}} impaired {{have been a}} longstanding and wellrecognized user group addressed {{in the field of}} Human- Computer Interaction (HCI). Recently, the study of sighted dog owners and their pets has gained interest in HCI. Despite this, there is a noticeable gap in the field with regards to research on {{visually impaired}} owners and their <b>dogs</b> (guide <b>dog</b> <b>teams).</b> This paper presents a study that explores the interactions of guide <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> revealing a rich, holistic understanding of their everyday lives and needs, across both work and leisure activities. Our findings inform and inspire future research and practices suggesting three opportunity areas: supporting working guide <b>dog</b> <b>teams,</b> enhancing play-interaction through accessible dog toys utilizing sensor technologies, and speculative and exploratory opportunities. This work contributes to the growing research on designing for human-canine teams and motivates future research with guide <b>dog</b> <b>teams...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The USAF Sentry Dog {{program was}} a product of the Korean War. By 1965 the USAF had a pool of sentry <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> {{available}} for deployment to South Vietnam. Nightly at every air base, sentry <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> were deployed as a detection and warning screen in the zone separating combat forces from the perimeter. Nearly all air base defense personnel agreed that the Sentry <b>Dog</b> <b>Teams</b> rendered outstanding service. Some of which went as far as to say [...] "Of all the equipment and methods used to detect an attacking enemy force, the sentry dog has provided the most sure, all inclusive means." ...|$|R
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his <b>dog</b> <b>team,</b> he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E

25|$|The word nigger {{was used}} as a dog's name during {{the early part of the}} 20th century. A black {{explosive}} sniffer dog named Nigger served with a Royal Engineers mine clearance unit in 1944 during the Normandy Campaign. The dog leading a sledge <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> on the Terra Nova Expedition to the Antarctic (1910-1912) was also named Nigger.|$|E
25|$|The Ziegler polar {{expedition}} of 1903–1905, {{also known}} as the Fiala expedition, Fiala calculated that the food requirements of an eight <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> and driver would be at least 1100 pounds. This presented an issue, as the maximum sled load capacity was 600 pounds. He planned to use the ponies to carry the extra supplies, and to feed the dogs on horse meat when the supplies dwindled.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said (by the present-day {{explorer}} Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E

25|$|That January RJ Lamont {{started the}} Omineca Express and {{delivered}} mail from Omineca to Quesnel using a <b>dog</b> <b>team.</b> His first round trip took him six weeks: he left Quesnel on January 31, arrived at Vital Creek {{and returned to}} Quesnel on March 16 with part {{of his hands and}} face frozen. Nevertheless, he continued this service throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 1870, handling the Omineca mail for Wells Fargo and Barnard's Express.

25|$|Two {{recorded}} instances {{include a}} boy charged while swimming in Helm Bay (in southeast Alaska) and orcas trying to tip ice floes {{on which a}} <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. In {{the case of the}} boy in Alaska, the boy was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals, leading to speculation that the killer whales misidentified him as prey and aborted their attack. In the case of the Terra Nova expedition, there is speculation that the seal-like barking of the sled dogs may have triggered the killer whales' hunting curiosity.|$|E
25|$|O.glaber is more {{potentially}} dangerous {{in some places}} than in others. The United States, and especially the state of California, prohibits the ant from entering lest it should disrupt the country's ecosystems. Its relationship with honeydew-producing insects and consumption of parasitoids could disrupt the biological control of certain pests, risking long-term ecological damage that could reduce biodiversity, disrupt natural communities, or change ecosystem processes. Therefore, the high-risk team and <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> of the California Department of Food and Agriculture have intercepted the ant in nursery stock and fresh plants from Hawaii, and a border station found and stopped it on beehives from Florida. California is especially vulnerable to O.glaber infestation because the state's climate resembles that of those regions where the ant already lives. Nonetheless, O.glaber would not lower crop yields, increase farming costs, degrade water supplies, or likely disrupt Californian agricultural commodity markets.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} military-related uses, sentry dogs were used to defend camps or other priority areas at night and sometimes during the day. They would bark or growl to alert guards of a stranger's presence. During the Cold War, the American military used sentry <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> outside of nuclear weapons storage areas. A test program was conducted in Vietnam to test sentry dogs, launched two days after a successful Vietcong attack on Da Nang Air Base (July 1, 1965). Forty <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> were deployed to Vietnam for a four-month test period, with teams placed on the perimeter in front of machine gun towers/bunkers. The detection of intruders resulted in a rapid deployment of reinforcements. The test was successful, so the handlers returned to the US while the dogs were reassigned to new handlers. The Air Force immediately started to ship <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> to all the bases in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|R
500|$|Ninnis, his sledge and <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> {{had fallen}} through a {{crevasse}} [...] wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge {{deep in the}} hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There {{was no sign of}} their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as , too far for their ropes to reach. [...] "Dog ceased to moan shortly", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. [...] "We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called & sounded for an hour. Read the burial service." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnette began {{building}} a cabin {{at a site}} he named [...] "Chenoa City", and he sold supplies to two prospectors, Felix Pedro and Tom Gilmore, {{who were in the}} area. Barnette traded for furs, then traveled to Valdez via <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> with his wife and three other men. The mountain pass they traveled through was later named Isabel Pass in honor of Barnette's wife. From Valdez, he returned to St. Michael, where he built a steamboat, the Isabelle, and began sailing up the Yukon in August 1902. He intended to move his supplies to Tanacross, but when he arrived at his trading post on the Chena River, he changed his mind. Felix Pedro had discovered gold.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several days, the party {{continued}} across the glacier. They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses; the forerunner, on skis, would cross the snow covering the hole (the lid), and once across {{the first of the}} two dog teams would follow. Only after the first <b>dog</b> <b>team</b> was across would the second follow, [...] "otherwise", wrote Mawson, [...] "the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be, cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse". But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses, once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} rescue <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> often {{deployed}} internationally {{on their own}} initiative {{which led to a}} catastrophe tourism that needed to be restricted. Today rescue <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> only deploy as part of specially trained Urban Search and Rescue Teams (USAR-Teams) when the affected country has made a request after a major catastrophe. These teams which are often funded by the government consist of medics, technicians, rescue specialist and rescue <b>dog</b> <b>teams</b> and mostly deploy with their own equipment and plane. The International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) which was founded in 1991 under the roof of the United Nations is determining the frame conditions for such deployments and also classifies the USAR Teams that have to proof their mission readiness at the INSARAG External Classification (IEC). A re-classification has to be taken every five years. INSARAG is subordinated to UN OCHA, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.|$|R
