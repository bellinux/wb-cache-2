40|$|The leaf {{epidermal}} trichome of Arabidopsis thaliana is {{an ideal}} model system to study plant cell architecture due to its many mutants featuring distorted phenotypes. In this thesis, the DISTORTED 2 (DIS 2), GNARLED (GRL) and SPIRRIG (SPI) genes were cloned and characterized. Both, the morphological as well as subcellular mutant phenotypes were assessed and discussed. The dis 2 mutant displayed a pronounced distorted trichome phenotype, by having stubbed and swollen trichomes. The DIS 2 gene was cloned by a <b>gene</b> <b>candidate</b> approach and encoded the ARPC 2 subunit of the actin nucleating protein 2 and 3 (ARP 2 / 3) complex. Loss of function of the protein disclosed an aberrant actin cytoskeleton, when compared to wild type, and thus also featured an altered microtubule cytoskeleton. Based on the actin and microtubule density in the mutant and wild type, presumptions could be made of how local outgrowth of cells might be restricted to a defined area. A similar trichome phenotype was observed in grl mutants. The GRL gene was identified through a <b>gene</b> <b>candidate</b> approach, revealing several mutations in the GRL gene. Protein homology analysis uncovered GRL as a homolog of the animal NAP 125 protein. NAP 125 is known to regulate the ARP 2 / 3 complex. Phenotypical morphological analysis showed that grl exhibits the same plant defects, like pavement cell aberrations, hypocotyl cell and root hair defects, as observed in other distorted mutants. The cloning and identification of GRL suggested that the regulatory machinery to control the actin cytoskeleton is conserved in animals and plants. The spi mutant disclosed similar plant defects as described above, but the trichome alterations were more subtle and the root hairs were shorter than those of wild type. Map based cloning attempts, <b>gene</b> <b>candidate</b> approaches and sequencing of several spi mutant alleles led to the identification of SPI. The SPI gene encoded a 3600 amino acids long protein, with seven transmembrane-, one BEACH- and four WD 40 - domains and is thus a novel protein in determining cell shape. Based on the spi phenotype {{as well as on}} the protein domains, mentioned above, a function in membrane trafficking could be suggested...|$|E

New methods to sequence genetic data are invented and existing methods are refined, resulting in the generation of more and larger datasets. To extract useful data from these growing datasets, the algorithms processing them have to support the new and larger datasets. In this thesis, four zebrafish NanoCAGE datasets have been processed using new algorithms to map the genetic expression to known genes, discover unknown gene candidates and extract the occurrence of five Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). Also, the infected and control datasets have been compared to find infection induced genes. An unknown <b>gene</b> <b>candidate</b> {{has been found that}} appears to be highly expressed. The number of reads of that <b>gene</b> <b>candidate</b> is in the same order of the number of reads of the most expressed gene and in 3 out of 4 datasets it has more reads. A large number of other gene candidates have been found, of which more than 100 have more than 1000 matched reads. Furthermore, the TATA box TFBS occurs frequently upstream of highly transcribed locations on the genome. In the adult datasets, more than 40 % of the locations on the genome with more than 100000 reads have a TATA box at the expected distance {{from the start of the}} reads and in the embryo datasets that percentage is more than 25 %. In conclusion, the NanoCAGE method and the resulting datasets show to be valuable in the research of genetic expression and genetic regulation mechanisms.

To investigate if the genetic makeup of one or a set of these <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> can be used to identify a general pattern between migratory and non-migratory birds, we extracted genomic sequence data for 25 hypothesised <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> for migration from 70 available genomes across all orders of Aves and characterised sequence divergence between migratory and non-migratory phenotypes. When examining each gene separately across all species, we did not identify any genetic variants in <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> that distinguished migrants from non-migrants; any resulting pattern was driven by the phylogenetic signal. This was true for each gene analysed independently, but also for concatenated sequence alignments of all <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> combined.
