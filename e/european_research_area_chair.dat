The digital science, which {{relies on}} the use of {{electronic}} infrastructures, services, and tools based on ICT, makes scientific processes more efficient and transparent, offers new tools for scientific collaboration, experimentation, and analysis, and makes scientific knowledge more accessible. At the same time, the digital science contributes to the emergence of new scientific methods, disciplines, and paradigms to respond to new challenges through the global distribution of the communities in which individuals and the society are directly involved in the creation and consumption of scientific knowledge. The paper discusses the plans and arrangements of development and use of the digital science in European programs. They are about means to coordinate and support the formation and functioning of an open homogeneous Federated productive infrastructure for the whole of Europe, the single digital <b>Research</b> <b>Area</b> ERA (<b>European</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Area).</b> EGI (<b>European</b> Grid Infrastructure) {{plays a key role in}} the provision of services in this online <b>European</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Area,</b> which unifies and supports researchers of different disciplines, enabling them to process the data obtained in the integrated European computing environment.
