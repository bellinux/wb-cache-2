Despite a reasonably sustained focus upon the career, exploits and tactical brilliance of Scipio Africanus during the Hannibalic War, modern scholarship has neglected the apparent abandonment of his tactical reforms by the Roman army during the following half century. This project focuses upon the development of tactical doctrine within the Roman army throughout the Hannibalic and Macedonian Wars. The project's aims are to establish with certainty the nature and scope of Scipio Africanus' tactical reforms, that they constituted a widely applicable alteration to tactical doctrine, and, finally, whether this reform program was abandoned in the Second and Third Macedonian Wars. These aims are addressed by a comparison of six set piece engagements, each critically reexamined by the investigator and based upon ancient source material, {{in order to determine the}} ideal conception by which Roman commanders employed their armies. This comparison found that Scipio’s reforms constituted manifestly superior tactical doctrine, based upon the doctrinal principle of envelopment, which was abandoned by Roman command during operations in Macedonia. The project concluded that the abandonment of said reform program constitutes an informational failure at the organizational level, which may represent a base driver for the relative decline of the Roman military in the second century BCE and thus a partial origin of the Marian reforms.

40|$|ABSTRACT When a {{body and}} fluid have {{relative}} motion in between them, they experience ‘drag’, the force which resists this relative motion. Particularly in aeronautics and automotive research, drag reduction {{is the most}} investi-gated topic. In the sub-sonic range total drag force exerted on a body {{is the sum of}} skin friction and pressure drag. For a streamlined body 85 - 90 % of the drag is from skin friction while for a bluff body 80 - 85 % of the drag is due to pressure drag. Additionally, the shear layers of the separated flow tend to be unstable, and concentration of vortices results in huge vortices in the wake. Because of this unsteadiness the drag forces are also unsteady with respect to magnitude and direction, thus generating vibrations of the body. An enhanced comprehension of the fluid mechanics around and behind bluff bodies as well as its effect when applying different control methods is essential in order to develop more safety, more energy efficient, and adapted design within many areas of practical appli-cation [...] In this research a passive method of wake reduction is encapsulated in which a duct connects the <b>frontal</b> high <b>pressure</b> region of the bluff body with the low pressure region at the rear.

Furthermore, hypertension is a strong risk factor for cognitive decline. However, few studies have examined longitudinal relationships between blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>frontal</b> white matter integrity, hippocampal grey matter volume, and cognition within a healthy elderly population. This study utilized structural MRI and neuropsychological tests administered two years apart to examine these relationships in a sample of healthy, community-dwelling older adults aged 75 - 90. Results indicated that increases in frontal white matter disease and, more strongly, declines in hippocampal volume were better predictors of cognitive change than age and education. No significant associations were observed between blood pressure and cognition. These findings suggest tracking trajectories of structural change within the brains of elderly individuals over time can facilitate identification of those at risk for cognitive decline. ...|$|R
50|$|A South Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone (Commonly {{referred to as}} hurricanes) is a non <b>frontal,</b> low <b>pressure</b> system that has developed, within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and little vertical wind shear aloft in the South Pacific Ocean. Within the Southern Hemisphere there are officially three areas where {{tropical cyclone}}s develop on a regular basis, these areas are the South-West Indian Ocean between Africa and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific basin between 160°E and 120°W. The South Pacific basin between 160°E and 120°W is officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service and New Zealand's MetService, while others like the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also monitor the basin.

40|$|Advances in polymer {{chemistry}} {{have led}} to the development of monomers and initiation agents that enable propagating free-radical polymerization fronts to exist. These fronts are driven by the exothermicity of the polymerization reaction and the transport of heat from the polymerized product to the reactant monomer/solvent/initiator solution. The thermal energy transported to the reactant solution causes the initiator to decompose, yielding free radicals, which start the free radical polymerization process as discussed in recent reviews. The use of polymerization processes based on propagating fronts has numerous applications. Perhaps the most important of these is that it enables rapid curing of polymers without external heating since the polymerization process itself provides the high temperatures necessary to initiate and sustain polymerization. This process also enables more uniform curing of arbitrarily thick samples since it does not rely on heat transfer from an external source, which will necessarily cause the temperature history of the sample to vary with distance from the surface according to a diffusion-like process. Frontal polymerization also enables filling and sealing of structures having cavities of arbitrary shape without having to externally heat the structure. Water at atmospheric pressure is most convenient solvent to employ and the most important for practical applications (because of the cost and environmental issues associated with DMSO and other solvents). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, steady, self-propagating polymerization fronts have not been reported in water at atmospheric pressure. Currently, polymerization fronts require a high boiling point solvent (either water at high pressures or an alternative solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (boiling point 189 C at atmospheric pressure.) Early work on <b>frontal</b> polymerization, employed <b>pressures</b> up to 5000 atm in order to avoid boiling of the monomer/solvent/initiator solution. High boiling point solutions are needed because in order to produce a propagating front, a high front temperature is needed to produce sufficiently rapid decomposition of the free radical initiator and subsequent free radical polymerization and heat release at a rate faster than heat losses remove thermal energy from the system. (While the conduction heat loss rate increases linearly with temperature, the free radical initiator decomposition is a high activation energy process whose rate increases much more rapidly than linearly with temperature, thus as the temperature decreases, the ratio of heat loss to heat generation increases, eventually leading to extinction of the front if the temperature is too low.) In order to obtain atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>frontal</b> polymerization in water, it is necessary to identify a monomer/initiator combination that is water soluble and will not extinguish even when the peak temperature (T*) is less than 100 C. In this work acrylic acid (AA) was chosen as the monomer because is it one of the most reactive monomers and can polymerize readily at low temperatures even without initiators. Ammonium persulfate (AP) was chosen as the initiator because it decomposes readily at low temperatures, produces relatively few bubbles and is commercially available. The propagation rates and extinction conditions of the fronts are studied for a range of AA and AP concentrations. Small amounts of fumed silica powder (Cab-o-sil, Cabot Corporation) were added to the solutions to inhibit buoyancy induced convection in the solutions; future studies will investigate the effects of buoyant convection within the solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the evolution of ground reaction force during alpine skiing turns. Specifically, this study investigated how turn phases and slope steepness affected the whole foot normal GRF pattern while performing giant slalom turns in a race-like setting. Moreover, the outside foot was divided into different plantar regions to see whether those parameters affected the plantar pressure distribution. Eleven skiers performed one giant slalom course at race intensity. Runs were recorded synchronously using a video camera in the <b>frontal</b> plane and <b>pressure</b> insoles under both feet's plantar surface. Turns were divided according to kinematic criteria into four consecutive phases: initiation, steering 1, steering 2 and completion; both steering phases being separated by the gate passage. Component of the averaged Ground Reaction Force normal to the ski's surface([Formula: see text], /BW), and Pressure Time Integral relative to the entire foot surface (relPTI, %) parameters were calculated for each turn phases based on plantar pressure data. Results indicated that [Formula: see text] under the total foot surface differed significantly depending on the slope (higher in steep sections vs. flat sections), and the turn phase (higher during steering 2 vs. three other phases), although such modifications were observable only on the outside foot. Moreover, [Formula: see text] under the outside foot was significantly greater than under the inside foot. RelPTI under different foot regions of the outside foot revealed a global shift from forefoot loading during initiation phase, toward heel loading during steering 2 phase, but this was dependent on the slope studied. These results suggest a differentiated role played by each foot in alpine skiing turns: the outside foot has an active role in the turning process, while the inside foot may only play a role in stability...|$|R

Two tests were conducted with shallow gouge depths for comparison with previous Delft Hydraulics flume medium scale gouge tests to evaluate the applicability of centrifuge modeling. Three tests were conducted at a fast gouge rate since most of the previous work were conducted at a relatively slow rate. A large amount of data regarding ice keel gouge in sand was acquired from the experimental program the analysis of which described here in. [...] The combined depth of gouge depth and frontal berm height has a significant effect on the force and subgouge deformation. The force per unit width increases as the gouge depth increases. The vertical to lateral gouge force ratio seems to be independent of the aspect ratio which is gouge width divide gouge depth or attack angle. The kappa value is the frontal berm height normalized by gouge depth is linear with the aspect ratio. The kappa value has a significant effect on gouge force and subgouge deformation. Particle image velocimetry (PlV) technique was successfully used to track the evolution of subgouge deformation in all 7 tests. The maximum horizontal subgouge displacement occurred {{at the base of the}} keel and decreased with depth. The associated maximum gouge forces are a function of the keel attack angle and the gouge geometry. In comparison with previous tests, the vertical extent of subgouge deformation (SGD) was a function of combined depth and the soil state, but independent of the attack angle. The SGD are influenced by the attack angle and the soil state. Faster gouge rates may result in larger gouge forces by a factor of 2 to 3 and smaller horizontal subgouge deformations but similar vertical extent...|$|R
40|$|This thesis details some {{applications}} of tracer techniques from laboratory scale studies of diffusion in porous media {{to the analysis}} of the transport and dispersion of pollutants in the mountain-valley and coastal environments that form the majority of the state of California. Chapter 1 describes a technique for estimating gaseous diffusivities in porous media that is based on the general solution to Fick's second law for diffusion in a tube between two well-mixed volumes. In beds of essentially non-porous particles, the ratio of the measured effective diffusivity to the air diffusivity of a gas was found to be proportional to the bed porosity raised to the 1. 43 power, a result in agreement with previous studies on similar materials. High moisture content (> 15 - 20 % moisture in sand) was found to significantly reduce the gas diffusivity with respect to that found in dry materials. Chapter 2 indicates the importance of ventilation system imbalance upon the reentrainment of pollutants exhausted from a building. Tracer was released from a fumehood in a "clean" room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Indoor concentrations as high as 235 PPB/gr-mole tracer released/hr were observed due to infiltration of the exhausted tracer. This concentration is about an order of magnitude higher than has been observed in buildings with more balanced ventilation systems. Predictions of single and multi-compartment stirred-tank models were compared to the dynamics of the tracer infiltration. A simple one-compartment model provided a better description of the infiltration dynamics than a three-compartment model suggested by the design of the ventilation system. Chapter 3 describes a series of atmospheric tracer studies of the transport and dispersion of pollutants over the ocean and near an isolated island cape. The experiments were designed to determine the impact of local sources on a background air quality sampling program. The horizontal dispersion of the tracer over the ocean surface could be approximated by the Gaussian plume model assuming a neutrally stable atmosphere, in general agreement with the expected atmospheric stability. Tracer releases {{from the surface of the}} isolated cape indicated that an essentially well-mixed separated zone existed above and downwind of the cape. The height of this zone extended to 35 - 40 % above the height of the cape, about the same height as the wake downwind of an isolated building. Limited mixing between the separated zone and the freestream resulted in a sharp concentration gradient above this height. Chapter 5 indicates the difficulties of describing the behavior of pollutants in complex terrain. A series of tracer experiments conducted in the northern and central California Coastal Mountains are described. The Gaussian plume model could be used to describe the dispersion of the tracer during strong, unidirectional winds. During an elevated tracer release, however, wind directional shear with altitude led to plume bifurcation, with the majority being transported through a stable nighttime drainage layer to ground level. The transport through the stable layer occurred at a vertical velocity of about 2 cm/s, surprisingly rapid transport between stably stratified layers of the atmosphere. Chapter 6 describes the uncertainties associated with mass balance and Gaussian parameter estimates from tracer data. The uncertainty in the calculated final result can be less than the errors (assumed random) associated with any individual experimental measurement, indicating that such calculations can be made with greater accuracy than would initially be expected. Chapter 7 details the transport of pollutants in the San Joaquin Valley during stable wintertime conditions. The relatively limited net ventilation of the valley indicates that pollutants can remain within the valley for several days subsequent to their release. During one tracer experiment, about 50 % of the released tracer was observed to be well-mixed within the southern valley about 72 hours after the beginning of the release. The most significant ventilation mechanism for the valley during the winter was the occasional passage of low <b>pressure</b> <b>frontal</b> systems. Long periods without frontal system passage can lead to significant pollutant buildup. Chapter 8 describes the transport of pollutants in the San Joaquin Valley during summertime conditions. While much more effectively ventilated than during the winter, the increased solar insolation leads to significant ozone levels within the valley. A strong influx of air at the northern mouth of the valley is balanced during the day by a corresponding efflux at its southern end and by daytime upslope flow on the Sierra Nevada Mountains. At night, an eddy forms in the southern valley due to low level stabilization and terrain blockage of the afternoon efflux over the southern boundary of the valley. This eddy grows as more air is entrained from the influx at the northern mouth of the valley. An accelerated layer of air aloft also develops during the night due to surface layer stabilization and decoupling. These dynamic flow structures are significant factors in the transport and dispersion of pollutants in the valley during the summer. Chapter 9 details the impact of the San Joaquin Valley on the northern Mojave Desert. The transport of pollutants from the southern valley was linked through both tracer and aerosol data to the rapid nighttime reduction in visibility in the northern Mojave Desert. Unlike winter conditions, most of the pollutants in the southern valley were transported out of the valley within a day after their release. Chapter 10 describes the impact on the Sierra Nevada Mountains of pollutant sources within the San Joaquin Valley. Tracer released within the valley was efficiently transported upslope, impacting National Park and Forest areas. The maximum concentrations observed upslope could be approximated with the Gaussian plume model, assuming very unstable atmospheric conditions. Nighttime stabilization arrested the upslope movement of the tracer and led to slope and valley impacts throughout the night. The limited nighttime ventilation of the slopes may result in the significant ozone concentrations typically observed at slope sites throughout the night. Chapter 11 describes the transport characteristics of the Sacramento Valley, the northern half of the California Central Valley. Tracer experiments indicated that San Francisco Bay area pollutants have only a small effect on the air quality in the Sacramento Valley. A midday flow divergence over Sacramento resulted in tracer impacts in both the northern part of the valley and the slopes northeast of the city. A counterclockwise eddy that forms in the southern valley during the morning was a potential mechanism for recirculating aged pollutants within the valley. During one tracer experiment, most of the released tracer was trapped within an elevated layer of air, a potentially important mechanism for multi-day impacts of pollutants. Chapter 12 evaluates the transport of pollutants in the Santa Barbara Channel off the coast of southern California. Limited vertical mixing combined with diurnal wind reversals resulted in multi-day onshore impacts of the tracer released offshore. Efficient lateral mixing of the tracer during wind reversals led to a widespread coastal impact from a single point source. The existence of many point sources could result in a diluted background concentration (i. e. after wind reversals) that equals or exceeds the concentration directly downwind of a single source. Chapter 13 develops a two layer model of the atmosphere that semi-quantitatively incorporates much of the basic transport structure observed in the above studies. The method of characteristics and the method of moments were used to examine the implications of the model. The model indicates that the air aloft must be considered in order to accurately predict the impact of a pollutant source, especially when considering the multi-day or long range impact of the source...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe medulla oblongta {{contains}} two distinct vasomotor centers, the vasoconstrictor and the vasodilator. Vascular tone {{is enhanced by}} vasoconstrictor impulses and relaxed by vaso-dilator impulses. Hooker (1918) and Donegan (1921) reported that venous blood vesselt are under the same tonic influences as the arterial vessels. The capillaries, on the other hand, lack a muscular coat and can not respond to stimulation. However, Fulton and Lutz (1940) directly observed in the frog that precapillaries and capillary origins contain modified smooth muscle cells, which are innervated by a nerve plexus physiologically independent of the supplying arterioles. The sphincter-like capillary origins regulate the capillary blood flow. Dale and Evans (1922) reported that carbon dioxide directly stimulates the vasoconstrictor center. McDowall (1930) showed that oxygen lack also excites the vasoconstrictor center and in later work (1935) reported {{that the effect of}} oxygen lack is not as great as that of excess carbon dioxide. Adrenalin and pitressin in moderate doses cause vasoconstriction. Burget and Visscher (1927) reported whether adrenalin constricts or dilates a blood vessel depends on the pH of the blood. Smaller amounts of adrenalin cause vasoconstriction in a more alkaline medium. Lewis and Zotterman (1927) reported that any strong chemical and ultraviolet light produce a flare reaction. Menkin (1936) reported that inflammatory substances cause an immediate local vasodilation and increase the capillary permeability. Temperature changes influence both innervated and denervated vessels. Cold stimuli effect vasoconstriction and warm stimuli cause vasodilatation. Howell, Budgett and Leonard (1894) noticed that the vasoconstrictor nerves are more susceptible to temperature changes than the vasodilators. McDowall (1930) reported that the vasodilator effect lasts longer than the vasoconstrictor effect. Excessive temperature changes produce inconsistent results. Abnormal vasoconstriction causes an increase in the peripheral resistance of the blood vessels. Page (1937) stated that an increased resistance to flow appears to be the major if not sole factor in the production of hypertension. Blood viscosity {{does not appear to be}} a factor in increasing the peripheral resistance. That peripheral resistance is of vasomotor origin or due to "intrinsic spasms" of the blood vessels is a very controversial subject (Page, 1937). The main control of peripheral resistance is in the variation of the contraction of the musculature of the vessels, which is normally under nervous and chemical influences. However in the various types of hypertension, several factors may exist which cause an increased peripheral resistance. The cardiac output is usually unchanged in hypertension. Page (1937) reported that only in cases of hyperthyroidism is an increased cardiac output evident. The medullary centers may become hyperactive and cause hypertension. The abnormal vasoconstrictor response following cold stimulation suggests vasomotor instability (Hines, 1940 a, and Grimson, 1941). Fulton (1943) stimulated areas 4 and 6 of the cerebral cortex of the cat and produced a marked rise in the systolic <b>pressure.</b> <b>Frontal</b> lobe stimulation also raises the blood pressure (Bailey and Sweet, 1940). An increased intracranial pressure effects marked hypertension (Griffith, Jeffers and Lindauer, 1935). Griffith and Roberts (1938) suggested that hypertension results from the obstruction of the perineural-lymphatic drainage. Grimson, Wilson and Phemister (1937) and Freeman and Jeffers (1940) reported that sympathectomy abolishes this type of hypertension. Alexander (1939) stated that emotional conflicts may either enter into the onset of hypertension or aggravate the existing symptoms. Weiss (1942) reported that emotional tension due to a chronic repressed rage is responsible for increasing both the anxiety state and tha blood pressure. Psychotherapy may dig out the emotional conflict and relieve the anxiety that aggravates the hypertension. The autonomic nervous system with the intrinsic cardiovascular reflexes regulate the blood pressure. The pressor reflex of the heart and large veins shifts the large venous reservoir to the arterial system (Bainbridge, 1915). Nonidez (1937) reported subendothelial pressoreceptors in the intrapericardial portion of all the large veins entering the heart and in the coronary sinus near the right auricle. Nonidez stated that the Bainbridge reflex is due to stimulation of the pressoreceptors of the veins and that auricular distention does not actively initiate the reflex cardiac acceleration. The carotid sinus cardiovascular reflex causes a sustained vasodilatation (Winder, 1937). That the carotid sinus cardiac reflex is more poorly maintained than the sinus vasomotor reflex is shown by the fact that there is a larger crossed component of the efferent vasomotor pathway than the efferent cardiac pathway, and that the former shows the process of occlusion, while the latter shows the process of facilitation (Wang and Borison, 1947 b). Winder (1937) pointed out that the aortic cardiovascular mechanism has a great buffering effect on the carotid sinus system. The aortic system is concerned more with cardiac control than the vasomotor regulation (Blalock, 1940). The vagi and sympathetics appear to act reciprocally in a certain time sequence in cardiac control via the carotid sinus reflex. Wang and Borison (1947 a) showed that the vagi predominate in the first and the sympathetics in the last phase of the sequence in cardiac restraint. Vagal bradycardia is independent, however, of the sympathetic component. Sattler (1940) stated that stimulation of the central end of the cut vagus nerve produces a reflex rise in the blood pressure. Two components exist in the reflex, a sudden rise (sympathetic effect) and a delayed rise (vago-neurohypophysial effect). Schmidt and Comroe (1940) reported that chemical stimulation of the carotid and aortic bodies causes a reflex pressor effect. The chemoreceptors have a lower threshold to anoxia than the vasomotor centers; with carbon dioxide, the opposite is the case. The pH of the blood is more important than excess carbon dioxide in exciting the chemoreceptors. These workers suggested that only in the hypertension of anoxia do the chemoreceptors play an important role. Ranson (1936) postulated that the sympathetic center is located in the posterior region of the hypothalamus and the parasympathetic center in the anterior hypothalamic area. The hypothalamus has direct connections with the brain stem and lower centers as well as indirect connections with the cerebral cortex; during intense emotional excitement, the hypothalamus unifies the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Removal of this organ prevents the formatlon of a fully developed emotional response. Page (1937) stated that vasoendocrine secretions eithe directly enhance vascular tone and arterial pressure or combine with other secretions to this effect. The adrenal cortical secretions are very important in maintaining vascular tone and may enter into the genesis of renal hypertension. Heymans and Bouckaert (1931) reported that section of the carotid sinus and the aortic depressor nerves produces a sustained neurogenic hypertension. Winder, Bernthal and Weeks (1938) reported that carotid body ischemia greatly excites the chemoreceptors to cause hypertension. Nowak and Walker (1939) and Blalock (1940) reported that cerebral vascular ischemia causes hypertension providing the collateral circulation is also affected. Renal hypertension can be produced by clamping the renal artery (Goldblatt, Lynch, Hanzal and Summerville, 1934) or by a capsule about the kidney (Page, 1939). Braasch, Walters and Hammer (1940) stated that the renal lesion must cause widespread atrophy of the renal tissues and sclerosis of the renal vessels to cause renal hypertension. Foster and Maes (1947) reported that in rabbits neurogenic hypertension caused an increase in the renal plasm flow and glomerular filtration rate. Grimson (1941) and Goldblatt, Kahn and Lewis (1942) reported that neither renal denervation or any type of sympathectomy abolishes renal hypertension. Feet, Woods and Braden (1940) failed to show that the renal vasoconstrictor nerves are hyperactive in renal hypertension. Grollman (1946) reported that chronic renal hypertension is maintained not by a humoral process but by a neurogenic factor; removal of the diseased kidney or all renal tissue does not lower the blood pressure. Grimson (1940) reported that renal denervation, partial and complete sympathectomy all fail to prevent neurogenic hypertension. Grimson (1945) reported that cervical cord section does not permanently reduce the hypertension. Grimson, Wilson and Phemister (1937) reported a new central vasopressor mechanism appears after total sympathectomy which maintains a moderate hypertension. Fishberg (1948) reported that sympathectomy was useful in less than 4 percent of the cases with essential hypertension. If the symptoms of hypertension are severe, sympathectomy may offer some relief...|$|R
