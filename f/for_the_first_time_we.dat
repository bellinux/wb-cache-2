Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. [...] "We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools... ejected from churches... and thrown into jail... But <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> witnessed being kicked out of jail." [...] It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out of jail during this time.|$|E

For five months, the trio stayed at a Hollywood hotel during the recording sessions, {{where they would}} often play loud music late at night, prompting complaints. The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment: [...] "For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how {{we were supposed to}} behave as Green Day. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars." [...] American Idiot took ten months to complete, at a cost of $650,000. By the end of the process, Armstrong felt [...] "delirious" [...] regarding the album: [...] "I feel like I'm on the cusp of something with this. [...] I really feel [...] like we're really peaking right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E

I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> chatted about poetry.

[...] Karpal approvingly cited the Lock-Up Rules, which only allow the interrogation of prisoners between 6.30am and 6.30pm, and noted that the decision meant Teoh's family could sue the MACC for his false imprisonment as well.

[...] Einstein gleefully pointed out that this equation now takes the form which he had earlier proposed with von Laue, and gives a concrete example of a class of theories which he had studied with Grossmann.|$|E
2500|$|Kai Yuan Tong Bao (...) {{were the}} main coin issued by the Tang. It was cast {{for most of the}} dynasty, a period of nearly 300 years. It was first issued by the Emperor Gao Zu in the autumn of the 4th year of the Wu De period (August 621). Its {{diameter}} was to be 8 fen. The weight was set at 2.4 zhu, ten to the liang. 1,000 coins weighed 6 jin 4 liang. The legend was written by the famous calligrapher Ouyang Xun in a much admired mixture of the Bafen and Li (official or clerkly) styles of writing. This is the first to include the phrase tong bao, used on many subsequent coins. The inscription was used by other regimes in later periods; such coins can be distinguished from Tang coins by their workmanship. Minting and copper extraction were centrally controlled, and private casting was punishable by death. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> find regulations giving the prescribed coinage alloy: 83% copper, 15% lead, and 2% tin. Previously the percentages used seem to have been on an ad hoc basis. Actual analyses show rather less copper than this.|$|E
2500|$|The dating of the Hand G miniatures {{has been}} placed at various points between 1417 and the late 1430s. The pages {{attributed}} to him are [...] universally agreed {{to be the most}} innovative; Hulin de Loos described these miniatures as [...] "the most marvelous that had ever decorated a book, and, for their time the most stupefying known to the history of art. [...] <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> see realized, in all of its consequences, the modern conception of painting... For the first time since antiquity, painting recovers the mastery of space and light" [...] Hulin de Loos thought these the work of Hubert van Eyck, who, like most art historians of the time, he also believed to be the main artist of the Ghent Altarpiece. He thought the less exciting, but similar, Hand H might be Jan van Eyck. [...] Since then art historical opinion has shifted to see both Hand G and most of the Ghent Altarpiece as the work of Jan; Max J. Friedländer, [...] Anne van Buren and Albert Châtelet were among the proponents of this view. [...] More recently, some art historians see Hand G as a different but related artist, in some ways even more innovative than the famous brothers. Proponents of this view highlight the many close compositional, iconographical and typographical similarities to van Eyck's panel paintings of the 1430s.|$|E
