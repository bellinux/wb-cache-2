Senior combat {{designer}} Derek Daniels {{said that for}} God of War II, they were basing the magical attacks on elements (e.g., air and earth). He said the combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic. He {{said that they were}} working for a similar balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat seen in the first game, and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for the overall balance. Unlike God of War where magic had a small role, Daniels said that for God of War II, their goal was to make magic {{an integral part of the}} combat system and to make it more refined. Barlog said the game would feature new creatures and heroes from the mythology, and he wanted to put more boss battles in it. Commenting on multiplayer options, Barlog said that [...] "there are possibilities for that but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>we</b> are doing right now." [...] He said that he felt that God of War is a single-player experience, and although multiplayer [...] "would be cool," [...] it did not appeal to him to work on. As for a PlayStation Portable (PSP) installment, he said that he thought it [...] "would be freaking awesome," [...] but not something he had time to work on and it was Sony's decision whether or not to make a PSP installment.|$|E
500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>we</b> are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>we</b> are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

Communism <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>we</b> desired. So we stayed a way from politics and made it a people's battle.

5000|$|Yes, {{doing it}} in the kernel is [...] "more robust". But don't play games, and stop the lying.

However, in November 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit, the representatives of the minority government of Canada spoke publicly on the world stage in opposition to the resolution. Canada's finance minister, Jim Flaherty, restated Canada's opposition to a Tobin tax, saying: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>we</b> would be interested in in Canada.

Ethical challenges <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>we</b> consider often enough in this or most biomedical research journals. Yet, such challenges increasingly confront us as private citizens providing health data and as researchers using these data for public health and research purposes. Big data is an ill-defined term, yet there can be no denying that social media data (which are described in this article for use in digital disease detection [DDD]) cover a large and varied area, measured by both volume and velocity (rate of accumulation), and, as the authors de-scribe, have the potential for important public health uses, but also have risks. And that, as de-scribed, is only one potential use of these data; there are many other uses barely introduced by the authors. In short the appeal of such data is huge, but so are the risks. The authors do an ex-cellent job of characterizing the pluses and minuses of DDD. I encourage all of us to contem-plate this article and the implications it masterfully elucidates. The underlying message from Vayena et al. is clear: use of these data far outpaces the gover-nance and due diligence of the ethical considerations that need to be addressed. Quoting th...|$|R
