In addition, the role of cis-trans isomerization of radical anions in electrohydrodimerization reactions is discussed. Differences in the cyclic voltammograms of diethyl maleate in the presence of acrylonitri le when com-pared with those obtained in the absence of acrylonitri le and for dimethyl fumarate in the presence of acrylonitri le are observed. We have previously reported (1) the use of rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammetry, cyclic volt-ammetry, and coulometry in the elucidation of the mechanism of the electrohydrodimerization (electro-lytic reductive coupling) of the three di-substituted olefins dimethyl fumarate (DF), cinnamonitri le (CN), and fumaronitri le (FN) <b>in</b> <b>anhydrous</b> dimethylform-amide (DMF) <b>solution.</b> Potential-step chronoamper-ometry has also been employed to determine the elec-trohydrodimerization mechanism of diethyl fumarate (2). These studies showed that these hydrodimeriza-tions proceed predominantly via a one-electron reduc-tion R+e~R [1] followed by a radical ion dimerization (EC reaction scheme) for each olefin _ 8...|$|R
40|$|A {{highly unusual}} series of Group 2 {{complexes}} with soft thio- and selenoether coordination, [MI 2 ([18]aneO 4 E 2) ] (M = Ca or Sr; E = S or Se), [CaI 2 ([18]aneO 2 S 4) ] and [MI 2 ([15]aneO 3 S 2) ], has been prepared by reaction of anhydrous MI 2 with the macrocycle in dry MeCN solution. The complexes have been characterised via 1 H NMR and IR spectroscopy, microanalysis and crystallographic studies which provide unambiguous {{confirmation of the}} M–S/Se coordination. The neutral complexes are seven- or eight-coordinate with the iodo ligands cis. The long M–E bond distances of [similar] 3. 0 Å indicate weak interactions, but they are significantly less {{than the sum of}} the van der Waals radii for M and E, and are important in facilitating isolation of the complexes. Trace hydrolysis of [MI 2 ([18]aneO 4 E 2) ] and [SrI 2 ([15]aneO 3 S 2) ] leads, unexpectedly, to displacement of the iodo ligands rather than the S/Se donor functions, and the resulting dicationic [Ca(H 2 O) 2 ([18]aneO 4 S 2) ]I 2, [Sr(H 2 O) 3 ([18]aneO 4 S 2) ]I 2 ·H 2 O, [Sr(H 2 O) 3 ([18]aneO 4 Se 2) ]I 2 and [Sr(H 2 O) 3 ([15]aneO 3 S 2) ]I 2 complexes have been structurally characterised, forming eight- and nine-coordinate cations, with all the macrocyclic donor atoms coordinated. Reaction of Ca(CF 3 SO 3) 2 with [18]aneO 4 S 2 <b>in</b> <b>anhydrous</b> MeCN <b>solution</b> similarly affords [Ca(CF 3 SO 3) 2 ([18]aneO 4 S 2) ], albeit in low yield, also proven crystallographically. Using the MI 2 precursors provides a general entry into this area of coordination chemistry of these Group 2 ions, owing in part at least to their higher solubility in the weak donor (weakly competing) MeCN solvent. While CaCl 2 reacts with 18 -crown- 6 either directly in MeCN giving [CaCl 2 (18 -crown- 6) ], or in the presence of SbCl 5 (to form trans-[Ca(MeCN) 2 (18 -crown- 6) ][SbCl 6] 2), neither of these routes works with the oxa-thia or oxa-selena crown...|$|R
40|$|Bismuth trihalides (BiX 3, X = Cl, Br or I) {{reacted with}} a range of thio- and seleno-ether ligands L-L <b>in</b> <b>anhydrous</b> MeCN <b>solution</b> to yield {{compounds}} with either a 1 : 1, 1 : 2 or 2 : 1 Bi : L-L ratio. Structural studies on [BiBr 3 {MeE(CH 2) (3) EMe}] (E = S or Se) and [BiCl 3 {MeSe(CH 2) (3) SeMe}] revealed that all of these species adopt an infinite two-dimensional sheet array derived from planar Bi 2 X 6 units linked by bridging dithio- or diseleno-ether ligands which occupy mutually trans co-ordination sites, giving a distorted octahedral geometry at Bi-III. The structure of [BiBr 3 {MeS(CH 2) (2) SMe}(2) ] reveals a discrete molecular compound which adopts a 7 -co-ordinate distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry involving two chelating MeS(CH 2) (2) SMe ligands. This arrangement is also found for the iodide analogue. Reaction of BiBr 3 with the Ph-substituted ligand PhS(CH 2) (2) SPh generated a very different structural arrangement in which chains of almost mutually orthogonal Bi 2 Br 2 'rectangles' are crosslinked by bridging dithioether ligands to yield infinite sheets of formula [Bi 2 Br 6 {PhS(CH 2) (2) SPh}]. With the tripodal ligands L- 3 (MeC(CH 2 SMe) (3) or MeC(CH 2 SeMe) (3)) compounds of stoichiometry [BiX 3 (L- 3) ] were obtained. The crystal structure of [BiCl 3 {MeC(CH 2 SeMe) (3) }] shows Bi 2 Cl 6 subunits linked by bridging selenoether ligands to give a two-dimensional sheet. Each selenoether tripod functions as a bidentate chelate to Bi and bridges to an adjacent Bi via the third Se-donor, giving a distorted octahedral geometry at Bi-III. Although a rather poor quality structure, [Bi 2 I 6 {MeC(CH 2 SeMe) (3) }(2) ] is not isostructural with its chloro analogue, but shows discrete dimers formed via Bi 2 I 6 subunits, with each Bi also co-ordinated to a bidentate Se tripod and two terminal I ligands. The third Se-donor on each ligand remains non-co-ordinating. The influence of the Bi-based lone pair on the structures adopted by these complexes is discussed...|$|R

X-ray crystal structures are reported for [BX 3 {μ-EtS(CH 2) 2 SEt}BX 3] (X = Cl, Br, I), [BBr 3 {μ-MeSe(CH 2) 2 SeMe}BBr 3], [BCl 3 {o-C 6 H 4 (SMe) 2 }] and [(BBr 3) 2 {μ-o-C 6 H 4 (SeMe) 2 }]. The complexes [(BX 3) 2 {MeTe(CH 2) 3 TeMe}] (X = F, Cl, Br) {{have been identified in}} solution by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, but decompose rapidly, whilst o-C 6 H 4 (TeMe) 2 decomposes immediately on contact with BBr 3 or BCl 3. Dealkylation of some of the chalcogenoether ligands at room temperature by BI 3, to yield complexes including [BI 2 {o-C 6 H 4 S(SMe) ] and [BI 2 {o-C 6 H 4 Se(SeMe) ], has been identified and the X-ray structure of [BI 2 {o-C 6 H 4 Se(SeMe) ] determined.
