Despite recognition of the scarcity of appropriate tests for Aboriginal people over many years, limited practical development has occurred. This study aimed to identify barriers to assessment for clinicians working with Aboriginal people in a remote context, and evaluate characteristics of assessments that clinicians considered to be more or less appropriate and thereby identify potential ways forward. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 22 health professionals working with Aboriginal clients in central and northern Australia enquired about cognitive assessment practices for Aboriginal people. Themes related to common barriers, useful approaches and areas of need are reported. Results: Results demonstrated that engagement, diversity and the lack of appropriate resources were seen as the most significant barriers to effective assessment. Appropriate tools should be visually engaging, brief, portable, relevant, focus on identifying strengths and cater to diversity whilst also being standardised and scientifically valid. Conclusions: Despite the obvious challenges, further development is required to increase available resources and evidence base. Specifically, assessments suitable for younger populations and measuring substance misuse related impairments and change over time in a clinical setting were highlighted as important areas of need.

Larger double peak support moments with reduced ankle plantar flexor and increased knee extensor moments were found. The hip moments were relatively small and highly variable. There was a significantly reduced peak knee extensor eccentric power (P = 0. 005) with backwards descent. These results demonstrate that stair descent (forward and backward) required higher moments at the knee than level walking but backward descent demanded less peak knee moment and eccentric power than forward descent. Overall, the use of a backward approach, offer an alternative for people unable to access stairs in the <b>forward</b> fashion. (<b>Abstract</b> shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Forward induction equilibrium according to this new definition exists for all finite, generic extensive form games with perfect recall. It does not satisfy backward induction. Yet for generic extensive form games the set of forward induction outcomes contains an invariant sequential equilibrium outcome. Forward induction is not equivalent to iterative elimination of strategies dominated at the equilibrium value.

In this setting, platform evolution {{can leave the}} transforma-tion, and hence the generated code, outdated. This issue is exacerbated by the perpetual beta phenomenon in Web 2. 0 platforms where contin-uous delta releases are a common practice. Here, manual co-evolution becomes cumbersome. This paper looks at how to automate fully or in partthe synchronization process between the platform and the trans-formation. To this end, the transformation process is split in two parts: the stable part is coded as a MOFScript transformation whereas the unstable side is isolated through an adapter that is implicitly called by the transformation at generation time. In this way, platform upgrades impact the adapter but leave the transformation untouched. The work focuses on DB schema evolution, and takes MediaWiki as a vivid case study. A first case study results in the upfront cost of using the adapter paying off after three releases MediaWiki upgrades. ...|$|R
