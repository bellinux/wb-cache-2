In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component. It refers to the tax-financed system and includes social assistance programs, minimum incomes and programs aimed at vocational training, and at integrating the young or long-term unemployed. These programs benefit those who {{do not have access to}} the social insurance system, such as the long-term unemployed or the young unemployed who have not contributed enough or have only a very short contribution period. Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, allowance for disabled adults, <b>integration</b> <b>allowance,</b> specific solidarity allowance, lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small invalidity insurance benefits), widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|E

However, the reduction in insecurity is difficult to measure and many papers {{have focused on the}} measurement of the efficiency of public transfer programs in reducing poverty (Heady et al., 1999; Ray, 2006). Also in Italy, {{one of the most critical}} aspects of our welfare state system is the low ability of the public authorities to effectively target the deserving population through transfer policy. Many papers have shown that the most important social transfers (social benefits and <b>allowances,</b> <b>integration</b> to a minimum of old age pensions, disability benefits, housing allowances) have moderate effects on poverty and income distributio...|$|R
