5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation <b>is</b> <b>finished</b> using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street.

With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction <b>is</b> <b>finished,</b> the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E

Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she <b>is</b> <b>finished</b> packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
