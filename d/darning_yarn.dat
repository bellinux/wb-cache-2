5000|$|Four {{volumes of}} {{black-and-white}} Sock Monkey comics have been published; each volume {{consists of two}} issues. Volume 3 won the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication. Volume 4 featured one issue drawn in charcoal, {{as opposed to the}} ink of the other issues, and another issue in which the character designs were changed dramatically. These comics have also been collected in two trade paperbacks, each containing two volumes: The Adventures of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey (2000) and The Collected Works of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey (2004). As of late 2006 a four-issue Sock Monkey mini-series featuring an extended story titled [...] "The Inches Incident" [...] is being released one issue at a time. In addition to the Sock Monkey comics, Millionaire has also produced five other Sock Monkey books. Sock Monkey: A Children's Book (2001) and Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob (2002) mix comics with illustrated prose. Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby (2004), That <b>Darn</b> <b>Yarn</b> (2005), and Little and Large (2005) are full-color, hardcover comic books. That <b>Darn</b> <b>Yarn</b> and Little and Large are both 36 pages and read much more like children's storybooks than Millionaire's other Sock Monkey comics.|$|R
