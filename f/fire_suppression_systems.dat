5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 <b>fire,</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> using foam.|$|E

25|$|The {{weight of}} the BMD-4 is {{achieved}} by using aluminum alloy for the hull instead of steel as armor. This armor protects the BMD-4 from 30mm weapons like its own 2A72 autocannon towards the front, and small arms fire and shell splinters towards the side. To counter infrared guidance and weapons, six 81mm ZD6 smoke grenade dischargers in two banks of three are mounted towards {{the sides of the}} turret. An NBC protection system and automatic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> are provided to the entire crew and passengers to ensure survivability in an environment with nuclear fallout.|$|E
25|$|Discovery {{was moved}} from its hangar in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-3 {{to the nearby}} 52-story Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on 9 September 2010. The shuttle emerged from OPF-3 at 06:54 EDT and the {{rollover}} was done at 10:46 EDT when Discovery came to a rest in the VAB's transfer aisle. The quarter-mile trip between the OPF-3 and VAB was the 41st rollover for Discovery. The rollover was originally planned at 06:30 EDT on 8 September 2010. The move did not commence due to the unavailability of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> because of a broken water main near the VAB and turn basin that runs out to the shuttle launch pads.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tests of}} an experimental <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> {{installed on the}} underbody of a test vehicle. The experimental <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> consisted of two Solid Propellant Gas Generators (SPGG) and two optical detectors. The test vehicle was subjected to a crash test that, in a previous test, resulted in a leak in the fuel tank. No fuel leak and no fire occurred in the crash test conducted for the study described in this report. A series of six static fire teds of this experimental <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> in the crash tested vehicle were conducted after this crash test. The ignition protocols used in these tests involved pumping gasoline from an external reservoir onto {{the top of the}} fuel tank in the test vehicle. The gasoline was allowed to run onto the ground under the test vehicle and ignited with a high-voltage electrical discharge. In some of these static fire tests, additional gasoline was poured onto the ground around the test vehicle before ignition. This experimental <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> used in these tests extinguished the test fires in two of six tests. ...|$|R

At roughly 10:00 on October 24, Princeton was attacked by a Yokosuka D4Y [...] "Judy" [...] which dropped its single bomb directly through the flight and hangar decks, igniting gasoline stores, disabling <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> and causing secondary explosions. After battling the fires for some hours, Buracker ordered Princeton abandoned, leaving behind only a salvage crew; Hoskins offered to stay behind. At 15:24, a massive explosion of ordnance stores blew off a large section of the carrier's stern, killing many and severing Hoskins's right leg just above the ankle.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies on extinguishing room fires by water mist <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> (WMFSS) in the past decade. Interactions between the fire-induced flow and the discharging water mists were studied. Carrying out experiments with physical models to understand more on the physics of experiment is expensive. Therefore, well-validated numerical models by fire tests are also required. These models are commonly used as an engineering tool for designing water mist <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>system.</b> In addition to taking the room as a homogeneous zone, two-layer zone approach is also used.
