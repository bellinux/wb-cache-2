A partir d’aquesta informació serà possible analitzar d’una forma no invasiva l’actuació d’algun tipus de vehicle aeroespacial. Aiming {{to obtain}} aerospace vehicle ight parameters and engine characteristics, a DCM and magnetometer fusion algorithm is introduced {{in addition to}} a Kalman lter, in order to estimate position, velocity and acceleration in the vertical axis. This strategy is tested {{in the case of a}} model rocket, and the <b>drag</b> <b>coe</b> cient and thrust curve are calculated. The attitude of the vehicle is also estimated with fewer outcomes. Finally, It is described how the system could be upgraded so that trajectory in 3 D can be obtained and therefore a better knowledge of the ight parameters...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. NUMERICAL design {{optimization}} provides {{a powerful tool}} that assists designers in improving their products. Design optimization automatically modifies important design parameters to obtain the best product that satisfies all the design requirements. This thesis explores the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and demonstrates its usefulness in the numerical optimization of a low-speed wind turbine for the power coe cient, Cp. The optimization design problem is the three-dimensional optimization of a wind turbine blade by making use of four two-dimensional radial stations. The candidate airfoils at these stations are selected from the 4 -digit NACA range. A metamodel of the lift and <b>drag</b> <b>coe</b> cients of the NACA 4 -digit series is created with SVR by using training points evaluated with XFOIL software. These SVR approximations are {{used in conjunction with}} the Blade Element Momentum theory to calculate and optimize the Cp value for the entire blade. The high accuracy attained with the SVR metamodels makes it a viable alternative to using XFOIL directly, as it has the advantages of being faster and easier to couple with the optimizer. The technique developed allows the optimization procedure the freedom to select profiles, angles of attack and chord length from the 4 -digit NACA series to find an optimal Cp value. As a result of every radial blade station consisting of a NACA 4 -digit series, the same lift and drag metamodels are used for each station. This technique also makes it simple to evaluate the entire blade as one set of design variables. The thesis contains {{a detailed description of the}} design and optimization problem, the implementation of the SVR algorithm, the creation of the lift and drag metamodels with SVR and an alternative methodology, the BEM theory and a summary of the results...|$|E

Angered because of believing {{that a young}} girl had died after being attacked by him (the girl had not died, and the allegation was never proven), hundreds of men had overwhelmed the small police force. They <b>dragged</b> <b>Coe</b> from his cell and hung him from streetcar cables {{at the corner of}} 17th and Harney.|$|R
40|$|The {{incompressible}} subsonic aerodynamics of four entry-vehicle shapes with variable c. g. {{locations are}} {{examined in the}} Langley 20 -Foot Vertical Spin Tunnel. The shapes examined are spherically-blunted cones with half-cone angles of 30, 45, and 60 deg. The nose bluntness varies between 0. 25 and 0. 5 times the base diameter. The Reynolds number based on model diameter for these tests is near 500, 000. Quantitative data on attitude and location are collected using a video-based data acquisition system and reduced with a six deg-of-freedom inverse method. All of the shapes examined su ered from strong dynamic instabilities which could produced limit cycles with su cient amplitudes to overcome static stability of the con guration. Increasing cone half-angle or nose bluntness increases drag but decreases static and dynamic stability.
