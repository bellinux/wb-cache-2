25|$|<b>Elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> in solids is {{reversible}} {{change in the}} internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> or elasticity.|$|E

2500|$|A {{conventional}} bicycle wheel {{consists of}} a thin rim kept under high compressive stress by the (roughly normal) inward pull {{of a large number}} of spokes. It can be considered as a loaded column that has been bent into a circle. If spoke tension is increased beyond a safe level, the wheel spontaneously fails into a characteristic saddle shape (sometimes called a [...] "taco" [...] or a [...] "pringle") like a three-dimensional Euler column. This is normally a purely <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> and the rim will resume its proper plane shape if spoke tension is reduced slightly.|$|E
2500|$|A solid {{material}} will deform when a load {{is applied to}} it. If it returns to its original shape after the load is removed, this is called <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation.</b> In the range where the ratio between load and deformation remains constant, the stress-strain curve is linear. [...] Not many materials are linear and elastic beyond {{a small amount of}} deformation. A stiff material needs more force to deform compared to a soft material, and an infinite force would be needed to deform a perfectly rigid material, implying that it would have an infinite Young's modulus. Although such a material cannot exist, a material with a very high Young's modulus can be approximated as rigid.|$|E

40|$|Results of the {{theoretical}} analysis of experimental diagrams of deformations of columns made of wood sawdust and concrete mixtures and of wood sawdust and gypsum mixtures exposed to uniaxial compression are provided in the paper. The findings of the prototype testing include identification of the two areas of deformations: areas of <b>elastic</b> <b>deformations</b> and areas of intensive development of deformations. The first area of partial <b>elastic</b> <b>deformations</b> {{is characterized by the}} linear stress function, while the second area demonstrates that this relationship is nonlinear. Permanent deformations appear as of the startup of the loading process and disproportionate stress is demonstrated throughout the deformation process. However, in the first area (partial <b>elastic</b> <b>deformations)</b> residual deformations are so small that this area is considered as the area of "the area of incomplete elasticity".

2500|$|In a gas or liquid, sound {{consists}} of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A longitudinal wave {{is associated with}} compression and decompression {{in the direction of}} travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the transverse wave, also called a shear wave, occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the [...] "polarization" [...] of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of orthogonal polarizations.|$|E
2500|$|Even the stiffest of rock is not {{perfectly}} rigid. [...] Given a large force (such {{as between}} two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the earth's crust will bend or deform. According to the elastic rebound theory of , eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault. [...] Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock {{on each side}} to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves. The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake), the demonstrated existence of large strike-slip displacements of hundreds of miles shows {{the existence of a}} long running earthquake cycle.|$|E
2500|$|Gas leaks: [...] Air leaks can {{be caused}} by burst or leaky hoses, {{defective}} o-rings, blown o-rings, particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a flow restriction orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke clamp seal extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> of the clamp by impact with the environment.|$|E

60|$|Outside {{of physics}} {{we know nothing}} of action at a distance. When we try to connect cause and effect in the {{experiences}} which natural objects afford us, it seems at first {{as if there were}} no other mutual actions than those of immediate contact, e.g. the communication of motion by impact, push and pull, heating or inducing combustion by means of a flame, etc. It is true that even in everyday experience weight, which is in a sense action at a distance, plays a very important part. But since in daily experience the weight of bodies meets us as something constant, something not linked to any cause which is variable in time or place, we do not in everyday life speculate as to the cause of gravity, and therefore do not become conscious of its character as action at a distance. It was Newton's theory of gravitation that first assigned a cause for gravity by interpreting it as action at a distance, proceeding from masses. Newton's theory is probably the greatest stride ever made in the effort towards the causal nexus of natural phenomena. And yet this theory evoked a lively sense of discomfort among Newton's contemporaries, because it seemed to be in conflict with the principle springing from the rest of experience, that there can be reciprocal action only through contact, and not through immediate action at a distance. It is only with reluctance that man's desire for knowledge endures a dualism of this kind. How was unity to be preserved in his comprehension of the forces of nature? Either by trying to look upon contact forces as being themselves distant forces which admittedly are observable only at a very small distance--and this was the road which Newton's followers, who were entirely under the spell of his doctrine, mostly preferred to take; or by assuming that the Newtonian action at a distance is only apparently immediate action at a distance, but in truth is conveyed by a medium permeating space, whether by movements or by <b>elastic</b> <b>deformation</b> of this medium. Thus the endeavour toward a unified view of the nature of forces leads to the hypothesis of an ether. This hypothesis, to be sure, did not at first bring with it any advance in the theory of gravitation or in physics generally, so that it became customary to treat Newton's law of force as an axiom not further reducible. But the ether hypothesis was bound always to play some part in physical science, even if at first only a latent part.|$|E
