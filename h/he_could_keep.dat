5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara. The main political reason for this decision was Tipu's belief that if he banished the Christians, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the British at bay. However, Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large-scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as a myth which {{is not based on}} any concrete evidence.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{meetings}} had to end by nightfall, {{a senator}} could talk {{a proposal to}} death (a filibuster) if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the debate going until nightfall. Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, {{and if it was}} not vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum. Each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by the presiding magistrate, and then deposited into the aerarium.|$|E
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E

5|$|Knox began forcing Kelly to {{accompany}} him to ringside so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on her, making her his de facto valet. As a result, she found herself involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, {{as part of a}} six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E
5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> his book to read.|$|E

25|$|By early 1969, Joplin was {{allegedly}} shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day (equivalent to $1300 in 2016 dollars) although {{efforts were made}} to keep her clean during the recording of I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!. Gabriel Mekler, who produced Kozmic Blues, told publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman after Joplin's death that the singer had lived in his house during the June 1969 recording sessions at his insistence so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> her away from drugs and her drug-using friends.|$|E

25|$|After {{meeting with}} the Sioux, Walsh set up two {{outposts}} on the Wood Mountain side of Cypress Hills. One would {{be closer to the}} Sioux while the other would be a halfway camp, near present-day Eastend. Walsh decided to build a house at the Wood Mountain post so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> a good eye on Sitting Bull. Worried that the Sioux may engage in war either with the United States or other tribes, Walsh instructed Wood Mountain traders, such as Légaré, to give the Sioux only enough ammunition to hunt for food.|$|E
25|$|Davey later partnered in {{the cattle}} run of Captain Benjamin Baxter, the first Postmaster and former Clerk of Petty {{sessions}} for the Port Phillip District, during the early-1850s. Their run covered {{the majority of}} what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Langwarrin and Langwarrin South. The fisherman James Oliver built his house on northern Olivers Hill around this time, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> watch for schools of fish in the waters below, and after whom the locality is now known by its current name. The explorer and surveyor Charles Wedge also arrived around this time, gaining a pre-emptive right to land license over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Carrum Downs and Seaford.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1997, Hart {{was given}} a shot to regain the title against Sid in a steel cage and thus change the main event at WrestleMania. If Hart won, his match with Austin at WrestleMania would become a title match while if Sid won, the {{regularly}} scheduled title match pitting him against the Undertaker would go on as planned. Since their respective matches would be affected, both Undertaker and Austin interfered in the match with Austin trying to help Hart so he could wrestle for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Undertaker trying to help Sid so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> his championship opportunity. Sid won the match by escaping the cage after Undertaker slammed the door in Hart's face as {{he was trying to}} exit. While the steel cage was being dismantled, Vince McMahon attempted to interview Hart, but a furious Hart grabbed the microphone and shoved McMahon down the mat before yelling expletives at him.|$|E

500|$|Day 18, {{the first}} day of week three, began with a day-long hippy-themed celebration of Halfwit's 24th birthday, in which Big Brother gave him the [...] "Gift of Normality" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> for himself or give to either Dogface or Noirin. He chose Noirin, freeing her from the {{obligation}} to draw a moustache and glasses on her face each day. The housemates failed every part of the Tudor-themed shopping task and received only a basic budget. During the task, Siavash, playing King Henry VIII, was called upon to ban one housemate from nominating and to grant another immunity. He chose Charlie and Marcus respectively. On Day 21, the housemates nominated against the clock in a live programme, resulting in Angel and Halfwit facing the public vote.|$|E
500|$|The {{boys are}} {{waiting at the}} bus stop when Cartman notices Stan has a black eye and it turns out his sister Shelley has been beating him up. Kyle has {{problems}} of his own; his mom will not let him keep his new pet elephant in the house. At school, Mr. Hat teaches the class about genetic engineering, which prompts Kyle to decide to crossbreed his elephant with Cartman's pot-bellied pig, Fluffy, to make little [...] "pot-bellied elephants", which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> in his house. Upon hearing this, Terrance Mephesto bets Kyle that he can clone a whole person before Kyle can create a pot-bellied elephant. Mr. Garrison suggests the boys use their genetic modifications for the upcoming science fair and go to the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, {{while helping}} his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a ukulele amongst the garbage {{that they were}} {{removing}} from an older woman's home. She told him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the instrument, which had only one string. Learning by ear, he played single notes, following along to Elvis Presley songs, particularly Presley's cover of Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Hound Dog". By the age of thirty-three, Hendrix's mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and on February 2, 1958, she died when her spleen ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother's funeral; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and instructed them that was how men were supposed to deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School and began attending, but did not graduate from, Garfield High School.|$|E

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> {{an eye out}} for her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E

[...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. Jackson recorded the whole album, but A label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album. She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track, titled [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records. Jam remembered, [...] "She was sitting outside in the lounge and said, 'Man, that's a funky track. Who's that for?' And we said, 'It's for you', and she said, 'Oh, cool'. I think she was very pleased when she heard the track".|$|E
500|$|Julian Symons, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement, found Moonraker [...] "a disappointment", and {{considered}} that [...] "Fleming's tendency... to parody {{the form of}} the thriller, has taken charge {{in the second half of}} this story." [...] Maurice Richardson, in his review for The Observer, was more welcoming: [...] "Do not miss this", he urged, saying that [...] "Mr. Fleming continues to be irresistibly readable, however incredible". Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener, thought that [...] "Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers", and considered that Moonraker [...] "is as mercilessly readable as all the rest". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that [...] "Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock." [...] The reviewer in The Scotsman considered that Fleming [...] "administers stimuli with no mean hand... 'Astonish me!' the addict may challenge: Mr Fleming can knock him sideways." ...|$|E
