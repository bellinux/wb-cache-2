60|$|Beetle {{snatched}} a crochet-work antimacassar {{from the}} shiny horsehair sofa, stuffed <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and {{rolled out of}} sight.|$|E
60|$|Malcolm at {{once again}} {{rolled up the}} pellet, put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{swallowed}} it, and then whispered to Ronald what he had just read.|$|E
60|$|Captain Trimblett, {{taking the}} largest radish he could find, pushed <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and sat gazing {{at him in}} consternation. He had used up two musical {{instruments}} {{in less than a}} week.|$|E
60|$|Jumbo, who sat {{near the}} place where it fell, {{snatched}} it up, grinned, and putting <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> cavernous <b>mouth,</b> swallowed <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Everybody {{was still}} for a second. Then he {{suddenly}} sprang forward, picked a tart from the hearth, and pushed <b>it</b> whole <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Weiss {{reached out}} his hand for a box of cigars, and biting the end off one, put <b>it</b> unlit <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He half offered the box to Vine, who, however, shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I saw him {{pick up a}} dirty bit of cracker {{from the}} {{pavement}} and cram <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and eat it down {{as if he were}} famished. And look! he's actually hunting for more in those garbage heaps!" ...|$|E
60|$|The parlour was {{the space}} {{behind the screen}} of rags. The old man raked the fire {{together}} with an old stair-rod, and, having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> again.|$|E
60|$|The lad {{came out}} of his trance and looked back at his companions, who edged nearer. Jones ate a lump of sugar, then handed one to the little Indian. He took it gingerly, put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{immediately}} jumped up and down.|$|E
6000|$|... 'News? I have no news, {{except that}} if you will open your mouth you shall see what dates taste like.' And he plucked a date, and put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before {{he thought}} {{what he was}} doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his fore-legs, and stuffed <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Child, child, {{victories}} sometimes {{come this}} way!' he cried, scarce knowing how <b>it</b> was put <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> but {{glad to see}} the light in her eye.|$|R
6000|$|But {{no sooner}} had he put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> than he uttered a great yell, and began dancing frantically about the room, for of course the {{porridge}} that was cold to earth folk was hot to him, and the big spoonful of cold pease porridge had burned his mouth to a blister! ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he heard}} the {{soldiers}} stirring without in answer to my summons, the man, who was unarmed, looked about his desperately; then he sprang at the fruit, and, seizing a fig, strove to thrust <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> But I was too quick for him, {{and within a few}} seconds the soldiers had him fast.|$|E
60|$|Leaning forward, {{he seized}} the puff-adder, and drawing it {{from beneath the}} fork, {{suffered}} it to strike him upon the breast, after which he deliberately killed it with a stone. Then he took some of the grey powder and rubbed it into the punctures; also put more of <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> which he swallowed.|$|E
50|$|In April 2010, Wet Kiwi Strawberry flavored {{lubricant}} {{was featured}} in an episode of MTV’s The Real World: Washington, D.C. when housemate Andrew picked up a bottle and proceeded to snack on the lubricant by pouring <b>it</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He joked {{that it was really}} tasty and he would use it on salads.|$|R
5000|$|In Irish mythology, Bec (modern Irish Beag, meaning [...] "small") {{was one of}} the Tuatha Dé Danann. She {{was known}} for having a magic well, guarded by her three daughters. When Fionn mac Cumhaill {{approached}} the well to ask for a drink, her daughters tried to prevent him from getting the water; [...] "one of them threw water over him to scare him away and some of <b>it</b> went <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> From the water he gained wisdom." ...|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Toad didn't {{wait to be}} told twice. He {{forgot all}} about his fright. He forgot all about Buster Bear. He forgot that he wasn't hungry. He forgot his manners. He jumped right in among those ants, and {{for a little while}} he was the busiest Toad ever seen. Buster Bear was busy too. He swept his long tongue this way, and he swept it that way, and each time he drew <b>it</b> back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>it</b> was covered with ants. At last Old Mr. Toad couldn't hold another ant. Then he remembered Buster Bear and looked up a little fearfully. Buster was smacking his lips, and there was a twinkle in each eye.|$|R
60|$|Another {{interval}} {{followed in}} which neither spoke. Jeff was slowly pursuing {{his line of}} thought. After Joe's last remark he returned his pipe to his pocket and brought out a tobacco-pouch. He tore off {{a large portion of}} the weed and thrust <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Then he held out the little buckskin sack to Joe.|$|E
60|$|The other man, {{a slender}} German {{of five and}} twenty, with the massive {{forehead}} of a scholar and the tumble-home chin of a degenerate, did not trouble to reply. He was busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette paper. Rolling what was approximately fifty grains of the drug into a tight wad, he tossed <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and gulped it down {{without the aid of}} water.|$|E
60|$|The giant {{wondered}} {{more and}} more at this; yet he did not answer a word, but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast. Jack {{wanted to make the}} giant believe that he could eat as much as himself, so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat, and slip the hasty-pudding into this bag, while he seemed to put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{friend of}} mine was horrified one day by hearing her little boy make use of a very bad word ...Turning to the maid she said, [...] "Jane, you may take Master Dick up stairs and wash <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> out with soap and water. It is too soiled for him {{to sit at the}} table with us..." [...] Good Housekeeping, 1889 One of the {{earliest}} recorded uses of forcing another to ingest soap as punishment appeared in the 1832 Legal Examiner, in which it was noted that a married couple [...] "were constantly quarrelling and that one evening, on the man's return home, he found his wife intoxicated, ... perceiving a piece of kitchen soap lying on the ground near the spot, he crammed <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> wife's <b>mouth,</b> saying, [...] "She has had plenty of water to wash with, she ought now to have a little soap".|$|R
60|$|He did {{not know}} what all the talk was about. It was not necessary. Words like {{revolution}} gave him his cue. Like a paleontologist, able to reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was able to reconstruct a whole speech from the one word revolution. He did it that night, and he did it well; and since Martin had made the biggest stir, he put <b>it</b> all <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and made him the arch-anarch of the show, transforming <b>his</b> reactionary individualism <b>into</b> the most lurid, red- shirt socialist utterance. The cub reporter was an artist, and it was a large brush with which he laid on the local color--wild-eyed long-haired men, neurasthenia and degenerate types of men, voices shaken with passion, clenched fists raised on high, and all projected against a background of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of angry men.|$|R
50|$|The film became {{noted for}} being the onscreen debut of Rajinikanth, {{who went on to}} become one of Tamil cinema's most {{successful}} actors. During his stay at the Film Chamber Institute in Chennai, Rajinikanth, then known by his real name, Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, was performing in a stage play and attracted the attention of Balachander, who subsequently telephoned Gaekwad and requested him to come for the auditions of his next film. At the auditions, Gaekwad imitated Sivaji Ganesan to prove his mettle to Balachander, but Balachander wanted Gaekwad to have an identity of his own and to perform without imitating the mannerisms of another person. Two days later, when Gaekwad was called again for a second audition, he took a cigar in his hand and threw <b>it</b> stylishly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> which impressed Balachander as he had not seen such unique mannerisms in any other actor that he came across since then. Balachander advised him to learn to speak Tamil, a recommendation that Gaekwad quickly followed.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} to Nigel {{that he had}} at length succeeded in opening the flood-gates. The hermit paused {{for a few moments}} and puffed at the meerschaum, while Moses glared at his master with absorbed interest, and pulled at the {{cigarette}} with such oblivious vigour that he drew <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> at last, spat it out, and prepared another. Nigel sat quite silent and waited for more.|$|E
60|$|Hoping that, by dint {{of great}} dispatch, he might avoid what he now felt to be a {{considerable}} inconvenience, King Midas next snatched a hot potato, and attempted to cram <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and swallow it in a hurry. But the Golden Touch was too nimble for him. He found his mouth full, not of mealy potato, but of solid metal, which so burnt his tongue that he roared aloud, and, jumping up from the table, began to dance and stamp about the room, both with pain and affright.|$|E
60|$|The boat floated {{slowly toward}} the bend in the stream, and finally came close to the bank {{in front of the}} big molasses-candy house, where it stopped. Dot stepped out upon the bank and {{fastened}} the boat, and then Tot jumped out beside her. There was a little path, brown in color and rather rough, that led past the house and down to the river where they stood, and as Tot jumped upon this path he stubbed his toe and fell down. Then Dot saw him pick up a piece of the brown path that had become loosened, and after looking at it a moment put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Narrator blacks {{out after}} the conversation, and when he awakes, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by {{destroying}} buildings that contain credit card companies' records. The Narrator tries to warn the police, but he finds that these officers {{are members of the}} Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in a building, but Tyler subdues him and moves him to the uppermost floor. Held at gunpoint by Tyler, the Narrator realizes that, in sharing the same body with Tyler, he himself is actually in control holding [...] "Tyler's" [...] gun. The Narrator fires <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>mouth,</b> shooting through the cheek without killing himself. Tyler collapses with an exit wound {{to the back of his}} head, and the Narrator stops mentally projecting him. Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing many buildings around them.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Bullion {{meets the}} inept window washers (whom he {{mistakes}} for interim dentists) when {{he enters the}} office demanding medical attention. They knock him out cold when he asks for anesthetic, then attempt to find the bad tooth. After pulling his bridge-work out completely ("you stripped his gears!", Larry comments), they try to put <b>it</b> back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> with cement. However, the cement hardens before {{they have a chance}} to put the tooth back in, so they decide to blast. The dentist arrives back in his office as the dynamite is lit. He calls out to the Stooges, who notice him and run off. The dynamite goes off and Mr. Bullion wakes up, noticing that the pain in his tooth is gone. He heads back to his car and notices the Stooges hiding inside. He inquires as to what they are up to, and Moe says that they are [...] "refugees." [...] Mr. Bullion then has a very nasty idea to disabuse his wife of her philanthropic notion: pass these three nitwits off as refugee children.|$|R
60|$|Swithin {{looked at}} them askance, and followed. By a dim light they groped their way up some stairs into a large room, into which the moon was shining through a window bulging over the street. A lamp burned low; there was a smell of spirits and tobacco, with a faint, {{peculiar}} scent, as of rose leaves. In one corner stood a czymbal, in another a great pile of newspapers. On the wall hung some old-fashioned pistols, and a rosary of yellow beads. Everything was tidily arranged, but dusty. Near an open fireplace was a table with {{the remains of a}} meal. The ceiling, floor, and walls were all of dark wood. In spite of the strange disharmony, the room had a sort of refinement. The Hungarian took a bottle out of a cupboard and, filling some glasses, handed one to Swithin. Swithin put it gingerly to his nose. 'You never know your luck! Come!' he thought, tilting <b>it</b> slowly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>It</b> was thick, too sweet, but of a fine flavour.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the dwarf}} stirred. He sat up, yawned, sneezed, shook himself, {{and began to}} rake among the burning embers of my fire with his naked hand. Presently he found the white stone, which was now red-hot--at any rate it glowed as though it were--and after {{examining}} {{it for a moment}} finally popped <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth!</b> Then he hunted in the other fire for the black stone, which he treated in a similar fashion. The next thing I remember was that the fires, which had died away almost to nothing, were burning very brightly again, I suppose because someone had put fuel on them, and Zikali was speaking.|$|E
6000|$|But such a sight as Old Mr. Toad was! Peter just stared. For a {{full minute}} he couldn't find his voice. Old Mr. Toad was {{changing}} his clothes! Yes, Sir, that is just what Old Mr. Toad was doing. He was taking off his old suit, and under it was a brand new one. But such a time as he was having! He was opening and shutting his big mouth, and drawing his hind legs under him, and rubbing them against his body. Then Peter saw a strange thing. He saw that Old Mr. Toad's old suit had split in several places, and he was getting it off by sucking <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|He turned, {{and rode}} quickly {{back to the}} place where the berserk's body lay, dismounted, and kneeled beside it. There was a large silver ring on the middle finger of Hake's right hand, which he took off and put on his own finger, {{replacing}} it with a gold one of his own. Then he ran to the spring, and, filling his helmet with water, came back and laved the man's temples therewith, at the same time pouring a little of <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> In a few minutes he began to show symptoms of revival, but before he had recovered sufficiently to recognise who his benefactor was, Erling had vaulted into the saddle and galloped away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare to you, Kate," [...] said Jessie, on one {{occasion}} after the captain had left the room, [...] "I saw him take one bite to-day which ought to have choked him, but it didn't. He stuck <b>his</b> fork <b>into</b> a piece of mutton as big--oh! I'm afraid to say how big; it really seemed to me {{the size of your}} hand, and he piled quite a little mound of green peas on it, with a great mass of broken fragments and gravy, and put <b>it</b> all <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> at once, though that mouth was already pretty well-filled with the larger half of an enormous potato. I thought he would never get it in, but something you said caused him to laugh at the time, and before the laugh was over the bite had disappeared. Before it was properly swallowed he was helping himself to another slice from the leg of mutton! I declare to you, Kate, that many a time I have dined altogether on less than that one bite!" ...|$|R
5000|$|A gursha (var. gorsha, goorsha) {{is an act}} of {{friendship}} and love. When eating injera, a person uses his or her right hand to strip off a piece, wraps it around some wat or kitfo, and then puts <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>mouth.</b> During a meal with friends or family, it is a common custom to feed others in the group with one's hand by putting the rolled injera or a spoon full of other dishes into another's mouth. This is called a gursha, and the larger the gursha, the stronger the friendship or bond (only surpassed by the brewing of Tej together). This tradition was featured in [...] "The Food Wife," [...] an episode of The Simpsons that uses Ethiopian cuisine as a plot point.|$|R
6000|$|Walking {{all those}} miles? Soames stared. The man's face had the {{beginning}} of a smile on it. What was he grinning at? And very quickly he turned, saying, [...] "All right, Sims!" [...] and went into the house. He mounted to the picture-gallery once more. He had from there a view of the river bank, and stood with his eyes fixed on it, oblivious {{of the fact that it}} would be an hour at least before her figure showed there. Walking up! And that fellow's grin! The boy--! He turned abruptly from the window. He couldn't spy on her. If she wanted to keep things from him--she must; he could not spy on her. His heart felt empty, and bitterness mounted from <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> very <b>mouth.</b> The staccato shouts of Jack Cardigan pursuing the ball, the laugh of young Mont rose in the stillness and came in. He hoped they were making that chap Profond run. And the girl in [...] "La Vendimia" [...] stood with her arm akimbo and her dreamy eyes looking past him. 'I've done all I could for you,' he thought, 'since you were no higher than my knee. You aren't going to--to--hurt me, are you?' ...|$|R
