40|$|The APIS project intents to semantically {{annotate}} the Austrian Bibliography Lexicon (ÖBL).

Entities, as well as relations between them, can be typed with vocabularies similar to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). APIS comes with a built in system of autocompletes that allows researchers to import meta-data of entities with just a single click. Out of the box APIS supports Stanbol as a backend for the autocompletes, but the system is rather easy to adapt to any Restfull API. APIS also supports the parsing of RDFs describing entities into an entity. The parsing is configured in a settings file. APIS comes also with a built in highlighter. The highlighter is configured via the built <b>in</b> <b>admin</b> backend and allows to annotate texts with entities and/or relations between entities...|$|R
