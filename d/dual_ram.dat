30|$|From all {{designs in}} Table 5 the {{architecture}} with 45 FUs occupies the smallest area. Comparing Tables 3 and 4, we notice {{that due to}} hardware restrictions, there is {{a portion of the}} RAM which is never used. The 45 FUs architecture Message RAM, for instance, needs 225 × 5184 = 1, 166, 400 bits. But physically, we have 225 × 213 = 1, 843, 200 bits, resulting in about 37 % unused bits. This fact occurs in all memories and for all architectures and we tried to minimize it by using decompositions into powers of 2 and concatenating smaller RAMs, but we realized that instead of decreasing, the area increases nearly 30 %, which can be justified by the additional number of internal RAM hardware controllers incorporated into the design. However, joining together several blocks of memory that operate in different time slots into one bigger common block of memory can become a more efficient solution. By analyzing in detail the Message memory block of the architecture with 45 FUs depicted in Figure 4, each 5 bits of the word are directly connected to each FU, and consequently only one main memory block is used, as mentioned in the beginning of Section 5. Therefore, the control is unique and only one (write or read) address is needed to transfer data to/from all FUs. This memory must be a <b>dual</b> port <b>RAM,</b> in order to allow reading and writing during the same clock cycle. However, due to memory generator limitations in the tools used, this type of memory was not possible to achieve. To overcome this, we adopted a solution that consists of creating a memory that operates at twice the circuit's frequency (fop): in the first cycle it performs read operations; and in the second one it writes data to memory. The system's master clock operates at 200 MHz and it is used to feed memory blocks, while fop = 100 MHz is synchronously derived from this clock source.|$|R
