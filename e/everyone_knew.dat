5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

Secession, therefore, {{did not take place}} because the Morrill tariff had gone through Congress, but, at most, the Morrill tariff went through Congress because secession had taken place.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an application}} of the S- 4 logic. There are two aims in this paper. Aim 1 is to check the relation between our model and the S- 4 logic. We 11 see the soundness and completeness of the S- 4 logic {{with respect to the}} model by using the concept of structure. Aim 2 is to prove avariation of no trade theorem in the model. 1 Introduction The word “knowledge ” and especialy “common knowledge ” plays avery important role in game theory. Intuitively, an event is common knowledge if <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> it, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> it, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> it and so on. Then how can we treat (common) knowledge fomffiy? Aumann (1976) tried to solve this problem. He introduced the formal notion of com-mon knowledge using set based and partitioned information structure and showed, so caUd, agreeing to disagree th∞rem^ 1 After Aumann, many papers have studied knowledge. Milgrom (1981), and Monderer and Samet (1989) treated knowledge by different approaches. Milgrom (1981) applied ax...|$|R

He is {{one of only a handful}} of players that have won a World Cup winners medal (1995), and Tri-Nations winners medal (1998) and a Currie Cup winners medals (1998 and 2002). He captained his side in both the Currie Cup finals he played and was later also awarded the captaincy of the Springboks in the 1999 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable. They came from the North and <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> that the colder the climate was, the more barbaric the people were. They knew nothing of metal, had no religion and lived like savages, without fire, eating their food raw, living off roots, and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses' saddles. They had no buildings, of course, {{not so much as}} a reed hut, indeed, they feared the very idea of venturing under a roof.|$|E
25|$|Eric Ives, the biographer of Anne Boleyn (1986), {{believes}} that the play is really a parallel {{of the fall of}} the queen, who was beheaded on false charges of adultery on the orders of her husband HenryVIII in 1536. There are numerous parallels between the two stories– including the fact that one of Henry's closest friends, Sir Henry Norreys, was beheaded as one of Anne's supposed lovers and he refused to confess in order to save his life, claiming that <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> the Queen was innocent. If this theory is followed then Perdita becomes a dramatic presentation of Anne's only daughter, Queen ElizabethI.|$|E

As discussion eventually resumed between the two groups, “it {{became clear that the}} expulsion of PL was inevitable”. Dohrn spoke again about Third World Struggles and anti-imperialism, things of which PL had no concern. She ended her speech with the proclamation that SDS “was becoming a revolutionary movement; and as such, it could not allow a group such as PL in its ranks”. Chanting began again, with PL fighting for their beliefs; however, it was basically over. “Although they controlled a third of the delegates at the final SDS convention,” the reality was that PL “had a presence in only a handful of the locations where SDS was active, and <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> it.

25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied {{thousands of pages of}} daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> that there were spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Hawtrey {{had become}} a regular {{participant}} in the Carry On films series. He was in the first, Carry On Sergeant (1958), and more than 20 others. His characters ranged from the wimpish through the effete to the effeminate and would always, regardless of the historical setting, be seen wearing Hawtrey's signature round glasses. In her autobiography Barbara Windsor wrote about Hawtrey's alcoholism and his outrageous flirting with the footballer George Best. While filming Carry On Spying (1964), in which they both played secret agents, Windsor thought that Hawtrey had fainted from fright at a dramatic scene on a conveyor belt. In fact he had passed out because he was drunk. When he came on set with a crate of R. White's Lemonade <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> {{that he had been}} on another binge.

25|$|With {{the painter}} Ary Scheffer, {{a friend of}} Louis-Philippe, he rode on horseback {{immediately}} to the Duke's residence in Neuilly, but found that the Duke had left and was in hiding at another chateau in Raincy. Thiers talked instead to the Duke's wife, Marie-Amélie, and sister-in-law, Madame Adelaide. Thiers explained that they wanted a representative monarchy and a new dynasty, and that <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> that Louis-Philippe was not ambitious and had not sought the crown for himself. Madame Adelaide agreed to take the proposition to the Duke. The Duke returned to Neuilly at ten {{in the evening and}} learned what had happened from his wife. He put on a tricolor ribbon, the symbol of the opposition, and rode to the Palais-Royal, where Thiers, the Marquis de Lafayette and Jacques Laffitte were waiting. Together, they persuaded him to take the throne and discussed how it would be done. That afternoon, they rode to the Hotel de Ville. Louis-Phiiippe, wrapped in a tricolor flag, was presented to the huge and cheering crowd in front of the Hotel de VIlle by LaFayette. King Charles X withdrew his proposed new government and offered to negotiate, but it was too late. He and his son departed the Chateau of Saint-Cloud and left France for exile in England.|$|E

National Posts Alex Strachan called the Next Generation cameos reminders of better Star Trek, compared to the [...] "bad make-up effects, bad acting, bad music" [...] of the latest show. Rob Salem of the Toronto Star said the cameos served no narrative purpose, and that the episode [...] "robs [...] characters (and their fans) of any significant long-term development or satisfying sense of closure." [...] Reviewers also criticized the episode's ending, where viewers never got to see Archer's rousing speech. IGN said that the episode was [...] "Berman and Braga's parting shot, making sure that <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> who was in charge," [...] and that the sharp contrast between [...] "These Are the Voyages..." [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] brought into relief the reason why both {{should not be allowed to}} produce Star Trek ever again.|$|E
500|$|In the , Hurley {{struggles with}} the task of food rationing. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) asks Hurley if the bunker {{contains}} food, specifically peanut butter for Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), but Hurley will not answer him. Hurley decides to enlist Rose Henderson-Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell) to help him take inventory. At one point, Hurley has a strange dream, in which Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) tells Hurley, in English, that [...] "everything is going to change." [...] Hurley becomes less and less certain of his ability to ration the food in a manner that keeps everyone happy. He attempts to quit, but John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) refuses to permit it. Hurley then prepares to blow up the pantry with dynamite, but Rose intervenes. He explains that the food, newfound wealth to the survivors, will change everything and everyone will come to hate him, just as things changed when <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> he won the lottery; however Rose talks him out of his plan. Later, Hurley informs Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) of his decision to give all the food away, arguing that the food stores do not amount to very much when divided among all the survivors. The food is distributed freely and the survivors enjoy a feast. Everyone appreciates Hurley's decision, including Charlie, who gives his benefactor a hug of reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament I reckon to beat." [...] Despite some {{bumps in the road}} and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well". Fischer became the youngest person ever to {{qualify for the}} Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day.
