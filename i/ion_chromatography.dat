5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and <b>ion</b> <b>chromatography</b> are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

These seemingly minute structural changes can affect preclinical stability and process optimization as well as therapeutic product potency, bioavailability and immunogenicity.

25|$|Ion {{exchange}} chromatography (usually {{referred to}} as <b>ion</b> <b>chromatography)</b> uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There {{are two types of}} ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{this study}} we have {{prepared}} the IgA solution from normal human plasma using plasma fractionation and <b>ion</b> exchange <b>chromatography.</b> Materials and Methods: Using fractionation of plasma with cold ethanol (starting with 8 % ethanol), fraction III was prepared as a suitable source for IgA preparation. Then it was treated with caprylic acid for separation of impurities. For enrichment of IgA, <b>ion</b> exchange <b>chromatography</b> using Sephadex DEAE A- 50 on a Pharmacia glass column was carried out. Results: By fractionation of pooled human plasma and then treatment with caprylic acid, the amount of immunoglobulins showed an increase from 17 % to 80 % measured by immunoturbidimetric method. Then the <b>ion</b> exchange column <b>chromatography</b> by Sephadex DEAE A- 50 was carried out. In washing solution 65 % of loaded IgG and only 17 % of loaded IgA were found. In elution solution 32 % of loaded IgG and 79 % of loaded IgA were obtained, which showed the <b>ion</b> exchange <b>chromatography</b> is a promising method for preparation of enriched IgA solution. Conclusion: Because of the similarity between IgA and IgG, techniques based on net charge and molecular differences would not give a high yield in IgA isolation. As IgA has a negative charge at the pH 8. 1, Sephadex DEAE A- 50 which is able to bind proteins at relatively high ionic strength was chosen for <b>ion</b> exchange <b>chromatography.</b> After column <b>ion</b> exchange <b>chromatography,</b> the concentration of obtained IgA was three times more enriched {{in comparison with the}} concentration of IgA in normal plasma...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ion</b> {{exclusion}} <b>chromatography</b> (IEe) is {{a relatively}} old separation technique, attributed to Wheaton and Bauman, which is now staging an impressive comeback for the simultaneous determination of ionic species. IEC provides a useful technique for the separation of ionic and nonionic substances using an ion exchange stationary phase in which ionic substances are rejected by the resin while nonionic or partially ionized substances are retained and separated by partition between the liquid inside the resin particles and the liquid outside the particles. The ionic substances therefore pass quickly through the column, but nonionic (molecular) or partially ionized substances are held up and are eluted more slowly. IEC is also referred to by several other names, including <b>ion</b> exclusion partition <b>chromatography,</b> <b>ion</b> chromatography-exclusion mode, and Donnan exclusion chromatography.
