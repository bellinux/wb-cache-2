Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.|$|E

5|$|Viking {{influence}} in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and whilst there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Uí Ímair dynasty played {{a prominent role in}} this early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century. Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E
5|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Bogdan-Pitești was educated in Geneva, at a local Catholic institution. Raised in the Romanian Orthodox faith, he {{converted}} to Catholicism in his twenties, but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time of his death. He supposedly attended medical school at the University of Montpellier, without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the bohemian milieu of Paris. He may have enrolled at the University of Paris, studying Law and Letters, but probably withdrew after a short while. Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pitești attended the École des Beaux-Arts in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled. Other sources express <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either France or Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had {{captured}} No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After {{a telephone call}} between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, there was no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, {{and they began to}} surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the system}} suggest that rules {{for the use of}} DRS have created an {{inconsistency}} of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation.|$|E

5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family {{home and in the}} courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are very}} long-lived, which is {{characteristic}} of many freshwater native fish in Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate {{in at least one}} exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most long-lived freshwater native fish in Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of years past leave little <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 years or more.|$|E
5|$|The Jersey Act was {{introduced}} to prevent the registration of most American-bred Thoroughbred horses in the British General Stud Book. It had {{its roots in the}} desire of the British to halt the influx of American-bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American-bred horses were purebred.|$|E

However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.|$|E
5|$|The age of {{the bones}} at death matched that of Richard when he was killed; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly {{consistent}} with physical descriptions of the king. Preliminary DNA analysis showed that mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones matched that of two matrilineal descendants, one 17th-generation and the other 19th-generation, of Richard's sister Anne of York. Taking these findings into account along with other historical, scientific and archaeological evidence, the University of Leicester announced on 4 February 2013 that it had concluded beyond reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skeleton was that of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Botaneiates {{and the four}} more years of war that {{followed}} indicate that the Byzantine success was not complete. Some modern historians <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian defeat was as complete as described by Skylitzes and Kekaumenos. Other historians emphasize that the death of Emperor Samuel two months later was much more fateful for Bulgaria. His heirs Gabriel Radomir and Ivan Vladislav were unable to effectively resist the attacks of Basil II, and Bulgaria was completely defeated in 1018. In that year Emperor Ivan Vladislav was killed in a battle at Dyrrhachium, and Bulgaria became a province of the Byzantine Empire until the successful uprising led by the Asen brothers in 1185.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Cavalry uniforms {{were made by the}} cavalrymen themselves. By 1862, the Confederate {{regulations}} ordered the uniform to become organized, being cadet gray and lined with a thin layer around the sleeve. The pant legs were light blue with a yellow strip rising {{from the bottom of the}} leg to the top. Non-commissioned officers of the cavalry wore either regular clothes from home or a variety of different types of uniforms. yellow was the prescribed branch of service color, but surviving uniforms show beyond a <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of cavalrymen who used any branch of service color, used buff as yellow cloth was virtually non existent in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, {{there can be little}} <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage {{and the development of a}} sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E
