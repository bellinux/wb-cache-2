40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} differences between <b>intrapreneurs</b> and entrepreneurs with regards to their resource utilisation behaviours through social capital and bricolage. In particular {{we were interested in}} those entrepreneurs who start their business while still being employed, as it allows us to compare how <b>intrapreneurs</b> and entrepreneurs make use of social capital within their employer. Our findings challenge some existing wisdoms in that it seems <b>intrapreneurs</b> make more use of social capital external to their employer than entrepreneurs, while the use of social capital internal to the company is similar to the use by entrepreneurs. Yet, internal organizational social capital seems to {{have a positive effect on}} performance for intrapreneurial efforts only, while external social capital is not related to performance. This suggests both <b>intrapreneurs</b> and entrepreneurs may benefit from reconsidering the focus they place on respectively external and internal organizational social capital. Bricolage behaviours were extremely prevalent amongst both <b>intrapreneurs</b> and entrepreneurs as well as being the strongest predictor of performance. This strong effect on performance for intrapreneurial ventures may suggest that bricolage behaviours need to be rethought when it comes to <b>intrapreneurs...</b>|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify competences that discriminate entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs.</b> The literature review analyzes entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> under different approaches. In this paper we consider entrepreneur as a person that opens and manages a business and <b>intrapreneurs</b> as a person inside a company that finds opportunities independently of the resources controlled by them, according to the concept developed by Steverson and Jarillo (1990). This is a qualitative research, with an exploratory focus. The data were collected by means of in-depth interviews, followed by a flexible questionnaire for both groups of interviewers. Seven men and six women, entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs,</b> took part in the interview. For data analysis, we used content analysis, proposed by Bardin (1977), and structured in six categories of answers. The results show that entrepreneurs have different competences in relation to <b>intrapreneurs</b> and those competences are focused on different factors such as personal motivation, different ways of managing their business, family support and the development of their professional careers...|$|R

Strong leadership skills are needed to strengthen teams and to persuade others to follow and execute their ideas.

5000|$|An {{internal}} entrepreneur {{is known}} as an <b>intrapreneur</b> (makes part of intrapreneurship) and is defined as [...] "a person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation".

50|$|The main {{difference}} between an internal entrepreneur (<b>intrapreneur)</b> and an entrepreneur is the environment, which represents the sphere in which they work. An entrepreneur's aim in general terms {{is to create a}} successful organisation, while an internal entrepreneur on the other hand has to find solutions to existing problems within the company and provide improvements {{for the benefit of the}} existing organisation. Another significant difference factor is the risk, intrapreneurs aren't responsible for the fate of the company at the same level as entrepreneurs do and usually work within a safe environment with guaranteed payment. Due to this fact, even in case of success they rarely get any additional benefits or additions but companies that support innovation tend to include additional bonuses. However, internal entrepreneurs tend to manifest themselves as the owners of the business, this makes them believe in their own influence and the fact that they are doing it in their own interests instead of the company's. This results in productiveness and huge efficiency during work.|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{faced by}} management graduates in promoting intrapreneurship to achieve competitive advantage {{is the use}} of motivational techniques that build commitment to entrepreneurial behaviour. Despite the acknowledged importance of rewards to encourage innovation, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence to provide guidance on which rewards motivate <b>intrapreneurs.</b> This paper investigates the rewards that organizations use to motivate <b>intrapreneurs</b> in both service and information and communication technology firms in South Africa. The results indicate that an intrapreneurial reward system tends to focus on formal acknowledgement, social incentives and the organizational freedom of employees. These, rather than monetary incentives, are valued by <b>intrapreneurs</b> and therefore should be incorporated into the teaching curricula of business schools. It is argued that application of these findings will help managers to promote intrapreneurial behaviour and create engaged employees...|$|R

[...] Hence, the <b>intrapreneur</b> focuses on innovation and creativity, and transforms an idea into a profitable venture, while operating within the organizational environment. Thus, intrapreneurs are Inside entrepreneurs who follow the goal of the organization. Intrapreneurship is an example of motivation through job design, either formally or informally. (See also Corporate Social Entrepreneurship: intrapreneurship within the firm which is driven to produce social capital in addition to economic capital.)Employees, such as marketing executives or perhaps those engaged in a special project within a larger firm, are encouraged to behave as entrepreneurs, even though they have the resources, capabilities and security of the larger firm to draw upon. Capturing a little of the dynamic nature of entrepreneurial management (trying things until successful, learning from failures, attempting to conserve resources, etc.) adds to the potential of an otherwise static organization, without exposing those employees to the risks or accountability normally associated with entrepreneurial failure.|$|E

Hence, we introduce a cost functional, which is the cost of risk faced by the <b>intrapreneur.</b> We assume that the entrepreneur can apply flexibility in planning, hence denote this as control, while the environment that is needed to be scanned is denoted as uncertainty. The model of game is applied to allow for saddle point (a point where there is no ‘gain’ no ‘loss’) solution. The implication of this is that for a saddle point to exist in a “worst case” situation, the <b>intrapreneur</b> is likely to breaking-even.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{identify}} and establish the relationship between <b>intrapreneurs</b> and the Dynamic Capabilities (DC) framework in a company. This relationship aided us in exploring whether <b>intrapreneurs</b> could positively influence the sensing, seizing and transforming of innovations. Findings: This paper explored and identified a possible applicability of intrapreneurial theory and dynamic capabilities in the Innovation Value Chain. Ten intrapreneurial skills that could be carried out by an Innovation Agent (IA) {{in various parts of the}} innovation chain were identified. The results showed how these intrapreneurial skills could positively influence the dynamic capabilities and contribute to an improvement in sensing, seizing and transforming of idea in full-scale innovations. Although it was shown that <b>intrapreneurs</b> positively influence the sensing, seizing and transforming as separate elements of the dynamic capabilities framework, it was also discovered that <b>intrapreneurs</b> play a crucial role in managing the ‘dynamic capabilities’ and ‘Innovation Value Chain’ as a whole. They do this by synthesizing and connecting the separate elements. In addition, a roadmap illustrating the focus areas of these intrapreneurial skills within the innovation chain was formulated during the study. Research Implications: The research findings contribute to the understanding the Innovation Value Chain through the lens of the Dynamic Capabilities Framework which consists of sensing, seizing and transforming and how the role of intrapreneurship could positively influence the dynamic capabilities and contribute to a better innovation process. Practical Implications: The practical implications of this study contribute to the innovation management of big high tech global companies. The use of <b>intrapreneurs</b> contributes to addressing the bureaucracy and innovation barriers that big companies usually create as part of their organizational structure and culture. Although it was discovered that all employees and managers should act as <b>intrapreneurs,</b> the research showed that in big global companies there is a need for a separate role of Innovation Agent, who would be responsible for seeing the ‘big picture of the innovation process’, supporting and navigating the employees with innovative ideas through the complexity of innovation process, and playing diverse intrapreneurial roles in order to creatively address the barriers to innovation in the company...|$|R
40|$|With each tottering {{attempt to}} walk, our bodies {{learn from the}} falls {{what not to do}} next time. In time we walk without {{thinking}} and think without falling, but {{it is not so much}} that we have learned to walk as we learned not to fall' (Petroski 1985 : 13) This research represents a contribution to the academic literature on entrepreneurship by exploring what entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> learned from their failed ventures. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate what can be learned from new venture and business failure. In addition, it reveals that although entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> perceived new venture and business failure differently, they shared similar experiences in their failed ventures, and generated similar knowledge. New venture failure is a well-researched field, in which the emphasis in the academic literature is on the importance of learning and recovering from such reverses. However, studies related what it is that one can learn from new venture failure are scant. This research explores the relationship between two fields: new venture failure and entrepreneurial learning. In this study, new venture and business failure is defined as 'the entrepreneur’s dissatisfaction with the venture’s progression', and it is emphasised that the entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> decide whether or not their venture has failed, regardless of the objective state of the venture. Learning is defined as a combination of behavioural and cognitive patterns: 'a creation of knowledge that leads to a behavioural change'. It is suggested that entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> learn from every action they perform, gaining experience from both successful and failed activities. However, they learn more from critical events. This exploratory, qualitative study explores how 27 experienced Australian entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> perceive new venture failure, and what they have learned from it. The research used practice-based theories to convert the participants' experiences into academic theories. The data was analysed using cognitive maps for categorising and sorting the data, and classic content and word count techniques for the analyses. The results of this research indicate that entrepreneurs perceived new venture and business failure as identical, while <b>intrapreneurs</b> distinguished between them. The majority of the entrepreneurs who participated in this research defined a failed new venture or business as a business or new venture that does not make a profit and suffers from lack of cash. However, the majority of the <b>intrapreneurs</b> who participated in this research defined a failed business as a business that is not managed properly, and a failed new venture as a venture that does not grow. A significant addition to the body of knowledge in this domain is depicted. Since this study is a first of its kind to integrate entrepreneurial learning and new venture failure, the following finding is highlighted: Venture failure is not perceived in a negative context by entrepreneurs, as long as they learn from the experience/s. As such, it is identified that ventures fail, not entrepreneurs! This finding would, however, provide a base for further empirical research into the psychological aspects of entrepreneurs' perceptions to new venture failure. From a research methodology perspective, using cognitive maps and entrepreneurial scripts in the above context constitutes an addition to the body of knowledge. Such methodology has been identified as an innovative research concept in examining the cognitive structures of entrepreneurs. The study concludes with a list of suggestions for novice and nascent entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> given by the participants in this research. These suggestions are the summary of their learning from their failed ventures. It is suggested that nascent entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> may adopt recommendations from the suggested list, thereby marginalising their risk of failure by learning from others. As this is qualitative exploratory research, it had a small data set. Any future researchshould ideally be expanded into a quantitative study and include entrepreneurs and <b>intrapreneurs</b> from different countries, thus enabling the findings to be generalised and the effect of cultural differences to be overcome...|$|R
