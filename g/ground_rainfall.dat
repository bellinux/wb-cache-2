Observed {{changes in}} the ground {{distributions}} of rainfall {{in the first and}} Second Israeli cloud seeding experiments are related to observed changes in cloud cell size and rainwater volume, rate and duration.

The increase in the <b>ground</b> <b>rainfall</b> intensity seems to follow the increase in cloud cell depth.

The length of the data used was four years (2003 - 2006) with the variation in the length of data scheme 1 (three year calibration), Scheme 2 (two years calibration) and scheme 3 (one year calibration).

30|$|The {{emergence}} of climatology and more advanced meteorological studies steadily undermined {{the idea that}} vegetation influenced climate. The {{emergence of}} the field of climatology with the 1883 publication of Julius von Hann’s (1839 – 1921) seminal Handbook of Climatology (Handbuch der Klimatologie) led researchers to emphasize the physical and global drivers of climate while downplaying the importance of forests in climate systems (Edwards 2013). Hann questioned the validity of climatic measurements, especially those showing temperature change or increases/decreases in rain, based on methodological <b>grounds.</b> <b>Rainfall</b> shifts could be better explained as secular variations rather than as being caused by changes to forests. This viewpoint influenced mainstream climatological and metrological positions for most of the twentieth century.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{estimate}} parameters of a distributed hydrologic model, GRM (grid based rainfall-runoff model), using a model-independent parameter estimation tool, PEST. We implement auto calibration of model parameters such as initial soil moisture, multipliers of overland roughness and soil hydraulic conductivity in the Geumho River Catchment and the Gamcheon Catchment using radar rainfall estimates and ground-observed rainfall represented by Thiessen interpolation. Automatic calibration is performed by GRM-MP (multiple projects), {{a modified version}} of GRM without GUI (graphic user interface) implementation, and “Parallel PEST ” to improve estimation efficiency. Although <b>ground</b> <b>rainfall</b> shows similar or higher cumula-tive amount compared to radar rainfall in the areal average, high spatial variation is found only in radar rainfall. In terms of accuracy of hydrologic simulations, radar rainfall is equivalent or superior to <b>ground</b> <b>rainfall.</b> In the case of radar rainfall, the estimated multiplier of soil hydraulic conductivity is lower than 1, which may be affected by high rainfall intensity of radar rainfall. Other parameters such as initial soil moisture and the multiplier of overland roughness do not show consistent trends in the calibration results.

40|$|Background: Ground {{hardness}} {{is considered}} one of the possible risk factors associated with rugby injuries. Objectives: To examine the contribution of <b>ground</b> hardness, <b>rainfall</b> and evapotranspiration to the incidence of injury, and to investigate seasonal injury bias throughout one full season of rugby union. Methods: A prospective epidemiological study of rugby injuries was performed on 271 players from rugby union teams involved in the premier grade rugby competition in Dunedin, New Zealand. Ground hardness was measured before each match over 20 rounds with an industrial penetrometer, and local weather information was collected through the National Institute of Weather and Atmospheric Research and the Otago Regional Council. Poisson mixed models were used to describe injury incidence as a function of ground hardness throughout the season. Results: The overall injury incidence during the season was 52 injuries per 1000 match player-hours (95 % CI 42 to 65). Although injury incidence decreased gradually by round with a rate ratio of 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 96 to 0. 99) (p = 0. 036), and the hardness of match grounds decreased significantly over the season (0. 16 MPa/round, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 21, p< 0. 001), a non-significant association was demonstrated between injury incidence and ground hardness. Injury incidence was not associated with a combination of <b>ground</b> hardness, <b>rainfall</b> and evapotranspiration on the day of the match or cumulative rainfall and evapotranspiration before each match. Conclusions: Seasonal change in ground hardness and an early-season bias of injuries was demonstrated. Although the contribution of ground hardness to injury incidence was not statistically significant, match round and injury incidence were highly correlated, confirming a seasonal bias, which may confound the relationship of injury to ground condition.

The quality control algorithm utilizes several adjustable height and reflectivity threshold parameters to remove non-precipitation echoes from ground-based radar data. Spurious radar reflectivity returns not removed during the quality control process may create biases in <b>ground</b> validation <b>rainfall</b> products used to evaluate rainfall measurements retrieved from aboard the TRMM satellite. To better evaluate {{the performance of the}} quality control algorithm, WSR- 88 D radar data from one primary GV site, Melbourne, Florida, are used to determine the seasonal characteristics of non-meteorological radar echoes in cast central Florida {{during the first year of}} the TRMM mission. It is demonstrated that unique spurious echo regimes develop throughout the year, leading to different levels of successful non-meteorological echo removal by the quality control algorithm. In addition to the type of non- precipitation echoes present, the success of the algorithm is also greatly dependent upon the amount of precipitation present. Less aggressive attempts to remove non-meteorological echoes must be employed when rain is observed so as not to remove these echoes as well. Therefore, precipitation statistics from <b>ground</b> validation monthly <b>rainfall</b> products will be utilized to further document the quality control algorithm performance.
