40|$|<b>Docking</b> ligands into an {{ensemble}} of NMR conformers {{is essential to}} structure-based drug discovery if only NMR structures are available for the target. However, sequentially <b>docking</b> ligands into each NMR conformer through standard single-receptor-structure <b>docking,</b> referred to as sequential <b>docking,</b> is computationally expensive for large-scale database screening {{because of the large}} number of NMR conformers involved. Recently, we developed an efficient ensemble <b>docking</b> algorithm to consider protein structural variations in ligand binding. The algorithm simultaneously <b>docks</b> ligands into {{an ensemble}} of protein structures and achieves comparable performance to sequential <b>docking</b> without significant increase in computational time over single-structure <b>docking.</b> Here, we applied this algorithm to <b>docking</b> with NMR structures.

5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales <b>Dock</b> was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the <b>dock,</b> and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the <b>dock.</b> Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the <b>dock</b> was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the <b>dock,</b> even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one.

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{prosperity}} the <b>dock</b> afforded the city, within 20 {{years of its}} construction the Albert <b>Dock</b> was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000tonnes, {{by the start of}} the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the <b>dock</b> simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert <b>Dock</b> so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert <b>Dock</b> remained {{an integral part of the}} <b>dock</b> system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{important}} cellular {{processes are}} carried out by protein complexes. To provide physical pictures of interacting proteins, many computational protein-protein prediction methods have been developed in the past. However, it is still difficult to identify the correct <b>docking</b> complex structure within top ranks among alternative conformations. Results We present a novel protein <b>docking</b> algorithm that utilizes imperfect protein-protein binding interface prediction for guiding protein <b>docking.</b> Since the accuracy of protein binding site prediction varies depending on cases, {{the challenge is to}} develop a method which does not deteriorate but improves <b>docking</b> results by using a binding site prediction which may not be 100 % accurate. The algorithm, named PI-LZerD (using Predicted Interface with Local 3 D Zernike descriptor-based <b>Docking</b> algorithm), is based on a pair wise protein <b>docking</b> prediction algorithm, LZerD, which we have developed earlier. PI-LZerD starts from performing <b>docking</b> prediction using the provided protein-protein binding interface prediction as constraints, which is followed by the second round of <b>docking</b> with updated <b>docking</b> interface information to further improve <b>docking</b> conformation. Benchmark results on bound and unbound cases show that PI-LZerD consistently improves the <b>docking</b> prediction accuracy as compared with <b>docking</b> without using binding site prediction or using the binding site prediction as post-filtering. Conclusion We have developed PI-LZerD, a pairwise <b>docking</b> algorithm, which uses imperfect protein-protein binding interface prediction to improve <b>docking</b> accuracy. PI-LZerD consistently showed better prediction accuracy over alternative methods in the series of benchmark experiments including <b>docking</b> using actual <b>docking</b> interface site predictions as well as unbound <b>docking</b> cases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Using {{the popular}} program AutoDock, {{computer-aided}} <b>docking</b> of small ligands with 6 or fewer rotatable bonds, is reasonably fast and accurate. However, <b>docking</b> large ligands using AutoDockâ€™s recommended standard <b>docking</b> protocol is less accurate and computationally slow. Results: In our earlier work, we presented a novel AutoDock-based incremental protocol (DINC) {{that addresses the}} limitations of AutoDockâ€™s standard protocol by enabling improved <b>docking</b> of large ligands. Instead of <b>docking</b> a large ligand to a target protein in one single step as done in the standard protocol, our protocol <b>docks</b> the large ligand in increments. In this paper, we present three detailed examples of <b>docking</b> using DINC and compare the <b>docking</b> results with those obtained using AutoDockâ€™s standard protocol. We summarize the <b>docking</b> results from an extended <b>docking</b> study that was done on 73 protein-ligand complexes comprised of large ligands. We demonstrate not only that DINC is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than AutoDockâ€™s standard protocol, but that it also achieves the speed-up without sacrificing <b>docking</b> accuracy. We also show that positional restraints {{can be applied to}} the large ligand using DINC: this is useful when computing a <b>docked</b> conformation of the ligand. Finally, we introduce a webserver for <b>docking</b> large ligands using DINC. Conclusions: <b>Docking</b> large ligands using DINC is significantly faster than AutoDockâ€™s standard protocol without any loss of accuracy. Therefore, DINC could be used as an alternative protocol for <b>docking</b> large ligands. DINC has been implemented as a webserver and is available a...|$|R
