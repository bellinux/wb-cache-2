50|$|Wiped joints {{continue}} {{to be made for}} {{as long as there are}} lead pipes in service. Although lead pipework is now rare, for health reasons, wiping a joint remains the usual way of joining it. Commonly though a joint is to be made by shortening the old lead and installing new copper or plastic piping beyond the joint. These joints are usually made today with a proprietary mechanical <b>joint,</b> <b>sealing</b> onto the soft lead by some mechanical compression ring.|$|E
40|$|Interlayer cooling {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to enable heat removal scaling in true 3 D integration. This technology will unavoidably expose tier interconnects to coolant. If using electrically conductive liquids, such as water based coolants, the interconnects require a sealing mechanism to protect from short-circuiting. As an efficient technological solution we present a concentric ring sealing, realized around the interconnect in the very same alloy, thereby forming a joint of its own. We compare different aspect ratios of upper and lower joining parts, as well as single <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> and multiple <b>joint</b> <b>sealing.</b> We demonstrate the post-bonding states of the sealing using CuSnAg, AuSn transient liquid phase bonding (TLPB) and Cu-Cu thermos-compression bonding. We lay emphasis on the resulting intermetallic compounds and present shear strengths of consistently beyond 30 MPa, reaching up to 85 MPa, which clearly shows the feasibility of the concept...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} drive towards {{improvements}} and achieving success in effective and long term sealing of portland cement concrete pavement contraction joints. A variety of <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> products and procedures have been applied in Iowa in search of improvements in seal performance. Hot poured rubberized asphalt products were mainly used for sealing all joints in earlier years for highways. In the 1980 s, silicone sealant products were becoming popular, especially for the major highways. As {{a high level of}} sealant performance was not achieved from silicones in Iowa conditions, other sealing products were tried. Preformed neoprene compression seals are being tried as a substitution for silicone sealants. Due to high costs of materials and installation with neoprene seals, the search for improvements through other <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> products and procedures continued. An agreement was made with Phoenix, North America, Inc., to provide and install preformed Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) compression joint seals. The research site was a 600 ft (183 m) test section of northbound I- 29 in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. Seal installation was done August 20, 1992. Seal performance has been good over the past seven years and the seals are still showing no significant signs of decreasing performance...|$|E

Several <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> test sections consisting of variations in sawing methods, joint cleaning techniques, sealant installation, and sealant types have been established {{over the past few}} years. Laboratory analysis and field inspections were done {{as a part of the}} tests, and core samples were taken for laboratory adhesion pull tests. Such methods often cover specifically small areas and may not expose hidden failures. Some tests are also labor-intensive and destructive, especially that of coring.

40|$|In {{the civil}} {{engineering}} field, water-swelling materials {{are often used}} as <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> materials to improve water cut-off performance in the joints of the steel (pipe) sheet pile. In short, water-swelling materials are extremely effective as water sealing materials. However, many characteristics of water-swelling materials {{have not yet been}} proved, and one of the unproven characteristics is the swelling pressure. Solving the issue of the swelling pressure will contribute to improving water sealing in the joints of the steel (pipe) sheet pile. At the same time, it is also expected to greatly contribute to the application of water-swelling materials for other purposes, or the new development and improvement of water-swelling materials. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove the characteristics of swelling pressure of water-swelling materials which are applied to <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> materials, e. g., a steel (pipe) sheet pile, etc., and to experimentally evaluate the swelling pressure of water-swelling materials. The results we obtained are : (1) the swelling pressure depends on the membrane thickness of the water-swelling materials. The thicker a membrane becomes, the bigger the pressure tends to be. (2) While the swelling pressure is not much influenced by the temperature of the water to be immersed, it is influenced by the quality of water to be immersed. Similar to the traits of the swelling rate, the swelling pressure when immersed in artificial sea water is lower compared with that when immersed in freshwater. (3) For example, water-swelling materials 1 mm thick achieve a swelling pressure of 6. 7 MPa when immersed in fresh water, and 4. 2 MPa when immersed in artificial sea water, respectively. Accordingly, we assume they should fully perform the swelling functions under a restricted environment as well...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, ultra-thin whitetopping (UTW) {{has evolved}} {{as a viable}} {{rehabilitation}} technique for deteriorated asphalt cement concrete (ACC) pavement. Numerous UTW projects have been constructed and tested, enabling researchers to identify key elements contributing to their successful performance. These elements include foundation support, the interface bonding condition, portland cement concrete (PCC) overlay thickness, synthetic fiber reinforcement usage, joint spacing, and <b>joint</b> <b>sealing.</b> The interface bonding condition {{is the most important}} of these elements. It enables the pavement to act as a composite structure, thus reducing tensile stresses and allowing an ultra-thin PCC overlay to perform as intended. Although the main factors affecting UTW performance have been identified in previous research, neither the impact that external variables have on the elements nor the element interaction have been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this research was to investigate the interface bonding condition between an ultra-thin PCC overlay and an ACC base over time, considering the previously mentioned variables. Laboratory testing and full scale field testing were planned to accomplish the research objective. Laboratory testing involved monitoring interface strains in fabricated PCC/ACC composite test beams subjected to either static or dynamic flexural loading. Variables investigated included ACC surface preparation, PCC thickness, and synthetic fiber reinforcement usage. Field testing involved monitoring PCC/ACC interface stains and temperatures, falling weight deflectometer (FWD) deflection responses, direct shear strengths, and distresses on a 7. 2 mile Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) UTW project (HR- 559). The project was located on Iowa Highway 21 between Iowa Highway 212 and U. S. Highway 6 in Iowa County, near Belle Plaine, Iowa.

A few air bases have already been under reconstruction, and the RCAs produced on-site on air bases have been used only for the sub-base materials, regardless of the potentially good RCA quality that the air bases can produce. It is noticeable that the RCA recycled on the air base normally contains fewer impurities than other structures and at most contains some asphalt and rubber from the patching and <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> areas.|$|E
