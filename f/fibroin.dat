5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, <b>fibroin,</b> gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E
25|$|Silk {{emitted by}} the {{silkworm}} {{consists of two}} main proteins, sericin and <b>fibroin,</b> <b>fibroin</b> being the structural center of the silk, and serecin being the sticky material surrounding it. <b>Fibroin</b> {{is made up of}} the amino acids Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala and forms beta pleated sheets. Hydrogen bonds form between chains, and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of <b>fibroin</b> protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. <b>Fibroin</b> has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk <b>fibroin</b> can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the <b>fibroin</b> before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the <b>fibroin.</b> Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk <b>fibroin</b> and silk <b>fibroin</b> extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E

25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk <b>fibroin</b> fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk <b>fibroin</b> contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk <b>fibroin</b> very competitive for applications in biomaterials.

25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use.

Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk <b>fibroin</b> exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk <b>fibroin</b> films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk <b>fibroin,</b> which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk <b>fibroin</b> does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products.

25|$|Silk is {{a natural}} protein fiber, some forms {{of which can be}} woven into textiles. The protein fiber of silk is {{composed}} mainly of <b>fibroin</b> and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.|$|E
40|$|Spider silks are {{renowned for}} their {{excellent}} mechanical properties and biomimetic and industrial potentials. They are formed {{from the natural}} refolding of water-soluble <b>fibroins</b> with α-helical and random coil structures in silk glands into insoluble fibers with mainly β-structures. The structures of the <b>fibroins</b> at atomic resolution and silk formation mechanism remain largely unknown. Here, we report the 3 D structures of individual domains of a ≈ 366 -kDa eggcase silk protein that consists of 20 identical type 1 repetitive domains, one type 2 repetitive domain, and conserved nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains. The structures of the individual domains in solution were determined by using NMR techniques. The domain interactions were investigated by NMR and dynamic light-scattering techniques. The formation of micelles and macroscopic fibers from the domains was examined by electron microscopy. We find that either of the terminal domains covalently linked {{with at least one}} repetitive domain spontaneously forms micelle-like structures and can be further transformed into fibers at ≥ 37 °C and a protein concentration of > 0. 1 wt%. Our biophysical and biochemical experiments indicate that the less hydrophilic terminal domains initiate the assembly of the proteins and form the outer layer of the micelles whereas the more hydrophilic repetitive domains are embedded inside to ensure the formation of the micelle-like structures that are the essential intermediates in silk formation. Our results establish the roles of individual silk protein domains in fiber formation and provide the basis for designing miniature <b>fibroins</b> for producing artificial silks...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineered}} scaffold {{is one of}} {{the hopeful}} therapies for the patients with organ or tissue damages. The key element for a tissue engineered scaffold material is high biocompatibility. Herein the poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) film was irradiated by the low temperature atmospheric plasma and then coated by the silk <b>fibroins</b> (SF). After plasma treatment, the surface of PHBHHx film became rougher and more hydrophilic than that of original film. The experiment of PHBHHx flushed by phosphate buffer solution (PBS) proves that the coated SF shows stronger immobilization on the plasma-treated film than that on the untreated film. The cell viability assay demonstrates that SF-coated PHBHHx films treated by the plasma significantly supports the proliferation and growth of the human smooth muscle cells (HSMCs). Furthermore, the scanning electron microscopy and hemotoylin and eosin (HE) staining show that HSMCs formed a cell sub-monolayer and secreted a large amount of extracellular matrix (ECM) on the films after one week's culture.

As a result, there is considerable interest in the design of these materials as a guide to the commercial production of protein-based structural polymers through genetic engineering. To understand the design of silks, we must understand the relationships between structure and function, and this will require information from molecular biology, polymer physics, materials science and spider biology. We now have good information on the amino acid sequence motifs present in spider <b>fibroins,</b> and our understanding of the molecular architecture of spider silks is growing daily.

25|$|Electrospinning is a {{very old}} {{technique}} whereby a fluid is held in a container in a manner such that {{it is able to}} flow out through capillary action. A conducting substrate is positioned below, and a large difference in electrical potential is applied between the fluid and the substrate. The fluid is attracted to the substrate, and tiny fibres jump almost instantly from their point of emission, the Taylor cone, to the substrate, drying as they travel. This method has been shown to create nano-scale fibres from both silk dissected from organisms and regenerated silk <b>fibroin.</b>|$|E

30|$|Comparing BMSF and APSF as such, {{the latter}} {{membranes}} were stiffer and stronger. In their blends, we noticed {{a decrease in}} both modulus and ultimate strength {{in the region of}} equal concentrations of the two components, while they increase in the regions of either low BMSF or low APSF. This is consistent with the observation (Tsukada et al. 1994) that in BMSF/APSF blends the crystalline compatibility is high at low concentrations (about 20 % w/w or less) of either component, but crystalline phase separation occurs when their concentrations are similar (e.g. in the range 40 – 60 % w/w of any of these components). It is believed (Hu et al. 2011) that an enhanced crystallinity in silk <b>fibroins</b> leads to enhanced rigidity and strength, therefore, a reduced crystallinity due to phase separation could cause lower modulus and tensile strength. Our results appear to confirm the above assumptions.|$|R
40|$|Bombyx mori cocoon has a {{multi-layer}} {{structure that}} provides optimal protection for silkworm pupa. Research on the mechanical {{properties of the}} multi-layer structure revealed structure-property relationships of the cocoon. Here, we investigated the protein components of the B. mori cocoon {{in terms of its}} multi-layer structure. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 286 proteins from the multiple cocoon layers. In addition to <b>fibroins</b> and sericins, we identified abundant protease inhibitors, seroins and proteins of unknown function. By comparing protein abundance across layers, we found that the outermost layer contained more sericin 1 and protease inhibitors and the innermost layer had more seroin 1. As many as 36 protease inhibitors were identified in cocoons, showing efficient inhibitory activities against a fungal protease. Thus, we propose that more abundant protease inhibitors in the outer cocoon layers may provide better protection for the cocoon. This study increases our understanding of the multi-layer mechanism of cocoons, and helps clarify the biological characteristics of cocoons.

40|$|Silk {{is one of}} the {{promising}} natural fibres and has a long established history in textile production throughout the centuries. Silk is produced by cultured silk worms, spiders, scorpions, mites and flies. It is extracellular proteinaceous fibres which consist of highly crystalline and insoluble proteins, the <b>fibroins</b> glued with sericin and an amourphous protein. On the other hand, understanding and controlling the degradation of protein materials are important for determining quality and the value of appearance retention in textiles. Hence, for silk textiles, appearance retention is critical value for the quality. And this {{is one of the}} key properties directly related to the degree and nature of protein degradation. It is therefore necessary to understand the silk composition and damage to obtain good conservation treatments and long-term preservation especially for the historical silk fabrics. In this study, silk fibre and its properties are briefly introduced along with images on their fibre damages. Additionally, proteomics method which helps to understand the degradation at the molecular level in textiles is introduced.

40|$|Orb-weaving {{spider silk}} fibers are {{assembled}} from very large, highly repetitive proteins. The repeated segments contain, in turn, short, simple, and repetitive amino acid motifs {{that account for}} the physical and mechanical properties of the assembled fiber. Of the six orb-weaver silk <b>fibroins,</b> the piriform silk that makes the attachment discs, which lashes the joints of the web and attaches dragline silk to surfaces, has not been previously characterized. Piriform silk protein cDNAs were isolated from phage libraries of three species: A. trifasciata, N. claVipes, and N. cruentata. The deduced amino acid sequences from these genes revealed two new repetitive motifs: an alternating proline motif, where every other amino acid is proline, and a glutamine-rich motif of 6 - 8 amino acids. Similar to other spider silk proteins, the repeated segments are large (> 200 amino acids) and highly homogenized within a species. There is also substantial sequence similarity across the genes from the three species, with particular conservation of the repetitive motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA is larger than 11 kb and is expressed exclusively in the piriform glands of the spider. Phylogenetic analysis of the C-terminal regions of the new proteins with published spidroins robustly shows that the piriform sequences form an ortholog group. 201...|$|R
40|$|Silk cocoons are {{composed}} of fiber proteins (<b>fibroins)</b> and adhesive glue proteins (sericins), which provide a physical barrier to protect the inside pupa. Moreover, other proteins were identified in the cocoon silk, {{many of which are}} immune related proteins. In this study, we extracted proteins from the silkworm cocoon by Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7. 5), and found that they had a strong inhibitory activity against fungal proteases and they had higher abundance in the outer cocoon layers than in the inner cocoon layers. Moreover, we found that extracted cocoon proteins can inhibit the germination of Beauveria bassiana spores. Consistent with the distribution of protease inhibitors, we found that proteins from the outer cocoon layers showed better inhibitory effects against B. bassiana spores than proteins from the inner layers. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to reveal the extracted components in the scaffold silk, the outermost cocoon layer. A total of 129 proteins were identified, 30 of which were annotated as protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors accounted for 89. 1 % in abundance among extracted proteins.

40|$|Spiders spin high {{performance}} threads that have diverse mechanical properties for specific biological applications. To {{better understand the}} molecular mechanism by which spiders anchor their threads to a solid support, we solubilized the attachment discs from black widow spiders and performed in-solution tryptic digests followed by MS/MS analysis to identify novel peptides derived from glue silks. Combining matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry and cDNA library screening, we isolated a novel member of the silk gene family called pysp 1 and demonstrate that its protein product is assembled into the attachment disc silks. Alignment of the PySp 1 amino acid sequence to other <b>fibroins</b> revealed conservation in the non-repetitive C-terminal region of the silk family. MS/MS analysis also confirmed the presence of MaSp 1 and MaSp 2, two important components of dragline silks, anchored within the attachment disc materials. Characterization of the ultrastructure of attachment discs using scanning electron microscopy studies support the localization of PySp 1 to small diameter fibers embedded in a glue-like cement, which network with large diameter dragline silk threads, producing a strong, adhesive material. Consistent with elevated PySp 1 mRNA levels detected in the pyriform gland, MS analysis of the luminal contents extracted from the pyriform gland after tryptic digestion support the assertion that PySp 1 {{represents one of the}} major constituents manufactured in the pyriform gland. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PySp 1 is spun into attachment disc silks to help affix dragline fibers to substrates, a critical function during spider web construction for prey capture and locomotion...|$|R

Though negative charges are generally considered a destabilizer of β sheets, their consistent appearance within the β motif suggests a potentially novel structure.

This protein-based {{material}} {{acts as a}} promiscuous {{pressure-sensitive adhesive}} that functions even in wet conditions. We conducted macroscopic tests in air to assess the tensile strength of moist glue (up to 78 +/- 8 kPa) and the shear strength of dry glue (1. 7 +/- 0. 3 MPa). We also performed nanomechanical measurements in water to determine the adhesion (1. 9 - 7. 2 nN or greater), resilience (43 - 56 %), and elastic modulus (170 - 1035 kPa) of solid glue collected in different ways. Dry glue contains little carbohydrate and consists mainly of protein. The protein complement is rich in Gly (15. 8 mol %), Pro (8. 8 mol %), and Glu/Gln (14. 1 mol %); it also contains some 4 -hydroxyproline (4. 6 mol %) but no 5 -hydroxylysine or 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). Denaturing gel electrophoresis of the glue reveals a characteristic pattern of proteins spanning 13 - 400 kDa. The largest protein (Nb- 1 R, apparent molecular mass 350 - 500 kDa) {{is also the most}} abundant, and this protein appears to be the key structural component.
