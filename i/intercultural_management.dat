40|$|In the {{multinational}} organizations, more groups of individuals are {{being involved in}} the process of knowledge creation in a collaborative manner, of sharing knowledge and learning from it. These individuals can have heterogeneous cultures and they must use a common language. IT has created and is developing the infrastructure for cross-cultural communications and <b>intercultural</b> knowledge <b>management.</b> Nowadays, <b>intercultural</b> knowledge <b>management</b> can be realized with support of Collaborative Technologies and Knowledge Management Support Systems (KMSS). In this respect Collaborative Technologies and <b>Intercultural</b> Knowledge <b>Management</b> Support Systems (IKMSS) will be the appropriate way for supporting intercultural communication, learning and collaborative knowledge management in organizations.

The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected {{not to be a}} [...] "free space" [...] for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to <b>intercultural</b> privacy <b>management</b> and enhances CPM's cultural criteria." [...] Within the same context, foreign English teachers [...] "employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing. Japanese co-workers defined privacy as information that should be hidden and managed such information by: (a) drawing clear boundaries by not talking or changing contexts, and (b) being pre-emptive by demarcating privacy boundaries early on within a relationship." ...|$|R

40|$|Integrating {{cross-cultural}} education into language instruction {{has been}} a considerable challenge for second language educators, becoming even more challenging when teaching languages for specific purposes, such as business, which faces significantly increased global competition. This paper presents a few pedagogical strategies I utilized to implement cultural components in advanced business Chinese instruction {{with the purpose of}} enhance students’ cross-cultural competence. The first part focuses on strategies of selecting appropriate teaching materials to create a dynamic context for cross-cultural language learning. While adopting Yuan Fangyuan’s Business Chinese for Success: Real Cases from Real Companies as the textbook, I have integrated a variety of relevant supplemental materials from newspapers such as Wall Street Journal and from multimedia such as clips from TV. The diversity of the integrated materials not only allow students to acquire an enriched Chinese business vocabulary, conventional phrases and expressions unique to Chinese business settings, but also increase students’ cross-cultural awareness and knowledge, keep them abreast with recent highlights in the Chinese and global business markets, and motivate them to further explore the selected topics. The second part of the paper presents three examples of teaching <b>intercultural</b> <b>managements</b> cases (KFC, Starbucks Coffee, and IKEA), illustrating various ways of approaching course materials from a cross-cultural perspective, such as designing class discussion topics and assigning business writing, translation, and presentation. The paper will demonstrate that effective strategies with cross-cultural intention can equip students not only linguistically, but also culturally, to function more comfortably and confidently in Chinese business environment...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study is}} focused on how the public sector can {{collaborate}} {{with the private sector}} on a certain issue. The public sector wanted to create a project to increase bicycling in the municipality of Kalmar. Our problem was to develop a sustainable way to collaborate between the two parties. We managed to present a suggestion on how the public sector with communication could improve their Public Relations with the private sector and therefore letting the parties benefit from their differences, thus making it possible to release synergy. Using semi-structured interviews and a workshop, we could clarify the values and attitudes of the parties to bring forth the core values to develop a shared vision. Where the identified differences were found, we used a dialog strategy based on <b>intercultural</b> conflict <b>management</b> as a communication tool. The result was exemplified with things that were expressed in the interviews, and we presented a framework on how to think when choosing the right type of collaboration model for the specified activity...|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{tools in}} {{business}} management are {{understood as a}} combination of information technologies and quantitative methods used to assist stakeholders to make better decisions. The contemporary business environment is dramatically changing by the massive accumulation of data. Now, as never before, the use of analytical tools must be expanded {{to take advantage of}} this growing digital universe. This article will apply the laddering technique to see how personal values (or managerial functions) influence a companys adoption of analytical tools. A set of ten in-depth interviews are conducted with CEOs, analytics consultants, academics and businessmen in order to establish quantitative relations among attributes, consequences and personal values. Two easy-to-read outputs are provided to interpret our results.
