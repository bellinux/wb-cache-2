25|$|Released in June 1995, Batman Forever was {{a success}} at the box office, despite {{receiving}} mixed reviews from critics. There was debate about Kilmer's performance; some critics charged that Kilmer, while physically fit to play Batman, more so than his predecessor Michael Keaton had been, gave a wooden performance as Bruce Wayne. Other critics though, such as Roger Ebert, <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> words for Kilmer. Batman creator Bob Kane said in a Cinescape interview {{that of all the}} actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film critic Leonard Maltin (who criticized the dark tone contained in Batman Returns) complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews, as well as being very favorable of the film as a whole. Defenders of Batman Forever praised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films.|$|E

[...] She also drew on her parents' {{marriage}} for inspiration—her father spent the bulk of each week traveling. Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; [...] "She's radically different. I am much more willful and [...] don't think I could go through a lifetime waiting for someone to appear, no matter how fascinating he was." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Stanfield {{worked to}} try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved {{difficult}} to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on a bilingualism bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson {{died of cancer in}} 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> words for his old rival. Diefenbaker {{shook his head and said}} only, [...] "He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this {{is a good way to}} allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E
500|$|Cody {{stated that}} when writing the script, she was [...] "simultaneously {{trying to pay}} tribute to some of the {{conventions}} that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear". One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film The Lost Boys. She wanted to [...] "honor that, and at the same time, [...] had never really seen this particular subgenre done with girls and [...] tried to do a little of both". Despite this, she said she had noticed that [...] "the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman" [...] and that because of this she feels [...] "horror has always <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative". Jennifer's Body could play on both of these aspects.|$|E
5000|$|A type {{constructor}} {{takes one}} or more type arguments, and produces a data type when enough arguments are supplied, i.e. it supports partial application thanks to currying. This is how Haskell achieves parametric types. For instance, the type [...] (list) is a type constructor - it takes a single argument to specify the type {{of the elements of}} the list. Hence, [...] (list of Ints), [...] (list of Floats) and even [...] (list of lists of Ints) are valid applications of the [...] type constructor. Therefore, [...] is a type of kind [...] Because [...] <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> , applying it to [...] results in , of kind [...] The 2-tuple constructor [...] <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> , the 3-tuple constructor [...] <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> [...] and so on.|$|R

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food {{division}} as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met {{used the}} proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being [...] "lax" [...] in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> of lost its way. We felt we could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under-resourced their R and done {{a number of things}} to make the number, make the number. Cost reduction is a way of life, {{but you have to be}} responsible about it. You have to protect the seed today because that will be the tree that bears fruit in the future. I don't think Pillsbury had done that.|$|E
500|$|Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, {{where they}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally {{concerned that they}} had taken [...] "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" [...] {{because it was the}} only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: [...] "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." [...] New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of only $17,000. With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, [...] "we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E

[...] Of Friend, he wrote [...] "Of all the officers I worked with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect.

2500|$|Tyler {{composed}} {{several other}} new themes for the film, {{to represent the}} titular villain Ultron; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger Vision. Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound [...] "almost heroic", since Ultron thinks he is saving the world, [...] "but dissonant and tweaky enough" [...] to reflect that [...] "he doesn't quite have it right" [...] and is still a villain. The melody is simple {{so that it is}} easy to remember, but starts flat by one note to make the theme sound slightly [...] "off", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played [...] "ahead by a beat" [...] the second time; [...] "not only out of tune, but out of time." [...] The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone. Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an [...] "unrequited romance and this kind of sad situation" [...] with [...] "the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [...] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken." [...] Tyler wrote the [...] "lullaby" [...] to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello. For the Vision's theme, Tyler [...] "wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and <b>had</b> <b>kind</b> of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic". He tried to reflect the character's role as a messianic figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth, and said, [...] "you don’t really know what side he’s on. You have this guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way." [...] The theme is an adagio that is [...] "not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery." [...] To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds. Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, [...] "trying to say more with less for Vision". The music for the visions that the Scarlet Witch gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a [...] "randomly played" [...] vibraphone and strings such as a harp to create a [...] "dreaminess" [...] and [...] "hypnotic effect".|$|E
