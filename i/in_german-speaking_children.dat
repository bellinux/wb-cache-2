40|$|Superior early {{numerical}} competencies {{of children}} in several Asian countries have (amongst others) been attributed to the higher transparency of their number word systems. Here, we directly investigated this claim by evaluating whether Japanese children’s transcoding performance when writing numbers to dictation (e. g., twenty five  25) was less error prone than that of German-speaking children; both in general as well as when considering language-specific attributes of the German number word system such as the inversion property, in particular. In line with this hypothesis we observed that German-speaking children committed more transcoding errors in general than their Japanese peers. Moreover, their error pattern reflected the specific inversion intransparency of the German number-word system. Inversion errors in transcoding represented the most prominent error category <b>in</b> <b>German-speaking</b> <b>children,</b> but were almost absent in Japanese-speaking children. We conclude that the less transparent German number-word system complicates the acquisition of the correspondence between symbolic Arabic numbers and their respective verbal number words...|$|E
40|$|The Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Youth) is a self-report {{inventory}} assessing 24 character strengths {{among people}} 10 – 17 years of age. This paper describes the adaptation and initial validation of a German {{version of this}} measure utilizing several samples (in total N = 2, 110 self-reports of participants aged 10 – 17 years, 56. 5 % girls; N = 219 parent-reports) from Germany and Switzerland. The 24 scales yielded high reliability and exhibited stability over 4 months. Self-reports and parent-ratings of strengths converged well. An oblique five-factor solution was found to represent the data well. There were small age effects, and small to medium gender effects (e. g., girls scored higher on beauty and kindness). Character strengths of hope, gratitude, love, and zest correlated positively with global life satisfaction. Furthermore, most of the strengths were strong predictors of general self-efficacy. Overall, the German VIA-Youth demonstrated good psychometric properties and promising evidence for validity. The German VIA-Youth is recommended {{for the assessment of}} character strengths <b>in</b> <b>German-speaking</b> <b>children</b> and adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Speech sound {{disorders}} affect {{more children}} {{than any other}} developmental communication disorder and are associated with longterm social and academic difficulties. The diversity of presenting symptoms {{has resulted in the}} need for classifying subgroups of speech disorders. Research on English-speaking children suggests that there are four types of surface speech error patterns (B. Dodd, 1995) : articulation disorder (e. g., lisp); delay (i. e., normal developmental patterns that are inappropriate for chronological age); consistent use of atypical error patterns (e. g., deletion of all initial consonants); and inconsistent pronunciation of the same lexical items. Classification typologies should be language independent. This study investigated whether the same four subgroups, in similar proportions, would be found <b>in</b> <b>German-speaking</b> <b>children</b> who had disordered speech. A total of 110 monolingual German-speaking children, aged 2 years 7 months to 7 years 7 months, participated in the study. They had been referred for assessment of a suspected speech disorder. The results supported the subgroup classification, providing evidence for the universal character of speech disorders. One significant difference was the relatively high proportion of children classified as having an articulation disorder. This was explained by the uncertainty regarding a lisp as a disorder in German, since it is also found in up to 40 % of normally developing children of the same age. The theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|E

It was argued that the children were learning plurals by rote, conditioned by morphological complexity which cannot be subsumed under any general rul...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore cluster {{acquisition}} <b>in</b> typically developing <b>German-speaking</b> 2 -year-olds. METHOD: Data from four cross-sectional studies (n[*]=[*] 145, aged 2; 00 - 2; 11) and one eight-month longitudinal study were analysed (n[*]=[*] 6, aged 2; 01 - 2; 04). Two different percentages of consonant clusters correct were calculated to allow a more detailed analysis. RESULT: Findings showed that the majority of children produced clusters, although they could not be considered to be fully acquired. Correct production significantly correlated with age. Only /gl/ and /kl/ were shown to be phonetically and phonemically acquired (75 % criterion) in the older age group. Three-element clusters were acquired at the same time as 2 -element clusters and /∫/-clusters were acquired to the same or larger extent as non-/∫/ clusters when fronting/backing of /∫/ was accepted. Younger children produced more reductions than simplifications but this effect was less strong for the /∫/-clusters. Developmental realisation patterns varied depending on cluster type. Inter- and intra-individual developmental patterns could be observed which changed depending on the time of testing. CONCLUSION: Findings on cluster acquisition <b>in</b> 2 -year-old <b>German-speaking</b> <b>children</b> revealed language-specific differences but also similarities in comparison with results from other languages. All but two children produced clusters. However, individual variation between children was high...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the acquisition of}} restrictive and appositive interpretations of relative clauses <b>in</b> <b>German-speaking</b> <b>children</b> between the age of 3 and 6 in three experiments. The theoretical background shows that restrictive relative clauses are semantically less complex than appositive ones. This assumption is supported by observations from a typological overview on the semantic functions attested across languages. It is shown {{that the existence of}} appositive relative clauses implies the availability of restrictive readings in a given language. Furthermore, restrictive readings may be favored due to the functioning of general processing principles. Previous research on the acquisition of relative clauses demonstrates that the acquisition of the semantic functions of relative clauses is an understudied area. In contrast, the acquisition of syntactic aspects of relative clauses is well documented. Relative clauses start to be produced in the third year of life and can be interpreted target-like between the age of 4 and 8 depending on their structure. Which semantic interpretation children assign to relative clauses at this age, however, is still an open question. Based on the formal background and insights from previous studies, three experiments were designed: two picture selection tasks and one acceptability task. The crucial aspect of the experimental design constitutes the interaction of an ordinal number word and the interpretation of the relative clause in sentences like “Take the third car(,) that/which is red”. The scope of the ordinal number reveals whether the relative clause had been attached restrictively at the NP-level or whether it had been attached higher up at the DP shell resulting in an appositive interpretation. The results of the experiments demonstrate that 4 - to 6 -year-old German-speaking children and adults prefer restrictive readings over appositive ones. This preference is found within the group data and is mirrored by the results of an individual analysis. In addition, while the majority of children has acquired restrictive readings at the age of 4, appositive interpretations are mastered only by about half of the children between age 4 and 6. Interestingly, 3 -year-old children show a different pattern than their older peers. Appositive but not restrictive interpretations seem to be available to these children. Although the results may be taken as evidence that appositivity is acquired before restrictivity in relative clauses by German-speaking children, I propose the contrary. Based on assumptions about the complexity of restrictive and appositive derivations, I argue that the appositive interpretations observed at the age of 3 do not result from a target-like syntactic and semantic representation. I propose that 3 -year-old children do not yet identify relative clauses as nominal modifiers. Instead, they are derived from an incorrect attachment of the relative clause higher up in the syntactic tree. The results of the three experiments are the first to show that neither a prototypical unintegrated prosodic contour nor the presence of a lexical marker, the discourse particle “ja”, or a visual context biasing for appositivity led to an increase of appositive interpretations in the children’s groups. Adults, in contrast, were sensitive to the presence of the discourse particle and the cues from the visual context. As for children, the prosodic format of the relative clauses did not systematically change the interpretation preferences of adults. The proposed acquisition path may not be specific to German. Instead, it is predicted to hold cross-linguistically and may also be transferred to the interpretation of adjectives. Moreover, the assumptions on how children integrate relative clauses during comprehension may be generalized to other types of subordinate clauses...|$|E

40|$|Childrenʼs poor {{performance}} on object relative clauses has been {{explained in terms}} of intervention locality. This approach predicts that object relatives with a full DP head and an embedded pronominal subject are easier than object relatives in which both the head noun and the embedded subject are full DPs. This prediction is shared by other accounts formulated to explain processing mechanisms. We conducted a visual-world study designed to test the off-line comprehension and on-line processing of object relatives <b>in</b> <b>German-speaking</b> 5 -year-olds. <b>Children</b> were tested on three types of object relatives, all having a full DP head noun and differing with respect to the type of nominal phrase that appeared in the embedded subject position: another full DP, a 1 st- or a 3 rd-person pronoun. Grammatical skills and memory capacity were also assessed in order to see whether and how they affect childrenʼs performance. Most accurately processed were object relatives with 1 st-person pronoun, independently of childrenʼs language and memory skills. Performance on object relatives with two full DPs was overall more accurate than on object relatives with 3 rd-person pronoun. In the former condition, children with stronger grammatical skills accurately processed the structure and their memory abilities determined how fast they were; in the latter condition, children only processed accurately the structure if they were strong both in their grammatical skills and in their memory capacity. The results are discussed in the light of accounts that predict different pronoun effects like the ones we find, which depend on the referential properties of the pronouns. We then discuss which role language and memory abilities might have in processing object relatives with various embedded nominal phrases...|$|R
