40|$|The one-stage {{processing}} {{technique for}} producing of thermal insulation materials based on silica gel has been developed. Silica gel is AlF 3, waste products including following main stages: hydrothermal synthesis polysilicate, granulation, classification and foaming. As compared with well-known analogs, it differs significantly in lower power consumption, {{does not require}} complex and expensive equipment, provides the possibility of varying boundary-granulometric composition of the foam product (0. 5 to 30 mm). The main influence on {{the stability of the}} product quality is caused by the processes of depolymerization and condensation occurring on the stage of hydrosilicates synthesis from the silica gel because of NaOH addition. It was found out that a final <b>foamed</b> <b>product</b> with a bulk density less than 200 kg/m 3 can be produced only if depolymerization and polycondensation of the silica gel stages are separated at the time. The values of process parameters (silica module, suspension temperature, the intensity of her mixing, foaming temperature, the quantity and type of modifiers) synthesis of heat-insulating materials have been defined. The required concentration of dissolved silica in the suspension is provided by its intensive mixing for 15 – 30 min. The temperature of the mixture should not exceed 35 – 40 °C. The most effective technique for the speed polycondensation control is to additive a carbon. Its amount should not be more than 0. 2 – 0. 3 %. Fast transition gel susp ension is achieved when it is heated to 70 – 80 °C for 10 – 15 min. After aging and foaming of gels at a temperature of 450 – 500 °C the proposed processing technique allows one to produce the thermal insulation materials possessing the characteristics which are not inferior to those of the foreign ones...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{materials}} {{based on}} expanded polystyrene {{can be substituted}} by biodegradable foam, manufactured by direct or indirect electrical heating of a potato starch suspension in a closed mold. This paper deals with an experimental evaluation of selected properties of potato starch and starch foam related to this technology: density, specific heat capacity and specific electrical conductivity of a water suspension of potato starch within the temperature range up to 100 °C, and mass fraction from 5 to 65 %. The electric conductivity and heat capacity changes were observed during direct ohmic heating of a starch suspension between electrodes in a closed cell (feeding voltage 100 V, frequency 50 Hz). Specific electric conductivity increases with temperature, {{with the exception of}} the gelatinization region at 60 to 70 °C, and decreases with increasing concentration of starch (the temperature and concentration dependencies were approximated using the Lorentz equation). Direct ohmic heating is restricted by a significant decrease in effective electrical conductivity above a temperature of 100 °C, when evaporated steam worsens the contact with the electrodes. Experiments show that when direct ohmic heating is not combined with indirect contact heating, only 20 % of the water can be evaporated from manufactured samples and the starch foam is not fully formed. This is manifested by only a slight expansion of the heated sample. Only the indirect contact heating from the walls of the mold, with the wall temperature above 180 °C, forms a fixed porous structure (expansion of about 300 %) and a crust, ensuring suitable mechanical and thermal insulation properties of the manufactured product. The effective thermal conductivity of the <b>foamed</b> <b>product</b> (sandwich plates with a porous core and a compact crust) was determined by the heated wire method, while the porosity of the foam and the thickness of the crust were evaluated by image analysis of colored cross sections of manufactured samples. While the porosity is almost constant, the thickness of the crust is approximately proportional to the thickness of the plate...|$|E

40|$|This work used {{different}} types of recycled PVC products including PVC pipes and bottles, as rigid recyclates, and PVC plastic coverings, as soft recyclate. The PVC recyclates were added into virgin PVC foam, ranging from 0 - 100 wt%. The PVC blends were then moulded with different processing temperatures, and their properties were monitored. It {{was found that the}} concentration of the pipe recyclates up to 60 wt% could be used to add into the PVC virgin for production of rigid PVC <b>foam</b> <b>products.</b> The higher the recyclate content led to the higher the blend density and the mechanical properties (flexural and impact strength, and hardness). For bottle recyclates, up to 60 wt% of bottle recyclates could be used for rigid PVC foam production, but the overall properties, except for the impact strength, of the PVC foam did not improve withincreasing the recycled bottles. For recycled coverings, increasing plastic coverings led to an increase in average cell size, but resulted in decreases of impact and hardness resistances. The flexible or soft PVC <b>foam</b> <b>products</b> could be manufactured with use of 0 - 100 wt% recycled coverings. In summary, it could be concludedthat recyclates of pipes, bottles and plastic coverings can be mixed with virgin PVC foam for making <b>foam</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|A facile {{and green}} {{approach}} {{was developed for}} the production of porous three-dimensional (3 D) nitrogen-doped graphene with a foam structure. In comparison with conventional methods, this green approach uses environmental precursors in the preparation of graphene products. The resulting crystalline graphene <b>foam</b> <b>product</b> exhibited a uniform structure with large surface area. These appealing features render the prepared graphene <b>foam</b> <b>product</b> a prospective backbone for producing 3 D charge-transport networks. The 3 D graphene <b>foam</b> <b>products</b> were employed as the skeleton with an interconnected network for lithium-ion batteries. The lithium-ion batteries with the 3 D porous foam structure exhibit superior cycling stability and good rate capability. There is no capacity loss after 800 cycles because the capacity stabilized for the first few cycles, and the lithium-ion batteries with 3 D graphene foam showed a discharge capacity of 180 mA h g(- 1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(- 1). This superior cycling stability and good rate capability was ascribed to the 3 D structure with an interconnected porous network and the nitrogen-doping strategy for improved conductive properties of graphene foam, which produces an efficient 3 D charge-transport network. The configuration of this 3 D transport network in lithium-ion cells not only can improve the electron-transport efficiency but also can suppress the volume effect during charge/discharge cycling. Besides, nitrogen doping could enhance the formation of chemical bonding between carbon and the nearby nitrogen atoms, which could accelerate the diffusion of lithium ions through the whole graphene network...|$|R
