5|$|In the end, Sounders FC {{was able}} to {{withstand}} D.C.'s late push for a 2–1 victory, becoming the second MLS expansion team in league history (Chicago Fire was the first) to win the U.S. Open Cup in their inaugural season. Players and coaches ran onto the field after the final whistle, <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down together and hurried to {{a corner of the}} field to acknowledge the Sounders FC fans cheering in the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|The return {{match at}} Anfield took place the {{following}} week. Celtic's Alan Thompson and Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann both {{came close to}} scoring for their respective sides in the opening quarter-hour with long range shots. On 19 minutes, Jerzy Dudek turned a 30-yard free kick from Henrik Larsson around the post. Two minutes from half time, Celtic were awarded a free kick 25 yards from goal. Thompson struck a low shot past Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall, which had <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed their victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, and then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal. Celtic's 20 win saw them win the tie 31 on aggregate and progress to the semi-finals.|$|E

5|$|Kahn {{was sent}} off in an {{incident}} against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001. With his Bayern Munich team losing 2–3 {{in the final}} minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> punched {{the ball into the}} opponent’s net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. He was named man of the match when {{he was part of the}} squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia. He played an important role in the penalty shoot-out held after the teams remained tied 1–1 after extra time, making three saves. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after he walked up to a disappointed Santiago Cañizares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to comfort him. The same year, Bayern Munich won the International Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors. But the team failed to win the UEFA Super Cup a couple of months earlier.|$|E
5|$|German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round {{opponents in}} the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3–1 at Parkhead, while in the second leg, despite Celtic going up 2–0 early, a {{comeback}} from Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3–2 on the night, although Celtic would progress 5–4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals saw another English Premier League opponent for Celtic, this time Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003, ending 1–1 through a first-minute Larsson goal; the away goal, however, gave Liverpool an advantage entering their home tie at Anfield. In the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Two minutes from half-time, Celtic were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Alan Thompson struck a low shot past Jerzy Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall which had <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed a 20 victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal.|$|E
25|$|Another craze that City {{supporters}} {{decided to}} implement in England {{is a celebration}} or dance that has been given the nickname of 'The Poznan'.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the concert, Furtwängler {{continued}} to keep his baton in his right hand. Hitler understood the situation and <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> demonstratively held out his right hand to him. The same situation occurred during another concert later on, when a photographer had been mobilized by the Nazis for the occasion: the photo of the famous handshake between Furtwängler and Hitler was distributed everywhere by Goebbels. Goebbels had obtained what he desired: to keep Furtwängler in Germany and to give the impression to those who were not well informed (especially outside the country) that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the regime.|$|E
25|$|Mistakenly {{believing that}} he was being shot at, Gil Lamadrid dropped to the ground. Perhaps {{thinking}} that Gil Lamadrid had been shot, Customs Officer Gallegos grabbed his pistol and opened fire on the US guards, killing Pvt. Klint with a shot to the face. Inspector Barber drew his revolver and returned fire, killing Gallegos and fellow Customs Officer Andrés Ceceña. In the confusion Gil Lamadrid <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sprinted down a nearby street, exiting the narrative of the battle that he had inadvertently started. Gil Lamadrid died in an altercation in a Nogales, Sonora, bar in 1935 near where the Battle of Ambos Nogales initially took place.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, Isaac Cody {{sold his}} land in rural Scott County, Iowa, for $2000, {{and the family}} moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory. In the years before the Civil War, Kansas was {{overtaken}} by political and physical conflict over the slavery question. Isaac Cody was against slavery. He was invited to speak at Rively's store, a local trading post where pro-slavery men often held meetings. His antislavery speech so angered the crowd that they threatened to kill him if he didn't step down. A man <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stabbed him twice with a Bowie knife. Rively, the store's owner, rushed Cody to get treatment, but he never fully recovered from his injuries.|$|E

25|$|The Spurs easily took Game 3 at {{home with}} Manu Ginóbili {{carrying}} the Spurs after two terrible games at L.A, making 5 3-pointers and finishing with 30 points; Tony Parker and Tim Duncan added 42 more. In Game 4 the Lakers never trailed (the Spurs missed several opportunities to take the lead) and led comfortably late, but a furious run by the Spurs and several mistakes by the Lakers (Bryant attempting a running fallaway with plenty {{of time on the}} shot clock, Gasol missing 2 free throws) gave San Antonio a chance to tie or win with seconds left. On a disputed no-call, Derek Fisher <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> collided with Brent Barry, but no foul was called and Barry missed a last second 3. The NBA later ruled that a foul should have been called on Fisher when he collided with Barry.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} during the promotional tour for the Hard Candy album, and the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour; both performances were similar. In the promotional tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was performed as the fifth {{song of the}} setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black dress with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. Every time the chorus played, Madonna and her back-up dancers <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, while waving their hands up in the air. The performance was backed by laser lights {{in the background and}} two movable screens, which displayed Williams, performing his lines.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{then moved}} on to celebrate British children's literature. J. K. Rowling began by reading from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The Child Catcher appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil and Lord Voldemort. [...] Minutes later, 32 women playing Mary Poppins descended on flying umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing. The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from Tubular Bells (with a giant set of tubular bells {{at the rear of the}} stage), Tubular Bells III and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, In Dulci Jubilo. [...] During this performance the children in pyjamas <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down on their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} added to the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. It {{replaced}} the song [...] "Heartbeat" [...] from Hard Candy and was used as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson who died a week {{prior to the start of}} the second leg of the tour. As Madonna sang the song, a picture of a young Jackson appeared on stage, followed by a Jackson impersonator wearing garments in Jackson style. The music then switched to a medley of his songs, like [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", and the impersonator worked through his moves, including the moonwalk as well as the spinning and gyrating. Madonna clapped her hands, swayed from side to side and <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down while images of Jackson over the years flashed on a big screen. After the performance, Madonna told the crowd, [...] "Let's give it up for one of the greatest artists the world has ever known," [...] and the crowd applauded.|$|E
500|$|Gene Hoglan, later {{known as}} the drummer for bands like Dark Angel and Death, {{provided}} backing vocals on the song [...] "Evil Has No Boundaries". [...] "Back {{at the time it}} was Jeff [...] and Kerry doing the 'Evil!' You know, it didn't sound too heavy and I mentioned to like Tom or Jeff or somebody like, 'You know you guys should consider...maybe consider doing like big gang vocals on that, make it sound evil like demons and stuff,' and they were like 'Good idea.' But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> yelled 'EVIL!!!' So I was like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.' So I was like 'Yeah, I got to sing on it!'" [...] On recording the drums, Slagel wanted drummer Dave Lombardo to play without using cymbals due to the amount of noise they made, as he was unsure if he could siphon the noise out, which he eventually did.|$|E
500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend for all these years. It had been like an old dog, sleeping comfortably at our feet, and then one day it <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do we put it to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E

500|$|The Three Way Ultimate X {{match was}} next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. Petey Williams, Chris Sabin, and Matt Bentley were {{the participants in this}} encounter, which spanned 13 minutes and 13 seconds. Bentley was accompanied by Traci to the ring. In an Ultimate X match, ropes are hung above the ring in a manner to form an [...] "X", in which the objective is to climb the ropes and retrieve an object {{at the center of the}} [...] "X". In this case, the object was a giant red [...] "X". Sabin scaled the ropes above the ring midway through the match, before Bentley <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tackled him to the mat below. The result of this impact caused the [...] "X" [...] to fall off the ropes. TNA officials then had to re-hang it while the match continued. Later, Bentley and Sabin attempted to retrieve the [...] "X" [...] again, only to cause it to fall once more. This time Williams was standing below and caught it; the referee declared Williams the winner, thus becoming the number-one contender to the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of [...] "Give It Away" [...] during jam {{sessions}} {{in the early}} 1990s. Following the Chili Peppers' tour in support of Mother's Milk (1989), the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone. During their tenure in the group, the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for [...] "Give It Away". The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter, but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers' upcoming record. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed, and upon hearing {{the rest of the}} Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting [...] "give it away, give it away, give it away now". The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band's new record, {{but it was not until}} he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit. Kiedis said, [...] "I was so struck by Flea's bass part, which covered the whole length of the instrument's neck, that I <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> marched over to the mic, my notebook in tow. I always had fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E
