The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project would serve as the backbone of the <b>European</b> <b>Supergrid.</b>|$|E

No attempt has been made as yet to represent a time-related demand curve of residential electricity consumption at the European level. This article assesses how active occupancy levels of single-person households vary in single-person household in 15 European countries. It makes use of occupancy time-series data from the Harmonised European Time Use Survey database to build European occupancy curves; identify peak occupancy periods; construct time-related electricity demand curves for TV and video watching activities and assess occupancy variances of single-person households...|$|E

40|$|The European Union's {{energy policy}} strives for a competitive, {{sustainable}} and secure energy supply. One {{of the most}} obvious results of this policy is the ongoing strong increase of renewable energy sources in the energy supply. The transmission grid updates required to accommodate this envisaged massive amount of renewable energy sources in the transmission system go well beyond standard system reinforcements used in the past: in the coming decades, a North-Sea grid interconnecting various offshore wind farms {{is expected to be}} built. This grid can gradually evolve into a <b>European</b> overlay <b>supergrid</b> connecting the offshore wind resources with the demand centers on the continent. Also solar energy, concentrated in the south of Europe, will require similar solutions. Voltage Source Converter High Voltage Direct Current (VSC HVDC) is the most suitable technological candidate to build such a grid. One of the challenges to use this technology relates to the control of the DC voltage in case of DC system contingencies, such as a converter outage. This thesis deals with the modeling and control of VSC HVDC in a meshed DC grid and multi-terminal DC systems in general. Models are developed to address both the interactions with the AC system and the control of the DC system. The main contributions of the work include a detailed comparison of different DC voltage control strategies for multi-terminal DC systems, the development of detailed dynamic and steady-state models as well as an open-source Matlab-based power flow software program, MatACDC, which enables the study of the influence of the DC voltage control on the power flows in the AC and DC systems. Furthermore, the impact of a distributed DC voltage control on the AC system transient stability is investigated, as well as the influence of the DC system layout on the DC voltage control after a contingency. nrpages: 237 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of power offshore has recently seen {{a large amount}} of interest and investment. Submarine power cables are essential tools in transferring power from these offshore generation sites, to where it is consumed back on land. In addition, initiatives like the <b>European</b> <b>Supergrid</b> use submarine HV interconnectors to link electrical infrastructure on a national level. This helps to improve efficiency, and reduce total power generation and its associated costs. HV cables have been studied extensively in terrestrial soils. How their behaviour alters when buried under the seafloor is essentially unknown, despite key differences between the two respective environments. In order to make full use of these assets, accurate current ratings must be obtained...|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of {{extensive}} deployment of indigenous and external renewable energy sources on a local electricity system (Sardinia Island) and discusses the main challenges faced by the European power grids in integrating high shares of renewable-based generation technologies. It presents the 2030 scenarios for the Sardinian power system {{and the results of}} steady-state analyses in extreme (renewable) generation and consumption conditions. These results are eventually combined with the assessment of key technology development trends to explain how this can affect the development of a <b>European</b> <b>supergrid.</b> In general, the article stresses that rendering the bulk-power system capable of accommodating high renewable energy penetration not only requires reinforcing the electricity highways but also demands carefully planning the architecture of and the interface with regional power systems.

40|$|The {{offshore}} node {{will be a}} {{key component}} of a future <b>European</b> <b>Supergrid.</b> The offshore AC hub (or SuperNode) is presented as one possible topology of an offshore node. Tranche A is an area within Dogger Bank, {{which is one of the}} UK's largest offshore wind development zones. It is a likely location of an offshore AC hub and therefore is used as a case study. Two strategies are presented for control of voltage, current and power within the offshore AC hub. The performance of each control strategy is compared under both planned and unplanned changes in operating conditions. Simulations are carried out using the SimPower toolbox of MATLAB Simulink. It is found that both control strategies are able to maintain satisfactory control of voltage, current and power. The communication requirements of each strategy are also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{choosing}} a non-standard operating frequency on {{the equipment and}} infrastructure costs of an offshore AC network is investigated. The offshore AC network considered is similar in design to the <b>European</b> <b>SuperGrid</b> “SuperNode”. It is designed to connect several large wind arrays to multiple HVDC converters through which power may be transmitted to shore. As the offshore AC network is isolated from onshore networks {{by the use of}} HVDC links, it may be operated unsynchronised at any desired frequency. The cost associated with operating the network at a fixed frequency in the range 20 – 120 Hz is investigated, focusing on the frequency-cost scalings of electrical devices (such as cables, transformers and reactive compensation) and offshore infrastructures. A case study is presented based upon Tranche A area of Dogger Bank, UK, where a minimum point in the total cost of the offshore network is found at 93 Hz...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Voltage Source Converter High Voltage Direct Current (VSC HVDC) {{have become a}} viable {{alternative}} for grid extensions. Due to technical limitations of existing AC technology and the classic Line Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDC, the VSC HVDC technology is the preferred technology when connecting remote offshore wind farms to onshore transmission systems. Beside point-to-point connections, the technology has good prospects when the expansion to multi-terminal HVDC or DC grids is considered, {{which could be used}} to interconnect offshore wind farms in e. g. a North-Sea offshore grid or to build a <b>European</b> <b>Supergrid.</b> Since the share of wind energy in the overall electricity mix is increasing, the research on frequency support by wind farms has become more and more important. With wind farms connected to an offshore DC grid, one of the challenging tasks is to come up with control strategies that allow different wind farms (and other non-synchronized zones) to contribute to the frequency support in another synchronized zone. This thesis concentrates on the development of a coordinated frequency control strategy for an offshore DC grid...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceWINPOWER {{project is}} a French national project funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) that aims at developing a wide control strategy to manage large scale High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) multi-terminal networks that will interconnect renewable energy sources (RES) to the main power network. The consortium is composed of french academic and industrial partners: EECI (European Embedded Control Institute), SUPELEC (École Supérieure d'Électricité), CEA (Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives), CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientique, ARMINES (Mines ParisTech), Winnove (Groupe Grandir Conseil), Alstom, EDF (Électricité de France). Proposed work deals with control strategies in a wide sense, from off-line optimization of network itself before its construction; to real time, multi layered, decentralized stabilizing control that is embedded into its components. This DC grid will allow for multi-RES generators efficient interconnection, for example offshore Wind Farms (WF) and solar plants. This DC grid will also manage their connection to: the main AC grid; large loads (big cities or industrial facilities); other DC grids like a future <b>European</b> <b>SuperGrid.</b> Northern Europe's RES will likely be implemented through the "Baltic interconnection", integrating offshore wind farms using DC networks. But most HVDC links are bi-terminal (one sending and one receiving). Moving forward, this will economically and technically lead to an under-optimal scheme, therefore leading to prefer migration toward multi-terminal DC networks. However scientific and technical literature did not yet solve voltage and power quality control on multi-terminal DC networks. Solving such problems requires a complete new system thinking and testing, bringing together industry and utility players from generation and transmission as well as academic research that brings theoretical support to platform experimentations. The project will show how stability can be obtained with already used technology such as high voltage direct current (DC) equipments and systems, or AC/DC mixed systems and networks. To obtain these objectives, new control schemes are envisaged to cope with large scale networked power systems issues like delayed remote information, uncertainties, interconnected nonlinear dynamics and mixed time scales. It will allow players along the value chain to position products and service offers according to their specific know-how and business models. As a consequence, a broad decentralized and intercommunicating strategy is necessary to target building a global European HVDC system infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{approved}} in 2009 an ambitious “Climate and Energy Package” with measures {{for the promotion}} of low-carbon technologies to fight human-induced climate change. This Package provided unprecedented EU-level support for carbon capture and storage (CCS), a new technology first mentioned in the EU’s political agenda in 2005. This dissertation answers the question: “what or who drove the sudden decision to support CCS in the EU?”; thereby covering important gaps in the literature. This literature largely explains away the EU’s choice for CCS as a logical measure to step up climate change mitigation. However, CCS {{is just one of many}} potential “innovative technologies”. Indeed, the vision of a <b>European</b> <b>Supergrid</b> acquired prominence as soon as CCS projects began floundering in 2010. A fraction of this EU literature does analyse the legal intricacies of support for CCS, but does not delve into the politics behind the laws. The thesis argues that a loose coalition led by traditional electrical utilities successfully pushed for the support of CCS at the EU level, subtly emphasizing its use in new coal-fired power plants as an innovative way to enhance European security of supply. The thesis contends that this coalition downplayed the uncertainty surrounding CCS deployment, disregarded the EU’s strengths in industrial CCS, and its increasingly coal-importing, low-growth economy. More coal power hardly addresses the EU’s supply worries and adds pressure on climate targets; yet it absorbed all EU funding made available to CCS – with few results. By contrast, steelmaking provided a trial ground for CCS with no current low-carbon alternatives, a fact that was widely ignored. A constructivist understanding of technological change underpins this thesis. This means that debates about technologies are assumed to socially “construct” their future development (or at least support for it) along “storylines” describing such development. The dissertation also drew on insights about the pitfalls of economic modelling as well as the relevance of the concept of “hype” in decision-making about future technologies. Documental analysis and interviews were used to reveal the social construction of low-carbon technologies in the EU, and the role of modelling therein. These methods also helped analyse the extent of hype. In its exposition, the dissertation traces chronologically the process of EU decision-making on CCS. Process-tracing highlights the influence of a dominant “storyline”, used by the aforementioned coalition, to extol the potential of CCS for coal-fired power plants in the EU. This EU storyline was based on a largely unrelated (and partly unfounded) global storyline, which originated in the early influence on CCS of the coal-rich USA and in a global community awestruck by the coal-propelled rise of China in the 2000 s. The global storyline was relayed and relied on by authoritative organisations (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the International Energy Agency). Eventually, the utility-led coalition adopted it in the EU – in order to safeguard not only the climate, but also its coal assets and interests. Two further points on modelling and hype can be derived from the process-tracing exercise. Firstly, a classic hype dynamic can be observed in the fact that, after a decade of being largely ignored and with little more data available, CCS for clean coal suddenly appeared essential worldwide. Secondly, this research reveals that the dominance of this CCS storyline sidelined other existing low-carbon options, such as the Supergrid. Notably, the economic modelling that backed CCS in the EU was fundamentally biased, assuming that only CCS would be capable of breakthroughs and that conditions not conducive to CCS deployment were “extremes”. Literature on CCS generally has failed to consider in depth the potentially very different role of CCS in each world region or its relation to other technologies. Drawing lessons from the findings above, this dissertation suggests a strategic approach to CCS promotion in the EU that takes into account (1) the possibility of breakthroughs in non-CCS low-carbon technologies and (2) the advantages of promoting CCS in industrial sectors with no other mitigation options...|$|E
