500|$|After Aaliyah's death, the German {{newspaper}} Die Zeit published {{excerpts from}} an interview done shortly before her death, {{in which she}} described a recurring dream: [...] "It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do <b>I</b> <b>feel?</b> <b>As</b> <b>if</b> I am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{former vice}} {{president}} opens the film by greeting an audience with his well-known line about his campaign in 2000: [...] "I am Al Gore; I {{used to be the}} next President of the United States." [...] He is shown using his laptop to edit his presentation, and pondering the difficulty he has had in awakening public concern: [...] "I've been trying to tell this story {{for a long time and}} <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I've failed to get the message across." ...|$|E
2500|$|James W. Walker, {{a prosperous}} {{merchant}} from Kentucky, purchased {{the hotel and}} [...] surrounding for use as his family home in 1889. [...] Walker became a successful citrus grower, and the house became a center of community life in San Dimas and the East San Gabriel Valley. [...] Many of the area's clubs and social groups met at the home, {{and it was also}} the site of the first school and the first church services in San Dimas. [...] For 90 years from 1889 to 1978, six generations of the Walker family lived at the converted hotel. [...] From the 1910s through the 1960s, the home was occupied by Mrs. Raymond I. Carruthers, the granddaughter of James M. Walker. [...] During this time, the house was commonly known as the [...] "Carruthers Home." [...] In 1961, Mrs. Carruthers noted that the cost of upkeep was enormous: [...] "Anytime I have a repair bill, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is a hotel." [...] She died in August 1967.|$|E

2500|$|Tripoli was {{occupied}} unopposed on 13 October by the 7th (Meerut) Division led once {{again by the}} XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery following Bulfin's orders for {{the continuation of the}} coastal advance northwards. The leading column was followed by the 19th Infantry Brigade Group commanded by Brigadier General W. S. Leslie which arrived on 18 October. The remainder of the 7th (Meerut) Division arrived not long after. Rothon arrived in Tripoli on 18 October, after a [...] march over mountain passes and sand. [...] "Felt absolutely done up when we got here and at times felt like lying down and giving in as <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> my very life blood is being drawn from me in these long marches, in addition to which we are only at half strength which means double work for us all." [...] He was hospitalised in Tripoli shortly after and was still there {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
2500|$|Skaat has said, [...] "My wish {{was always}} to be a singer, and I'm still working on it." [...] Skaat {{is one of many}} {{well-known}} singers, both past and present, of Yemenite Jewish heritage—a long line that includes Bracha Zefira, Shoshana Damari, Haim Moshe, Zohar Argov, Ofra Haza, Gali Atari, Dana International, Achinoam Nini (Noa), and many others. [...] However, unlike the music of some Yemenite Jewish singers, there have been generally few hints of the distinctive singing style often associated with that culture in Skaat's music. Although Skaat has said that he has been influenced by Rivka Zohar and he has named Rami Kleinstein and Sarit Hadad as two of his favorite singers, he stated in a February 2010 interview that, [...] "I don't think I [...] ever been influenced by someone in specific. I have always listened to so many different kinds of music. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I have learned from each singer I listened to and still do. From the vigour of the great female singers, through the song interpretation of French performers to the intricate structures of classical music pieces. I find inspiration in them all!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, I am {{not at all}} tired. I {{have not}} quite {{expressed}} what I mean. I don't mean that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a great space of time had gone by, but that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> much had happened--to myself, you know.' ...|$|E

60|$|The way to {{your good}} opinion, favour, and support, {{has been to}} me very pleasing--a path strewn with flowers and cheered with sunshine. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I stood amongst old friends, whom I had intimately known and highly valued. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the deaths of the}} fictitious creatures, in which you have been kind enough to express an interest, had endeared us to each other as real afflictions deepen friendships in actual life; <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been real persons, whose {{fortunes}} we had pursued together in inseparable connexion, and that I had never known them apart from you.|$|E
