5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on {{shot of the}} shower head, the camera had to be {{equipped}} with a long lens. The inner holes on the shower head were blocked and the camera placed a sufficient <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> so that the water, while appearing to be aimed directly at the lens, actually went around and past it.|$|E

50|$|Of all the above, Ulysses is {{the only}} {{spacecraft}} whose orbit takes it large <b>distances</b> <b>away</b> from the ecliptic plane. These deviations from the ecliptic plane allow more precise 3-D measurements of the apparent positions of the GRBs.|$|R
5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne {{arrive on}} the island a short <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but {{declares}} her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from Edward's forces in the south. He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King. He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.|$|E

5|$|Nine {{people and}} al-Balawi {{were killed by}} the blast. Seven were CIA personnel: five officers, {{including}} the chief of the base, and two contractors. One was a Jordanian intelligence officer and another was the Afghan driver. Six other CIA personnel were seriously wounded in the attack, including the deputy chief of Kabul station. Some of those killed had already approached the bomber to search him, whereas others killed were standing some <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> At least 13 intelligence officers were within 50 feet of al-Balawi when the bomb went off.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress {{and delight}} (5, 6, 7, 8), often by including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). Sometimes they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Sometimes {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> (10), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.|$|E
5|$|Route958 {{was first}} {{designated}} among many regional highways in the 1928 mass renumbering of state highways throughout Pennsylvania. The alignment, however {{was only a}} stub designation, connecting the southern terminus of U.S. Route6 (formerly State Route7) to the borough of Wrightsville, only a short <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> The alignment designed in 1928 only remained intact eight years into 1936, when it was extended northward to its current terminus at the New York state line near Bear Lake, Pennsylvania and Niobe, New York in 1936. The alignment has remained unchanged since the 1936 extension.|$|E

50|$|The least common {{category}} {{is an extension}} of agoraphobia, the anxiety of having a panic attack while being in crowds or public places. One manifestation of agoraphobia is the inability to travel long <b>distances</b> <b>away</b> from home.

5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the new course caused more {{pollution}} to flow into the bay near the Ashbridges' land. In 1923, the bay was drained and filled to create industrial land, using fill dredged from the Toronto Harbour. The home which was once next to the shore was now located some <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from the water.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is located}} in the {{approximate}} geographic centre of the city, and is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin's original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the National Gallery, National Museum, National Library, Australian National University and the High Court were built on its shores, and Parliament House is a short <b>distance</b> <b>away.</b> Its surrounds, consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in the lake is uncommon, it is used {{for a wide variety of}} other activities, such as rowing, fishing, and sailing.|$|E
5|$|The {{notes were}} handed to two {{horsemen}} who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed {{just a short}} <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing {{the death of her}} son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.|$|E

50|$|The Hive Fleets of the Tyranids do {{not travel}} through the Warp but instead rely on small Narvhal bio-ships which are capable of {{harnessing}} a planetary system's gravity from immense <b>distances</b> <b>away</b> to create a corridor of compressed-space through which Tyranid vessels can travel towards the system at a swift rate. Whilst slower than proper Warp travel, this method is much more reliable.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 Alfred Kwame Agbeshie, Member of Parliament for Ashaiman {{called for}} the {{building}} of a new parliament house to accommodate the increasing number of parliamentarians in the country. His assertion was {{based on the fact that}} members of parliament sat at <b>distances</b> <b>away</b> from the Speaker, making it difficult for some members to be recognized and allowed to contribute to debates.|$|R
5|$|The {{site of the}} observatory, which {{includes}} the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre and an arboretum, {{is located in the}} civil parish of Lower Withington (the rest being in Goostrey civil parish), near Goostrey and Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, North West England.

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|Cummings {{explored}} the Richardsonian Romanesque mode {{in several of}} his buildings at Russell Sage. The Paine Mansion at 49 Second Street applied the same style, with arcaded entrance loggia and corner tower, to a home. The brick drugstore annex at 155-157 River Street is a particularly representative commercial example of the style. In 1893 the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago popularized the Classical and Renaissance revivals and Beaux-Arts style. They came to Troy very quickly when Marcus Cummings and his son Frederick designed the Classical Revival county courthouse at 80 Second Street, the third to occupy the site, the following year. A short <b>distance</b> <b>away</b> three years later, the Renaissance Revival Hart Memorial Library was built of Vermont marble, joining the similarly styled 1895 Frear Mansion, also on Second Street.|$|E
