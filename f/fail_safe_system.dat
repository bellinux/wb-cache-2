5000|$|Each brake {{reservoir}} stores air at {{a pressure}} of 7 bar and is fed via a {{pressure reducing valve}} off the Main Reservoir Pipe. The driver's brake handle passes control voltages down three wires to each EP control valve, which allows air from the brake reservoir to pass into the brake cylinder, thereby activating the disc brake. The presence of the voltage holds the brakes off, providing a <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{the piston}} tank is the ballast system of choice. These models can become very {{expensive}} to build {{due to the}} complexity of their ballast systems. It {{should also be noted that}} in the event of a loss of radio contact while submerged, the boat will most likely sink to the bottom and require manual retrieval, unless equipped with a <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>system.</b> However, the ability to dive while at a stand still has its advantages, as it can be more precise and scale like than dynamic systems.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version has}} large, {{extremely}} strong magnets on the gondola and the ride {{so that the}} whole ride is within a magnetic force. The ride is lifted to the top mechanically, but then the ride drops {{and then when it}} nears the bottom, slows because the gondola passes over giant sheets of pure aluminum, which magnets can't stick to. While a magnet is not attracted to aluminum,when there is relative motion between the two, the magnet generates eddy currents in thealuminum which causes a retarding force that slows down the falling gondola. This is an extremely <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>system</b> that does not depend on any external force or power.|$|E

Three {{of the major}} advantages of flywheel systems are: longer operational life, higher electrical efficiency, and higher system energy density. The use of composite material flywheels is important to realize these advantages.

50|$|Radiation is a {{carcinogen}} {{and causes}} numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The {{environmental impacts of}} nuclear power plant disasters such as the Chernobyl disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the Three Mile Island accident, among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>systems</b> and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive Plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the properties and possible applications of the „CANopen Safety Chip (CSC) “ in safety related devices. The object being described is a chip, partially certified by TÜV, which has met all {{the requirements of the}} IEC 61508 standard up to SIL 3 (safety integrity level). With the implementation of the CSC in safety related systems, a considerable reduction in costs for development and certification is achieved. Time to market is reduced noticeably. The structures of the CSC and the safety related permanent firmware are described here as well. Examples are shown to demonstrate possible applications. For example, the CSC assumes all control and monitoring functions in simple <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> sensor/actuator <b>systems.</b> In complex devices (such as safety light curtains, drives) it can be integrated as a communication interface. There is a function and data interface available to serve as an interface to the application. This allows the user to access the CANopen functions, safety relevant data and the Object Dictionary. The user-oriented programmability of the CSC facilitates flexible implementation in various application environments...|$|R
40|$|The NA 48 {{experiment}} at the CERN SPS {{measures the}} direct CP violation parameter Re(e 0 =e) in the neutral kaon system with an intended precision of 2 10 4. Thus, the {{data acquisition system}} has to handle peak rates up to 150 MByte/s during a 2. 5 s beam burst and flat rates up to 20 MByte/s during on-line processing. The NA 48 on-line PC farm includes 24 PentiumII- 266 MHz PCs connected via switched fast ethernet network. This farm receives data from the detector systems and performs event building. Afterwards the data are transferred via an optical gigabit ethernet link to the NA 48 central data recording system at CERN computer center. In addition, trigger and checking processes can be applied. The software on the farm is implemented as client/server applications and represents a highly flexible, <b>fail</b> <b>safe,</b> and scalable <b>system.</b> During data taking, in 1999, 100 TByte were collected, processed, and stored by the acquisition system with an overall efficiency of 99 %. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.

5000|$|During {{the filming}} of Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick learned that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe,</b> a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot {{resemblance}} would damage his films box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel Fail-Safe (on which the film is based) is so similar to Red Alert that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court. What worried Kubrick most was that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> boasted acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American President and Walter Matthau as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into <b>Fail</b> <b>Safes</b> production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove: [...] "We started casting. Fonda was already set ... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter the screenwriter was set ...

40|$|The <b>Safe</b> <b>System</b> {{approach}} has been adopted {{by a number of}} global organisations as the best practice approach for delivering road safety. This approach marks a significant change in how road safety is implemented, and the outcomes sought. The <b>Safe</b> <b>System</b> {{approach has}} been adopted by a number of countries, including Australia as the guiding principle for achieving road safety outcomes. This paper presents recent examples from Australia of how the <b>Safe</b> <b>System</b> approach may be implemented, particularly in regards to road infrastructure solutions.

40|$|Abstract: The Main Rotor Hub {{is a very}} {{critical}} component of the helicopter considering that its failure may determine catastrophic consequences for the whole rotorcraft. A complete experimental and numerical analysis is so necessary to certificate the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> and eventually the damage tolerant behavior of the component. In this paper the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> behavior of a composite titanium-graphite Rotor Hub is analyzed. The component, with artificial technological defects, was tested with complex contingent fatigue load in order to cause {{the failure of the}} titanium section. The failure started in proximity of a high stressed area and it propagated quickly in the whole titanium section but without involve the surrounding filament winding graphite, that is a <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> device. The behavior of the hub during the whole test is simulated, with good accuracy, by means of a complete FE model that reproduces also the 3 D propagation of the crack in the titanium section...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis {{of project}} activity: 1998 [...] Awarded cost share grant from DOE. 1 st Qtr 1999 [...] Developed <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> {{lubricating}} <b>system.</b> 2 nd Qtr 1999 [...] Performed first large scale test with nitrile based bearings. It failed due to material swelling. Failure was blamed on improper tolerance. 3 rd Qtr 1999 [...] Material tests were performed with autoclaves and exposure tests to Casa Diablo fluids. Testing of Viton materials began. Alternate bearing designs {{were developed to}} limit risk of improper tolerances. 4 th Qtr 1999 [...] Site testing indicated a chemical attack on the bearing material caused the test failure and not improper bearing tolerance. 1 st Qtr 2000 [...] The assistance of Brookhaven National Laboratory was obtained in evaluating the chemical attack. The National Laboratory also began more elaborate laboratory testing on bearing materials. 2 nd Qtr 2000 [...] Testing indicated Viton was an inappropriate material due to degradation in Casa Diablo fluid. Testing of EPDM began. 3 rd Qtr 2001 [...] EPDM bearings were installed for another large scale test. Bearings failed again due to swelling. Further testing indicated that larger then expected oil concentrations existed in lubricating water geothermal fluid causing bearing failure. 2002 - 2003 [...] Searched for and tested several materials that would survive in hot salt and oil solutions. Kalrez{reg_sign}, Viton{reg_sign}ETP 500 and Viton{reg_sign}GF were identified as possible candidates. 2003 - 2005 [...] Kalrez{reg_sign}has shown superior resistance to downhole conditions at Casa Diablo from among the various materials tested. Viton ETP- 500 indicated a life expectancy of 13 years {{and because it is}} significantly less expensive then Kalrez{reg_sign}, it was selected as the bearing material for future testing. Unfortunately during the laboratory testing period Dupont Chemical chose to stop manufacturing this specific formulation and replaced it with Viton ETP 600 S. The material is available with six different fillers; three based on zinc oxide and three based on silicon oxide. Samples of all six materials have been obtained and are being tested at the National Laboratory in Brookhaven, New York. This new material's properties as a bearing material and its ability to adhere to a bearings shell must be reviewed, but cost information deemed the material to be too expensive to be economical...|$|R
