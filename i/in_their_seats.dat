5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E
5|$|Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, {{also joined}} the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> or bunks). As the cooking was {{performed}} by regular U.S. Army cooks, the cars were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. The cars were also equipped {{with a pair of}} 200-gallon cold water tanks and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed {{in the middle of the}} train so that food could be served from both ends.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the intricacies}} of {{official}} scoring, the winning run excited the packed grandstand mightily, with fans remaining <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and cheering for {{fifteen minutes after the}} game was over, while hundreds of others stormed the Browns' locker room with congratulations.|$|E
25|$|Rice: If {{you knew}} Mike, then believe me, every run he made was an {{unexpected}} bonus. I wasn't daring even to watch. No one {{was allowed to}} move inside the dressing room. Everyone stayed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> as we got closer and closer.|$|E

Bahçeli stated that the MHP was ready to become the main opposition party if such an eventually took place.|$|R
25|$|While {{many people}} burned to death, many others {{died as a}} result of the ensuing chaos. Though most spectators were able to escape the fire, many people were caught up in the hysteria. Witnesses said some simply ran around in circles trying to find their loved ones, rather than trying to escape from the burning tent. Some escaped but ran back inside to look for family members. Others stayed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> until it was too late, {{assuming}} that the fire would be put out promptly.|$|E
25|$|The {{first route}} to be {{introduced}} in 1955 was the 12A from St Marychurch through Babbacombe, Torquay, Paignton and Goodrington to Broadsands. To reach Paignton's sea front at Preston the bus had to pass under a very low railway bridge. A licence for the route was only granted on condition that buses would {{come to a stop}} before passing under the bridge, the conductor would then have to instruct passengers on the top deck to remain <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and then stand {{at the top of the}} stairs to see that they did.|$|E
25|$|The {{passengers}} were left hanging upside-down <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> One mother {{was holding a}} baby that was not strapped in. All on board escaped from the aircraft, with three people needing to be treated in hospital suffering from shock. A number of {{passengers were}} also treated at Lympne. Thirty-six of the passengers continued their journey to London, some with fuel-soaked clothing. The aircraft, with a replacement cost of £250,000, was written off. This was the first Avro 748/HS 748 to be written off in an accident. Skyways Coach-Air leased an Avro 748 from LIAT {{for two years in}} 1968 to replace the aircraft lost.|$|E

25|$|Many {{amusement}} rides provide rotation. A Ferris wheel has {{a horizontal}} central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. As a result, {{at any time}} {{the orientation of the}} gondola is upright (not rotated), just translated. The tip of the translation vector describes a circle. A carousel provides rotation about a vertical axis. Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes. In Chair-O-Planes the rotation about the vertical axis is provided mechanically, while the rotation about the horizontal axis is due to the centripetal force. In roller coaster inversions the rotation about the horizontal axis is one or more full cycles, where inertia keeps people <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
25|$|Barbara Guinn Tidwell is {{the founder}} of the team, and served as their {{director}} and choreographer from their creation in the fall of 1960 to her retirement in the spring of 1997. After high school graduation, she attended Kilgore Junior College where she was a Kilgore College Rangerette. After Kilgore, she and three other Rangerettes chose the University of Southern Mississippi to complete their Bachelor degrees, with Tidwell receiving her degree in history. Tidwell was teaching at Galveston High School in the late 1950's, when she applied for a position at Southwest Texas State hoping to teach history there. The School President, Dr. Jack Flowers, said he wasn’t looking for a history teacher but someone with dance expertise who could create a team to keep fans <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> at halftime.|$|E
25|$|Turner Field {{featured}} multiple premium seating {{areas and}} suites. The SunTrust Club {{was named for}} the bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta and was reserved for official partners and luxury clients of the ballpark. This $6 million addition was completed in 2008 and its 143 premium seats were just 43 feet from home plate, closer than seats in any other MLB ballpark of the era (and closer to home plate than the pitcher's mound). SunTrust Club members also had access to an exclusive club area located under the Hank Aaron Seats (Section 101) that consists of free food and drinks for club members. The club area featured a waitstaff that catered to club members <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> during the games. Members could choose to watch the games from their reserved seats, or from inside the club itself on high definition televisions.|$|E

50|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} Friday 26 February 2016. Fine Gael lost 26 seats; the Labour Party, which lost 30 seats, only just returned enough members to secure speaking rights in Dáil Éireann. Fianna Fáil added 23 seats, Sinn Féin added nine seats and Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit also made gains <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seat</b> numbers. The Social Democrats and Independents 4 Change returned all their elected representatives to the Dáil. Having lost all <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> 2011, the Green Party returned two TDs; these included former Communications Minister Eamon Ryan. The result left Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil with similar seat numbers and brought {{an end to the}} previous government's overall majority.|$|R
25|$|Air Canada Flight 797 was a {{scheduled}} trans-border flight that flew from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Montréal–Dorval International Airport, with an intermediate stop at Toronto Pearson International Airport. On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer {{skin and the}} inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that knocked {{out most of the}} instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers who had yet to evacuate the aircraft. Blood tests showed some of the passengers had inhaled lethal amounts of toxins from the in-flight fire, likely meaning they were already dead <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> before the plane touched down.|$|E
25|$|The Britons having {{returned}} their {{thanks to}} Anarawd, presently fell to work, and Necessity giving edge to their Valour, they easily dispossessed the Saxons {{who were not}} as yet warm <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>Seats.</b> For some time they continued peaceably {{in this part of}} Wales; but Eadred Duke of Mercia, called by the Welch Edryd Wallthir, not being able to bear any longer such an ignominious ejection, made great Preparations for the re-gaining of the said Country. But the Northern Britons, who had settled themselves there, having intelligence of his Design, for the better security of their Cattel and other Effects, moved them beyond the River Conwey. Prince Anarawd in the mean time was not idle, but drawing together all the Strength he could raise, encamped his army near the Town of Conwey at a place called Cymryt, where he and his Men having made gallant Resistance against the pressing Efforts of the Saxons, obtained a very compleat Victory. This Battel was by some called Gwaeth Cymryt Conwey, by reason that it was fought in the Township of Cymryt near Conwey. But Prince Anarawd would have it called Dial Rodri, because he had there revenged the Death of his Father Rodri.|$|E
