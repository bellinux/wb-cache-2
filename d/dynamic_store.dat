Those antigens can be separated using plasma / serum of blood from which RBCs were taken. It is found that those antigens consist of HLA antigens, tissue specific antigens, and foreign antigens.

40|$|There {{has been}} great {{progress}} recently in formally specifying the memory model of microprocessors like ARM and POWER. These specifications are, however, too complicated for reasoning about program behaviors, verifying compilers etc., because they involve microarchitectural details like the reorder buffer (ROB), partial and speculative execution, instruction replay on speculation failure, etc. In this paper we present a new Instantaneous Instruction Execution (I 2 E) framework which allows us to specify weak memory models in the same style as SC and TSO. Each instruction in I 2 E is executed instantaneously and in-order such {{that the state of}} the processor is always correct. The effect of instruction reordering is captured by the way data is moved between the processors and the memory non-deterministically, using three conceptual devices: invalidation buffers, timestamps and <b>dynamic</b> <b>store</b> buffers.

However, the grain size decrease reduces their strain hardening ability and makes UFG materials more susceptible to deformation instability such as shear localization.

An important limitation of the nested logit model is that it assumes that all alternatives at both levels of the nest {{are available in the}} choice set of the consumer. While there is a wide literature on the incorporation of restricted choice sets into the logit model, the logical extension of this analysis to nested restricted choice sets has not been pursued in the literature. In this study we develop a nested consideration model that integrates store choice and brand choice incorporating the formation of dynamic restricted choice sets of both stores and brands. We term the model the nested consideration model and derive the related probabilities in a manner analogous to the well-known nested logit model. In an empirical illustration, we find that the nested consideration model shows better prediction than nested logit models (with the same explanatory variables).

40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} (GA) is a <b>dynamic</b> <b>store</b> of Ca(2 +) {{that can}} be released into the cell cytosol. It can thus participate in the regulation of the Ca(2 +) concentration in the cytosol ([Ca(2 +) ](cyt)), which might be critical for intra-Golgi transport. Secretory pathway Ca(2 +) -ATPase pump type 1 (SPCA 1) is important in Golgi homeostasis of Ca(2 +). The subcellular localization of SPCA 1 appears to be GA specific, although its precise location within the GA is not known. Here, we show that SPCA 1 is mostly excluded from the cores of the Golgi cisternae and is instead located mainly on the lateral rims of Golgi stacks, in tubular noncompact zones that interconnect different Golgi stacks, and within tubular parts of the trans Golgi network, suggesting a role in regulation of the local [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) that is crucial for membrane fusion. SPCA 1 knockdown by RNA interference induces GA fragmentation. These Golgi fragments lack the cis-most and trans-most cisternae and remain within the perinuclear region. This SPCA 1 knockdown inhibits exit of vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein from the GA and delays retrograde redistribution of the GA glycosylation enzymes into the endoplasmic reticulum caused by brefeldin A; however, exit of these enzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum is not affected. Thus, correct SPCA 1 functioning is crucial to intra-Golgi transport and maintenance of the Golgi ribbon...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 + signals, {{produced}} by Ca 2 + release from cellular stores, switch metabolic responses inside cells. In muscle, Ca 2 + sparks locally exhibit the rapid start and {{termination of the}} cell-wide signal. By imaging Ca 2 + inside the store using shifted excitation and emission ratioing of fluorescence, a surprising observation was made: Depletion during sparks or voltage-induced cell-wide release occurs too late, continuing to progress even after the Ca 2 + release channels have closed. This finding indicates that Ca 2 + is released from a “proximate” compartment functionally in between store lumen and cytosol. The presence of a proximate compartment also explains a paradoxical surge in intrastore Ca 2 +, which was recorded upon stimulation of prolonged, cell-wide Ca 2 + release. An intrastore surge upon induction of Ca 2 + release was first reported in subcellular store fractions, where its source was traced to the store buffer, calsequestrin. The present results update the evolving concept, largely due to N. Ikemoto and C. Kang, of calsequestrin as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>store.</b> Given the strategic location and reduction of dimensionality of Ca 2 +-adsorbing linear polymers of calsequestrin, they could deliver Ca 2 + to the open release channels more efficiently than the luminal store solution, thus constituting the proximate compartment.

It is estimated that malaria causes an annual mortality rate of 627, 000. New drugs are urgently required, as the incidence of resistance is spreading rapidly. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins decorate the merozoite surface and several of which, including merozoite surface proteins - 1 and - 2 have previously been shown to be essential for erythrocyte invasion and parasite survival. Plasmodium GPI-anchors contain a glycan core consisting of four mannose residues. Therefore, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of activated mannose, guanidine diphosphomannose pyrophosphorylase (GDP-Man PP) and dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), are thought to be crucial for GPI-anchor biosynthesis and as such potential drug targets. Double homologous recombination has been exploited to test whether PfGDP-Man PP and PfDPMS are essential during the erythrocytic portion of the parasite’s life cycle. Additionally, overexpression parasite lines for both enzymes have been generated and have shown that the regulation of the two enzymes are intricately linked. Focused metabolomics by multi-reaction monitoring of the overexpression lines suggests that the fucosylation pathway may have a novel function within the parasite, possibly as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>store</b> for activated fucose/mannose. In order to determine the cellular concentration of key metabolites within the parasite, the volumes of the intra-erythrocytic stages have been determined and show that the concentration of metabolites in the ring stage parasites is substantially higher than previously thought.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{testing of}} statically pre-deformed {{specimens}} of Ti 6 Al 4 V {{shows that the}} total strain to failure increases {{with the level of}} pre-strain. Furthermore, interrupted and various other dynamic tests on Ti 6 AL 4 V show that the temperature rise prior to localization has only a minor influence on adiabatic shear band (ASB) formation. For all the tests, the calculated dynamic deformation energy until ASB formation is found to be relatively constant. This indicates that adiabatic shear banding is dependent almost solely on dynamic deformation processes, with quasi-static and thermal effects prior to localization being very marginal. We suggest the concept of a constant dynamic mechanical energy (toughness) as a quantitative criterion for ASB formation. Physically, this concept is related to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stored</b> energy of cold work. Adiabatic shear failure is a well know failure mechanism that is uniquely experienced in dynamic loading situations [1, 2]. The homogeneous deformation tends to localize into a narrow band followed by catastrophic failure. Because of the typical short time scales involved, the phenomenon is considered to be adiabatic with large temperature increases, especially inside the band. Many materials fail by adiabatic shear banding, in an uncontrolled manner. A vast body of literature has been dedicated to the material aspects of adiabatic shear failure [1, 2]. A basic criterion has been proposed by Zener and Hollomon [3], stating that ASB is governed by the competition between strain hardening and therma...|$|R
