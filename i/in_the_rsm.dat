Loading and unloading cycles were applied with amplitudes incrementally increasing from 140 to 700 kPa in five steps. A thickness of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> layer of approximately 0. 4 times the footing diameter was found to deliver the minimum total and residual settlements, irrespective {{of the level of}} applied cyclic load. Both the total and residual settlements decrease with increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>RSM</b> layers, regardless of the level of applied cyclic load, but the rate of reduction in both settlements reduces with increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>RSM</b> layers.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{drawbacks}} and limitations when following the basic Taguchi methodology. First, each parameter value requires discrete values. Predicted results are only calculated at these discrete values. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> methodology enables prediction at points not located at dedicated {{values of the}} control parameters. Second, the method discussed assumes that interaction effects between parameters are negligible. A complete DOE screening that evaluates every combination of parameter values has the capability of identifying interaction effects amongst parameters. In many cases this is not feasible given the sheer quantity of test cases required. Often, experimenter knowledge of the overall systems enables intuitive judgments about which effects lend themselves towards interaction.|$|R

However, a critical issue in these applications using high-resolution stereo {{satellite imagery}} {{is to improve the}} accuracy of point geo-positioning. This paper presents a framework for comparison of the performance of the three-dimensional (3 D) geo-positioning of the bias-corrected Rigorous Sensor Models (RSMs) and rational function models (RFMs) with respect to the high-resolution QuickBird stereo images in three spaces (i. e., orbital space, image space and object space). The compared models include a bias-corrected <b>RSM</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orbital space, a bias-corrected <b>RSM</b> and RFM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image space, and a bias-corrected <b>RSM</b> and RFM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> object space. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> comparison, <b>the</b> <b>RSMs</b> and RFMs use the vendor-provided orbit data and Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs), respectively. The experimental results indicated that, (1) these five bias-corrected models can provide a sub-pixel geo-positioning accuracy. With the zero-order polynomial correction model <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orbital space and a minimum of three Ground Control Points (GCPs), the accuracy based on RPCs better than 0. 8 m in horizontal direction and 1. 3 m in vertical direction.

40|$|We {{have found}} {{a new way to}} express the {{solutions}} of <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> (Reynolds Stress Model) equations that allows us to present the turbulent diffusivities for heat, salt and momentum {{in a way that is}} considerably simpler and thus easier to implement than <b>in</b> previous work. <b>The</b> <b>RSM</b> provides <b>the</b> dimensionless mixing efficiencies Gamma-alpha (alpha stands for heat, salt and momentum). However, to compute the diffusivities, one needs additional information, specifically, the dissipation Epsilon. Since a dynamic equation for the latter that includes the physical processes relevant to the ocean is still not available, one must resort to different sources of information outside <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> to obtain a complete Mixing Scheme usable in OGCMs. As for <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> results, we show that the Gamma-alpha s are functions of both Ri and Rq (Richardson number and density ratio representing double diffusion, DD); the Gamma-alpha are different for heat, salt and momentum; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of heat, the traditional value Gamma-h = 0. 2 is valid only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of strong shear (when DD is inoperative) while when shear subsides, NATRE data show that Gamma-h can be three times as large, a result that we reproduce. The salt Gamma-s is given in terms of Gamma-h.

Having tested Gamma-h, we then test the momentum Gamma-m by showing that the turbulent Prandtl number Gamma-m/Gamma-h vs. Ri reproduces the available data quite well. As for the dissipation epsilon, we use different representations, one for the mixed layer (ML), one for the thermocline and one for the ocean;s bottom. For the ML, we adopt a procedure analogous to the one successfully used in PB (planetary boundary layer) studies; for the thermocline, we employ an expression for the variable epsilon/N(exp 2) from studies of the internal gravity waves spectra which includes a latitude dependence; for the ocean bottom, we adopt the enhanced bottom diffusivity expression used by previous authors but with a state of the art internal tidal energy formulation and replace the fixed Gamma-alpha = 0. 2 with <b>the</b> <b>RSM</b> result that brings into the problem the Ri, R-rho dependence of the Gamma-alpha; the unresolved bottom drag, which has thus far been either ignored or modeled with heuristic relations, is modeled using a formalism we previously developed and tested in PBL studies.

The effects of toasting {{time on the}} kinetics of hydrolysis, the resulting molecular weight distribution of 00 -rapeseed meal (RSM) and the soluble and insoluble protein fractions separated from the RSM were studied. Hydrolysis was performed with pancreatic proteases to represent in vitro protein digestibility. Increasing the toasting time of RSM linearly decreased the rate of protein hydrolysis of RSM and the insoluble protein fractions. The extent of hydrolysis was, on average, 44 % higher for the insoluble compared with the soluble protein fraction. In contrast, the rate of protein hydrolysis of the soluble protein fraction was 3 – 9 -fold {{higher than that of}} the insoluble protein fraction. The rate of hydrolysis of the insoluble protein fraction linearly decreased by more than 60 % when comparing the untoasted to the 120 min toasted RSM. Increasing the toasting time elicited the formation of Maillard reaction products (furosine, Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine and Nε-carboxyethyl-lysine) and disulfide bonds in the insoluble protein fraction, which is proposed to explain the reduction in the hydrolysis rate of this fraction. Overall, longer toasting times increased the size of the peptides resulting after hydrolysis of the RSM and the insoluble protein fraction.

This model term has {{significant effect on the}} system compared to other interactions. ANN being a black box model, it does not give such insights of the system directly. Black-box neural network model are allowed to acquire the relationships that exist between important variables and was used to predict the system variables. Except for a small network, it is almost impossible that the models describe <b>the</b> equations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short-term and easily. Subsequently, the practical implementation of artificial neural networks is difficult. Desai et al. [9] found that ANN is equally efficient in sensitivity analysis and interestingly quite comparable to the coefficient of first-order terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quadratic <b>RSM</b> equation.|$|R
