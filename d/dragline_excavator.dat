25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator</b> was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E
25|$|The {{new year}} began with no {{work at the}} {{convention}} center construction site. Mayor Celebrezze ordered city Law Director Ralph S. Locher to order Hunkin-Conkey to begin work in three days or be in default of its completion bond. These demands were communication on December 26 and 27, 1961. The construction company replied with a five-page letter outlining why it could not. William S. Hunsel, a consultant to Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren, advised Hunkin-Conkey to dewater in sections, laying the foundation in sections. But the company refused, as this {{would be much more}} expensive. Implementing a new drainage system was the only solution, company officials said, and it would take four more months to finish the foundation. Hunkin-Conkey's reply was unacceptable to the city, so on January 11 Cleveland Properties Director Harold Lausche sent the bonding firm, Federal Insurance Co., noticed of failure to perform. Defending itself to the insurer, Hunkin-Conkey said its contract required all pumping to be complete before additional excavation could proceed. The company admitted that it had successfully tested a <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator</b> to remove watery soil at the site, but it would need written city approval to use the excavator for the remaining foundation work.|$|E
2500|$|On January 14, 1962, Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren ordered Hunkin-Conkey {{to proceed}} with the {{excavation}} using the <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator.</b> The company was to dig out [...] sections at a time, lay the foundation, and proceed to the next section. Hunkin-Conkey protested that this would be much more expensive, and announced it would seek reimbursement from the city for the added expense. The city said it would go to court to prevent payment. The first section of foundation was ready for pouring on January 15 in the southwest corner of the site.|$|E

2500|$|... 1926 saw further improvements, {{when the}} {{traditional}} use of spades and barrows {{to maintain the}} drains was superseded by a petrol/paraffin <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator,</b> obtained from Priestman Bros. Limited. The Brandon steam engine {{did not last long}} as a standby as it was de-commissioned in April 1927 and finally sold for scrap for Â£25 in 1933. The Lark engine fared better, and although little used, was maintained in working order until 1945. Further consideration was given to upgrading the engines in 1939, but the start of the Second World War delayed implementation. Approval was eventually obtained to install a Crossley [...] engine driving a [...] Gwynne rotary pump, capable of pumping 150 tons per minute in 1941, but it was January 1945 before work was completed. The Lark steam engine was sold for scrap in July, and the engine house converted into a workshop.|$|E

50|$|A series DC motor {{connects the}} {{armature}} and field windings {{in series with}} a common D.C. power source. The motor speed varies as a non-linear function of load torque and armature current; current is common to both the stator and rotor yielding current squared (I^2) behavior. A series motor has very high starting torque and is commonly used for starting high inertia loads, such as trains, elevators or hoists. This speed/torque characteristic is useful in applications such as <b>dragline</b> <b>excavators,</b> where the digging tool moves rapidly when unloaded but slowly when carrying a heavy load.|$|R

He founded the Autonomous Systems laboratory of the CSIRO ICT Centre, and served as Research Director from 2004-2007. From 2005-9 he worked on wireless sensor network technology, was a co-developer of the Fleck wireless sensor node, and investigated applications to environmental monitoring and agriculture, and virtual fencing.He was a senior principal research scientist when he left {{to take up a}} chair at QUT in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Since 1993 we {{have been}} working on the {{automation}} of <b>dragline</b> <b>excavators,</b> the largest earthmoving machines that exist. Recently we completed a large-scale experimental program where the automation system was used for production purposes over a two week period and moved over 200, 000 tonnes of overburden. This is a landmark achievement in the history of automated excavation. In this paper we briefly describe the robotic system and how it works cooperatively with the machine operator. We then describe our methodology for gauging machine performance, analyze results from the production trial and comment on the effectiveness of the system that we have created.

2500|$|Since 1956 {{the company}} {{had been working on}} plans to switch to sub-surface shaft mining. By 1964 new {{technology}} meant that {{it would be possible to}} continue the surface mining to lower levels, although trials with shaft mining received the go-ahead. A trial shaft was completed to [...] by 1965 and to [...] two years later. No sub-surface revenue mining has ever taken place. Eight new 65-tonne ore trucks from Haulpack were delivered in April 1965, along with two <b>dragline</b> <b>excavators</b> and five bores, costing a total of NOK38million. The company continued to purchase more and larger trucks, including eighteen 100-tonne trucks from Lectra Haul between 1968 and 1973, and nine 150-tonne trucks.|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{construction}} equipment is usually used {{due to the}} amounts of material to be moved â up to millions of cubic metres. Earthwork construction was revolutionized {{by the development of}} the (Fresno) scraper and other earth-moving machines such as the loader, the dump truck, the grader, the bulldozer, the backhoe, and the <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1949 {{the plant}} {{produced}} the first <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator.</b> In 1960s the plant designed and manufactured draglines with booms 90-100 m long. Now more than 200 walking draglines are in operation at mines in Siberia and the Far East. One {{third of the}} total coal amount produced by the open casting is mined {{with the help of}} draglines.|$|E
50|$|Between 1894 and 1932, the Nokomai gold miners {{won gold}} worth Â£223,043 from the Sew Hoy Nokomai claim but the running costs {{involved}} were becoming too high. In 1932 The Nokomai Gold Mining Coy Ltd was floated, with capital of over Â£60,000, {{to try a}} revolutionary method of gold production. A giant <b>dragline</b> <b>excavator,</b> weighing 150 tons, was assembled at Nokomai. The largest ever made at that time, the excavator had a 50-foot-high winch tower and a bucket that could hold 8 tons of shingle.|$|E
50|$|The {{quarries}} {{worked by}} creating a long trench (or gullet) through the overburden, along the base of which a tramway could transport the ore. The overburden (often of considerable depth) was excavated and dumped {{on the far side}} of the gullet, so that the next section of ore could be dug out. In this way the trench would gradually migrate across a field, and the reinstated land would be several feet lower than the surrounding fields. The early quaries had moved all the excavated rock by hand, loading it into wheelbarrows and pushing it via planks suspended over the trench, to be dropped on the far side. By the time this quarry was being opened up, probably in the 1920s there were mechanical excavators, and the quarries used ever larger <b>dragline</b> <b>excavators</b> to maximise production with the fewest people employed.|$|R
50|$|The CU Project {{consists}} of three parts: the Falkirk Mine, the Coal Creek Generating Station, and the CU Powerline. A subsidiary of North American Coal Corporation runs the Falkirk Mine, a lignite coal strip mine in North Dakota that covers over twenty-five square miles and uses {{two of the biggest}} <b>dragline</b> <b>excavators</b> ever assembled. The lignite uncovered by the draglines travels by conveyor belt to Coal Creek Station, the largest lignite-fired plant in North Dakota. The Coal Creek Station produces AC current which is converted into DC current at a conversion station. This DC current is transmitted from Coal Creek Station in North Dakota 440 mi to a station near Buffalo, Minnesota where it is converted back into AC current. The powerline crosses 9 western and central Minnesota counties and includes a total of 659 towers placed at one-quarter mile intervals on the property of 476 landowners: primarily corn, wheat, soybean, and sugar beet farms.|$|R
