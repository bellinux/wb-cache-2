Thus, PCoE had to be closed down and all current students were transferred (by the Directorate of Technical Education of the state Government of Maharashtra) to other engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai.

The Federal Office for Risk Assessment (BfR) originally assessed the additive {{in terms of its}} health effects in 2003. Since Natamycin is, due to its effectiveness against fungal infections, also used as an antimycotic in human medicine, the BfR has taken a stand against an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> its application area in order to counteract the potential development resistant pathogens. In November 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) presented a new assessment of the additive. The BfR checked whether the two assessments of its health effects diverged and possibly even partially contradicted each other. The critical point here concerns statements regarding the resistance issue. In its opinion, the EFSA sees the resistance risk arising from Natamycin as negligible. Its statement is expressly restricted to the already regulated use of Natamycin as a food additive. At the time of its opinion in 2003, the BfR was aware of indications that the use of Natamycin in the treatment of patients with fungal infections may cause resistance. Nevertheless, the institute had not voiced any objections against its further use within the regulated domain of food additives. However, the BfR did oppose an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> Natamycin as an additive for surface treatment for other foods such as cured ham at the time.

30|$|Indication {{extension}} {{refers to}} the practice of identifying novel ways of application for an existing drug.

Upon receiving approval for reformulation or new indications, innovator-company can acquire at least 3 -years of market exclusivity (Bhat 2005). In this manner, the innovator-company can gain a distinguishing feature towards the generic competition.

40|$|Khalid Shoumariyeh, Nikolas von BubnoffDepartment of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Abstract: Treatment {{of chronic}} myeloid leukemia (CML) has {{undergone}} {{dramatic changes in}} the last decade. Dissecting the molecular pathways that lead to the development of this disease resulted in the development of targeted therapy against the molecular driver of CML, namely the aberrantly activated tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL 1. By introducing the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib to the treatment repertoire, the natural course of the disease has been dramatically altered and overall survival of patients with CML prolonged substantially. Nevertheless, a significant number of patients are primarily resistant, acquire resistance during the course of their disease, or do not tolerate the intake of imatinib due to adverse effects. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were developed in an attempt to overcome these problems. Dasatinib is a potent oral kinase inhibitor that was originally developed as an Src-kinase inhibitor but exhibited promising potency against BCR-ABL 1 as well. Phase I and II trials demonstrated efficacy in patients failing imatinib, and thus dasatanib was approved in 2006 for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients with chronic-phase CML harboring the BCR-ABL 1 fusion protein. It has since shown promising efficacy and good overall tolerability in subsequent clinical trials, including the Phase III first-line DASISION trial that led to the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> its <b>approval</b> for first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML.

Following initial US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> RAL for treatment of HIV- 1 -infected adults in 2007, an ongoing pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy study in ARV-experienced children and adolescents led to <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> FDA <b>approval</b> to children and adolescents aged 2 – 18 years in 2011. Availability of chewable tablets for children aged 2 – 11 years is a significant advantage, and twice-daily dosing is recommended based on pharmacokinetic parameters. Granules for oral suspension in children 4 weeks to 2 years of age are currently under evaluation and clinical trials in neonates are imminent. Coadministration of RAL and the anti-tuberculosis drug rifampin (RIF) results in reduced RAL exposure. Evaluation of a double RAL dosing strategy in children requiring cotreatment with RIF is planned. RAL is generally well tolerated and has a good overall safety profile. Further data is required for children before RAL can be recommended in first-line ARV treatment regimens. RAL is also under investigation for use in preventing mother-to-child transmission both during pregnancy and in the HIV-exposed neonate. Currently, the main therapeutic role for RAL in children is for treatment failure and multi-drug resistant cases where the inclusion of RAL in combination with optimal background therapy has demonstrated successful outcomes. Increased availability of RAL and the introduction of second-generation integrase inhibitors are likely to further extend the utility of this class of ARV drugs.

The CD 33 antigen is present on 90 % of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} blasts and is shared on normal hemopoietic cells only on the non stem dillerentiating fraction. Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) is an engineered humanized antibody anti-CD 33 conjugated with a potent intercalating agent, named calicheamicin, which is release only at intracellular level (lower pH), following a selective binding to CD 33 -positive cells, thus representing a promising approach for target anti-leukemia therapy. GO was approved conditionally by the Federal Drug Administration in May 2000 as a single therapy for first recurrence of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in a subset of older patients. Since 2000, treatment trials and pilot studies have revealed potential expanded applications along with potential limitations. Phase II trials have confirmed the activity and the efficacy of GO as single agent {{in the treatment of}} relapsed AML. More recently, clinical trials on induction and post-remission treatment of adult AML have shown efficacy of GO in combination chemotherapy.
