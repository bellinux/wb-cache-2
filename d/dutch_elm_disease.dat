5|$|After a 1990 <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> {{outbreak}} in Portland, including one diseased tree at Park and Market in the South Park Blocks, the elm trees have been immunized with Tiabendazole. Portland's first outbreak of <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> occurred in 1976 at Overlook Park, and the peak infections were in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The bark beetle, {{elm leaf beetle}} and the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack elm trees.

The disease has devastated elm trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{full length}} {{mitochondrial}} small subunit ribosomal (mt-rns) gene {{has been characterized}} for Ophiostoma novo-ulmi subspecies americana. The gene was also characterized for Ophiostoma ulmi and a group II intron was noted in the mt-rns gene of O. ulmi. The insertion in the mt-rns gene is at position S 952 {{and it is a}} group IIB 1 intron that encodes a double motif LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease from an open reading frame located within a loop of domain III. Secondary structure models for the mt-rns RNA of O. novo-ulmi subsp. americana and O. ulmi were generated to place the intron {{within the context of the}} ribosomal RNA. The in vivo splicing of the O. ul-mS 952 group II intron was confirmed with reverse transcription-PCR. A survey of 182 strains of <b>Dutch</b> <b>Elm</b> <b>Diseases</b> causing agents showed that the mS 952 intron was absent in what is considered to be the more aggressive species O. novo-ulmi but present in strains of the less aggressive O. ulmi. This observation suggests that the O. ul-mS 952 intron can be used as a PCR-based molecular marker to discriminate between O. ulmi and O. novo-ulmi subsp. americana.

The subfossil elm wood is extremely rare to find and due to the <b>Elm</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>disease,</b> {{it is almost impossible}} to find elm in natural woods of South East Europe in the last 50 -odd years.|$|R

5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, {{which cause}} disease in insects, {{include at least}} 14 species that attack aphids. Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced and used to manage {{a wide variety of}} insect pests {{including}} whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease,</b> and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|E

The common owes its existence {{to the demands of the}} military in the early 19th century for a clear range of fire. The present day common lies parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. Today, the common is a popular recreation ground, and also a venue for a number of annual events, which includes carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals. The common also has a large collection of mature elm trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire, which have escaped <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> owing to their isolation. Other plants include the Canary Island date palms Phoenix canariensis, which are some of the largest in Britain and have produced viable seed in recent years.|$|E

The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> (DED) devastated elms {{throughout}} Europe {{and much}} of North America {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. It derives its name 'Dutch' from the first description of the disease and its cause in the 1920s by the Dutch botanists Bea Schwarz and Christina Johanna Buisman. Owing to its geographical isolation and effective quarantine enforcement, Australia has so far remained unaffected by <b>Dutch</b> <b>Elm</b> <b>Disease,</b> as have the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia in western Canada.|$|E
25|$|This belle époque {{lasted until}} the First World War, when as a {{consequence}} of hostilities, notably in Germany whence at least 40 cultivars originated, and of the outbreak {{at about the same time}} of the early strain of <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease,</b> Ophiostoma ulmi, the elm began its slide into horticultural decline. The devastation caused by the Second World War, and the demise in 1944 of the huge Späth nursery in Berlin, only accelerated the process. The outbreak of the new, three times more virulent, strain of <b>Dutch</b> <b>elm</b> <b>disease</b> Ophiostoma novo-ulmi in the late 1960s brought the tree to its nadir.|$|E
