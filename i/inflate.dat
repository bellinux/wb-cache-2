40|$|In current Western society, {{children}} are often lavished with <b>inflated</b> praise (e. g., "You made an incredibly beautiful drawing!"). <b>Inflated</b> praise is often given {{in an attempt}} to raise children's self-esteem. An experiment (Study 1) and naturalistic study (Study 2) found that adults are especially inclined to give <b>inflated</b> praise to children with low self-esteem. This inclination may backfire, however. <b>Inflated</b> praise might convey to children that they should continue to meet very high standards-a message that might discourage children with low self-esteem from taking on challenges. Another experiment (Study 3) found that <b>inflated</b> praise decreases challenge seeking in children with low self-esteem and has the opposite effect on children with high self-esteem. These findings show that <b>inflated</b> praise, although well intended, may cause children with low self-esteem to avoid crucial learning experiences. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|R

The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to <b>inflate</b> the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator.

40|$|The {{pivotal role}} of <b>inflated</b> {{responsibility}} {{beliefs in the}} maintenance and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been clearly demonstrated (Rachman, 1993; Salkovskis, 1998; Shafran, 1997; van Oppen & Arntz, 1994). Yet {{little is known about}} the origins of these beliefs, their contribution to a sense of <b>inflated</b> responsibility or the symptoms of OCD, or the contribution of personality to <b>inflated</b> responsibility and to OCD, The aims of this thesis were to investigate a model of the inter-relationships among the personality dimensions of neuroticism and psychoticism, <b>inflated</b> responsibility and OCD, and the origins of <b>inflated</b> responsibility to <b>inflated</b> responsibility and to OCD. In order to achieve these aims, a scale was developed to assess the origins of <b>inflated</b> responsibility based upon the five pathways proposed by Salkovskis, Shafran, Rachman, and Freeston (1999) and the additional domains of guilt, vigilance and thought-action fusion (Shafran, Thordarson, & Rachman, 1996; Shafran, Watkins & Charman, 1996; Tallis, 1994). Eighty-four participants with OCD (age M = 43. 36) and 74 control participants (age M = 37. 14) volunteered to participate in the two studies of this thesis. The aim of Study 1 was to develop and validate a measure of the Origins of <b>Inflated</b> Responsibility (OIR). The results of the first study yielded a 25 -ttem scale, the Origins of <b>Inflated</b> Responsibility Questionnaire (OIRQ) with five independent factors: responsibility, strictness, protection from responsibility, critical incidents, and peer blame which demonstrated both internal reliability and temporal stability over a 2 -week period. In Study 2, participants also completed the Responsibility Attitudes Scale (Salkovskis, Wroe, Gledhill, Morrison, Forrester, Richards, ct al. (2000) (a measure of <b>inflated</b> responsibility), the Padua Inventory (Sanavio, 1988) (to measure of the symptoms of OCD) y and the Eysenck Personality Inventory-Revised (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991). Multivariatc Analysis of Variance revealed that the OCD group scored higher on all variables than the control group except for strictness where the groups were not different, and psychoticism where the OCD group scored lower. A series of Multiple Regression analyses revealed that both group and the OIR contributed to <b>inflated</b> responsibility (R 2 =. 56). When all variables, OIR, <b>inflated</b> responsibility and neuroticism were entered as predictors of OCD, 60 % of the variance in OCD was explained however, 49 % of the variance was shared by the independent variables suggesting the presence of some underlying construct. Structural Equation Modelling, where all the constructs in the model were examined simultaneously, revealed that neuroticism contributed to the OIR, <b>inflated</b> responsibility and OCD. The OIR were also significant predictors of <b>inflated</b> responsibility and indirectly through <b>inflated</b> responsibility predictive of OCD. The OIR also directly predicted OCD and when the total effects are considered, their contribution was greater than the total effect for <b>inflated</b> responsibility alone. The results of these studies provide good support for the origins of <b>inflated</b> responsibility proposed by Salkovskis et al. (1999), as measured by the OIRQ developed for use in the current thesis. The results also support the contribution of <b>inflated</b> responsibility and neuroticism, as well as the OIR, to OCD, The large amount of variance shared by the OIR, <b>inflated</b> responsibility and neuroticism suggest that there might be some underlying construct, perhaps of a biopsychosocial nature, that requires further investigation for its role in the onset and maintenance of OCD. The clinical relevance of these findings is discussed in terms of early prevention strategies and interventions...|$|R

5|$|Cleveland's {{enduring}} {{reputation as}} chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York. Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party—silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago. For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver to <b>inflate</b> the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may <b>inflate</b> the actual numbers of cats.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 863, Umar struck again, joining forces with the Abbasid general Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat (probably the {{governor}} of Tarsus) for a successful raid into Cappadocia.

There, the Tarsian army returned home, but Umar obtained Ja'far's leave to press on into Asia Minor. Umar's forces represented {{the bulk of his}} emirate's strength, but their size is unknown: the contemporary Muslim historian Ya'qubi claims that Umar had 8,000 men at his disposal, while the Byzantine historians Genesius and Theophanes Continuatus <b>inflate</b> the numbers of the Arab army to 40,000 men. The Byzantinist John Haldon considers the former number to be closer to reality, and estimates the size of the combined Arab force at 15,000–20,000 men. It is likely that a Paulician contingent under Karbeas was present as well.|$|E
40|$|Stars {{close to}} the Eddington {{luminosity}} can have large low-density <b>inflated</b> envelopes.

If the shock breakout occurs in such <b>inflated</b> envelopes, the shock breakout signals diffuse in them, and their rise time can be significantly extended.
