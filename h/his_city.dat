5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to <b>his</b> <b>city</b> and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose <b>his</b> <b>city</b> to the Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|Mari's revenge: According to Alfonso Archi and Maria Biga, the {{destruction}} happened approximately {{three or four}} years after the battle of Terqa.

5|$|The Western Xia met {{a similar}} fate, {{becoming}} an unreliable vassal to the Mongols by seeking to secure alliances with Jin and Song.

5|$|A bronze {{column in}} the shape of {{intertwined}} snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, acquired in the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims.

He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{into the}} 1960s, Marcus became ever more {{convinced}} that <b>his</b> <b>city</b> {{and his company}} needed {{to take action to}} promote racial equality, both as a moral issue and to reduce the growing civil unrest.

Metrovision, the area's economic development chamber, stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing suites, season tickets and club seating from businesses to the extent that there was a waiting list for suites. Also a relocation to St. Louis, under the same conditions as with Laurie, was considered.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past.

5|$|Spartan {{citizens}} used helots, {{a dependent}} group collectively {{owned by the}} state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when <b>his</b> <b>city</b> was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.|$|E
5|$|Starr {{released}} the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, {{coinciding with the}} start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about <b>his</b> <b>city</b> of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.|$|E

5|$|When Abdi-Milkutti {{ascended to}} Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was {{captured}} and beheaded in 677BC after a three-year siege, while <b>his</b> <b>city</b> was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon {{was stripped of}} its territory, which was awarded to BaalI, the king of rival Tyre and loyal vassal to Esarhaddon.

Alan refuses {{to believe that he}} is {{trapping}} himself, but soon faces a monstrosity of several televisions, with the irrational Alan on them that tries to kill him. Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.|$|E
5|$|Both the Puranas and the Ramayana {{feature the}} half-blood {{siblings}} of Kubera. Vishrava, Kubera's father, also married the Rakshasa (demon) princess Kaikesi, who mothered four Rakshasa children: Ravana, the chief antagonist of the Ramayana, Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana and Soorpanaka. The Mahabharata regards Vishrava as {{the brother of}} Kubera, so Kubera is described as the uncle of Ravana and his siblings. It records that when Kubera approached Brahma for the favour of superseding his father Pulastya, Pulastya created Vishrava. To seek the favour of Vishrava, Kubera sent three women to him, by whom Vishrava begot his demon children. Ravana, after acquiring a boon of Brahma, drove Kubera away from Lanka and seized his Pushpaka Vimana, which was returned to Kubera after Ravana's death. Kubera then settled on Gandhamandana mountain, near Mount Kailash — the cosmological abode of the god Shiva—in the Himalayas. Sometimes, Kailash itself is called Kubera's residence. <b>His</b> <b>city</b> is usually called Alaka or Alaka-puri ("curl-city"), but also Prabha ("splendour"), Vasudhara ("bejeweled") and Vasu-sthali ("abode of treasures"). There, Kubera had a grove called Caitraratha, where the leaves were jewels and the fruits were girls of heaven. There is also a charming lake called Nalini in the grove. Kubera {{is often described as}} a friend of Shiva in the epics. The Padma Purana says that Kubera prayed to Shiva for many years, and Shiva granted him the kingship of Yakshas.|$|E
