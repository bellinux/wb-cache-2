5|$|The Third Fleet's {{operations}} in the South China Sea were highly successful. It destroyed {{a large number of}} Japanese ships and aircraft, while losing relatively few of its own aircraft. Historians have judged the destruction of Japanese cargo vessels and oil tankers to have been the most important result of the raid. Subsequent attacks by Allied aircraft and warships forced the Japanese to cease sending ships <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea from April 1945.|$|E

5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest {{due to a}} strong subtropical ridge located {{to the north of}} the system. A few hours later, the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55km/h (35mph 1-minute winds). After being over land for most of July31, the depression relocated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300km (185mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a few hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24km/h (15mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea. By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95km/h (60mph 10-minute winds). By the morning of August2, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, and a few hours later, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin, {{armed with}} heavy {{anti-aircraft}} batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during {{air strikes against}} Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations.

5|$|A {{few hours}} after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the {{depression}} made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00UTC on August3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August5.|$|E

5|$|A typhoon {{approached}} eastern Luzon on September 16, {{and moved}} across the island on the next day. In the municipality of Baler on the east coast, a minimum pressure of 969 mbar (28.63 inHg) was recorded. The typhoon's eye passed over and nearly destroyed the town. A tornado spawned by the typhoon hit Metro Manila. The typhoon progressed westward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, later curving to the northwest and entering the Gulf of Tonkin near the island of Hainan. After the storm, the Philippine government provided aid to residents.|$|E

Heavy damage occurred along the path, and several boats were wrecked in Capiz, resulting in several fatalities. The island of Mindoro lost communications with Manila during the storm. Shifting to the west-northwest, the storm moved ashore eastern Vietnam on October 8 near Danang. Another typhoon followed a similar path, originating near Guam on October4 and progressing westward. Five days later, the storm struck the Philippine province of Camarines Norte, causing damage {{as it moved}} westward through Luzon.

5|$|After the Treaty of Paris, the British {{government}} sought stronger {{ties with}} China. William Amherst, the diplomat chosen {{to inform the}} emperor of the peace in Europe and to offer Britain's friendship, specifically requested Maxwell and Alceste to accompany him. Maxwell, without a ship since HMS Daedalus was wrecked three years before, commissioned Alceste {{at the beginning of}} 1816. The journey out was uneventful; Alceste left Spithead for China on 9 February with Amherst aboard, and after stopping at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, Anyer, and Batavia, sailed through the Bangka Strait <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea. After calling to pay respects at Canton, Alceste transited the Straits of Formosa and hove-to in the Bohai Sea on 28 July. There she met the 10-gun brig-sloop, Lyra, despatched earlier to herald the arrival of Britain's ambassador.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} August 19, a {{tropical}} cyclone was near {{and south of}} Guam. Its track curved from the west-northwest to the north, drifting at times west of the Marianas Islands. The typhoon turned to the northwest, and was nearing the Ryukyu Islands on August 27. Turning westward and later to the west-southwest, the storm moved across Taiwan moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea. The typhoon moved ashore southern China in Guangdong on or after August 30 {{to the west of}} Hong Kong. In the province, the typhoon and its accompanying waves killed 5,000 people. More than 20,000 homes were damaged, and around 400 boats were wrecked, estimated at US$1 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The panelling was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently this room was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. The Latch porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for nearly twenty years, before being returned by Charles Evans to Upper Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E

Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 millibars.|$|E
5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E
