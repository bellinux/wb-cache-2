50|$|Drug {{release from}} bulk <b>eroding</b> {{polymers}} {{is difficult to}} characterize because the primary mode of release from these polymers is diffusion. Unlike surface <b>eroding</b> polymers, bulk <b>eroding</b> polymers show a very weak relationship between the rate of polymer degradation {{and the rate of}} drug release. Therefore, the development of surface <b>eroding</b> polyanhydrides incorporated into the bulk <b>eroding</b> polymers is of increased importance.|$|R
5000|$|Hole-in-the-Rock is {{a series}} of {{openings}} (tafoni) <b>eroded</b> in a small hill composed of bare red arkosic conglomeritic sandstone.

5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of <b>Erode</b> Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in <b>Erode.</b> When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{an area of}} erosion soils {{developed}} in Timis county of North - East of Timisoara. Soil erosion phenomenon intensity over the field of Ianova area is controlled by environment factors: relief, climate (rainfall intensity and runoff), vegetation, lithological substratum and human activity. Slope erosion state on erosion classes show {{that more than half}} of slope lands are affected by moderate and strong erosion. Ecopedological indicators of chemical soil characterization present lower values while erosion degree progresses. Thus, humus cantity progressively comes down from soil weak <b>eroded</b> (3, 90 - 2, 82 %) to soil excessive <b>eroded</b> (1, 14 %- 1, 11 %). Nitrogen content expressed through nitrogen indicator has medium values (1, 86 - 3, 04) for weak and moderate <b>eroded</b> soils and small values (0, 96 - 0, 21) for excessive <b>eroded</b> soils. Potassium content substantially comes down from weak <b>eroded</b> soils (180 ppm) till to those excessive <b>eroded</b> (132 ppm). Phosphorus content has small values for all <b>eroded</b> soils (4, 70 - 2, 68 ppm). For <b>eroded</b> fields of Ianova area we propose: antierosional developments, agropedoimprovement works, antierosional agrotechnical works...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{circumferentially}} local wall thinning on {{the fracture}} behavior of pipes were investigated by monotonic four-point bending. Local wall thinning was machined on the pipes {{in order to}} simulate erosion/corrosion metal loss. The configurations of the <b>eroded</b> area included an <b>eroded</b> ratio of d/t = 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 6, and 0. 8, and an <b>eroded</b> length of l = 10 mm, 25 mm, and 120 mm. Fracture type could be classified into ovalization, local buckling, and crack initiation depending on the <b>eroded</b> length and <b>eroded</b> ratio. Three-dimensional elasto-plastic analyses were also carried out using the finite element method, which is able to accurately simulate fracture behaviors excepting failure due to cracking.

40|$|Patches with a diatom mat were {{compared}} with adjacent <b>eroded</b> patches on an intertidal flat in the Ems-Dollard estuary. Distinction between patches was {{made on the basis}} of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration and relief. Short-term variations and depth distribution were investigated for carbohydrates (water-soluble and water-insoluble carbohydrates), beta-glucosidase activity and heterotrophic bacterial production and abundance. The major differences between mat patches and <b>eroded</b> patches were confined to the upper 6 mm, From 6 to 20 mm depth variables in mat patches and <b>eroded</b> patches were roughly comparable, with the exception of the bacterial abundance and beta-glucosidase activity. Distinct increases in carbohydrates, bacterial production and abundance during tidal flat exposure were most pronounced in the mat surface layer, but were still detectable in the <b>eroded</b> patches for the different carbohydrate fractions. Concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates were substantially higher in mars than in <b>eroded</b> patches, This concurred with a much higher bacterial production and abundance in mats than in <b>eroded</b> patches. The beta-glucosidase activity in the mat surface was low compared to this activity in <b>eroded</b> patches. In diatom mats, beta-glucosidase showed highest activities between 6 and 12 mm, while in <b>eroded</b> patches this maximum occurred at 0 - 2 mm, Patterns suggest inhibition of the beta-glucosidase activity at high concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations and a release of inhibition with declining carbohydrate concentrations. Interestingly, concentrations of water-insoluble carbohydrates (EDTA-extracted carbohydrates) did neither clearly differ between mat patches and <b>eroded</b> patches, nor changed substantially with depth. The observation that water-insoluble carbohydrate-to-chl-a ratios were higher outside the mat layer than in the mat, which has a larger stability than <b>eroded</b> patches, indicates that it is a poor index for sediment erodibility. The same holds true for water- soluble carbohydrate concentrations. [KEYWORDS: Deep-sea sediments; cohesive sediments; epipelic diatoms; chlorophyll; erodibility; rates...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist.

40|$|The biota’s {{state of}} the {{ordinary}} chernozem located in the southern zone of the Republic of Moldova has been investigated. Arable chernozems with different degrees of erosion (slightly, moderately and severely <b>eroded)</b> have been compared to the chernozem with the normal profile and <b>eroded</b> soil which was under 58 year’s old fallow. The biological degradation of soils occurred {{as a result of}} water erosion processes. The parameters of the biota very depending on the erosion degree and decrease in the following sequence: chernozem with the normal profile → slightly <b>eroded</b> chernozem → moderately <b>eroded</b> chernozem → severely <b>eroded</b> chernozem. Losses of microbial carbon amount to 107 - 248, 305 - 433 and 513 - 535 kg C ha- 1 according to the erosion degree. The loss of species and families of invertebrates in moderately and severely <b>eroded</b> chernozems is of 63 - 100 %. Diversity of the Bacillus family decreased from 14 species to 7 - 10 species. The decline of enzymes activities in moderately and severely <b>eroded</b> chernozems reaches 29. 2 - 55. 6 % for dehydrogenase and 85. 7 - 94. 3 % for urease. A scale of biological parameters has been proposed to assess the stability of biota of the ordinary chernozem and to develop the national soil quality standards. The recovery rate of the biota and fertility of <b>eroded</b> arable chernozems that moved to the category of fallow soils has been determined. In this context, the management of fallow land areas has been recommended aiming to regenerate the edaphic fauna and microorganisms and to restore the natural quality of <b>eroded</b> chernozems...|$|R
40|$|Estimations of rainfall-induced {{soil erosion}} are mostly {{derived from the}} weight of {{sediment}} measured in natural runoff.

The volume of <b>eroded</b> soil is easier to calculate visually using popular imaging tools, which can aid in estimating the transport distance of <b>eroded</b> soil through geometry relationships. In this study, we present a straightforward geometry model to predict the maximum sediment transport distance incurred by rainfall events of various intensity and duration. In order to verify our geometry prediction model, a series of experiments are reported {{in the form of}} a sediment volume. The results show that cumulative rainfall has a linear relationship with the total volume of <b>eroded</b> soil.
