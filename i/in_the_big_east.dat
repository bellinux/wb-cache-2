5|$|The Big East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year {{award is}} given to the men's {{basketball}} player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference voted as the top performer by the conference coaches. It was first awarded {{at the end of the}} league's inaugural season of 1979–80.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{sports teams}} {{are called the}} Pirates. They {{participate}} in the NCAA's Division I and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference. The college established its first basketball squad in 1903. Seton Hall canceled football (which was played in Division III) in 1982.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2013–14 Big East season, Dunham was named to the All-Big East Second Team. Despite his improvements, Butler had a lackluster season, finishing with a 14–17 overall record and bowing out to Seton Hall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Tournament. Dunham finished the season seventh <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> in scoring with a 16.4 points per game average to go along with 4 rebounds per game. Dunham shot 39 percent from the field and 35.5 from 3-point range. He hit a 3-pointer in 29 of the team's 31 games. After the season, he teamed up with several college players to participate in Athletes in Action's summer trip to the Philippines. Athletes in Action is a Christian group that helps athletes use sports for spiritual growth.|$|E
50|$|The Cardinals {{also won}} {{back-to-back}} championships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East's</b> final {{season as a}} conference, an achievement few teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conference had.|$|R

5|$|Defensive end Connor Barwin led the Bearcats' {{defense in}} sacks with 11, {{a figure that}} also was the highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> and No.14 nationally. He {{finished}} the regular season with 48tackles, a figure that included the 11sacks. In recognition of his performance, he was named a first-team All-Big East selection, signifying his status as the best player at his position in the conference.|$|E
5|$|During the 2003 college {{football}} season, Virginia Tech accumulated an 8–4 regular-season record that included four {{losses in the}} Hokies' final sixregular-season games. As the third-place team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference, Tech accepted a bid to the 2003 Insight Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the California Golden Bears, who went 7–6 during the regular season, tying for third place in the Pacific-10 (Pac-10).|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} games {{following}} {{the loss to}} Syracuse, Tech lost two, taking it to a final regular-season record of 9–4 overall and a Big East conference record of 3–4, meaning Tech was the fourth ranked team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> that season. Prior to the season, the Big East had {{signed an agreement with}} the new San Francisco Bowl, giving that bowl the fifth pick of bowl-eligible teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East.</b> But with the Gator Bowl (second pick of Big East teams) selecting Notre Dame instead of a Big East team, all the Big East's selections were pushed back one slot. Second-place West Virginia University was pushed to the Continental Tire Bowl (third pick) and third-place Pittsburgh was selected by the Insight Bowl (fourth pick), leaving Virginia Tech to be selected by the San Francisco Bowl with the fifth pick.|$|E
50|$|Outside of basketball, Dixon {{has been}} {{credited}} with a peripheral role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East's</b> decision to invite TCU to become the conference's 17th member. Specifically, he suggested to TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte that <b>the</b> school pursue <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> membership during a conversation at the 2010 TCU-Baylor football game. TCU would end up going to <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> 12 Conference instead.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Hoyas {{finished}} <b>in</b> {{first place}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Easts</b> regular season, <b>the</b> second time <b>in</b> three seasons and {{fourth time in}} school history that they had finished in first or tied for first. They won <b>the</b> 1989 <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Tournament, defeating fifth-ranked Syracuse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final for <b>the</b> sixth <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Tournament championship in Georgetown history. Charles Smith averaged 22 points per game over the Hoyas three tournament games.|$|R

5|$|McNamara's career {{came to an}} unceremonious end in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament. Severely hobbled by his leg injury and {{exhausted}} from the run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> tournament, he scored only two points in just 23 minutes of play as fifth-seeded Syracuse was upset by Texas A University. It marked the only game in his career McNamara was held without a field goal. The Orange finished with a 23-12 record.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} player for Cincinnati, however, was punter Kevin Huber, {{who was named}} an Associated Press All-American {{and became the first}} player in Bearcats history to earn that honor in two {{consecutive}} years. Thanks to Huber's performance during the regular season, Cincinnati led the country in punting average (41.5yards per kick) and was No.1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|The school's 19 varsity men's and women's {{sports teams}} {{are called the}} Friars, after the Dominican Catholic order that runs the school. They are the only collegiate team to use the name. All teams {{participate}} in the NCAA Division I and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference, except for the men's and women's ice hockey programs, which compete in Hockey East. In 2015, the men's hockey team won its first NCAA Division I National Championship.|$|E
25|$|In response, West Virginia filed {{a lawsuit}} to declare invalid the withdrawal-notice {{requirement}} stipulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East's</b> bylaws. <b>The</b> lawsuit alleged that <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> breached its fiduciary duty by allowing several football-playing members to depart, causing the conference to {{no longer be a}} major football conference and jeopardizing its continued existence. Because of this, West Virginia alleged, its continued performance under the contract had become unreasonably burdensome and its original purpose <b>in</b> entering into <b>the</b> contract had been eliminated.|$|R
50|$|As of July 1, 2013, USF {{became a}} member of the American Athletic Conference, the result of a split <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old <b>Big</b> <b>East.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 2011-2014, Seton Hall {{had four}} {{straight}} 30-win seasons, including {{a high of}} 39 in 2014, its first year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference.|$|R
5|$|UConn played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference {{since the}} 1982-83 season, {{the first to}} hold a women's {{basketball}} tournament; they won 18 tournaments in 31 years. Since 2013-14 UConn plays in the American Athletic Conference, where they are still unbeaten both in regular season and conference tournament games, having won all 4 conference tournaments held.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's defense, which {{performed}} {{well in the}} beginning of the season and against No.3 Miami, faltered in the final games of the regular season, allowing 123points and over 1,800yards to opponents' offenses. Despite a poor performance when compared with previous seasons' accomplishments, Virginia Tech still ranked second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> conference in total defense, scoring defense, and quarterback sacks.|$|E
5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} season because of surgery to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among the worst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. As the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{four of the}} six UC fall {{sports teams}} {{improved}} their finish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> conference standings over that of Fall 2005. The Bearcat teams collectively posted an improvement of three places. UC's men's soccer team became the first Bearcat squad to claim a <b>BIG</b> <b>East</b> title, winning <b>the</b> Red Division of the league's regular season race. Most recently, football won <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Championship <b>in</b> 2008, 2009, and 2011 and women's volleyball won <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> regular season title <b>in</b> 2010 and <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> tournament <b>in</b> 2011.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> football, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> entered {{competition}} as {{a conference in}} 1991, after inviting five football colleges to become members of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East,</b> joining three teams from <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> whose football teams were competing as Division I independents (Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse) {{to form a new}} Division I football league. The strength of this league earned <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> an automatic berth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bowl Championship Series, when that series was created <b>in</b> 1998. <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> won two national football championships, both by University of Miami. Between 2005 and 2012, four of the more succesful football schools left <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> for other conferences, starting a process that led to a complete realignment of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> <b>in</b> 2013.|$|R
50|$|After the {{addition}} of Maryland and Rutgers into <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Ten, <b>the</b> subsequent geographical realignment placed Indiana and Michigan State <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Ten <b>East,</b> assuring that the rivalry will be renewed annually.|$|R
5|$|Before the Orange Bowl, Cincinnati {{was ranked}} 50th (of 119 Division I FBS teams) in total offense. The team was ranked 24th in passing offense, {{with the five}} quarterbacks pressed into service during the season {{averaging}} 254.1 passing yards per game. By {{the end of the}} season, Tony Pike emerged as Cincinnati's sole starting quarterback. He finished the regular season having completed 183 of 291 pass attempts for 2,168 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions. He ranked second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> and 29th nationally in passing efficiency with a passer rating of 141.07.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 San Francisco Bowl was {{the final}} collegiate game of Tech running back Lee Suggs, whose twotouchdowns allowed him to finish his collegiate career with 336points, the second-most career points scored by a player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East.</b> Suggs also {{extended}} his NCAA-record streak of consecutive games with a rushing touchdown to 27. That record still stands today. Suggs finished the game with 19carries for 70rushing yards and two touchdowns. Tech wide receiver Ernest Wilford, who caught fivepasses for 50yards, set {{what was then a}} school record for receptions in a season with 51. This broke the record of 46, set by Mike Burnop in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Georgetown Hoyas are the {{athletics}} {{teams that}} officially represent Georgetown University in college sports. Part of the NCAA's Division I, the Hoyas field 23 varsity level sports teams, {{most of which}} participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference, {{with the exception of}} the Division I FCS Patriot League in football. In late 2012, Georgetown and six other Catholic, non-FBS schools announced that they were departing the Big East for a new conference. The rowing and sailing teams also participate in east coast conferences. The men's basketball team is the school's most famous and most successful program, but Hoyas have achieved success in a wide range of sports.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton {{was named}} ACC Coach of the Year on March 10, 2009, {{and a second}} time in 2012. Hamilton is the first coach to be named coach of <b>the</b> year <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> and ACC.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> {{agreed to}} accept Virginia Tech {{as a full}} member in all sports. Virginia Tech {{ultimately}} paid $8.3 million to join the conference, $1.1 million of which was actually paid after the school left.|$|R
50|$|The Cardinals made {{appearances}} <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Tournament and <b>the</b> NCAA Tournament. They {{finished the}} season ranked sixth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Coaches Poll and thirteenth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AP Poll. At {{the conclusion of}} the season, the team graduated three seniors.|$|R
5|$|The Huskies entered 2008 {{seeking to}} prove their success the {{previous}} season was no fluke. In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-championship, albeit after losing to their fellow co-champion, West Virginia, 66–21. A loss to Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl—the team's second bowl appearance all-time—gave the Huskies a final 2007 record of 9–4. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 1995 season after having {{finished}} with an 84 overall record in 1994. That season culminated with a 4523 loss to Tennessee in the 1994 Gator Bowl. Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech {{to improve on}} its previous performance. Most commentators, however, expected a season comparable to 1994's: a second-place finish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> {{and a trip to}} the Gator Bowl. This was borne out by the preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 2004 college {{football}} season having gone 8–5 in 2003, culminating with a 52–49 loss to California in the 2003 Insight Bowl. The 2003 season {{had also been}} Virginia Tech's final year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> Conference, and Tech began the new season in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Tech started the season unranked {{for the first time}} since 1998, and was picked to finish sixth (out of 11 ACC teams) in the annual ACC preseason poll, held in July.|$|E
25|$|Providence Friars and Villanova Wildcats — The two {{smallest}} schools <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> battle each year. The rivalry is also elevated by the Catholic orders which run the schools; Providence's Dominicans and Villanova's Augustinians.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 game marked <b>the</b> {{last time}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{foreseeable}} future that <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> 10 was represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bowl game. A four-year contract was signed so that starting <b>in</b> 2010 <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> {{will send a}} team to the bowl instead.|$|R
50|$|During another {{phase of}} {{realignment}} in 2005, three schools (Boston College, Miami-FL and Virginia Tech) jumped from <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> to <b>the</b> ACC, and Temple also left the conference (before eventually returning <b>in</b> 2013). <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>East</b> responded by adding former basketball-only member Connecticut and three schools from C-USA.|$|R
