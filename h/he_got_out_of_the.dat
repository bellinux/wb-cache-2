25|$|Bud Moore Engineering took {{a three-year}} hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the No. 15 Ford to a 26th-place finish at Riverside. LeeRoy Yarbrough, Dick Brooks, and Donnie Allison also drove that year. In 1973, Bobby Isaac climbed {{on board with}} Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten {{finishes}} until the Talladega 500, when he radioed in to Moore {{and told him he}} was quitting. When <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named Darrell Waltrip, who had a top-ten at Darlington Raceway.|$|E
25|$|At 1:08p.m. PDT, {{approximately}} {{seven hours}} after the rapes, Mixon's burgundy 1995 Buick sedan was pulled over by two motorcycle officers, Officer John Hege and Sergeant Mark Dunakin, for a traffic violation, in the 7400 block of MacArthur Boulevard in East Oakland, one block away from Eastmont Town Center and an Oakland Police Department substation. After collecting Mixon's driver's license, Sergeant Dunakin became suspicious that the license was fake and signaled to his partner, Officer Hege, to arrest Mixon. Mixon accessed a semiautomatic pistol, leaned out of the vehicle's side window, and opened fire without warning, methodically shooting both officers twice. After the officers collapsed to the ground, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, approached them, and fired execution-style directly into their backs. He then briefly remained standing over the bodies before fleeing on foot. Those who heard the gunshots reported Mixon as having fired six shots. Neither officer was able to return fire. Mixon was last seen fleeing westward into the surrounding neighborhood on 74th Avenue southbound.|$|E
500|$|Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and {{frontman}} Pete Shelley {{have both}} been credited with suggesting the band name [...] "Stiff Kittens", but settled on [...] "Warsaw" [...] shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song [...] "Warszawa". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, they sped off.|$|E

2500|$|A BBC Inside Story episode, [...] "Chappaquiddick," [...] {{broadcast}} on the 25th {{anniversary of the}} death of Mary Jo Kopechne, advanced a theory that Kennedy and Kopechne had gone out from the party in Kennedy's car, but when Kennedy saw an off-duty policeman in his patrol car, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, fearing the political consequences of being discovered by the police late at night with an attractive woman. According to the theory, Kennedy then returned to the party, and Kopechne, unfamiliar both with the large car and the local area, drove the wrong way and crashed off the bridge. The episode argued that the explanation would account for Kennedy's lack of concern the next morning, as he was unaware of the crash, and for the forensic evidence of the injuries to Kopechne being inconsistent with her sitting in the passenger seat.|$|E

2500|$|On Thursday, April 30, 1998, around 3:00p.m., Jones {{parked his}} dark gray Toyota pickup truck on the {{transition}} loop from the Harbor Freeway to the Century Freeway in Los Angeles (...) [...] Jones {{sat in the}} front of his truck with his pet dog Gladdis, a seven-year-old Labrador-whippet mixed-breed. Jones began pointing a loaded shotgun at passing cars on the freeway, causing motorists to report him to the police. Jones himself then called 9-1-1, revealing he was emotionally distraught about HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations) and the circumstances surrounding his HIV. Jones said he was in pain due to mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed. As was confirmed later, aside from being HIV-positive, Jones also suffered from cancer. During the call, he fired off several rounds from his shotgun, with one of them going through the roof of his truck. Authorities then closed the two freeways, preventing anyone from approaching him. Jones remained in his truck the entire time, as police helicopters monitored his movements. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Weapons Team began to assemble and got into position around him. Jones then reached into a backpack he owned and took out clothing and a videotape. He then began throwing the items over the freeway wall. Afterwards, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truck and walked across the empty freeway.|$|E

2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car and went through that door.|$|E
