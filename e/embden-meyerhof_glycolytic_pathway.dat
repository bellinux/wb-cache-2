40|$|<b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>glycolytic</b> <b>pathway</b> and Gluconeogenesis Glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) is {{the most}} common {{sequence}} of reactions for the conversion of glucose- 6 -P into pyruvate in all domains of life. It generates ATP, reduced equivalents, and precursor metabolites for a multitude of essential cellular processes. During growth on substrates other then hexoses, essential glycolytic intermediates are synthesized via glyconeogenesis, reversion of EMP. While Glycolysis and glyconeogenesis are well-conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes, Archaea have developed unique variants of these pathways, presented in a separate subsystem. Striking examples of unique features of glycolytic pathways in archaea include: zero or very low ATP yields; reduction of ferredoxin rather than NADH; many unusual glycolytic enzymes, including ADP-dependent gluco- and phosphofructo- kinases, non-orthologous PGMs, FBAs, non-phosphorylating GAP dehydrogenases, etc. Notably, less variation is observed in glyconeogenic than in glycolytic enzymes. This may reflect the independent evolution of catabolic branches in bacteria and archaea diverging from originally glyconeogenic EMP pathway (refs. 2, 5).

The O 2 -stimulated uptake activity was lost rapidly (> 70 % in 5 h) when cell suspensions were incubated aerobically, but this loss was prevented {{by the addition}} of crude catalase. Catalase had no apparent effect on cell viability during these incubations. Glucose uptake activity was strongly inhibited by a 10 -fold excess of mannose or galactose but not by methyl-α-d-glucoside, fructose, or lactose. Both glucose and mannose were rapidly incorporated into polyglucose after uptake.

Both species grew faster on glucose than on starch or maltose. The fermentation end product ratios were altered based on higher ethanol and lactate yields on starch than on glucose. In C. thermohydrosulfuricum, glucoamylase, pullulanase, and maltase were mainly responsible for conversion of starch and maltose into glucose, which was accumulated by a putative glucose permease. In C. thermosulfurogenes, beta-amylase was {{primarily responsible for}} degradation of starch to maltose, which was accumulated by a putative maltose permease and then hydrolyzed by glucoamylase. Regardless of the growth substrate, the rates of glucose, maltose, and starch transformation were higher in C. thermosulfurogenes than in C. thermohydrosulfuricum. Both species had a functional <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>glycolytic</b> <b>pathway</b> and displayed the following catabolic activities: ferredoxin-linked pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, NAD(P) -ethanol dehydrogenase, NAD(P) -ferredoxin oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, and fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate-activated lactate dehydrogenase.

J. Bacteriol. 92 : 470 – 476. 1966. —A mutant of Escherichia coli {{in which}} fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate aldolase functions at 30 C {{but not at}} 40 C was used to study the physiological effect of a specific block in the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>glycolytic</b> <b>pathway.</b> Growth of the mutant at 40 C {{was found to be}} inhibited by the presence of glucose or certain related compounds in the medium. At 40 C, glucose was metabolized at 30 to 40 % of the control rate and was abnormal in that glucose was converted into other six-carbon substances (probably gluconate, in large part) that were released into the culture medium. The inhibition was complete, but transient; its duration depended upon the initial amount of inhibitor added. The resumption of growth at 40 C was correlated with the further catabolism of the excreted compounds. When glycerol was used to grow the mutant at 40 C, the growth inhibition by glucose was accompanied by cessation of glycerol metabolism. Growth on α-glycerol phosphate was not inhibited under these conditions, implicating glycerol kinase as a possible site of inhibition; no inhibition of glycerol kinase by sugar phosphates, however, could be detected in vitro. The inhibitory effect of glucose on growth at 40 C is not caused by a deficit of intracellular adenosine triphosphate, but {{may be the result of}} a generalized poisoning of many cell processes by a greatly increased intracellular concentration of fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate, the substrate of the damaged enzyme...|$|E

Both species contained ferredoxin-linked pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyridine nucleotide oxidoreductases. Ferredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) reductase activity was significantly higher in T. brockii than in AS 39 and was not detectable in LQRI. H 2 production and hydrogenase activity were inversely related to ferredoxin-NAD reductase activity in the three strains. Ferredoxin-NAD phosphate reductase activity was present in cell extracts of both species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity in C. thermocellum was NAD dependent, unidirectional, and inhibited by low concentrations of NAD and ethanol. Ethanol dehydrogenase activity of T. brockii was both NAD and NADP linked, reversible, and not inhibited by low levels of reaction products.
