5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened {{to ruin the}} Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E

25|$|The {{balance of}} federal powers and those powers {{held by the}} states as defined in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution was first {{addressed}} {{in the case of}} McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). The Court's decision by Chief Justice John Marshall asserted that the laws adopted by the federal government, when exercising its constitutional powers, are generally paramount over any conflicting laws adopted by state governments. After McCulloch, the primary legal <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area concerned the scope of Congress' constitutional powers, and whether the states possess certain powers to the exclusion of the federal government, even if the Constitution does not explicitly limit them to the states.|$|E

And number two, the mainstream <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|Taxes and {{the economy}} were {{overwhelmingly}} the top <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign. Corzine's strongest issue was on education, {{but it was the}} most important issue for only 4% of likely voters. Christie attacked Corzine's record of raising taxes, failing to deliver property tax relief, and presiding over a period of unusually high unemployment in the state. Corzine pointed to the global economic recession as the reason for the state's economic troubles. However, Republicans contended that Corzine's policies led to over-taxation and economic decline, causing an out-migration of residents documented in a report by the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.|$|E
25|$|The Haskalah {{was always}} a minor force, but the Jewish {{national}} movements which emerged in the 1880s, as well as Socialism, proved much more appealing to the young. Progressive strata condemned Hasidism as a primitive relic, strong, but doomed to disappear, as Eastern European Jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization. The gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of Hasidic yeshivas (in the modern, boarding school-equivalent sense) to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty: The first was established at Nowy Wiśnicz by Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (I) in 1881. These institutions were originally utilized by the Misnagdim to inoculate their youth from Hasidic influence, but now, the latter faced a similar crisis. One of the most contentious <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect was Zionism; the Ruzhin dynasties were quite favourably disposed toward it, while Hungarian and Galician courts reviled it.|$|E

25|$|He first ran {{for mayor}} of Verdun in the 1985 {{municipal}} election, {{in which he was}} narrowly defeated by former Liberal member of parliament Raymond Savard. During this campaign, Bossé promised to revitalize the city's shopping streets and increase its cultural activities without a significant tax hike; a report in the Montreal Gazette indicated that he spent the maximum amount of money permitted for the campaign, hired a public relations consultant, and had his supporters pack Verdun council meetings during the buildup to the vote. One of the key <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> election was the proposed amalgamation of Verdun into Montreal, which both Bossé and Savard opposed. Bossé's Parti d'action municipale (Municipal Action Party) won six out of the twelve seats on council, but it did not remain united as a party after election; at least five of the party's councillors later joined Savard's rival Regroupement des citoyens de Verdun (Verdun Citizens' Movement).|$|E

[...] Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Other <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe.

The {{actions of the}} president that Dames & Moore upheld did not dictate {{the outcome of the}} case, but merely specified that the claims be handled by a different tribunal. The court's decision in Dames & Moore was based on the [...] "longstanding practice of settling the claims of U.S. nationals against foreign countries by treaty or executive agreement." [...] In contrast with the majority's interpretation of Dames & Moore, [...] "those dispositions, crucially, were not exercises of judicial power." [...] The Chief Justice critiqued the majority's position on Dames & Moore by contending that the political branches of the government—Congress and the executive branch—have sufficient power of their own to address the <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case and do not need to [...] "commandeer the courts to make a political decision look like a judicial one." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1995, {{parent company}} Sony Music Entertainment chose to move Stone from the Nashville {{division}} of Epic Records {{to that of}} Columbia Records. This {{decision was made to}} give Stone a new promotional team. His only Columbia album, Faith in Me, Faith in You, was released in March of that year, with Stroud again serving as co-producer. This album's three singles were comparatively less successful than his previous singles, with none reaching Top 10: the title track peaked at No.13, followed by [...] "Sometimes I Forget" [...] at No.41 (his first single to miss the Top 40) and [...] "Born in the Dark" [...] at No.12. Stone suffered a nearly-fatal heart attack in December 1995 and a mild stroke in 1996, reducing his ability to record and tour. Stone would later remark that he was [...] "lucky" [...] to have survived his health <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> timespan.

500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode.

I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner?

500|$|In September 2010, it was {{announced}} that actress and singer Queen Latifah would guest star on the show as a Congresswoman named Regina Bookman who demands from Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy, more diversity in its NBC programming lineup. Latifah is a fan of the show and big fan of Baldwin and series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. She said in an interview she was [...] "out of my mind" [...] excited to guest-star. Latifah is due to appear in a future episode of 30 Rock. It was also confirmed that actor-director Rob Reiner would appear as himself, and in [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] he played a Congressman. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported in August 2010 that the show set a casting call [...] "for an African-American male in the 30s-60s age range" [...] to play a fictitious host named Rutherford Rice, a well-spoken host of Right On, a fictitious talk show focusing on African American <b>issues.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> episode, Rutherford Rice was played by actor Reg E. Cathey, best known for his role on the HBO drama The Wire as Norman Wilson. Actor John Amos made a brief appearance in the episode in which he stars in one scene from the Let's Stay Together show alongside a talking dog named Stanley the Dog. This was actor Todd Buonopane's fourth appearance as the character Jeffrey Weinerslav, an NBC Human resource mediator.

500|$|He {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the General Court (state legislature), winning election to the state senate annually from 1780, and being chosen by that body to serve on the Governor's Council. [...] He stood for election to the United States House of Representatives in the 1789 election (the first after the adoption of the United States Constitution) but was defeated by Jonathan Grout. [...] After the death of the immensely popular Governor John Hancock in 1793, the state's gubernatorial election of 1794 was a wide open race. [...] Gill was one of several nominees for lieutenant governor, and received more votes than all nominees except the winning gubernatorial candidate, Samuel Adams. [...] With no candidates for lieutenant governor receiving a majority, the General Court decided the election, choosing Gill. [...] He thereafter won annual reelection to that post. [...] In 1796 the aging Adams announced he would not run for reelection the following spring, and again the election was a wide open affair. [...] The party system was still taking shape in the state, and the Federalists nominated Increase Sumner, while more populist factions that had previously supported Hancock and Adams nominated Gill and James Sullivan. [...] Although Gill polled well in Boston and the eastern counties (present-day Maine), the Federalists won a decisive victory over the divided opposition. [...] Since he was also nominated by one faction as lieutenant governor, Gill was again returned to that post. [...] The principal <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and subsequent elections were over federal policy: specifically the national response to threats of war with Revolutionary France, and the consequent need for increased taxes to arm the nation. [...] Gill's politics are unclear: historian Anson Morse is of the opinion that his popularity was not sufficient to head the ticket of either the Federalists or the Democratic-Republicans. [...] Historian John Barry observes that Gill's term as acting governor, even though it was for essentially a full year, was [...] "too short to be particularly distinguished".|$|E
