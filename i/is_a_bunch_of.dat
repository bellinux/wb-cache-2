2500|$|The Conservative leader Michael Howard {{stated that}} the BNP were a [...] "stain" [...] on British democracy, adding that [...] "this is not a {{political}} movement, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> thugs dressed up as a political party". His successor David Cameron described it as a [...] "completely unacceptable" [...] organisation which [...] "thrives on hatred". The Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair called it a [...] "nasty, extreme organisation", while the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg termed it a [...] "party of thugs and fascists". The Bishops of the Church of England stated that supporting the BNP was [...] "like spitting in the face of God". Winston Churchill's family has criticised the BNP's use of his image and quotations, labelling it [...] "offensive and disgusting". The singer Vera Lynn condemned the party for selling her CD on its website. In 2009, the Royal British Legion asked Griffin—at first privately and then publicly—to not wear their poppy symbol. In 2004, the General Synod of the Church of England declared that supporting the BNP was incompatible with Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the arrest}} of several men in Britain in September 2004, on {{suspicion}} {{that they were trying}} to buy a kilogram of red mercury for £300,000, the International Atomic Energy Agency made a statement dismissing claims that the substance is real. [...] "Red mercury doesn't exist," [...] said the spokesman. [...] "The whole thing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> [...]" [...] When the case came to trial at the Old Bailey in April 2006, it became apparent that News of the Worlds [...] "fake sheikh" [...] Mazher Mahmood had worked with the police to catch the three men, Dominic Martins, Roque Fernandes and Abdurahman Kanyare. They were tried for [...] "trying to set up funding or property for terrorism" [...] and [...] "having an article (a highly dangerous mercury based substance) for terrorism". According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, but whether or not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution. All three men were acquitted in July 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Trouble {{was formed}} in 1979 by Rick Wartell and was joined by guitarist Bruce Franklin, vocalist Eric Wagner, bassist Tim Ian Brown (not to be {{confused}} with lead singer of English band The Stone Roses), and drummer Jeff Olson. Ian Brown was replaced by Sean McAllister in 1983. Drawing from Black Sabbath for inspiration (with occasional nods to the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s), the band used gloomy down-tuned riffs and spiritual, often openly Bible-inspired lyrics, which led Metal Blade to market the band as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. [...] "I was brought up Catholic", vocalist and primary lyric writer Wagner explains in the liner notes of Psalm 9 re-issue (2006), [...] "but you have to remember, back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic, and I did not get into that vibe." [...] Wagner has implied that Metal Blade actually came up with the term in the first place, which the band rejected: [...] "I think it was more like Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything [...] being called black metal, why not call us white metal, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> crap." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1970s occult boom {{influenced}} many early {{heavy metal}} bands lyricwise. In the early 1980s, several bands dealt such themes {{in a more}} extreme manner, including Venom, Mercyful Fate and Bathory. During the mid-1980s, heavy metal music divided into many subgenres, and black metal {{emerged as one of}} them, taking its name from a Venom album of the same title. In the 1980s, the term was imprecise with regards to musical attributes, simply referring to all metal bands with Satanic lyrical themes. Although Christian metal bands had existed since the late 1970s, a clear contrast with black metal occurred in 1984 with the doom metal band Trouble who released the Bible-based album Psalm 9. Metal Blade Records marketed them as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. Singer Eric Wagner has explained that [...] "back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic," [...] and he has implied that Metal Blade (or the owner Brian Slagel) actually invented the term in the first place: [...] "I think it was more like Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything being called black metal, so why not call us white metal, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> crap." [...] While there were Christian extreme metal bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Christian black metal likely did not exist until 1994.|$|E
