It was one of the first church sources of Old Russian Law. Church Statute of Prince Yaroslav and other Old Russian princely statutes served to closely purposes.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two likelihood-based <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> fit, the <b>index</b> lz (Drasgow, Levine & Williams, 1985) and the Snijders’ {{modified}} index lz* (Snijders, 2001).

The lz* index is a generalization of lz which corrects for this sampling variability. Surprisingly, {{it is not yet}} popular in the psychometric and educational assessment community. Moreover, there is some ambiguity about which type of item response model and ability estimation method can be used to compute the lz* <b>index.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to present the index lz* in a simple and didactic approach. Starting from the relationship between lz and lz*, we develop the framework according to the type of logistic IRT model and the likelihood-based estimators of ability.

50|$|Church Statute of Prince Yaroslav (Церковный Устав князя Ярослава) is {{a source}} of church law in Old Rus', defined legal {{authority}} of church by the prince (knyaz), his administration and churchmen. Yaroslav's Statute was a short legal code, regulated relationship between the church and the state, including demarcation of jurisdiction between church and princely courts, <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> within the church jurisdiction, rules of family law (family law belonged to church jurisdiction) and sanctions against moral violation. The statute was written at the 11th-12th century and remaked during 13th-16th centuries, in Old Church Slavonic and Old Russian. It {{was one of the first}} church sources of Old Russian Law. Church Statute of Prince Vladimir and other Old Russian princely statutes served to closely purposes. But church jurisdiction was expanded in comparison with Vladimir's Statute. A part of the lawsuits in the Yaroslav's Statute was referred to the church jurisdiction, and a part - to joint jurisdiction of the church and the prince. One of the sources of the statute was Byzantine law, including Nomocanon.|$|E

40|$|Scott DeLancey’s {{analysis}} of person-sensitive TAME marking in Lhasa Tibetan – “a. k. a. conjunct-disjunct marking” or “egophoricity” – has stimulated considerable discussion and debate, particularly as previously little-known languages of the Tibeto-Burman area, {{as well as}} outside it, {{have come to be}} described, and a wider range of functional factors have been taken into account. This chapter is intended as a contribution to this discussion, by presenting the first detailed {{analysis of}} person-sensitive TAME marking in a language of the Tani subgroup of Tibeto-Burman, namely Galo. Like Tournadre (2008), I find that person-sensitive TAME marking in Galo is not a grammaticalized <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> (“agreement”) nor <b>of</b> cross-clause subject continuity, but is instead a semantic <b>index</b> <b>of</b> an assertor’s knowledge state. Unlike in more westerly Tibeto-Burman languages, however, different construals of agency and/or volition {{do not seem to be}} factors in the Galo system. Thus, there are both similarities and differences underlying systems of person-sensitive TAME marking in different Tibeto-Burman languages; this suggests that further research - particularly, employing a diachronic perspective when possible - will be required before we can confidently characterize person-sensitive TAME marking from a pan-Tibeto-Burman (or broader) cross-linguistic perspective...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the short-term side-effects of omega- 3 supplementation consumption on the respiratory functioning after severe aerobic activities in the athletes with exercise-induced bronchospasm. Materials & Methods: In the semi-experimental study, 31 male students with mild exercise-induced bronchospasm were studied in Chamran University of Ahwaz in 2015. The subjects, randomly selected based on the study criteria, were divided into two groups including omega- 3 (n= 15) and control (n= 16). 1000 mg omega- 3 supplementation was daily administrated in omega- 3 group for 3 weeks. After an exhaustive activity (Astrand Treadmill Test), the pulmonary functioning was assessed in both group at both pretest and posttest steps. Data was analyzed by SPSS 19 software using dependent T and covariance tests. Findings: 3 -week consumption of omega- 3 supplementation did not significantly change the pulmonary <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with exercise-induced bronchospasm (p> 0. 05).

40|$|This book {{presents}} a critical {{edition of the}} Latin letters in ms. G 3 (Uppsala University Library) from Johannes Annorelius to his brother. Johannes Annorelius left Sweden as a young student {{in the beginning of}} the 18 th century and settled down in Flanders, where he converted to the Catholic faith and became a Capuchin friar. In the Capuchin friary Annorelius wrote several extensive letters in French and Latin to his brother Julius in Sweden. The letters state the reasons for his conversion and are intended to convince his Lutheran brother and the rest of their family to become Catholics as well. Hence, the letters become epistolary specimens of controversial theology with arguments mostly from the Bible and the Church Fathers in a style highly influenced by the controversialists of the Counter-reformation. We find a Neo-Latin text presenting a scholastic argumentation in a spirit representative of the time. In a unique way the present letter collection reflects the great European confessional warfare in the mirror of two brothers from the village of Tierp in Sweden. The major part of the book (267 pp.) consists of the edition of the letters. An introduction supplies with information about Johannes Annorelius, about his style and influences, and about his language. At the end of the book follow <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> and countries, doctrinal matters, and groups <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> who in Annorelius? opinion are to be considered heretics...|$|R
40|$|With the {{variability}} among alcohol users in mind, Project MATCH hypothesized several treatment matching relationships based on alcohol severity and alcohol dependence, but found limited effects. However, {{it is possible}} that the existing examinations of Project MATCH data did not fully characterize the nature of severity of alcohol dependence, as these analyses have examined dependence severity as an additive symptom count similar to the diagnostic strategy represented in the DSM-IV. We examined dependence severity as a latent trait hypothesized to have a characteristic developmental progression using Item Response Theory (IRT), and examined the implications of this approach to severity scaling in the Project MATCH data. The IRT-derived empirical continuum corresponded to an earlier theoretical model of the developmental course of alcoholism, demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity, and incremented other severity markers in predicting Alcoholics Anonymous involvement, social functioning, and readiness of change. However, it did not predict treatment outcomes or other validating variables more effectively than the measures used in the original design. Furthermore, an empirical <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> fit to this continuum did not moderate trait-validator relations including treatment outcome and treatment matching effects. Overall, findings did not support the incremental utility of a latent trait representation of alcohol severity...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{psychometric properties of}} an instrument for assessing perceived occupational value, the 26 -item OVal-pd. Data from 225 Swedish subjects with and without known mental illness were analysed regarding fit to the Rasch measurement model (partial credit model), differential item functioning (DIF), and functioning of the OVal-pd four-category response scale. The reliability (<b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> separation, analogous to Cronbach's alpha) was good (0. 92) but {{there were signs of}} overall and item level (six items) misfit. There was DIF between people with and without mental illness for three items. Iterative deletion of misfitting items resulted in a new 18 -item DIF-free scale with good overall and individual item fit and maintained reliability (0. 91). There were no disordered response category thresholds. These observations also held true in separate analyses among people with and without mental illness. Thus, the first steps of ensuring that occupational value can be measured in a valid and reliable way have been taken. Still, occupational value is a dynamic construct and the aspects that fit the construct may vary between contexts. This has implications for, e. g., cross-cultural research and calls for identification of a core set of culture-free items to allow for valid cross-cultural comparisons...|$|R
