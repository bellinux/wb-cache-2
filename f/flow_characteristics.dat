40|$|Abstract. Micro-flowing {{technique}} gained popular {{applications in}} microdevices of microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS), {{and the performance}} of micro-devices is greatly determined by the properties of micro-flow. This paper studied the characteristics of different viscosity fluid flowing over microchannels with different diameters and lengths under low pressure driving, and the influence of scale effects on the <b>flowing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of low viscosity fluids was also examined. The experiments studied the <b>flow</b> rate–pressure <b>characteristics</b> of distilled water flowing over microchannels with diameter of 13 μm, 20 μm, and silicon oil flowing over microchannels with diameters of 50 μm, 100 μm. The results indicate that, when the diameter of micro-channel is more than 20 μm, the <b>flowing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of distilled water and silicon oil agrees well with conventional flow theory, and when the diameter of microchannels is 13 μm, the <b>flowing</b> <b>characteristics</b> are related to the length of micro-channel. When the length is relatively shorter, the <b>flowing</b> <b>characteristics</b> are almost in agreement with the conventional flow theory. When the length reaches 100 mm, the flow rate is much higher than the values predicted by theoretical calculation when the length reaches 100 mm. It is obvious that scale effect arises when the length arrives to 100 mm and the velocity slippage results in the great increase of flow rate...|$|R

The programming was developed using the FORTRAN 90 software and compiled by FORTRAN Power Station 4. 0. The velocity profile of boundary layer along moving flat plate are investigated. It can be seen that when the flow distance from plate are increases, the velocity in boundary layer will decrease and the wall shear stress will increase.

2500|$|Weirs are {{commonly}} used to control the flow rates of rivers during periods of high discharge. Sluice gates (or {{in some cases the}} height of the weir crest) can be altered to increase or decrease the volume of water flowing downstream. Weirs of this purpose {{are commonly}} found upstream of towns and villages and can either be automated or manually operated. By slowing the rate at which water moves downstream even slightly a disproportionate effect can be had on the likelihood of flooding. On larger rivers a weir can also alter the <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a river to the point that vessels are able to navigate areas previously inaccessible due to extreme currents or eddies.

2500|$|It may be {{desirable}} for the diver {{to have some}} control over the <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the demand valve.

2500|$|Wells are drilled into oil {{reservoirs}} {{to extract}} the crude oil. [...] "Natural lift" [...] production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, {{such as in the}} Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using [...] "artificial lift" [...] means. Over time, these [...] "primary" [...] methods become less effective and [...] "secondary" [...] production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [...] "waterflood" [...] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or [...] "wellbore."
