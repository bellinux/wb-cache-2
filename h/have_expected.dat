5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Several episcopalians, {{supporters}} of the existing system of bishops, were {{also included in the}} summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, Daniel Featley, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.|$|E
5|$|The Economist {{recalled}} how the Soviet Union prevented Andrei Sakharov from accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, {{and suggested that}} Chinese leadership would probably <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> such a comparison.

5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters to Clinton, even before he might <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> a {{response}} to the July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She does not appear to <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders may <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> Alexios {{to become}} their leader, {{but he had}} no {{interest}} in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear fealty to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{cathedral chapter}} was {{composed}} of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of Christ Church Cathedral. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was {{the responsibility of the}} prior. At the time of Theobald's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, and they seem to <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to St Martin's Priory at Dover, which had been settled with canons instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near Lewes to provide benefices for his cathedral chapter.|$|E

5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{fully aware that}} his target was a {{hospital}} ship and decided to sink her regardless, either on his own initiative or on a poor interpretation of his orders. Researchers speculate that as Nakagawa was approaching {{the end of his}} tour in Australian waters, and had only sunk a single enemy vessel, the 8,742ton freighter Limerick, {{he did not want to}} return with the disgrace of a single kill. Other claims include that Nakagawa may have been acting in vengeance for casualties inflicted by the Allies during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, or may <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> praise for the sinking of an enemy naval vessel.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> {{to find in the}} seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|Stephen responded {{quickly to}} the revolts and invasions, paying most {{attention}} to England rather than to Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, {{with the task of}} retaking the key port of Dover, under Robert's control. A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the Battle of the Standard. Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of Gloucestershire, first striking north into the Welsh Marches, taking Hereford and Shrewsbury, before heading south to Bath. The town of Bristol itself proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area. The rebels appear to <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> Robert to intervene with support, but he remained in Normandy throughout the year, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself. Dover finally surrendered to the Queen's forces later in the year.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's {{personal}} qualities {{as a military}} leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable ability to move military forces quickly over relatively long distances. In response to the revolts and invasions, Stephen rapidly undertook several military campaigns, focusing primarily on England rather than Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, {{with the task of}} retaking the key port of Dover, under Robert's control. A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the battle of the Standard in August by the forces of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of Gloucestershire, first striking north into the Welsh Marches, taking Hereford and Shrewsbury, before heading south to Bath.
