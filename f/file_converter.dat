40|$|Every year, {{over one}} hundred Industrial and Systems Engineering at Ohio State {{students}} take courses that teach them the basics of linear and integer programming. Currently, students in these courses are taught to use a built in Excel solver or CPLEX using the LP or MPS file formats. These formats make it frustrating for students to create, modify, and debug mathematical programs. This frustration can prevent students from learning. This paper suggests {{the use of a}} high-level Excel specification format that is easier to use and more powerful than the formats that are currently taught. An Excel add-in was created to convert this new file format into an industry standard format. The new format and conversion program have many features to help students create, modify, read, and debug their models. Each section of the model has a column for a description and many different ways to add comments and notes exist. In addition, all of Excel’s features can be used to derive the end model. Finally, an error checker that gives specific feedback and suggestions for fixing errors is built into the <b>file</b> <b>converter.</b> The new format still needs to be extensively tested and some features are yet to be added. In addition, testing should be done to determine how the use of the new format influences the learning of mathematical programming...|$|E
40|$|Quinoa {{is a set}} of {{computational}} {{tools that}} enables research and numerical analysis in fluid dynamics. At this time it remains a test-bed to experiment with various algorithms using fully asynchronous runtime systems. Currently, Quinoa consists of the following tools: Walker, a numerical integrator for systems of stochastic differential equations in time. It is a mathematical tool to analyze and design the behavior of stochastic differential equations. It allows the estimation of arbitrary coupled statistics and probability density functions and is currently used for the design of statistical moment approximations for multiple mixing materials in variable-density turbulence. Inciter, an overdecomposition-aware finite element field solver for partial differential equations using 3 D unstructured grids. Inciter is used to research asynchronous mesh-based algorithms and to experiment with coupling asynchronous to bulk-synchronous parallel code. Two planned new features of Inciter, compared to the previous release (Quinoa_v 0. 1, LA-CC- 16 - 015), to be implemented next, are (a) a simple Navier-Stokes (NS) solver for ideal single-material compressible gases, and (b) solution-adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), which enables dynamically concentrating compute resources to regions with interesting physics. Using the NS-AMR problem we plan to explore how to scale such high-load-imbalance simulations, representative of large production multiphysics codes, to very large problems on very large computers using an asynchronous runtime system. RNGTest, a test harness to subject random number generators to stringent statistical tests enabling quantitative ranking with respect to their quality and computational cost. UnitTest, a unit test harness, running hundreds of tests per second, capable of testing serial, synchronous, and asynchronous functions.

40|$|This {{point release}} brings {{a series of}} new {{features}} and improvements, {{and a host of}} bug fixes. Of particular note are: Correlation Function Analysis (Corfunc) This performs a correlation function analysis of one-dimensional SAXS/SANS data, or generates a model-independent volume fraction profile from the SANS from an adsorbed polymer/surfactant layer. A correlation function may be interpreted in terms of an imaginary rod moving through the structure of the material. It is the probability that a rod of length R moving through the material has equal electron/neutron scattering length density at either end. Hence a frequently occurring spacing within a structure manifests itself as a peak. A volume fraction profile describes how the density of polymer segments/surfactant molecules varies with distance from an (assumed locally flat) interface. Fitting of SESANS Data Data from Spin-Echo SANS measurements can now be loaded and fitted. The data will be plotted against the correct axes and models will automatically perform a Hankel transform in order to calculate SESANS from a SANS model. Documentation The documentation has undergone significant checking and updating.

A full list of known bugs and feature requests is available at [URL] Critical - No currently known critical issues Other Significant - The way that orientation is defined is being refactored to address long standing issues and comments. In release 4. 1 however only models with symmetry (e. g. a=b) have been converted to the new definitions. The rest (a b c - e. g. parellelepiped) maintain the same definition as before and will be converted in 4. 2. Note that orientational distribution also makes much more sense in the new framework. The documentation should indicate which definition is being used for a given model. - The infrastructure currently handles internal conversion of old style models so that user created models in previous versions should continue to work for now. At {{some point in the future}} such support will go away. Everyone is encouraged to convert to the new structure which should be relatively straight forward and provides a number of benefits. - In that vein, the distributed models and those generated by the new plugin model editor are in the new format, however those generated by sum|multiply models are the old style sum|multiply models. This should also disappear in the near future. - The on the fly discovery of plugin models and changes thereto behave inconsistently. If a change to a plugin model does not seem to register, the Load Plugin Models (under fitting -> Plugin Model Operations) can be used. However, after calling Load Plugin Models, the active plugin will no longer be loaded (even though the GUI looks like it is) unless it is a sum|multiply model which works properly. All others will need to be recalled from the model dropdown menu to reload the model into the calculation engine. While it might be annoying it does not appear to prevent SasView from working [...] Model Issues Corrections will be posted to Marketplace as available (and fixed in following release) - Core shell parrallelipiped fails to calculate the long (C side) shell. If set non-zero this leads to an incorrect volume normalization and thus to an incorrect absolute scaling. This has apparently always been true. If thick_C is set to zero the model behaves correctly. - Triaxial ellipsoid does not reproduce the limiting cases of oblate or prolate ellipsoid.

30|$|When using QR Codes™ as triggers, {{which can}} be {{downloaded}} and printed out, no additional hardware, i.e., sets of RFID or NFC tags, has to be distributed. Thus, the system can remotely be made available for download. Some minor technical details are subject to our further investigation and development, such as {{the design of the}} application surface. Furthermore, strategies for accurate review and quality control of the teaching material have to be implemented. Programming and indexing tags with their corresponding video clips may be time consuming, as it is for any ultrasound video loop editing for educational purposes. As some mobile devices failed to feed battery power to the RFID antennas, the capability of using different triggering solutions provides a useful backup plan. Finally, the sole triggering of a video clip to be displayed does not encompass probe manipulation and image optimization skills as commercially available systems do, which is another field of further technical development for the system. Furthermore, the video output format of ultrasound machines and the anonymizing function varies. Several different file types and codecs may hamper their universal utilization for an ultrasound simulation library. This can easily be overcome using free <b>file</b> <b>converters.</b> Altogether, despite some minor technical issues, {{we did not want to}} withhold this important technical advance from publication, since we are convinced, that it will have a considerable impact on worldwide training in POC-US.|$|R
