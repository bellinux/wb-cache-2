40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} are terrible scourge {{that occur in}} many countries, specially for developing countries where transportation affairs like tangled yarn. Besides functioning as an engine compartment cover, the hood of modern compact SUV can also help to manage the impact energy of a pedestrian’s head in a vehicle-pedestrian impact. This paper presents <b>outer</b> <b>hood</b> design of Esemka R 2 that has a potential to improve hood’s ability and also to absorb the impact energy of a pedestrian’s head. The developed method {{for the design of}} an <b>outer</b> <b>hood</b> configuration aims to provide a robust design and homogeneous of Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for impact position at WAD 1000 and three different thicknesses (1. 25 mm, 1. 35 mm & 1. 50 mm) of <b>outer</b> <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> of Esemka R 2 compact SUV, taking into consideration the limited space available for deformation. The non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software (Explicit Dynamics) was used in this research to simulate the testing procedurs of head impact for child pedestrian. The results show that the average of comparison dimensional of <b>outer</b> <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> of Esemka R 2 was 4. 89 mm. The minimum of deformation space meet the requirement for HIC value which required obtaining robust and homogeneous head impact performance. <b>Outer</b> <b>hood</b> thickness and materials were identified as the factors to influence the stress and HIC value of the hood. By comparing all <b>outer</b> <b>hood</b> <b>panels,</b> aluminium alloy as the best selected material which has the lowest value is 32. 78 % for the pedestrian protection...|$|R
50|$|Flying {{controls}} were essentially conventional with fin, rudder, all-flying tailplane, and ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> on the 1921 version. For the 1922 competition <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> of increased area and wing-warping control were introduced.|$|R
50|$|Its thick section, {{cantilever}} wing was in three parts, with a centre section between the engines and twin <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> The centre section was rectangular in {{plan and the}} <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were straight-tapered, square-tipped and constantly decreased in thickness outwards. The centre section had a steel tube structure which carried the engine mountings and the outer wings and was plywood-covered. Each <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> was built around two spruce, ash and ply spars and had an aileron at its tip.|$|R

50|$|The cantilever, mid set, wooden {{wing of the}} OE-1 {{consisted}} of three parts: the 9 m span 90 cm chord rectangular planform centre section and two tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> 4.5 m span and rounded wing-tips. Three position plain flaps were fitted to the trailing edges of the centre section with a chord of 24 cm and set positions of −0.5, +8 and +80 degrees. Ailerons occupied the entire trailing edges of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> A shallow gull form was due to reduced dihedral on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Dhanens, the sculptural depictions on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> are a [...] "brilliant success ... in imparting a {{sense of}} life to the {{supposed}} statues." [...] The wings continue van Eyck's innovation in placing two grisaille <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> wings of polyptychs; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the Ghent Altarpiece.|$|R
50|$|The MB.141 was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane with a three part wing consisting of a rectangular plan centre section and trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> It was built around two spars and metal skinned; the leading edges were removable for maintenance purposes and the trailing edges carried high aspect ratio ailerons which filled {{about two-thirds of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

50|$|The low, {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} M.112 was built in three parts, a tapered centre-section {{which was part of}} the fuselage and trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with elliptical tips. Its aspect ratio of 9.5 was high for the time. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> carried mild dihedral and full-span, narrow-chord ailerons. The wings were completely wooden, with twin box spars and alder plywood skin.|$|R
50|$|The Poite 3 had a three part, low, {{cantilever}} wing, {{built around}} twin spars {{and having a}} high aspect ratio (10.8). There was a rectangular centre-section which filled about {{one quarter of the}} span and almost triangular <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> which carried light dihedral and tapered in thickness. Its ailerons occupied about half the trailing edges of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> and increased in chord inboard.|$|R
50|$|The Régnier 12's wing was {{in three}} parts {{with a short}} span, {{rectangular}} plan centre section and almost triangular plan <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> strongly tapered with a tip angle of about 20°. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> had a dihedral of 4.5°. The wing was built around two wooden box spars; its ribs were also wooden and the skin was birch plywood. Long ailerons filled much of the outer panels' trailing edges.|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} edged {{high wing}} of the Squale has a slightly tapered centre section of about 60% of the span and more strongly tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> There is constant dihedral across the whole span. The ailerons are on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> with airbrakes on the trailing edges of the outer centre section. The wing is built around a single wooden spar, with wooden ribs and 2.3 mm (0.1 in) plywood skin.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the inner}} and outer {{sections}} of the wing were built around two wooden box spars and wooden ribs. The final ribs of the centre-section extended rearwards to the tail as the booms and the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were bolted to them. An open single cockpit for pilot and passenger in side-by-side seats was positioned between the spars. In plan the centre-section was rectangular, about 2.0 m in span, 3.0 m in chord (more than half the overall length of the aircraft) and was 660 mm thick. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were braced to the lower centre-section outer edge on each side with two steel tube struts. In plan the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were strongly tapering trapezoids, carrying ailerons along the entire trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The all wood Viking 2 {{was a close}} {{relative}} of the earlier Viking 1 but bigger, heavier and with a modified and repositioned wing. The latter retained the same planform, having a constant chord central section and tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with rounded tips. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> each about {{one third of the}} span, carried full width, variable droop ailerons. A pair of spoilers was fitted at mid-chord on the centre section. However, the wing was mid-mounted rather than shoulder mounted and had slight dihedral on the thickened central section. The upper surfaces of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were without dihedral, forming overall a cantilever gull wing. The wing span was 10 ft 0 in (3.06 m) greater than that of the Viking 1.|$|R

50|$|The Viking 1 was an all-wood aircraft, with {{a single}} spar {{cantilever}} shoulder wing which was fabric covered behind the spar. In plan, the wing had constant chord in the central section and tapered <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with rounded tips. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> each about {{one third of the}} span, carried full width, variable droop ailerons. A pair of hinged plate spoilers was fitted at mid-chord on the centre section. The wing had slight dihedral.|$|R
50|$|The Féré F.3 {{is almost}} entirely wooden in {{structure}} and skinning, though some areas are fabric covered. The one piece, low set wing is built around a single box spar, with its leading edge covered in okoumé plywood under an overall fabric covering. The inner sections of the wings have no dihedral but the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> are set at 5.80°. There are plain, fabric covered ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> but no flaps.|$|R
50|$|The G-27 was {{the only}} Gribovsky design {{with more than one}} engine. It was a wooden {{multi-purpose}} monoplane, intended to provide training in navigation and photo-reconnaissance for its crew of three as well as filling light transport and air ambulance rôles. In plan its wing had a rectangular centre section and straight tapered, two spar <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> with rounded tips. The <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> carried slotted ailerons and the centre section pneumatically operated split flaps.|$|R
50|$|The LeO H-23 was {{a flying}} boat with a three part {{cantilever}} high wing which was trapezoidal in plan out to roughly elliptical tips. The centre section filled {{just over half}} of the span and was very thick at the roots but the wing thinned continuously outboard over both centre and <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> There was about 4.5° of dihedral. Its ailerons were on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b> The wing was completely wooden and covered in plywood.|$|R
50|$|The Crossover has {{a largely}} epoxy resin and carbon fibre structure. The three part wing has a {{rectangular}} plan, 6.5 m span central section and detachable trapezoidal <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> each either 1.55 m or 4.25 m {{long for the}} 9.60 m and15.00 m span variants respectively. The wingtips have tall, narrow winglets. The trailing edge of the inner section is filled by two-section, double slotted, electrically driven Fowler flaps, with ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} Bodiansky 20 was built in three parts, with a short-span, thick, rectangular plan central section and nearly triangular plan <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> which carried 8° of dihedral and thinned linearly outwards. The aspect ratio of the wing, 10.9, was high. Structurally the central section was a welded steel tube part of the fuselage and the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were wooden, each with two spars and plywood skinned. Slats, which opened to form the slots, filled the whole leading edges of the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> and {{were divided into two}} sections. These sections matched the division of the trailing edge into ailerons outboard and flaps inboard. The outer slots opened automatically on the approach of the stall, whereas the inboard slats deployed when the flaps were lowered to their single down setting.|$|R

5000|$|The Farner HF Colibri 1 SL motor glider, designed, {{built and}} test flown by Hans Farner {{in the late}} 1970s {{embodied}} these ideas. It had a very high aspect ratio (31.7) wing with a constant chord centre section carrying dihedral. <b>Outer</b> <b>panels,</b> with anhedral, combined with the inner section to form a cantilever gull wing. These <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> had straight taper on the leading edges only, and rotated as all-moving ailerons or [...] "tiperons" [...] for roll control.|$|R
50|$|The Lignel 10 of 1938 was {{a wooden}} low wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{one in the}} series of Société Française de Construction Aéronautique designs stretching back to the 1935 SFCA Maillet 20. It was a single-seater, intended to meet a military requirement for a trainer that would assist the pupil's transition from simple two seat trainers to faster and more complex fighters with flaps and retractable undercarriages. The wings of the Lignel 10, {{like those of the}} rest of the series were in three parts, with a rectangular plan centre section without diheral and <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> which, on the Lignel 10, had about 6° of dihedral. The leading edges of these <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> were straight and only slightly swept but the trailing edges were increasingly curved towards the wing tips. Inset ailerons and the split flaps were both on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The flying {{surfaces}} of the Urendo are almost entirely wooden, apart from fabric-covered rear control surfaces and fibre-glass aileron nose-caps. Its high set wing, mounted with 3.50° of dihedral, is built around a single spar and plywood-skinned. In plan the wing is straight-edged, with an inner panel of constant chord and 4.50° of forward sweep at quarter chord, and <b>outer,</b> tapered <b>panels</b> with forward sweep of 3°, terminating in small, streamlined bodies known as salmons. The three Urendo variants were distinguished by {{the details of the}} ailerons on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels,</b> the airbrakes, also on the <b>outer</b> <b>panels</b> but at their inboard limit, and {{the presence or absence of}} centre section flaps.|$|R

5000|$|The second-worst fatal {{accident}} in Scottish Airlines' history occurred on 7 December 1957, {{when one of}} the firm's Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer 1 planes (registration: G-AOEO) crashed 285 mi SSW of Tripoli, Libya. Following takeoff from Atshan airstrip for an expected three-and-a-half hour flight to Tripoli Idris Airport the aircraft failed to arrive at its destination. While the aircraft's wreckage was found 285 mi SSW of Tripoli, its left wing's <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> was located 1,200 yards (yd) (1,100 metres (m)) from the main wreckage. The subsequent accident investigation established the failure of the forward tube of the [...] "V brace" [...] structure in the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the port wing due to fatigue as the probable cause. This failure caused the <b>outer</b> <b>panel</b> of the port wing to break away from the aircraft in flight. This in turn resulted in the aircraft becoming completely uncontrollable and diving vertically into the ground, killing all six occupants (two crew and four passengers).|$|R
