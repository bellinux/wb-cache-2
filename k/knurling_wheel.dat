5000|$|Upon {{arrival at}} {{a parking lot}} {{requiring}} parking disc, the parking disc is set and put on display behind the front windshield. The disc has a thumb wheel (or <b>knurling</b> <b>wheel)</b> at the upper side that makes the clock face turn around its center point, allowing it to show different clock times. The standard parking clock can show a full twelve hours, with additional marks for each half-hour. The time to be set is rounded up from the actual arrival time, for example a 10:00:01 arrival would be set to 10:30, while a 10:29:59 arrival would also be set to 10:30. The legal requirements are that [...] "parking is allowed when the vehicle shows a parking disc that is easily readable from the outside and whose clockhand points to {{the mark of the}} half hour that follows the time of arrival".|$|E

50|$|The first {{photographic}} camera {{developed for}} commercial manufacture was a daguerreotype camera, built by Alphonse Giroux in 1839. Giroux {{signed a contract}} with Daguerre and Isidore Ni√©pce to produce the cameras in France, with each device and accessories costing 400 francs. The camera was a double-box design, with a landscape lens fitted to the outer box, and a holder for a ground glass focusing screen and image plate on the inner box. By sliding the inner box, objects at various distances could be brought to as sharp a focus as desired. After a satisfactory image had been focused on the screen, the screen was replaced with a sensitized plate. A <b>knurled</b> <b>wheel</b> controlled a copper flap in front of the lens, which functioned as a shutter. The early daguerreotype cameras required long exposure times, which in 1839 could be from 5 to 30 minutes.|$|R
