The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary.

25|$|Lucas was a {{prime suspect}} {{in the killing of}} Rich. A few months later, in June 1983, he was arrested on charges of {{unlawful}} possession of a firearm by Texas Ranger Phil Ryan. Lucas reported that he was roughly treated by bullying inmates in prison and attempted suicide. Lucas claimed that police stripped him naked, denied him cigarettes and bedding, held him in a cold cell, and did not allow him to contact an attorney. After four days, Lucas confessed to the murder of Rich, which confession investigators had <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> was genuine; in addition, he confessed to killing Powell. When he started confessing to numerous unsolved cases, he was initially credible; police knew that he had truthfully admitted committing two killings. Some interrogators, including Ryan, thought many of Lucas's confessions were made to get out of his cell and improve his living conditions. They did, however, treat dozens as potentially genuine.|$|E

25|$|Some {{argue that}} almost all of the above is based on an unhistorical {{projection}} of present concerns, onto the past. This alternative view argues that there are immense complexities of time, space, climate, geology and topography which, when combined with our extremely fragmentary information, makes generalizations almost impossible. Tree crops, dates, figs, olives, chestnuts etc, played a very important role in Roman agriculture. Grains were often intercultivated with these tree crops. Almost all species of trees grow again when cut down. Cutting down a wood does not, by itself, destroy woodland. Coppicing is one way in which wood could be harvested on a sustainable basis for example. Hypocausts were pre-adapted to burn poor quality fuels like straw as well as coal. There is <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that both straw and coal were important fuels in antiquity, especially in Roman Britain where coal was abundant in many areas. A great deal of protection against soil erosion arises from terracing hillsides. We do not know how extensive terraces were in antiquity but {{a good deal of the}} soil erosion, here assumed to be caused by the Romans, may well date to the dark ages when the maintenance of terraces broke down. Changes in tree cover may well arise from differences in climate, which are still not well understood. But there is some evidence that the decline of the Roman West is linked to climate change.|$|E
500|$|According to the Historia Brittonum, Penda besieged Oswiu at Iudeu; {{this site}} has been {{identified}} with Stirling, {{in the north of}} Oswiu's kingdom. Oswiu tried to buy peace: in the Historia Brittonum, it is said that Oswiu offered treasure, which Penda distributed among his British allies. Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda, who [...] "resolved to extirpate all of [...] nation, from the highest to the lowest". Additionally, according to Bede, Oswiu's son Ecgfrith was being held hostage [...] "at the court of Queen Cynwise, in the province of the Mercians"—perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement. It would seem that Penda's army then moved back south, perhaps returning home, but a great battle was fought near the river Winwaed in the region of Loidis, thought to be somewhere in the area around modern day Leeds, on a date given by Bede as 15 November. The identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain, but possibly it was a tributary of the Humber. There is <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it may well have been the river now known as Cock Beck in the ancient kingdom of Elmet. The Cock Beck meanders its way through Pendas Fields, close to an ancient well known as Pen Well on the outskirts of Leeds, before eventually joining the River Wharfe. This same Cock Beck whilst in flood also {{played a significant role in}} the much later Battle of Towton in 1461. Another possibility is the River Went (a tributary of the River Don, situated to the north of modern-day Doncaster). It may be that Penda's army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability, which would help explain Oswiu's victory over forces that were, according to Bede, much larger than his own.|$|E

2500|$|In early sources, {{there is}} an {{additional}} complex of beliefs that is connected with the afterlife: death {{could be described as}} an erotic embrace between the dead man and a lady who represents the afterlife.

There is <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that such erotic elements are not just skaldic playfulness, but authentic pagan notions, since they appear in the oldest known skaldic poems.

Several skaldic poems and sagas describe death in battle or on the sea with erotic terminology.

2500|$|On {{the advice}} of MCA's Lew Wasserman, Jack Benny formed a holding company, [...] "Amusement Enterprises" [...] (a tax break major entertainers usually enjoyed in those years), which allowed him to bundle his entire program and {{personnel}} into a single commodity.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and {{sympathy for the}} Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence {{of the number of}} Irish Catholics in the Battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while [...] "there was a portion of truth" [...] in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, [...] "I have <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result ," [...] describing how he found the punishments used for [...] "trivial offensives" [...] to be [...] "revolting and disgusting". Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.|$|E
