Furthermore, the effect of the discharging methods at the broiler farm on the physical quality of pellets using MEP as a method of analysis was evaluated. The first phase of the experiment was a randomized block with six treatments: A - pellets at the end of the pelletizer machine; B - pellets inside the truck; C - truck's discharging at the feed silo; D - place inside the warehouse after the feed silo; E - the middle of the <b>feed</b> <b>plate</b> line and F - the end of the <b>feed</b> <b>plate</b> line.
