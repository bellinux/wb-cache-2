The observed correlations are not tight, one dimensional relations. Supernovae with the same postmaximum decline or the same color have a spread in visual magnitude of ≈ 0. 7 m. The dispersion in the color-magnitude relation may result from uncertainties in the distance determinations or the interstellar reddening within the host galaxy. The dispersion in the decline rate-magnitude relation suggests that an intrinsic 1 spread in the supernova properties exists that cannot be accounted for by any single relation between visual brightness and postmaximum decline.

5000|$|Anti-handling {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} used in fuzes since at least 1940, in, for example, Luftwaffe's ZUS-40 anti-removal fuze [...] which was used during the London Blitz and elsewhere. ZUS-40s were designed to fit underneath most Luftwaffe bomb fuzes. When a delayed-action bomb containing a ZUS-40 was dropped on a target, the impact when it hit the ground freed a ball-bearing inside the ZUS-40, thereby arming a spring-loaded firing pin. However, so long as the main bomb fuze remained inside its fuze well, the cocked firing pin in the ZUS-40 was prevented from springing forward. ZUS-40s were often fitted underneath a type 17 clockwork long delay fuze, which gave between 2 and 72 hours <b>delayed</b> <b>detonation.</b> Rendering safe a type 17 fuze was normally a simple and straightforward process i.e. unscrew the fuze locking ring, remove the fuze from its pocket {{in the side of the}} bomb and unscrew the gaine. However, fitting a ZUS-40 underneath a type 17 fuze made the render-safe process much more complicated and dangerous. Removing the main time-delay fuze more than 15 millimetres from its fuze pocket (without neutralising the anti-handling device underneath) automatically released the cocked firing pin inside the ZUS-40, which sprang forward to strike a large percussion cap, thereby causing detonation of the bomb and the death of anyone nearby. Because the ZUS-40 was designed to be concealed underneath a conventional bomb fuze, it was very difficult to know whether a particular bomb was fitted with an anti-handling device or not. In any case, many electrically fired German bomb fuzes already had a pendulum-based [...] "trembler" [...] switch which triggered detonation if the bomb was subjected to rough handling. Some German anti-handling fuzes were even more dangerous to EOD personnel, such as the type 50 and 50BY fuzes. These were normally fitted to 250/500 kg bombs and contained two mercury tilt switches which detected vertical or horizontal movement. The fuzes fully armed themselves approximately 30 seconds after hitting the ground. Subsequently, if the bomb was moved in any way, the mercury switch triggered detonation. To complicate matters still further, German bombs could have two separate fuze pockets fitted, with different fuze types screwed into each one. As a result, one bomb could incorporate two separate anti-handling devices working independently of each other e.g. a type 17 clockwork fuze with a ZUS-40 hidden underneath it screwed into one fuze pocket, and a type 50BY in the other. Even comparatively small air-dropped munitions could incorporate an anti-handling feature e.g. the type 70 fuze fitted to Butterfly bombs. However, fuzes with an integral anti-handling feature were not only found in air-dropped bombs. For example, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze (dating from 1943) fitted to Teller mines automatically triggered detonation if (in an attempt to render the mine safe) the pressure plate was unscrewed. Although the designs of these anti-handling fuzes varied, all were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel who had the task of rendering them safe.|$|E

40|$|Aims. Deflagration models poorly {{explain the}} {{observed}} diversity of SNIa. Current multidimensional simulations of SNIa predict {{a significant amount}} of, so far unobserved, carbon and oxygen moving at low velocities. It has been proposed that these drawbacks can be resolved {{if there is a}} sudden jump to a detonation (<b>delayed</b> <b>detonation),</b> but these kinds of models have been explored mainly in one dimension. Here we present new three-dimensional <b>delayed</b> <b>detonation</b> models in which the deflagraton-to-detonation transition (DDT) takes place in conditions like those favored by one-dimensional models. Methods. We have used a smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics code adapted to follow all the dynamical phases of the explosion, with algorithms devised to handle subsonic as well as supersonic combustion fronts. The starting point was a centrally ignited C–O white dwarf of 1. 38 M. When the average density on the flame surface reached ∼ 2 − 3 × 107 g cm− 3 a detonation was launched. Results. The detonation wave processed more than 0. 3 M of carbon and oxygen, emptying the central regions of the ejecta of unburned fuel and raising its kinetic energy close to the fiducial 1051 erg expected from a healthy type Ia supernova. The final amount of 56 Ni synthesized also was in the correct range. However, the mass of carbon and oxygen ejected is still too high. Conclusions. The three-dimensional <b>delayed</b> <b>detonation</b> models explored here show an improvement over pure deflagration models, but they still fail to coincide with basic observational constraints. However, there are many aspects of the model that are still poorly known (geometry of flame ignition, mechanism of DDT, properties of detonation waves traversing a mixture of fuel and ashes).

40|$|The nucleosynthetic {{characteristics}} of various explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is explored based on three two-dimensional explosion simulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, a <b>delayed</b> <b>detonation</b> following an approximately spherical ignition {{of the initial}} deflagration, and a <b>delayed</b> <b>detonation</b> arising from a highly asymmetric deflagration ignition. Apart from this initial condition, the deflagration stage is treated in a parameter-free approach. The detonation is initiated when the turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. This occurs at densities around $ 10 ^{ 7 }$ g cm$^{- 3 }$ [...] relatively low as compared to existing nucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. The burning in these multidimensional models {{is different from that}} in one-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both into unburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarf and into the low density region near the surface. Thus, the resulting yield is a mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning products at low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities, as well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. In contrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce a characteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraints from Galactic chemical evolution.

His intervention saved the lives of 200 people on the train as it <b>delayed</b> the <b>detonation</b> of the bomb which blew a [...] gap in the track.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} war days of the Second World War, the bridge in Angelroda was {{prepared}} for detonation, although it was completely irrelevant to {{the course of the}} war. Citizens of Angelroda, who feared damage to their houses, some of which were next to the bridge, <b>delayed</b> the <b>detonation</b> until the arrival of American troops. During the Cold War, acts of sabotage to the bridge were feared. Therefore, it was permanently guarded from 1950 to 1958/59.|$|R
