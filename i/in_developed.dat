40|$|This thesis investigates how mobile {{technology}} usage could help to bring Information and communication technologies (ICT) {{to the people}} <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. Some people <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries have access to use ICT while other {{people do not have}} such opportunity. This digital divide among people is present <b>in</b> many <b>developing</b> countries where computers and the Internet are difficult to access. The Internet provides information that can increase productivity and enable markets to function more efficiently. The Internet reduces information travel time and provides more efficient ways for firms and workers to operate. ICT and the Internet can provide opportunities for economic growth and productivity <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. This indicates that {{it is very important to}} bridge the digital divide and increase Internet connections <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how can {{mobile technology}} and mobile services help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. Theoretical background of this thesis consists of a collection of articles and reports. Theoretical material was gathered by going through literature on the digital divide, mobile technology and mobile application development. The empirical research was conducted by sending a questionnaire by email to a selection of application developers located <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. The questionnaire’s purpose was to gather qualitative information concerning mobile application development <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. This thesis main result suggests that mobile phones and mobile technology usage can help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. This study finds that mobile technology provides one of the best tools that can help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. Mobile technology can bring affordable ICT to people who do not have access to use computers. Smartphones can provide Internet connection, mobile services and mobile applications to a rapidly growing number of mobile phone users <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries. New low-cost smartphones empower people <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries to have access to information through the Internet. Mobile technology has the potential to help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries where a vast amount of people own mobile phones...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was an {{exploration}} into the implementation process <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> country cities. Western debates on implementation {{are usually not}} applicable <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> country cities and the question asked was why.

Of particular interest is waste management. Different approaches are employed {{in the management of}} waste <b>in</b> some <b>developing</b> country cities and the results have been mediocre with no real impact on the urban environment. To this end, this thesis set out to understand implementation within these cities. In the course of this research, some very interesting factors were discovered about policy implementation <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> country cites.
