40|$|Recommending TV {{programs}} in the interactive TV domain is a difficult task since the catalog of available items is very dynamic, i. e., items are continuously added and removed. Despite recommender systems based on collaborative filtering typically outperform content-based systems in terms of recommendation quality, they suffer from the new item problem, i. e., they {{are not able to}} recommend items that have few or no ratings. On the contrary, content-based recommender systems are able to recommend both old and new items but the general quality of the recommendations in terms of relevance to the users is low. In this article we present two different approaches for buildinghybridcollaborative+contentrecommendersystems, whosepurposeistoproducerelevantrecommendations,while overcoming the new <b>item</b> <b>issue.</b> The approaches are tested ontheimplicitratingscollectedfrom 15 ’ 000 IPTVusersover a period of six months. 1...|$|E

This problem is particularly acute in TV applications, where the catalog of available items (e. g., TV programs) is very dynamic. On the contrary, content-based recommender systems are able to recommend both old and new items but the general quality of the recommendations in terms of relevance to the users is low.

40|$|Background: The NHS spends {{billions of}} pounds {{annually}} on repeat prescriptions in primary care, but data on their extent and use {{is out of}} date. Understanding the scale of repeat prescribing and for whom it is prescribed {{is important for the}} NHS to plan services and develop policies to improve patient care. Method: Anonymous data on prescription numbers and practice population demographics was obtained from GP computer systems in a large urban area. Searches were conducted in November 2011 to identify the numbers of repeat items listed on individuals' repeat lists by sex and age. The proportion of all prescription <b>items</b> <b>issued</b> as repeats was identified by conducting searches on <b>items</b> <b>issued</b> as repeat and acute prescriptions. Results: In the year of study 4, 453, 225 <b>items</b> were <b>issued</b> of which 3, 444, 769 (77 %) were repeats (mean 13 items per patient/annum) and 1, 008, 456 (23 %) acute prescriptions (mean 3. 9 items per patient per annum). The mean number of repeat Items per patient was 1. 87 (range 0. 45 ages 0 - 9  years; 7. 1 ages 80 - 89  years). At least one repeat medicine was prescribed to 43 % of the population (range 20 % for ages 0 - 9; over 75 % for ages 60 +). Conclusion: A significant proportion of the population receive repeat prescriptions and the proportion increases with age. Whilst the proportion of repeat items to acute items has remained unchanged {{over the last two decades}} the number of repeat prescriptions <b>items</b> <b>issued</b> has doubled (from 5. 8 to 13. 3 items/patient/annum). This has implications for general practice workload, patient convenience, NHS costs and risk...|$|R

40|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a nearly four year study cycle following the closing of the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12), the 2015 WRC in November of 2015 considered a number of agenda <b>items</b> and <b>issues</b> relevant to systems and spectrum allocations supporting communications, navigation and surveillance for the operation of civil aviation.
