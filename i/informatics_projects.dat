An identified business need at a large military treatment facility was an educational tool {{to bridge the gap between}} nursing <b>informatics</b> and <b>project</b> management. The scholarly project was a Nursing <b>Informatics</b> <b>Project</b> Management Guidebook, which served as an educational tool to increase nurses 2 ̆ 7 knowledge to serve in the HIT project manager role. With a quality improvement methodology, the outcome and impact sequence logic model was applied as the framework. The target population was the Clinical Informatics Sub-Committee, which was a multidisciplinary working group. The Nursing <b>Informatics</b> <b>Project</b> Management Guidebook included an introduction to nursing <b>informatics,</b> <b>project</b> management standards, 9 current scholarly articles, and links to professional organizations. There was also an overview of the roles and responsibilities of a nursing <b>informatics</b> <b>project</b> manager throughout the 5 acquisition lifecycle processes, which includes initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing. Finally, essential terms were defined to assist in the completion of the assigned project on time, within budget, and in scope.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{indicate}} how Outcome Mapping (OM) can be used as a methodology to monitor and evaluate a specific developmental <b>informatics</b> <b>project</b> currently under way in the Meraka Institute. OM was applied in the Broadband for All (BB 4 All) wireless mesh network project which focuses on the provision of broadband to selected citizens/rural communities in South Africa, funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). In this project the main focus is the deployment of broadband connectivity in and around selected schools and other government centres such as clinics, Thusong Centres (multipurpose community service centres) and community libraries. Selected areas include Nkangala, Sekhukhune and John Taolo Gaetsewe (Kgalagadi) districts. OM was mainly applied as a monitoring and evaluation framework during the initial/planning phase through to the implementation phase of the project. The result of the usage of this methodology indicated that it can support any development <b>informatics</b> <b>project</b> if applied from the beginning. Detailed feedback from all stakeholders in the project proved to be the major challenge and specific changes in behaviour were documented from the project team right through to the Village Operators in the identified rural areas. This article will also outline what unexpected results and lessons were learnt from specific groups involved in the project...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{past decade}} has brought a boom of online {{initiatives}} that monitor the performance of parliaments – a practice {{commonly referred to as}} ‘parliamentary informatics’. A recent survey identified 191 organisations monitoring over 80 parliaments worldwide; many of these use digital tools to aggregate information and facilitate citizens ’ involvement in parliamentary activity (Mandelbaum 2011). At the same time, little is actually known about who uses these platforms and whether they increase the quality of democracy. This paper aims to fill this gap by assessing parliamentary <b>informatics</b> <b>projects</b> in three European countries {{from the point of view}} of key democratic dimensions: equality, accountability, and political responsiveness. In particular, the paper shows that parliamentary <b>informatics</b> <b>projects</b> achieve mixed results in terms of democratic quality. Many of the traditionally underrepresented groups in politics have even more limited presence on these online platforms. Accountability- including access to user-friendly, close to real-time, and objective political information that help ordinary citizens to hold their representative accountable- turns out to be the strong point of this type of project. However, users do not consider transparency of information to be enough. Many participants build up significant expectations about the political effects of their engagement. Yet, their expectations are generally disappointed by lack of impact...|$|E
