25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
500|$|The {{influential}} distortion {{sound of}} the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called [...] "little green", after {{the name of the}} amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies' neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC-30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave's guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, [...] "My brother is lying. I don't know why he [...] does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> speaker cone up with a razor blade and I was so shocked and [...] surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and [...] Pete [...] … Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song 'You Really Got Me' and I played the riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound." ...|$|E

25|$|I don't give 'em {{a lot of}} film to play with. In fact, Eastman used to {{complain}} that I exposed so little film. <b>I</b> do <b>cut</b> in <b>the</b> camera.
