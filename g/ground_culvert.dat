25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by {{the fact that there was}} once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just a couple of miles away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under <b>ground</b> and the <b>culvert</b> it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|R

Runs of up to 1,000 Chinook or King Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but have all but vanished in the current decade apparently blocked from access to breeding <b>grounds</b> by impassable <b>culverts,</b> weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District. In 2011 a small number of Chinook salmon were filmed spawning under the Julian Street bridge.|$|R
40|$|Rollover {{incidents}} of military vehicles {{have resulted in}} soldiers incurring injuries or losing their lives. A recent report identified that one cause of vehicle rollovers is the driver’s inability to assess rollover threat, such as a cliff, soft <b>ground,</b> water, or <b>culvert</b> {{on the passenger side}} of the vehicle. The vehicle’s width hinders the driver’s field of view. To reduce the number of military vehicles rolling over, a road edge detection and driver warning system is being developed to warn the driver of potential rollover threats and keep the driver from veering {{off the side of the}} road. This system utilizes a unique, ultra-fast, image-processing algorithm based on the neurobiology of insect vision, specifically fly vision. The system consists of a Long-Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) camera and monochrome video camera system, a long-range laser scanner, a processing module in which a biomimetic image processor detects road edges in real-time, and a Driver’s Vision Enhancer (DVE) which displays the road image, detected boundaries and road-side terrain steepness in real-time for the driver. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-speed}} railway {{project for}} trains with speeds of 160 – 180 km/h was recently completed in Malaysia. An array of geosynthetics such as biaxial geogrids, non-woven geotextiles and woven geotextiles were extensively {{used in the}} project primarily for separation, filtration and reinforcement purposes. The geosynthetics were particularly used at locations of high embankments underlain by soft clays and loose sands. Ground improvement using geosynthetics in the project primarily included geogrid-reinforced piled embankments with individual pile caps, geogrids at bridge approach transitions, geogrids for <b>ground</b> treatment beneath <b>culverts,</b> geogrids for culverts supported by stone columns, woven geotextiles for cement column works, non-woven geotextiles for excavation works, non-woven geotextiles {{at the top of}} the railway subgrade layer, non-woven geotextiles for temporary retaining walls and non-woven geotextiles for slope protection works. This paper provides a detailed insight into the design and implementation of ground improvement using geogrids and geotextiles in this case study project, with a focus on the geogrid reinforcement design of piled embankments with individual pile caps. The use of geosynthetics in the various railway applications in the project was found to provide safe and cost-effective solutions to the various geotechnical engineering challenges encountered...|$|R
5000|$|Early written {{documents}} {{record the}} local presence of migrating {{salmon in the}} ‘'Rio Guadalupe'’ dating {{as far back as}} the 18th century. Archaeological remains of salmon were found dating through A.D. 300 in the lower watershed in what is now North San Jose. On February 22, 1904 the San Jose Daily Mercury (now the San Jose Mercury News) reported [...] "Several large salmon and steelheads have become stranded in the holes, and after the water has subsided they have become the prey to boys. Several large salmon have been captured even in the city limits." [...] Both steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and chinook or king salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) continue to make spawn in the river, making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning runs, the other major cities being Anchorage; Seattle; Portland and Sacramento. [...] Runs of up to 1,000 chinook salmon swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but were decimated by man-made barriers to their breeding <b>grounds</b> by impassable <b>culverts,</b> weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the SCVWD for flood control. By 2006 less than 40 king salmon were counted, although two managed to get up to Los Gatos that year and spawn below the California State Route 17 Freeway bridge over Los Gatos Creek in back of the Pruneyard Shopping Center. No Chinook have been seen until November, 2011 when they were documented with photo and video, the apparent offspring of the 2006 spawners. From 1992-1994 a genetic study of mitochondrial DNA in 29 fish showed that some have haplotypes not found in Central Valley wild or hatchery salmon, but found in the Russian River. Two subsequent analyses found that chinook salmon in the Guadalupe River are mainly fall run Central Valley chinook, but also that some were genetically similar to lower Columbia River basin salmon. This is significant because the California Coast Chinook salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) was considered federally threatened September 16, 1999 (64 FR 50394) and reaffirmed June 28, 2005 (70 FR 37160), although the Russian River is normally considered the southernmost limit for this ESU. Chinook salmon are adept at colonizing neighboring and even distant streams and rivers, as evidence by the recent finding of juvenile Chinook salmon from the Klamath River in the Napa River. In 2012, the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan reported that Chinook salmon currently spawn in the Guadalupe River and its tributaries, as well as Coyote Creek. Because Chinook spawn in early winter and juveniles may migrate to the ocean in their first spring, Chinook are able to use habitats that turn very warm or have low water quality in summer.|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} of this thesis {{is the result}} of a survey by ‘provincie Zuid-Holland’ (PZH), that has developed a ‘uniform model’ for the assessment of the structural safety of existing prefabricated culverts. PZH is considering the possibility of using generic parameters to decide on the strength of existing culverts in the area. The province wants to show that all culverts, given their size and other material characteristics, are strong enough to carry the traffic loads prevailing in Netherlands. The PZH has decided to provide some elements of a replacement culvert (Schaapswegduiker) for the (destructive) determination of the strength. This has been realized based on the results of this thesis. The aim of the thesis is to determine the maximum load that can be carried and to assess the structural safety of the Schaapswegduiker, in accordance with current regulations. In order to answer this research question, a literature study was conducted to assess the structural safety of existing structures. Schaapswegduiker is assessed for traffic loads LM 1 and LM 2 in accordance with RBK 1. 1, NEN 8700, NEN 8701 and NEN-EN- 1991 - 2. First, a materials research has been performed (by Nebest) based on my plan of action, to determine the proper output parameters for the calculations. Hereafter two calculation models have been prepared to validate the uniform model of PZH: a framework model (comparable to uniform model) and an advanced nonlinear FEM model. The advanced non-linear calculation has been carried out by means of a 2 D-model DIANA. Using this model, I have made a prediction, a plan of action and a set-up for the test load that is carried out (by Heijmans). The DIANA-model is calibrated with the results of the test. Lastly, the influence of the by <b>ground</b> enclosed <b>culvert</b> on the load-bearing capacity has been analyzed For all calculation models, the spread of the traffic load on the deck of the culvert is considered as uniformly distributed load. The load-bearing capacity and the assessing of the structural safety for the framework model (calculation model 1) is as follows. Applying the material properties assumed by PZH (design values), the culvert does not meet (UC = 1. 09 for shear force). Applying the design values of the measured material properties by the material research (with a non-exact reinforcement configuration) are used, the culvert still does not meet (UC = 1. 02 for shear force). Applying the (material properties of the calibrated model) upper limit of the design values of the measured values including spread and the exact reinforcement configuration, the culvert meets the assessment (UC = 0. 92 for shear force). The associated load-bearing capacity is 443 kN. With framework models, sufficient strength can be demonstrated using the measured values and exact reinforcement configuration. However, with an advanced model, a higher strength (in this case an increase of a factor 1. 9) can be determined. With the calibrated DIANA-model, a load-bearing capacity of 840 kN has been determined with a corresponding UC of 0. 53. The upper limit of the design values of the measured values including spread and the exact reinforcement configuration have been used for this calculation as well. This determined strength is including the maximum negative influence of the load-bearing capacity for culvert which is enclosed by ground. This reduced the load-bearing capacity by 10 %. In short, the culvert meets the test for assessing the structural safety for both models. An advanced model with a nonlinear calculation in EEM calculates a factor of 1. 9 higher load-bearing capacity and UC, compared with a framework model which is linear-elastic. This factor includes the maximum negative influence of the <b>culvert</b> in the <b>ground</b> and a conservative calibration of the model (DIANA-model is calibrated up to a maximum of 81 %). That means that this determined factor can actually be even higher. PZH is recommended to go through the following phases when assessing other culverts. Phase 1, design values should be used when there is enough information available about the culvert. When the UC does not meet, there should be continuation to phase 2. Here a materials research will be done. Precise determination of the material properties is important, especially the reinforcement configuration. It has been shown that it is worth paying extra attention to the reinforcement configuration. When the UC does not meet with the design values of the under limit of the design values of the measured values, there should be continuation to phase 3. Here, an advanced non-linear calculation is with FEM recommended, such as DIANA. The same material properties are assumed as in phase 2.
