40|$|Performance related pay (PRP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} for teachers in the UK, {{as part of a}} drive to improve the outcome of public service and teaching in particular. For the introduced <b>individual</b> PRP <b>scheme</b> to be effective, teachers must have an effect on pupil attainment, must respond to financial incentives, must respond to performance based pay and within this to <b>individual</b> PRP <b>schemes.</b> This review examines evidence on these issues, drawing in particular from the experience of the USA. We conclude that <b>individual</b> PRP <b>schemes</b> can result in small positive gains in pupil attainment, but that the current operation of the UK scheme is more akin to a general pay rise for eligible teachers than a PRP scheme.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} field {{experiment}} in 31 primary schools in England {{to test the}} effectiveness of different temporary incentive <b>schemes,</b> a standard <b>individual</b> based incentive <b>scheme</b> and a competitive scheme, on increasing the choice and consumption of healthy items at lunchtime. The <b>individual</b> <b>scheme</b> has a weak positive effect that masks significantly differential effects by age whereas all students respond positively to the competitive scheme. For our sample of interest, the competivie scheme increases choice of healthy items by 33 % and consumption of healthy items by 48 %, twice and {{three times as much}} as ain the <b>individual</b> incentive <b>scheme,</b> respectively. The positive effects generally carry over to the week immediately following the treatment but we find little evidence of any effects six months later. Our results show that incentives can work, at least temporarily, to increase healthy eating but that there are large differences in effectiveness between schemes. Furthermore it is important to analyse things at the individual level as average effects appear to be masking significant heterogeneous effects that are predicted by the health literature...|$|R

This study aims to analyze the credit process and transaction costs incurred on the model of individuals and groups lending and to compare the magnitude of transaction costs on both models. Mixed Method Analysis is used to analyze the component of transaction costs and the magnitude of the transaction cost on both models. These results indicate there are differences in transaction costs incurred on both schemes. In the amount of the transaction costs, the overall group scheme still allows for greater compared to <b>individual</b> <b>schemes</b> and dominated by the cost of the disbursement. Even so, the transaction cost per member group is much smaller than the <b>individual</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the feasibility and utility of economic appraisal of community water investments. In the first section the scope of current investments are detailed. In the second section we discuss the special problems associated with the proliferation of self-help water schemes. Public and private water investments together constitute an important commitment, and we explore the problem of judging whether this investment is at an appropriate level given national goals and available resources. It is evident that this difficult question cannot be satisfactorily answered until we have a more coherent understanding of the cost-effectiveness of <b>individual</b> <b>schemes.</b> Finally a set of criteria is suggested which may be used to obtain information about <b>individual</b> <b>schemes.</b> Application of these appraisal procedures will sharpen the judgement of decision makers making allocations within the sector.

30|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM)-based cognitive radio (CR) systems {{suffer from the}} large out-of-band emission (OOBE) that may interfere with other users. Since most existing OFDM OOBE suppression schemes are derived {{on the base of}} an original OFDM system without any other scheme, we first propose a generalized OFDM framework that is capable of describing these schemes no matter whether any {{one or more of the}} schemes is applied. Then, according to the place where these schemes are implemented in our framework, they are classified into three groups, namely symbol mapping techniques, precoding techniques, and time-domain techniques. Finally, based on the proposed framework, we propose three new schemes by combining a precoding scheme named singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding with three other schemes from the three groups, namely spectral precoding, N-continuous symbol mapping, and filtering. Numerical results show the power spectral density (PSD), peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and bit error rate (BER) performances of the three proposed schemes. Since the <b>individual</b> <b>schemes</b> have complementary characteristics, the three proposed combined schemes are constructed to maintain the merits and avoid the drawbacks of the <b>individual</b> <b>schemes</b> involved. Thus, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework can be employed to develop other new combined OOBE suppression schemes tailoring to some specific practical needs.|$|E
