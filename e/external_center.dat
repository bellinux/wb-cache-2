5000|$|If {{the circles}} {{have the same}} radius (but {{different}} centers), they have no external homothetic center in the affine plane: in analytic geometry this results in division by zero, while in synthetic geometry the lines [...] and [...] are parallel {{to the line of}} centers (both for secant lines and the bitangent lines) and thus have no intersection. An <b>external</b> <b>center</b> can be defined in the projective plane to be the point at infinity corresponding to the slope of this line.

5000|$|For a given pair of circles, the {{internal}} and external homothetic centers may be found in various ways. In analytic geometry, {{the internal}} homothetic center is the weighted average of the centers of the circles, weighted by the opposite circle's radius - distance from center of circle to inner center is proportional to that radius, so weighting is proportional to the opposite radius. Denoting the centers of the circles [...] and [...] by [...] and [...] and their radii by [...] and [...] and denoting the center by [...] this is:The <b>external</b> <b>center</b> can be computed by the same equation, but considering one of the radii as negative; either one yields the same equation, which is:More generally, taking both radii with the same sign (both positive or both negative) yields the inner center, while taking the radii with opposite signs (one positive and the other negative) yields the outer center. Note that the equation for the inner center is valid for any values (unless both radii zero or one is the negative of the other), but the equation for the <b>external</b> <b>center</b> requires that the radii be different, otherwise it involves division by zero.|$|E
50|$|For two circles, {{there are}} {{generally}} four distinct lines that are tangent to both (bitangent) - {{if the two}} circles are outside each other - but in degenerate cases there may be any number between zero and four bitangent lines; these are addressed below. For two of these, the external tangent lines, the circles fall {{on the same side}} of the line; for the two others, the internal tangent lines, the circles fall on opposite sides of the line. The external tangent lines intersect in the external homothetic center, whereas the internal tangent lines intersect at the internal homothetic center. Both the external and internal homothetic centers lie on the line of centers (the line connecting the centers of the two circles), closer to the center of the smaller circle: the internal center is in the segment between the two circles, while the <b>external</b> <b>center</b> is not between the points, but rather outside, on the side of the center of the smaller circle. If the two circles have equal radius, there are still four bitangents, but the external tangent lines are parallel and there is no <b>external</b> <b>center</b> in the affine plane; in the projective plane, the external homothetic center lies at the point at infinity corresponding to the slope of these lines.|$|E
5000|$|A {{special case}} of this approach, seen in Figure 3, is carried out with antihomologous points from an {{internal}} or <b>external</b> <b>center</b> of similarity. Consider two rays emanating from an external homothetic center E. Let the antihomologous pairs of intersection points of these rays with the two given circles be denoted as P and Q, and S and T, respectively. These four points lie on a common circle that intersects the two given circles in two points each. [...] Hence, the two lines joining P and S, and Q and T intersect at the radical center of the three circles, which lies on the radical axis of the given circles. [...] Similarly, the line joining two antihomologous points on separate circles and their tangents form an isosceles triangle, with both tangents being of equal length. [...] Therefore, such tangents meet on the radical axis.|$|E

In this article, {{we present a}} case of primary bladder endometriosis in a 33 year-old female patient who had undergone partial cystectomy.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between access to <b>external</b> shopping <b>centers</b> and the scale of downtown retailing for Swedish municipalities. To do so we propose two competing scenarios for how such a relationship may be shaped. These scenarios are (i) that an <b>external</b> shopping <b>center</b> can attract the customers that otherwise would shop in the downtown district, or possibly (ii) that the availability of and access to <b>external</b> shopping <b>centers</b> can increase the attractiveness of a given local retail market overall. The question we pose is important to answer for retailers {{as well as for}} local policymakers, as it can influence their investment decisions. We use a measure of access to <b>external</b> shopping <b>centers</b> to account for the distance sensitivity, and the spatial continuum in the retailing industry. By using geo-coded data, we determine the total number of shops at the 5 and 1 kilometer distance from the central business district in Swedish municipalities. To establish {{the relationship between}} access to <b>external</b> shopping <b>centers</b> in a municipality and the scale of its retail market, we use cross-sectional data from 2013, and perform several OLS multiple regression analyses. We find a positive relationship between access to <b>external</b> shopping <b>centers</b> and the scale of the downtown retail district. The result holds for urban municipalities and for the accessibility measures on the regional and extra-regional level. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} laser cooling concept for the {{translational}} motion of molecules {{which does not}} require repeated spontaneous emission by each molecule. The cooling works by repetition of three main steps; velocity selection of a narrow momentum width, deceleration of velocity selected molecules by repeated STIRAP and accumulation of decelerated molecules via one time spontaneous emission. We use single spontaneous emission for irreversible accumulation of narrow velocity selected and decelerated populations. We develop an analytical model to describe {{the evolution of the}} molecular gas system, internal subsystem and <b>external</b> (<b>center</b> of mass) subsystem density matrices and entropies. Simulation results show cooling from an arbitrary momentum width towards final width of about ħ k. The external entropy is reduced while the internal entropy is increased. The external entropy is shown to decrease during coherent laser interactions, a possibility of translational cooling via unitary evolution. The system entropy increases in consistency with the Araki-Lieb inequality...|$|E

On the other hand, there isn't clinical experience yet in nonoperative treatment of pregnant patients with gunshot injury.

Nonoperative management is a choice of treatment in carefully selected patients and well-defined strategy.

40|$|A {{derivation}} {{is given}} from first {{principles of the}} fact that the SU(2) gauge theory is in a confining phase for all values of the coupling 0 < g < ∞ defined at lattice spacing (UV regulator) a, and space-time dimension d ≤ 4. The strategy is to employ approximate RG decimation transformations of the potential moving type which give both upper and lower bounds on the partition function at each successive decimation step. By interpolation between these bounds an exact representation of the partition function is obtained on progressively coarser lattices. In the same manner, one obtains a representation of the partition function in the presence of <b>external</b> <b>center</b> flux. Under successive decimations the flow of the effective action in these representations is constrained by that in the upper and lower bounds which are easily explicitly computable. Confining behavior for the vortex free energy order parameter (ratio of partition functions with and without external flux), hence `area law' for the Wilson loop, is the result for any initial coupling. Keeping the string tension fixed determines the dependence g(a), which is such that g(a) → 0 for a → 0. Comment: 49 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} {{exposition of}} the rest-frame instant form of dynamics for arbitrary isolated systems (particles, fields, strings, fluids) admitting a Lagrangian description is given. The {{starting point is}} the parametrized Minkowski theory describing the system in arbitrary admissible non-inertial frames in Minkowski space-time, which allows one to define the energy-momentum tensor {{of the system and}} to show the independence of the description from the clock synchronization convention and from the choice of the 3 -coordinates. In the inertial rest frame the isolated system is seen as a decoupled non-covariant canonical <b>external</b> <b>center</b> of mass carrying a pole-dipole structure (the invariant mass M and the rest spin S⃗̅⃗ of the system) and an external realization of the Poincare' group. Then an isolated system of positive-energy charged scalar articles plus an arbitrary electro-magnetic field in the radiation gauge is investigated as a classical background for defining relativistic atomic physics. The electric charges of the particles are Grassmann-valued to regularize the self-energies. The rest-frame conditions and their gauge-fixings (needed for the elimination of the internal 3 -center of mass) are explicitly given. It is shown that there is a canonical transformation which allows one to describe the isolated system as a set of Coulomb-dressed charged particles interacting through a Coulomb plus Darwin potential plus a free transverse radiation field: these two subsystems are not mutually interacting and are interconnected only by the rest-frame conditions and the elimination of the internal 3 -center of mass. Therefore in this framework with a fixed number of particles there is a way out from the Haag theorem,at least at the classical level. Comment: Minor change...|$|E
40|$|Every quantum system {{subjected}} to measurements {{is an open}} quantum system. The cavity QED system is elegant in that it probes the interaction between two quantum systems, the atom and the field, while its loss mechanisms are well understood and can be externally monitored. The study of cross-correlations in cavity QED is important for understanding how entanglement evolves in open quantum systems. As quantum information science grows {{we need to learn}} more about entanglement and how it can be quantified and measured. Correlation functions have been used to compare an electromagnetic field (intensity) of one mode with the electromagnetic field (intensity) of the same mode at a later time or different spatial location. In quantum optics, correlation functions have been calculated and measured to probe the nonclassical field that results from the interaction of a single mode of the electromagnetic field and an ensemble of two-level atoms (the canonical cavity QED system). This field can exhibit antibunching, squeezing, and can violate inequalities required for a classical field. Entanglement in the steady state of a cavity QED system cannot be measured directly with traditional correlation functions (Hanbury-Brown and Twiss type experiments). Cross-correlations, however, interrogate directly both modes of the entangled pair, the transmitted (cavity) and the fluorescent (atom) intensities, and can act as an entanglement witness. This thesis presents the implementation of a cross-correlation measurement in a cavity QED system. The work has required the construction of an apparatus that incorporates laser cooling and trapping with quantum optics to carefully control both the <b>external</b> (<b>center</b> of mass motion) and internal (atomic state) degrees of freedom of a collection of atoms that interact with a single mode of a high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. We examine theoretically and experimentally a new intensity cross-correlation function which probes the evolution of the cavity field conditioned on the detection of a fluorescent photon from an atom in the cavity. The results open the possibility to generalize the dynamics of entanglement as a physical resource necessary for the nascent quantum information science...|$|E
