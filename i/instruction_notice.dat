30|$|As commented by Vaez Dalili (2011) {{the field}} of {{language}} teaching pedagogy has witnessed a resurgence {{of interest in the}} pivotal role of grammar instruction.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether explicit instruction focusing on metaphorical collocations would promote the incidental noticing of similar phrases by English learners during a subsequent reading task. Noticing was operationalized using the remember-know protocol and learning was measured on a fill-in-the-blanks test. In Experiment 1 (N = 36), within-subjects comparisons showed that explicit instruction led to more incidents of noticing (p &lt;. 001). Experiment 2 (N = 24) sought to extend the findings by examining whether self-referential questions during instruction would lead to greater noticing compared to depersonalized questions. Experiment 2 confirmed the first experiment&rsquo;s finding of effects of explicit <b>instruction</b> on <b>noticing,</b> but failed to show significant effects for self-referential prompts on subsequent noticing, although such prompts did lead learners to produce higher word counts during the writing task. The two experiments suggest that explicit <b>instruction</b> promotes incidental <b>noticing</b> of important semantic contrasts in subsequent input.

40|$|Canadian {{statistics}} show that children from birth to four years of age {{are more likely to}} be reported with an infection from Campylobacter, Giardia, Salmonella and Shigella species, and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli than any other age group. A review of the Canadian and international literature, and an analysis of case and outbreak data suggest that the risk factors for infection in young children (ages birth to four years) are different from the risk factors for older children and adults. In children from birth to four years of age, infant formula, fast foods, snacks and candies have caused major outbreaks of enteric and foodborne diseases; however, the contamination of a child’s environment or the presence of ill individuals in a household may be highly significant to disease expression. Contact with animals (including family pets) and contaminated surfaces, together with experimental touching and testing behaviours, are important routes of infection for infants and preschool children. Risk factors for enteric infections in children appear to be related, occasionally, to specific foods that are particularly attractive to all children (all age groups from infants up to and including elementary school-aged childen), to an infected person or pet in the same household, or to the contamination of a child’s environment. Nonfood-related risk factors may be of particular significance in infection in infants and very young children. Contact with animals, particularly exotic pets and farm animals, or their environments should be considered to be a potential source of infection in children in situations in which there is an absence of other risk factors. The evidence presented in the current paper emphasizes the importance of personal and home hygiene practices in limiting children’s exposure to enteric pathogens. Strict hand washing practices and restrictions on touching birds, reptiles and other animals at petting zoos or in nursery and primary school facilities are recommended to avoid widespread infection. Public health authorities should consider the development of guidelines on the provision of hand washing facilities and <b>instruction</b> <b>notices</b> in settings where the public may come into contact with farm or other animals in jurisdictions where such guidelines do not already exist...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how formal instruction and language exposure influence learners' perception and output of Japanese sentence-final forms. 44 learners participated, divided into four groups by sex and proficiency level (lower or higher), and 28 native speakers (NS). All participants were required to assess 31 Japanese sentence-final forms, from the perspective of how often they hear and use them in daily conversation, and for the learners only, how explicitly they were explained in class. Path-analysis was used to see the relationships between learner's perception and frequency of output, explicitness of formal instruction, frequency of NS's use, and NS's tendency of use by sex. This analysis was done separately for each group, which were then compared. After the assessment the learners were interviewed to identify how they learn sentence-final forms. The results indicate the following, (1). The learner's perception is constrained by his/her lack of knowledge and low proficiency. Especially for lower-level learners, formal <b>instructions</b> promote <b>noticing</b> of sentence-final forms by makin g it possible for the learners to attend to the forms. (2). Language exposure has a larger effect on higher level learners than lower level learners, exposure with situational information gives learners the key to understand the meaning and function of each sentence-final form...|$|R
40|$|Discourse {{practices}} in mathematics classes {{have been proven}} to lead to greater student achievement. Policy and standards require {{students are able to}} justify and critique mathematical reasoning. Literature on how high school mathematics teachers implement discourse practices and facilitate discussions is scarce. This research study examined how three high school mathematics teachers, who participated in a professional development course which focused on facilitating discussions in the classroom, used and described their use of discussions and specifically the teacher discourse moves (TDMs) in their classes. This study was situated in a high-achieving suburban upper-middle class district. Data sources included: journal reflections, responses to Use of Discourse Surveys, Beliefs Mappings, interviews (including post-observation Video Stimulated Recall (VSR) interviews) and classroom observations. Each participant was observed teaching four lessons. Qualitative analyses revealed that participants’ beliefs related to discourse and classroom expectations evolved. The results of this study confirmed that facilitating whole class discussions was challenging for high school mathematics teachers. In particular, some Teacher Discourse Moves (TDMs) were easier for participants to use over others and some changes were easier for participants to make such as utilizing different activity structures. Factors that contributed to participants’ use of discussion included: professional development, watching one’s own teaching, noticing changes in students’ behaviors, previous instruction on learning to teach, perceptions of student capabilities, perceptions of time constraints, and lack of reflective practice. Despite these challenges, participants were able to make positive changes in their <b>instruction</b> and <b>notice</b> an increase in student engagement as a result. Participating in VSR interviews had a dramatic impact on the participants’ beliefs, reflection and changes in practice...|$|R
30|$|In the ‘focus on forms’ <b>instruction</b> condition, the <b>noticing</b> phase {{involved}} asking {{language learners}} {{to read the}} passage as many times they needed and answer the comprehension and vocabulary exercises that followed the unit. In this phase, language learners were asked to try to guess the meaning of formulaic sequences from context and/or have the sequences explained to them. In the retrieving phase, an approach, known as role-play or exchange structure, was used. In this approach, language learners were given a context or scenario {{and were asked to}} orally exchange information using formulaic sequences. For example, one language learner could extend an invitation (e.g., Would you like to come to my birthday party on Friday?), and the other language learner accepted (e.g., Yes, thanks a lot) or refused the invitation (e.g., I’d love to, but …). In the generating phase, language learners were provided with definitions for formulaic sequences using example sentences which were different from those encountered in the textual input. Language learners were then asked to isolate formulaic sequences in sentences and create new texts around them.|$|R
40|$|Tasks {{have been}} shown to have a number of {{potential}} benefits for learning and their use has become increasingly popular in recent years (cf. Ellis 2003). One aspect of tasks that has received relatively little attention is the effect of the accompanying instructions. Does asking learners to pay attention to a certain aspect of the language help them to learn it? This paper reports on a study of the effects of implicit instructions (exposure only) and explicit instructions (exposure plus a <b>noticing</b> <b>instruction)</b> on acquisition of two grammatical structures. Participants were pretested for prior knowledge of the target structures and then completed three treatments followed by a posttest and a delayed posttest. Performance on the pre,- and posttests was compared to establish if there was a signifcant effect for the instructions that accompanied the treatments. It was found that 1) the explicit instructions did not have an effect on what participants learned from the input, and that 2) the explicit instructions can even inhibit acquisition in the case of relatively complex structures. One of the implications {{of this study is that}} teachers need to be aware of the interaction between the types of instructions they give and the complexity of the target structures...|$|R

Calls to other subroutines, functions or COMMON blocks are resolved through RLD records, which modify the address as stored in a TXT record to determine the complete address of the subroutine or function.

30|$|In the ‘focus on form’ <b>instruction</b> condition, the <b>noticing</b> phase {{involved}} directing language learners’ attention toward formulaic sequences {{included in}} the reading passages through highlighting them. In this phase, language learners received copies of the reading passages in which formulaic sequences were written in boldface type. Language learners were asked to read the text {{as many times as}} they needed and answer reading comprehension and vocabulary exercises that followed each unit. They were allowed to check their dictionaries or ask for the meaning of unfamiliar words or expressions. In the retrieving phase, following Nation and Newton (2009), the disappearing text technique was used. In this technique, a passage of approximately 50 to 60 words containing a number of formulaic sequences was selected and was written on the board, and a language learner was asked to read it aloud. Then some of the formulaic sequences were deleted and another language learner was asked to read the passage aloud, supplying the missing formulaic sequences as he or she read. Then more formulaic sequences were deleted, and this continued until there were no formulaic sequences at all on the board and the language learners were repeating the passage from their memory. In the generating phase, excerpts from other reading sources in which the same formulaic sequences taught during the session had been used in a different context and again in boldface type were given to language learners. Language learners were then asked to read the excerpts and answer the comprehension and vocabulary exercises that followed them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Accidents with {{fertilizer}} distributors at work {{happen in}} the Austrian agriculture every year. In accordance with Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC and the standards ISO 4254 - 1 and DIN EN 14017, fertilizer distributors undergo a risk assessment before construction and market entry to ensure their complying with these legal recommendations and to eliminate largely the risk of injury for the operators. To determine the accident scenarios, causes, and technical solutions, a narrative analysis of 14 reports of accidents that led to moderate and serious injuries from 2008 to 2010 was done, eight victims interviewed, and seven accident machines and eight new ones, which were sold in 2013, evaluated according to applicable regulations. Mostly farm managers were involved in accidents with mineral fertilizer distributors during coupling and uncoupling and filling mainly on the farmyard. During coupling and uncoupling, farm managers collided with the machine itself, and during filling with the fertilizer chunks of the big bags. Falls from the machine were caused by slips and missteps during fertilizing, filling, and cleaning tasks. Farm managers were hit by the machine by coming {{into contact with the}} running spreading unit during fertilization and maintenance tasks. The accident machines showed large and the new machines low permanent deficits in <b>instruction</b> and warning <b>notices</b> as well in constructional execution. Potential constructive improvements are the standardized provision of instructions and warnings, standard-compliant boarding (ladders, grab rails, platforms, etc.) and loading means (lift arms, platforms) for filling and monitoring the container contents, sufficient space or hydraulic coupling elements for coupling, uncoupling, and unfolding of spreader units, and protective devices for agitators in new machines.

All this newness can be both exciting and intimidating. If you have a feeling of being overwhelmed, take some comfort {{in the fact that the}} faculty and your predecessors have all been in the same spot – more or less – and survived. This booklet is meant to help you out in one of these new experiences, that of being a TA. Be assured, the job of a TA is a very important one to the department, and it must be carried out properly, thoughtfully, and with some maturity. This may be a new kind of responsibility for you. However, you are not given many specifics for doing the job. This lack of specifics, in many ways, is the nature of teaching. During your undergraduate days you’ve noticed many styles and methods of <b>instruction.</b> You probably <b>noticed</b> also that these styles and methods were each tied to the personality of the instructor. This is one of the fundamentals of university teaching. Specific techniques, methods, and a style that works well for one member of the teaching staff seldom works the same for another. Nevertheless, most of us have found it useful to know what others are doing in their classrooms and laboratories. This knowledge is usually a starting point for new course planning in the department or when we think about changing our own particular classroom routines. We hope this booklet will help you somewhat in the same way as you begin your TA responsibilities.

40|$|Plan B Paper. 2013. Master of Arts-TESOL [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls. English Department. 77 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 59 - 63). Since the 1960 s, {{computers have}} been used within the language classroom as a supplemental tool to enhance instruction in the target language. Teachers have incorporated the computer into their lessons to provide additional support and perhaps supply {{a clearer understanding of}} the content to the students. With the progress of technology, the computer has become a much more efficient machine, which is a clear indication as to why it is being increasingly used in the classroom. Currently, I teach an English grammar skills course (Reading and Writing Strategies) at a college in the Twin Cities area. I teach in a residential classroom setting, where the students attend class once a week. I deliver the material in a traditional manner: using the white board to define concepts, passing out worksheets to practice the material, setting up pair/group work activities. In addition, the students also use the computer in my classroom to perform practice exercises while focusing on the content. I have been teaching for quite some time, both at the college level and in the public sector. Incorporating the computer into the lessons has always been an essential part of my instruction. I use this only as a tool to support, not replace my <b>instruction.</b> I have <b>noticed</b> that students find value in being given additional resources as they are working on learning the core concepts of the class. Moreover, the computer often is an engaging tool that retains students' interest while they are working on the content. The course (Reading and Writing Strategies) that I teach is offered to both native and non-native English speakers, and both types of students are combined into the same class. This course reviews basic grammatical concepts for all students. The nonnative English student makes different language errors/mistakes as opposed to the native speaker. Therefore, it is imperative that additional resources are provided to nonnative learners to assist them in their language learning and allow them to focus on areas that specific to their needs. In addition, these resources will help future instructors if faced with a similar situation...|$|R
