2500|$|Joel Coen {{seems to}} agree. In an {{interview}} with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that [...] "overall [...] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' <b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'" [...] In addition, Ethan Coen states that [...] "we're not conscious of it, [...] {{to the extent that}} we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [...] it is by accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013, at the hospital, Maxine tells Cameron she's glad Abigail has {{someone to}} lean on with {{everything}} she's going through right now. He admits they're just friends and looks deflated. Maxine's sorry she assumed. He leaves. She can tell he's got it bad for Abby. In the square Gabi walks by, she drops her books and Cameron sees. He helps pick them up. Nick walks over, picks up Gabi's bag {{and hands it to}} Cameron saying [...] "You missed one." [...] It's awkward. He leaves and goes back to the hospital and texts Chad. They need to talk. Maxine tells Cam to find Gabi in the waiting room. She has questions about her brother's therapy. Cameron heads over and overhears Abigail tell Gabi she and Chad 'did it'. <b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looks upset. Cameron decides to pay Chad a visit and asks how could he lie to Abby and set her up? Chad notices his computer is open to the treatment search and feigns a headache. He closes the laptop as Cam gets him water. Chad apologizes that he had to lose in this situation. Cameron's worried about Abigail's vulnerability. Chad says Abby wanted it and gives him a reason to live. Cameron won't say how he found out but agrees to stay out of it. Chad realizes Cameron loves her. Cameron only says Abby's his friend and he cares for them both before going back to the hospital where he bumps into Abby and they share an awkward moment.|$|E

6000|$|If {{you ask the}} boy {{there who}} tells you the law, [...] "Why not a chickadee {{as well as a}} sparrow?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as of yore, and answers dogmatically: [...] "'Cause you mustn't." ...|$|E

60|$|RAINA (disarmed by pity). Come, don't be disheartened. (She stoops {{over him}} almost maternally: <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.)</b> Oh, {{you are a}} very poor soldier--a {{chocolate}} cream soldier. Come, cheer up: it takes less courage to climb down than to face capture--remember that.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. Yes: they {{object to}} the smell in the office; and we've had to take to cigarets. See! [She opens the box {{and takes out a}} cigaret, which she lights.

6000|$|CUTHBERTSON (impatiently). Ibsen, man: Ibsen. (He {{goes out}} by the {{staircase}} door followed by Sylvia, who kisses her hand to the bust as she passes. Craven stares blankly after her, and then up at the bust. Giving the problem up as insoluble, <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and follows them.

6000|$|... (There is a salt {{smile on}} his face as <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to her. He lets the cloak slip to the ground. She will not take this for an answer; again her arms go out to him. Then comes the great renunciation. By an effort of will he ceases to be an erect figure; he has the humble bearing of a servant. His hands come {{together}} as if he were washing them.) ...|$|E
60|$|As Doctor Crocus {{says these}} latter words, <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> knowingly, and laughs again. Many of the {{bystanders}} {{shake their heads}} {{in concert with the}} doctor, and laugh too, and look at each other as much as to say, 'A pretty bright and first-rate sort of chap is Crocus!' and unless I am very much mistaken, a good many people went to the lecture that night, who never thought about phrenology, or about Doctor Crocus either, in all their lives before.|$|E

6000|$|RUFIO (startled, and puzzled). It was not you: {{you were}} with us when it happened. (She turns her back scornfully on him. <b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and draws the {{curtains}} to go out. It is now a magnificent moonlit night. The table has been removed.

Rufio starts; closes the curtains again softly; and says in a low voice to Cleopatra) Was it she? With her own hand? ...|$|E
6000|$|CAESAR (taking the dates). My age! (<b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and bites a date.) Yes, Rufio: I am an old man--worn out now--true, quite true. (He {{gives way}} to melancholy contemplation, and eats another date.) Achillas is still in his prime: Ptolemy is a boy. (He eats another date, and plucks up a little.) Well, every dog has his day; and I have had mine: I cannot complain. (With sudden cheerfulness) These dates are not bad, Rufio. (Britannus returns, greatly excited, with a leathern bag. Caesar is himself again in a moment.) What now? ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{lowering}} {{of the bottle}} interrupts Policeman Hogan. The long letter to Aunt Dorothea has cooled the ardour of Mr. Scalper. The generous blush has passed from his mind {{and he has been}} trying in vain to restore it. To afford Hogan a similar opportunity, he decides not to haul the bottle up immediately, but to leave it in his custody while he delineates a character. The writing of this correspondent would seem to the inexperienced eye to be that of a timid little maiden in her teens. Mr. Scalper is not to be deceived by appearances. <b>He</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> mournfully at the letter and writes: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{the flowers}} belonged to this poor boy,' said Tim; 'that's all. When it is fine weather, {{and he can}} crawl out of bed, he draws a chair close to the window, and sits there, looking at them and {{arranging}} them, all day long.

'Roy,' says the kid, with a sirloiny sound to it. But when the rest of it and his post-office address is referred to, <b>he</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'I guess not,' he says. 'You'll send me back. I want to stay with you. I like this camping out. At home, we fellows had a camp in our back yard. They called me Roy, the Red Wolf! I guess that'll do for a name. Gimme another piece of beefsteak, please.' ...|$|E
