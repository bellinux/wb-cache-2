Cyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances in 2011 and 2012. Her sexually explicit behavior generated widespread controversy while promoting her fourth album Bangerz (2013), her first under her recording contract with RCA Records. Cyrus' independently-released fifth studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) deviated from her traditional pop style for more psychedelic experimentation. The following year, she became a coach on the singing competition television series The Voice; she has since appeared on two of its thirteen seasons.

5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's <b>image.</b> <b>With</b> a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{tremendous}} improvements for facial landmark detection on general "in-the-wild" images. However, {{it is still}} challenging to detect the facial landmarks on <b>images</b> <b>with</b> severe occlusion and <b>images</b> <b>with</b> large head poses (e. g. profile face). In fact, the existing algorithms usually can only handle one of them. In this work, we propose a unified robust cascade regression framework that can handle both <b>images</b> <b>with</b> severe occlusion and <b>images</b> <b>with</b> large head poses. Specifically, the method iteratively predicts the landmark occlusions and the landmark locations. For occlusion estimation, instead of directly predicting the binary occlusion vectors, we introduce a supervised regression method that gradually updates the landmark visibility probabilities in each iteration to achieve robustness. In addition, we explicitly add occlusion pattern as a constraint to improve the performance of occlusion prediction. For landmark detection, we combine the landmark visibility probabilities, the local appearances, and the local shapes to iteratively update their positions. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method is significantly better than state-of-the-art works on <b>images</b> <b>with</b> severe occlusion and <b>images</b> <b>with</b> large head poses. It is also comparable to other methods on general "in-the-wild" images. Comment: International Conference on Computer Vision, 201...|$|R
40|$|<b>Images</b> <b>with</b> signal-dependent noise present {{challenges}} {{beyond those}} of <b>images</b> <b>with</b> additive white or colored signal-independent noise {{in terms of}} designing the optimal 4 -f correlation filter that maximizes correlation-peak signal-to-noise ratio, or combinations of correlation-peak metrics. Determining the proper design becomes more difficult when the filter is to be implemented on a constrained-modulation spatial light modulator device. The design issues involved for updatable optical filters for <b>images</b> <b>with</b> signal-dependent film-grain noise and speckle noise are examined. It is shown that although design of the optimal linear filter in the Fourier domain is impossible for <b>images</b> <b>with</b> signal-dependent noise, proper nonlinear preprocessing of the images allows the application of previously developed design rules for optimal filters to be implemented on constrained-modulation devices. Thus the nonlinear preprocessing becomes necessary for correlation in optical systems with current spatial light modulator technology. These results are illustrated with computer simulations of <b>images</b> <b>with</b> signal-dependent noise correlated with binary-phase-only filters and ternary-phase-amplitude filters...|$|R

Another Scottsdale landmark hotel, the Mountain Shadows Resort, opened the following year, in 1959. These three tourist havens reflected a desired cosmopolitan and exotic feel on Scottsdale.|$|E

5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} <b>image</b> <b>with</b> nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E

5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the <b>image</b> <b>with</b> the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E
