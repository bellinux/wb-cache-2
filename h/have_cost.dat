40|$|One of {{analysis}} methode that is use to evaluate construction project management {{in order to}} minimize cost, work optimation & time efectivity with also care about the project quality is by using value engineering. The main reason to use this Analysis methode is the systematic and procedural approach in the object evaluation. Stages on the job plan are information stage, creative, analysis & recommendation stages which is the first one is the specify the item with highest cost, then the analyse stage to choose the alternative for the life cycle cost compare & to classifiet the main & seconding functional to get cost/wort ratio. Is the result of this engineering analysis is cost minim for example on the foundation work <b>has</b> <b>cost</b> minimizing until Rp. 125. 855. 576, 30. On the concrete slab work <b>has</b> <b>cost</b> minimizing until Rp. 78. 988. 937, 72. On the nain bean work <b>has</b> <b>cost</b> minimizing until Rp. 24. 308. 712, 38.
