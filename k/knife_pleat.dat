50|$|A kilt can be pleated {{with either}} box or knife pleats. A <b>knife</b> <b>pleat</b> {{is a simple}} fold, while the box pleat is bulkier, {{consisting}} of two knife pleats back-to-back. Knife pleats {{are the most common}} in modern civilian kilts. Regimental traditions vary. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders use box pleats, while the Black Watch make their kilts of the same tartan with knife pleats. These traditions were also passed on to affiliated regiments in the Commonwealth, and were retained in successor battalions to these regiments in the amalgamated Royal Regiment of Scotland.|$|E

In recent years, the term skort has been given to any skirt with an attached pair of shorts.|$|R
