40|$|This study {{examines}} gift giving at Israeli weddings. In accordance with kin selection theory, {{we hypothesized that}} wedding guests possessing greater genetic relatedness to the newlyweds would offer greater sums of money as wedding gifts. We also hypothesized that family members stemming from the maternal side (where the genetic lineage has higher kinship certainty), would offer the newlyweds more money than those stemming from the paternal side. Data on the monetary <b>gift</b> <b>sums</b> of the wedding guests from 30 weddings were collapsed according to two criteria: (1) genetic relatedness (0 %, 6. 25 %, 12. 5 %, 25 %, and 50 %) and (2) kinship certainty (maternal or paternal lineage). Both hypotheses were supported. We discuss {{the implications of these}} data in understanding family dynamics, as well as practical applications associated with the marketing of gifts...|$|R

50|$|The contest {{selected}} {{many stars}} like Chen Chusheng, Jason Zhang, Chen Xiang, Vision Wei, Hua Chenyu and so on. It gives the young boys, who love music, {{the way to}} achieve dreams. But it also caused some criticism. Some people think it contributes to the atmosphere of daydream of becoming stars. Many young people change their attention from study to music and singing, without considering whether they have this <b>gift.</b> In <b>sum,</b> it once became a fashion.|$|R
5000|$|In 1829, Halhed then Commissioner of Chittagong reaffirmed that: [...] The hill tribes {{were not}} British {{subjects}} but merely tributaries and we recognized no right {{on our part}} to interfere with their internal arrangements. The near neighbourhood of a powerful and stable government naturally brought the Chief by degree under control and every leading chief paid to the Chittagong collector a certain tribute or yearly <b>gifts.</b> These <b>sums</b> were at first fluctuating in amount but gradually were brought to specific and fixed limit, eventually taking the shape not as tribute but as revenue to the state.|$|R
60|$|The {{people of}} England were in very bad humor too. You will observe that the {{inducements}} which Louis employed in procuring the treaty were <b>gifts</b> and <b>sums</b> of money granted to Edward himself, {{and to his}} great courtiers personally for their own private uses. There was nothing in his concessions which tended {{at all to the}} aggrandizement or to the benefit of the English realm, or to promote the interest of the people at large. They thought, therefore, that Edward and his counselors had been induced to sacrifice the rights and honor of the crown and the kingdom to their own personal advantage by a system of gross and open bribery, and they were very much displeased.|$|R
40|$|In one of {{its last}} {{opinions}} of the 2010 term, the U. S. Supreme Court decided, in Stern v. Marshall, that Anna Nicole Smith, a former Playboy model and minor television celebrity, will get nothing from the estate of her late husband, J. Howard Marshall II, a billionaire Texas oil tycoon. This {{marks the end of}} a sixteen-year battle about whether J. Howard’s son, Pierce Marshall, wrongfully interfered with his father’s alleged plans to <b>gift</b> substantial <b>sums</b> of money and property to his new, and much younger, bride. In this column, I’ll explain the history of the litigation, including how it got {{all the way to the}} U. S Supreme Court (twice), and comment on why the Justices ruled as they did...|$|R

5000|$|Seidlin was criminally {{investigated}} for [...] "allegedly asking {{a lawyer for}} gifts and financially exploiting an elderly woman". In February 2007, former Florida attorney Jack Thompson of Coral Gables filed a formal complaint against Seidlin to Judicial Qualifications Commission for [...] "violating almost every judicial canon". The complaint {{was based on an}} investigative report in a local weekly newspaper that reported that the judge had received questionable <b>gifts</b> and large <b>sums</b> of money from Barbara Kasler, an elderly neighbor in his Fort Lauderdale condo building. After an investigation by the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office, Seidlin was cleared of any wrongdoing in January 2009.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{award of}} honorary life membership {{was accompanied by}} a <b>gift</b> (the <b>sum</b> of one guinea per member of the executive committee). To retain this tradition honorary life members today receive a special silver badge. Conceived by Richard Faragher and noted jewellery designer Clara Vichi, the badge incorporates a stylised shell motif and the initials of the British Society for Research on Ageing. Vichi has achieved widespread recognition for designs of this type, which draw inspiration from calligraphy and typography. The choice of a shell as the symbol of life membership combines insights from modern gerontology with the symbolism of medieval pilgrim badges. It is at once a reference to Arctica islandica (the longest-living non-colonial animal) and to the scallop shells worn by medieval pilgrims. To the original pilgrims the radial ridges on the shells they wore represented the different routes pilgrims travelled, eventually converging on their shared destination. Similarly, the membership of the BSRA study the biology of ageing in very different ways but share the common goal of creating a longer, healthier human lifespan.|$|R
25|$|A gift of $50,000 from W. B. Astor came in 1866, {{of which}} $20,000 {{was used for}} {{purchase}} of books, the remainder was for the general funds of the library. This <b>gift</b> brought the <b>sum</b> total presented by him to $300,000, {{not to mention the}} installation of a new system of heating apparatus in 1867 for which he paid $6,545.74. Of the $700,000 received from the Astors, father and son (increased about two per cent, by investments, etc.) $283,324.98 was expended for site, building, and equipment; $203,012.38 for books, binding, freight, etc., leaving an endowment fund of $229,000. The income in 1866 was $11,664.31, expenses $8,975.31.|$|R
50|$|A {{prospective}} husband paid {{money or}} offered {{land for a}} woman's hand in marriage. This was paid to her directly {{and she had the}} right to do with it as she pleased. It is made clear that the marriage finances were held by both man and woman. A woman was free to leave a marriage, keeping in mind the only times divorce was documented in cases of adultery; and if the woman did leave and take the children, she was entitled to half the property. These <b>gifts</b> were substantial <b>sums</b> and generally property. The gifts given by the groom were sometimes viewed as a sale of the bride, when, in actuality, it was to safeguard her interests and add security.|$|R
50|$|The libel actions {{arose from}} {{a piece that}} Private Eye {{published}} following the disappearance of Lord Lucan after {{the murder of his}} children's nanny. The article stated (incorrectly) that Goldsmith had participated in a meeting called by John Aspinall after Lucan's disappearance, and further claimed that the meeting amounted to a conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice by hampering the police enquiries. Goldsmith certainly was acquainted with Lucan as a fellow regular at Aspinall's gambling club, the Clermont, {{but it is not clear}} how close they were (but apparently on good enough terms for Lucan to ask him for a loan of £10,000 the previous year, and for Goldsmith to counter with an offer to make him a <b>gift</b> of that <b>sum).</b>|$|R
500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Salon.com and The Scotsman. Louis Bayard of Salon.com {{disagreed}} with the delivery of the final chapter, on ecological debt, writing that Atwood [...] "forsakes artistic engagement for ideological reflex". William Skidelsky in The Guardian agreed that the chapter was [...] "by no means {{the highlight of the}} book". [...] He also wrote: [...] "Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't always give herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic. The result is that, although Payback is packed with information, it can seem oddly thin... Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for her subject and lively style {{go a long way toward}} making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a <b>gift</b> for <b>summing</b> up an idea with a single vivid image." [...] Allan Massie, reviewing for The Scotsman, could not find a coherent argument being presented and found her writing style [...] "veering uncomfortably between the academic and the jokily colloquial, [...] tiresome, [...] some of her writing is pretentious, much obvious and platitudinous". The reviewers in Salon.com and The Scotsman, as well as The Economist, were all uncomfortable with Atwood not distinguishing or contrasting 'good' and 'bad' debt.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike his father, Ahmad Pasha had {{to lobby}} for the {{position}} of beylerbey ("provincial governor") of the Damscus Eyalet. According to Arab historian Rifaat Abu al-Haj, Ahmad Pasha had to send to <b>gifts</b> and large <b>sums</b> of money to [...] "countless vezirs and bureaucrats" [...] in the Ottoman capital Istanbul before being awarded the province in 1601. During his rule, Ahmad Pasha became a patron of Muslim jurists and {{is known to have}} regularly consulted the ulema, high-ranking Muslim scholars, on provincial affairs. Abu al-Haj wrote that by the time Ahmad Pasha had gained the governorship of Damascus, Ahmad had grown old. He died, while still in power, in 1607. Following his death, Ahmads son Hasan [...] "Arab" [...] Pasha inherited the governorship of Gaza and took part in putting down the revolt of Fakhr-al-Din II in modern-day Lebanon.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{literature on}} organ donation and transplantation has drawn {{attention to the}} popularity of "gift of life" discourse among pro-donation advocates, transplantation specialists, and within organisations lobbying for improved donation rates to promote the benefits of organ donation {{among members of the}} general public. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, gift of life discourse is robust. Aside from attempts to elicit altruism by promoting tissue donation in the public domain, gift terminology separates the act of donation from that of commerce and the commodification of body tissues. In distancing donation from commodification and the potential to degrade and exploit human beings, it is assumed that gift discourse transmits the positive message that donation is a noble and morally worthy act. Recent sociological research has shown that assumptions of the gift as one-way and altruistic do not necessarily align with people's perceptions and experience of donating body tissues, and that the vocabulary used to describe these acts is often at variance with reality. This article draws on interview data with 15 critical care specialists (intensivists) and donor and recipient coordinators, examining their perceptions of the relevance of gift discourse and its applicability in the context of deceased donation in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The data indicate several problems with gift rhetoric to describe the situations health professionals encounter. In <b>sum,</b> <b>gift</b> terminology tends to downplay the sacrifice involved in tissue donation generally, as well as depoliticising the exchange relations of tissue transfer in contemporary consumer culture and in the global context. This raises questions about the underlying ethics of language choice and what, if anything, empirical accounts of tissue transfer can contribute to ethical debates.

50|$|Vijay (Prithviraj) is a {{business}} man who always listens to his brain, and Pavitra (Andrea) - {{the daughter of a}} famous businessman CS Nambiar (Pratap Pothen) - is a girl who always listens to her heart. Vijay was asked to marry Pavitra by her dad and Pavitra is testing whether Vijay is the right guy for her. Driving his way home from spending a day with Pavitra, Vijay hits Merin (Nanditha), a nurse who has just arrived from India to work in London. Her wrist gets paralysed after the accident. Vijay takes care of her and eventually falls in love with Merin and vice versa. Pavitra's dad and Francis (Mukesh) fixes Vijay and Pavitra's marriage. But when he refuses to marry her, Francis forces him to get married to Pavitra because of her wealth. Merin's job agreement gets terminated because they think that she is physically unfit. Francis tries to help her but he fails. Eventually, Francis forces Vijay to not give her false hopes and <b>gift</b> her a <b>sum</b> of money and let her go back to India. Merin refuses the amount of money gifted and asks him to show her around London before she leaves. Then Merin goes back to India. The next day, her aunt Gracy (Lena) calls Vijay to tell that Merin has not reached her home yet. Gracy's husband Thai Kutty (Sunil), tells them that he will go to India to enquire about Merin but Vijay says that he will go instead because {{he is the one who}} is supposed to go. Francis tries to force him to stay, but Vijay says that he really likes Merin and he will go to India, no matter what. Pavitra helps him to go to India by convincing her dad to not stop him and personally dropping him at the airport. Vijay reaches India. While in a taxi, Francis calls Vijay and directs him to go to Merin's home. Vijay reaches Merin's home to find her house being seized to debt. He finds out that Merin has reached home safely. The movie ends by Vijay revealing to Pavitra that Merin had reached home safely, but lied to make Vijay realize his love for her.|$|R
