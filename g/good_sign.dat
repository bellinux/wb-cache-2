5|$|The Mets {{performance}} in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued this was a <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> {{for the future of}} baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed that baseball needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership.|$|E
5|$|After {{the club}} was relegated in 1969–70, the 1970s, and 1980s {{consisted}} of little other than mediocrity and struggling against re-election.In February 1984 Stockport competed in their first Associate Members' Cup match against Crewe Alexandra in a competition their chairman at the time' Dragan Lukic' helped create. The matched finished 2–2 after extra time and as so was decided in a penalty shoot-out; the first in Stockport's history. Stockport went on to lose 3–0 on penalties. The introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Conference was not a <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> for Stockport, and in 1986–87 they had just six points from 13 games and faced a real prospect of non-League football, exemplified by being eliminated from the FA Cup by Caernarfon Town. Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager. Stockport gained 45 points from their final 31 games and survived, although Murphy left shortly {{after the end of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the bat; one is that bats are simply quite common in the area. The second theory is that on 9 October 1238, when James I was {{about to enter the}} city, re-conquering it from the Moors, a bat landed {{on the top of his}} flag, and he interpreted it as a <b>good</b> <b>sign.</b> As he conquered the city, the bat was added to the arms.|$|E
25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared {{and go back to}} sleep for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, it is a sign that the winter is not over yet. If it is cloudy, it is a <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> that the winter is about to end.|$|E

25|$|Christmas {{is celebrated}} for three days. On {{the second day}} of Christmas, neighbors visit each other. On the third day, Christmas straw is taken out of the house.

A bigger bundle may be stored in a dry place: it will be burned on St. George's Day, as a {{protection}} of fields against hail. Another bundle is taken away across the nearest stream – a symbolic elimination of all the vermin that may be present in the house. Men make crosses from the remnant of the thicker side of badnjak, and stick them under eaves, on fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries.

25|$|There {{once took}} place a great {{competition}} between the Devas to decide who among them should {{be the head of}} the Gana (the troops of semi-gods at the service of Shiva). The competitors were required to circle the world as fast as possible and return to the Feet of Parvati. The gods took off, each on his or her own vehicle, and even Ganesha participated with enthusiasm in the race; but he was extremely heavy and was riding on a mouse! Naturally, his pace was remarkably slow and this was a great disadvantage. He had not yet made much headway when there appeared before him the sage Narada (son of Brahma), who asked him where he was going. Ganesha was very annoyed and went into a rage because it was considered unlucky to encounter a solitary Brahmin just {{at the beginning of a}} voyage. Notwithstanding the fact that Narada was the greatest of Brahmins, son of Brahma himself, this was still a bad omen. Moreover, it wasn't considered a <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> to be asked where one was heading when one was already on the way to some destination; therefore, Ganesha felt doubly unfortunate. Nonetheless, the great Brahmin succeeded in calming his fury. Ganesha explained to him the motives for his sadness and his terrible desire to win. Narada consoled and exhorted him not to despair; he said that for a child, the whole world was embodied within the mother , so all Ganesha had to do was to circle his Parvati and he would defeat those who had more speed but less understanding.|$|E

Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E

Shekhar of Oneindia called the film a [...] "brilliant psychological thriller": [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is excellent and will impress all classes of audience.
