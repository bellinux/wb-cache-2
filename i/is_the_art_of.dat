25|$|In his {{analysis}} of the new art movement, Apollinaire makes a distinction between four different types of Cubism; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, Scientific Cubism, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from the reality of vision, but from the reality of knowledge. It is the tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.|$|E
25|$|Orphic Cubism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> {{painting}} with elements borrowed not from visual reality, but entirely {{created by the}} artist and endowed by him with a powerful reality. The works of the Orphic artists simultaneously present a pure aesthetic pleasure, a construction to the senses and a sublime meaning. This is pure art, according to Apollinaire, that includes the work of R. Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and M. Duchamp.|$|E
25|$|Dance (from Old French dancier, {{perhaps from}} Frankish) {{generally}} refers to human movement either {{used as a}} form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting.

Choreography <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.|$|E

25|$|Theoretical {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In particular the application of quantum mechanics to {{chemistry is}} called quantum chemistry. Since the end of the Second World War, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) condensed matter physics and molecular physics.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{animation}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> creating moving images via the use {{of computer}}s. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes {{the target of the}} animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film. It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.|$|E
25|$|Jazz {{drumming}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> playing percussion (predominantly {{the drum}} set, {{which includes a}} variety of drums and cymbals) in jazz styles ranging from 1910s-style Dixieland jazz to 1970s-era jazz fusion and 1980s-era Latin jazz. The techniques and instrumentation {{of this type of}} performance have evolved over several periods, influenced by jazz at large and the individual drummers within it. Stylistically, this aspect of performance was shaped by its starting place, New Orleans, as well as numerous other regions of the world, including other parts of the United States, the Caribbean, and Africa.|$|E

25|$|Musical {{expression}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> playing or singing {{music with}} emotional communication. The elements {{of music that}} comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced {{by a combination of}} other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is {{more than the sum of}} measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E
25|$|Mosaic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> decorating solid {{surfaces}} {{with pieces}} of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent glass tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar {{so that it is}} visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with a blanket of pictures and patterns.|$|E
25|$|The {{pedagogy}} of post-structuralism {{is marked}} by an attempt to redefine rhetoric {{as it relates to}} composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing {{can be seen as a}} metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act. Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.|$|E

500|$|Authors such as Keith Critchlow {{argue that}} Islamic {{patterns}} are created {{to lead the}} viewer {{to an understanding of}} the underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers interested only in pattern sometimes imply. David Wade states that [...] "Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> decoration – which is to say, of transformation." [...] Wade argues that the aim is to transfigure, turning mosques [...] "into lightness and pattern", while [...] "the decorated pages of a Qur’an can become windows onto the infinite." [...] Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif states in her book Beauty in Arabic Culture that a [...] "major difference" [...] between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of the good and the beautiful are separated in Arabic culture. She argues that beauty, whether in poetry or in the visual arts, was enjoyed [...] "for its own sake, without commitment to religious or moral criteria".|$|E

[...] The UK's The Guardian ranked Climate Progress at the top of {{its list}} of blogs in its [...] "Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow". [...] Reviewing Romm's 2010 book Straight Up, Bill McKibben wrote that Romm [...] "knows his climate science ... has been a persuasive voice for the most important truth about global warming: that it is a far worse problem than either politicians or the general public understand. ... Romm has been consistent in insisting that we have much of the technology necessary to at least begin tackling the problem." [...] He called Romm [...] "a tireless foil to the 'right-wing disinformation machine' that has tried – with great success ... to delay action by confusing and disheartening Americans about global warming. ... It requires a thick skin to take on the daily task of dealing with the disinformers, but Romm has the taste for this kind of blood sport, and the talent as well." [...] In 2011, The New York Times called Romm [...] "one of the country’s most influential writers on climate change". [...] In 2012, Planetsave wrote that Romm is [...] "considered the world’s best blogger on climate science, and politics related to it." ...|$|E
