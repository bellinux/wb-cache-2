The launchoff-shift method has several advantages over the launch-offcapture but imposes strict requirements on transition fault testing due to at-speed scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal.</b> A novel scan-based atspeed test is proposed which generates multiple local fast scan <b>enable</b> <b>signals.</b> The scan <b>enable</b> control information is encapsulated in the test data and transferred during the scan operation.

40|$|A novel scan-based delay test approach, {{referred}} as the hybrid delay scan, is proposed in this paper. The proposed scan-based delay testing method combines {{advantages of the}} skewed-load and broad-side approaches. Unlike the skewed-load approach whose design requirement is often too costly to meet due to the fast switching scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal,</b> the hybrid delay scan {{does not require a}} strong buffer or buffer tree to drive the fast switching scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal.</b> Hardware overhead added to standard scan designs to implement the hybrid approach is negligible. Since the fast scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> is internally generated, no external pin is required. Transition delay fault coverage achieved by the hybrid approach is equal to or higher than that achieved by the broad-side load for all ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. On an average, about 4. 5 % improvement in fault coverage is obtained by the hybrid approach over the broad-side approach. 1...|$|R

Neither the client devices (which may be fixed or mobile), nor their operators require a license, but these devices must receive an <b>enabling</b> <b>signal</b> from a licensed base station before transmitting. All stations must be identifiable in the event they cause interference to incumbent operators in the band. Further, there is a requirement that multiple licensees' devices are {{given the opportunity to}} transmit in the same area using a [...] "contention based protocol" [...] when possible. If interference between licensees, or the devices that they have enabled, cannot be mediated by technical means, licensees are required to resolve the dispute between themselves.|$|E

These blocks are then demonstrated in an example GNU Radio application running in a Linux environment, using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) as a radio frontend. A second USRP on an unconnected host computer is used to generate the relevant test signals used for training and detection/classification trials. A key advancement presented in this work is application of these algorithms to real-world signals input from an RF frontend, rather than ideal signals generated in MATLAB.

40|$|Abstract — Clock gating is a {{predominant}} {{technique used}} for power saving. It is {{observed that the}} commonly used synthesis-based gating still leaves {{a large amount of}} redundant clock pulses. Data-driven gating aims to disable these. To reduce the hardware overhead involved, flip-flops (FFs) are grouped so that they share a common clock <b>enabling</b> <b>signal.</b> The question of what is the group size maximizing the power savings is answered in a previous paper. Here we answer the question of which FFs should be placed in a group to maximize the power reduction. We propose a practical solution based on the toggling activity cor-relations of FFs and their physical position proximity constraints in the layout. Our data-driven clock gating is integrated into an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) commercial backend design flow, achieving total power reduction of 15 %– 20 % for various types of large-scale state-of-the-art industrial and academic designs in 40 and 65 manometer process technologies. These savings are achieved on top of the savings obtained by clock gating synthesis performed by commercial EDA tools, and gating manually inserted into the register transfer level design.

40|$|Solid-state nanopores are {{promising}} tools for single molecule detection of both DNA and proteins. In this study, we investigate {{the patterns of}} ionic current blockades as DNA translocates into {{or out of the}} geometric confinement of such conically shaped pores. We studied how the geometry of a nanopore affects the detected ionic current signal of a translocating DNA molecule over a wide range of salt concentration. The blockade level in the ionic current depends on the translocation direction at a high salt concentration, and at lower salt concentrations we find a non-intuitive ionic current decrease and increase within each single event for the DNA translocations exiting from confinement. We use recently developed DNA rulers with markers and finite element calculations to explain our observations. Our calculations explain the shapes of the signals observed at all salt concentrations and show that the unexpected current decrease and increase are due to the competing effects of ion concentration polarization and geometric exclusion of ions. Our analysis shows that over a wide range of geometry, voltage and salt concentrations we are able to understand the ionic current signals of DNA in asymmetric nanopores <b>enabling</b> <b>signal</b> optimization in molecular sensing applications.

40|$|Signal {{proteins}} {{are able}} to adapt their response {{to a change in}} the environment, governing in this way a broad variety of important cellular processes in living systems. While conventional molecular-dynamics (MD) techniques can be used to explore the early signaling pathway of these protein systems at atomistic resolution, the high computational costs limit their usefulness for the elucidation of the multiscale transduction dynamics of most signaling processes, occurring on experimental timescales. To cope with the problem, we present in this paper a novel multiscale-modeling method, based on a combination of the kinetic Monte-Carlo- and MD-technique, and demonstrate its suitability for investigating the signaling behavior of the photoswitch light-oxygen-voltage- 2 -Jα domain from Avena Sativa (AsLOV 2 -Jα) and an AsLOV 2 -Jα-regulated photoactivable Rac 1 -GTPase (PA-Rac 1), recently employed to control the motility of cancer cells through light stimulus. More specifically, we show that their signaling pathways begin with a residual re-arrangement and subsequent H-bond formation of amino acids near to the flavin-mononucleotide chromophore, causing a coupling between β-strands and subsequent detachment of a peripheral α-helix from the AsLOV 2 -domain. In the case of the PA-Rac 1 system we find that this latter process induces the release of the AsLOV 2 -inhibitor from the switchII-activation site of the GTPase, <b>enabling</b> <b>signal</b> activation through effector-protein binding. These applications demonstrate that our approach reliably reproduces the signaling pathways of complex signal proteins, ranging from nanoseconds up to seconds at affordable computational costs. © 2012 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|A {{circuit and}} method for {{transmitting}} and receiving on-off-keyed (OOK) signals with fractional signal-to-noise ratios uses available high-temperature silicon- on-insulator (SOI) components to move computational, sensing, and actuation abilities closer to high-temperature or high-ionizing radiation environments such as vehicle engine compartments, deep-hole drilling environments, industrial control and monitoring of processes like smelting, and operations near nuclear reactors and in space. This device {{allows for the}} networking of multiple, like nodes {{to each other and}} to a central processor. It can do this with nothing more than the already in-situ power wiring of the system. The device s microprocessor allows it to make intelligent decisions within the vehicle operational loop and to effect control outputs to its associated actuators. The figure illustrates how each node converts digital serial data to OOK 18 -kHz in transmit mode and vice-versa in receive mode; though operations at lower frequencies or up to a megahertz are within reason using this method and these parts. This innovation s technique modulates a DC power bus with millivolt-level signals through a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) and resistor by OOK. It receives and demodulates this signal from the DC power bus through capacitive coupling at high temperature and in high ionizing radiation environments. The demodulation of the OOK signal is accomplished by using an asynchronous quadrature detection technique realized by a quasi-discrete Fourier transform through use of the quadrature components (0 and 90 phases) of the carrier frequency as generated by the microcontroller and as a function of the selected crystal frequency driving its oscillator. The detected signal is rectified using an absolute-value circuit containing no diodes (diodes being non-operational at high temperatures), and only operational amplifiers. The absolute values of the two phases of the received signal are then summed and hard limited (digitized) by comparing them to a reference level and are then input into a microprocessor as a serial bit stream. The quasi-discrete Fourier transform is performed in high-temperature components (operational amplifiers, analog switches, resistors, and capacitors). The demodulated signal is a serial data stream that is input to the UART (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter) receiver pin of the microprocessor. The OOK of the carrier frequency uses the output of the UART pin as an <b>enabling</b> <b>signal</b> that drives the gate of the MOSFET. Logic low bits enable the carrier frequency (realized by using the 0 phase signal from the microcontroller, though either phase may be used) to be DC-coupled to the power supply bus through a current-limiting resistor mounted between the MOSFET drain and the supply rail. The presence of logic lows on the power supply rail is realized by carrier bursts while logic highs are realized by the absence of bursts...|$|E
