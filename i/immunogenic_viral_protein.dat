40|$|Abstract Merkel cell {{carcinoma}} (MCC) is an aggressive skin malignancy {{with a high}} mortality rate and an increasing incidence. The recent discovery of Merkel cell polyomavirus has revolutionized our understanding of MCC pathogenesis. Viral oncoproteins appear to {{play a critical role}} in tumor progression and are expressed in the majority of MCC tumors. Virus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses are detectable in MCC patients and are linked to the natural history of the disease. Despite persistent expression of <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins,</b> however, MCC tumors are able to evade the immune system. Understanding of the mechanisms of immune evasion employed by MCC tumors is rapidly increasing and offers opportunities for development of rational immune therapies to improve patient outcomes. Here we review recent discoveries in MCC with a special focus on the pathogenic role of Merkel cell polyomavirus and the immunobiology of this virus-associated disease...|$|R
40|$|The current {{epidemic}} of {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) poses {{a major threat to}} our population. Urgently needed are both a vaccine to prevent infection with the etiologic retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and safe, effective an-tiviral agents to treat those individuals already infected. The elucidation of viral replica-tive mechanisms has allowed the development and testing of several agents active against HIV in vitro. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase that have demonstrated activity include azidothymidine, phosphonoformate, antimoniotungstate (HPA- 23), and suramin. Ribavirin and recombinant interferon alpha-A (IFN-a-A) also inhibit HIV replication, although their mechanisms of action are less clear. All of these compounds are undergoing early clinical trials in patients with HIV infection. The identification of <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> may allow the development of one or more subunit vaccines against HIV. Studies are underway to clone appropriate viral genes and incorporate the expressed proteins into vectors for administration. Laboratory models, e. g., chimpanzees, will be inoculated with candidate vaccines and, if successful, this will be followed by clinical trials for safety and efficacy in appropriate human populations seronegative for HIV.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger to produce and assemble complex <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> into virus-like particles (VLPs) in batch culture was enhanced by optimizing the bioprocessing parameters, agitation intensity and dissolved oxygen (dO 2) concentration. Response surface methodology (RSM) and a two-factor-two-level central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to evaluate the interactive response pattern between parameters and their optimum combination. The recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) {{was used as a}} model VLP system to determine the effect of these parameters on biomass yield, fungal morphology, HBsAg production and bioreactor kinetics. The response surface model predicted optimum cultivation conditions at an agitation of rate of 100 rpm and a dO 2 concentration of 25 %, obtaining highest intracellular membrane-associated HBsAg levels of 3. 4 mg lculture- 1. HBsAg production levels were increased tenfold compared to yields obtained in shake flask cultivation. Although hepatitis B VLPs mostly accumulated intracellularly, optimal bioreactor conditions resulted in significant HBsAg release in culture supernatant. These results compare favourably with other recombinant VLP systems in batch culture, and therefore, indicate a substantial potential for further engineering of the A. niger production system for the high level of intracellular and extracellular VLP production. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|The nucleocapsid (N) protein of {{rinderpest}} virus (RPV) {{is one of}} the most abundant and <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> expressed during natural or experimental infection. To identify immunogenic epitopes on the N protein, different forms of RPV N protein, including the full-length protein (N 1 - 525), an amino-terminal construct (N 1 - 179), and a carboxy-terminal construct (N 414 - 496), were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The antigenicity of each recombinant protein was evaluated by Western immunoblotting. All recombinants were recognized by hyperimmune RPV bovine antisera, indicating that immunoreactive epitopes may be present at both ends of the N protein. However, GST-N 414 - 496 was much more antigenic than GST-N 1 - 179 when tested with sera from vaccinated cattle, suggesting that an immunodominant or highly immunogenic epitope(s) may be located at the carboxy terminus of the N protein. Epitope mapping with overlapping peptides representing different regions of the carboxy terminus (amino acids 415 to 524) revealed three nonoverlapping antigenic sites in regions containing the residues 440 VPQVRKETRASSR 452 (site 1), 479 PEADTDPL 486 (site 2), and 520 DKDLL 524 (site 3). Among these, antigenic site 2 showed the strongest reactivity with hyperimmune anti-RPV bovine sera in a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but did not react with hyperimmune caprine sera raised against peste-des-petits-ruminants virus, which is antigenically closely related to RPV. Identification of an immunodominant linear antigenic site at the carboxy terminus of the N protein may provide an antigen basis for designing diagnostics specific for RPV...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{test the}} {{potential}} for parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV 5) -based vectors to provide protection from vaccinia virus (VACV) infection, PIV 5 was engineered to express secreted VACV L 1 R and B 5 R proteins, two important antigens for neutralization of intracellular mature (IMV) and extracellular enveloped (EEV) virions, respectively. Protection of mice from lethal intranasal VACV challenge required intranasal immunization with PIV 5 -L 1 R/B 5 R in a prime-boost protocol, and correlated with low VACV-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-VACV neutralizing antibody. Mice immunized with PIV 5 -L 1 R/B 5 R showed some disease symptoms following VACV challenge such as loss of weight and hunching, but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice. While immunization with PIV 5 expressing B 5 R alone conferred at least some protection, the most effective immunization included the PIV 5 vector expressing L 1 R alone or in combination with PIV 5 -B 5 R. PIV 5 -L 1 R/B 5 R vectors elicited protection from VACV challenge even when CD 8 + cells were depleted, {{but not in the}} case of mice that were defective in B cell production. Mice were protected from VACV challenge out to at least 1. 5 years after immunization with PIV 5 -L 1 R/B 5 R vectors, and showed significant levels of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate {{the potential for}} PIV 5 -based vectors to provide long lasting protection against complex human respiratory pathogens such as VACV, but also highlight the need to understand mechanisms for the generation of strong immune responses against poorly <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of CD 8 T cells {{for the control}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has raised interest {{in the identification of}} <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> as candidates for vaccination and cytoimmunotherapy. The final aim is to determine the viral “immunome” for any major histocompatibility complex class I molecule by antigenicity screening of proteome-derived peptides. For human CMV, there is a limitation to this approach: the T cells used as responder cells for peptide screening are usually memory cells that have undergone in vivo selection. On this basis, pUL 83 (pp 65) and pUL 123 (IE 1 or pp 68 to - 72) were classified as immunodominant proteins. It is an open question whether this limited “memory immunome” really reflects the immunogenic potential of the human CMV proteome. Here we document an analogous focus of the memory repertoire on two proteins of murine CMV. Specifically, ca. 80 % of all memory CD 8 T cells in the spleen as well as in persisting pulmonary infiltrates were found to be specific for the known IE 1 peptide 168 YPHFMPTNL 176 and for the peptide 257 AGPPRYSRI 265, newly defined here, derived from open reading frame m 164. Notably, CD 8 T-cell lines of both specificities protected against acute infection upon adoptive transfer. In contrast, the natural immune response to acute infection in draining lymph nodes and in the lungs indicated a somewhat broader specificity repertoire. We conclude that the low number of antigenic peptides identified so far for CMVs reflects a focused memory repertoire, and we predict that more antigenic peptides will be disclosed by analysis of the acute immune response...|$|R
40|$|While Epstein-Barr virus-specific {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) {{have been}} used successfully for the prophylaxis and treatment of the highly immunogenic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, the clinical experience for other EBV-associated malignancies, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), is limited and the results obtained so far indicate that EBV-CTLs are less effective in these settings. Decreased CTL efficacy most likely reflects immune evasion strategies by tumor cells, including down-regulation of immunodominant EBV proteins and the weak immunogenicity of the <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> expressed. One of the possible approaches to overcome these limitations is the identification of additional <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> expressed by tumor cells that may serve as tumor-associated antigens to be targeted by improved CTL induction and expansion protocols. We have recently demonstrated that NPC patients show strong spontaneous CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses specific for the EBV-encoded oncogenic protein BARF 1. We also showed that BARF 1 provides immunogenic HLA-A* 0201 -restricted epitopes, suggesting that exploitation of the immunogenic features of this viral antigen may help improve the current immunotherapeutic strategies for EBV-associated malignancies. On these grounds, we characterized more extensively the immunogenic properties of BARF 1 with the final goal to develop improved protocols of adoptive immunotherapy based {{on the use of}} EBV-CTLs enriched in BARF 1 -specific effectors. In particular, we identified and validated additional BARF 1 CTL epitopes presented in the context of common HLA class I alleles. These results strictly correlate to those deriving from a high-resolution HLA genotyping of a large series of NPC, giving a precise estimate of the immunogenicity of BARF 1 in relation to the HLA class I profile of Italian NPC patients. To fully exploit the immunologic properties of BARF 1, we are also developing and characterizing BARF 1 -specific monoclonal antibodies that may be of both diagnostic and therapeutic usefulness in these clinical settings. In future perspective, the proposed research may provide a strong rationale for the clinical application of improved adoptive immunotherapy protocols for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies, particularly the less immunogenic forms, such as NPC and, possibly, Hodgkin’s lymphoma...|$|R

Herein, {{we report on the}} consequences of codon bias, and on the favorable outcome of the systematic replacement of native codons of PRRSV ORF 5 gene with codons chosen to reflect more closely the codon preference of highly expressed mammalian genes. Therefore, a synthetic PRRSV ORF 5 gene (synORF 5) was constructed in which 134 nucleotide substitutions were made in comparison to wild-type gene (wtORF 5), such that 59 % (119) of wild-type codons were replaced with known preferable codons in mammalian cells. In vitro expression in mammalian cells of synORF 5 was considerably increased comparatively to wtORF 5, following infection with tetracycline inducible replication-defective human adenoviral vectors (hAdVs). After challenge inoculation, SPF pigs vaccinated twice with recombinant hAdV/synORF 5 developed earlier and higher antibody titers, including virus neutralizing antibodies to GP 5 than pigs vaccinated with hAdV/wtORF 5.

40|$|Alphavirus vectors have {{demonstrated}} {{high levels of}} transient heterologous gene expression both in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, possess attractive features for vaccine development. The most commonly used delivery vectors are based on three single-stranded encapsulated alphaviruses, namely Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Alphavirus vectors have been applied as replication-deficient recombinant viral particles and, more recently, as replication-proficient particles. Moreover, in vitro transcribed RNA, as well as layered DNA vectors have been applied for immunization.

40|$|Abstract Background Lassa fever is a {{neglected}} tropical disease with {{significant impact on}} the health care system, society, and economy of Western and Central African nations where it is endemic. Treatment of acute Lassa fever infections has successfully utilized intravenous administration of ribavirin, a nucleotide analogue drug, but this is not an approved use; efficacy of oral administration has not been demonstrated. To date, several potential new vaccine platforms have been explored, but none have progressed toward clinical trials and commercialization. Therefore, the development of a robust vaccine platform that could be generated in sufficient quantities and at a low cost per dose could herald a subcontinent-wide vaccination program. This would move Lassa endemic areas toward the control and reduction of major outbreaks and endemic infections. To this end, we have employed efficient mammalian expression systems to generate a Lassa virus (LASV) -like particle (VLP) -based modular vaccine platform. Results A mammalian expression system that generated large quantities of LASV VLP in human cells at small scale settings was developed. These VLP contained the major immunological determinants of the virus: glycoprotein complex, nucleoprotein, and Z matrix protein, with known post-translational modifications. The <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> packaged into LASV VLP were characterized, including glycosylation profiles of glycoprotein subunits GP 1 and GP 2, and structural compartmentalization of each polypeptide. The host cell protein component of LASV VLP was also partially analyzed, namely glycoprotein incorporation, though the identity of these proteins remain unknown. All combinations of LASV Z, GPC, and NP proteins that generated VLP did not incorporate host cell ribosomes, a known component of native arenaviral particles, despite detection of small RNA species packaged into pseudoparticles. Although VLP did not contain the same host cell components as the native virion, electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that LASV VLP appeared structurally similar to native virions, with pleiomorphic distribution in size and shape. LASV VLP that displayed GPC or GPC+NP were immunogenic in mice, and generated a significant IgG response to individual <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> over the course of three immunizations, in the absence of adjuvants. Furthermore, sera from convalescent Lassa fever patients recognized VLP in ELISA format, thus affirming the presence of native epitopes displayed by the recombinant pseudoparticles. Conclusions These results established that modular LASV VLP can be generated displaying high levels of <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> <b>proteins,</b> and that small laboratory scale mammalian expression systems are capable of producing multi-milligram quantities of pseudoparticles. These VLP are structurally and morphologically similar to native LASV virions, but lack replicative functions, and thus can be safely generated in low biosafety level settings. LASV VLP were immunogenic in mice in the absence of adjuvants, with mature IgG responses developing within {{a few weeks after the}} first immunization. These studies highlight the relevance of a VLP platform for designing an optimal vaccine candidate against Lassa hemorrhagic fever, and warrant further investigation in lethal challenge animal models to establish their protective potential. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{papillomavirus}} type 16 (HPV- 16) infections can in {{rare cases}} persist and cause lesions that may progress to cervical cancer. Cells in the lesions are not permissive for virus production, nor are cervical cancer cells. The intracellular environment is such that it prevents production of the highly <b>immunogenic,</b> <b>viral</b> structural <b>proteins</b> L 1 and L 2. One may speculate that inhibition of L 1 and L 2 expression {{is a prerequisite for}} persistence and cancer progression. We have therefore investigated how expression of HPV- 16 L 1 is regulated. We found that the only splice site in the HPV- 16 late region, which is used to produce L 1 mRNAs, is under control of a splicing enhancer located in the 17 nucleotides immediately downstream of the splice site. However, the function of this enhancer in cervical cancer cells is largely overshadowed by multiple splicing silencers in the late region which bind to hnRNP A 1. High levels of hnRNP A 1 therefore inhibit HPV- 16 L 1 expression. Immunohistological analysis of cervical epithelia revealed that hnRNP A 1 is expressed primarily in the lower layers of the epithelium. hnRNP A 1 is undetectable in terminally differentiated cells that can express HPV- 16 late genes, which supports the conclusion that high levels of hnRNP A 1 inhibit HPV- 16 L 1 expression...|$|R

Although antibodies (Abs) can neutralize HIV- 1 and potentially protect against infection, antibodies that target the <b>immunogenic</b> <b>viral</b> surface <b>protein</b> gp 120 have widely variable and poorly predictable cross-strain reactivity. Here, {{we developed a}} novel computational approach, the Method of Dynamic Epitopes, for identification of neutralization epitopes targeted by anti-HIV- 1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Our data demonstrate that this approach, based purely on calculated energetics and 3 D structural information, accurately predicts the presence of neutralization epitopes targeted by V 3 -specific mAbs 2219 and 447 - 52 D in any HIV- 1 strain. The method was {{used to calculate the}} range of conservation of these specific epitopes across all circulating HIV- 1 viruses. Accurately identifying an Ab-targeted neutralization epitope in a virus by computational means enables easy prediction of the breadth of reactivity of specific mAbs across the {{diversity of}} thousands of different circulating HIV- 1 variants and facilitates rational design and selection of immunogens mimicking specific mAb-targeted epitopes in a multivalent HIV- 1 vaccine. The defined epitopes can also be used for the purpose of epitope-specific analyses of breakthrough sequences recorded in vaccine clinical trials.

Comparative analyses of integration sites of different retroviral vectors have elucidated distinct target site preferences, highlighting vectors based on the alpharet-rovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) as those with the most neutral integration spectrum. To date, alpharetro-viral vector systems are based mainly on single constructs containing viral coding sequences and intact long terminal repeats (LTR). Even though they {{are considered to be}} replication incompetent in mammalian cells, the transfer of intact viral genomes is unacceptable for clinical applications, due to the risk of vector mobilization and the potentially <b>immunogenic</b> expression of <b>viral</b> <b>proteins,</b> which we minimized by setting up a split-packaging system expressing the necessary <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> in trans. Moreover, intact LTRs containing transcriptional elements are capable of activating cellular genes. By removing most of these transcriptional elements, we were able to generate a self-inactivating (SIN) alpharetroviral vector, whose LTR transcriptional activity is strongly reduced and whose transgene expression can be driven by an internal promoter of choice. Codon optimization of the alpharetroviral Gag/Pol expression construct and further optimization steps allowed the production of high-titer self-inactivating vector particles in human cells.

40|$|In vivo gene {{transfer}} of recombinant E 1 -deficient adenoviruses results in {{early and late}} viral gene expression that elicits a host immune response, limiting the duration of transgene expression {{and the use of}} adenoviruses for gene therapy. The prokaryotic Cre-lox P recombination system was adapted to generate recombinant adenoviruses with extended deletions in the viral genome (referred to here as deleted viruses) in order to minimize expression of <b>immunogenic</b> and/or cytotoxic <b>viral</b> <b>proteins.</b> As an example, an adenovirus with a 25 -kb deletion that lacked E 1, E 2, E 3, and late gene expression with viral titers similar to those achieved with first-generation vectors and less than 0. 5 % contamination with E 1 -deficient virus was produced. Gene transfer was similar in HeLa cells, mouse hepatoma cells, and primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo as determined by measuring reporter gene expression and DNA transfer. However, transgene expression and deleted viral DNA concentrations were not stable and declined to undetectable levels much more rapidly than those found for first-generation vectors. Intravenous administration of deleted vectors in mice resulted in no hepatocellular injury relative to that seen with first-generation vectors. The mechanism for stability of first-generation adenovirus vectors (E 1 a deleted) appeared to be linked in part to their ability to replicate in transduced cells in vivo and in vitro.

Transfection experiments leading to the over-expression of specific <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> in {{the presence or absence of}} various recombinant DNA constructs designed to modulate the activity of the cellular SUMOylation system demonstrated that various <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> are also SUMOylated when over-expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, experiments performed using recombinant adenoviruses able to modulate the activity of the cellular SUMOylation system demonstrated the SUMOylation of specific <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> during influenza infection. Finally, this study characterizes the SUMOylation of the nonstuctural <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> NS 1 A, the best SUMO target of all the <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> produced during infection, explores some of the potential effects exerted by SUMOylation on the functions of this <b>viral</b> <b>protein,</b> and introduces the use of “artificial SUMO ligases” as an innovative method to increase the SUMOylation of specific targets in the cell and facilitate the characterization of the effects mediated by SUMOylation on protein function. Collectively, our studies provide new insights into the virus-host interactions established during influenza virus infections. ...|$|R

50|$|Inoviruses {{begin their}} life cycle by {{attaching}} to specific host receptors via <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> gp3. After attachment, they insert their viral DNA into the host cell. Once inside the cell, they convert the genome into a double-stranded intermediate form {{which is then}} replicated by the host's DNA polymerase. At the same time, the host's RNA polymerase transcribes the viral genome to make mRNA and <b>viral</b> <b>proteins.</b> The replicated genomes then combine with newly synthesized <b>viral</b> <b>proteins</b> to make more viruses, which are released from the host. This replication cycle generally takes 10-15 minutes to complete.|$|R
