2500|$|The {{weapon is}} {{described}} as an [...] "air-cooled, electrically powered, rapid firing weapon." [...] All portions of the firing cycle are powered this way so the unit requires an external power source. Other important features are the reciprocating barrel and cam assembly that drive the other components of the system. All phases of the weapon cycle are positively controlled by the <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> assembly in which a planetary gear train is enclosed, responsible for reducing the motor's high speed to the desired rate for the gun. The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> through a flexible shaft in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil. The weapon accepts linked ammunition, which was fed from rotary drums {{in the case of}} the M5 and M28 systems, and from boxes {{in the case of the}} XM9 systems. [...] The M5 could also use a box magazine.|$|E

The split was amicable and it was also announced that close friend Steve Kiely was to replace Cam as the new permanent drummer for The Reason.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computer-aided design and manufacturing {{system for the}} design and production of complex profiles for high-performance <b>drum</b> <b>cams</b> within the specified tolerance. The system graphically generates the cam profile on the cylindrical drum after performing {{an analysis of the}} kinematic performance for the prescribed follower motion, using a B-spline representation of follower curves. Eight different types of follower motion for a translating follower are considered. The kinematic performance is based on the criteria of achieving the lowest levels of velocity and acceleration for each curve. The system is also able to simulate the motion of the designed cam graphically. The system also recommends the best cam profile on the basis of comparing the kinematic performance of all the B-spline representations of all the follower motions...|$|R
5000|$|In {{advance of}} the album, three single tracks were {{released}} on the YouTube channel of the band's record label, Nuclear Blast. [...] "Born in Dissonance" [...] was released on August 25, 2016, [...] "Nostrum" [...] was released on September 15, 2016, and [...] "Clockworks" [...] (accompanied by an official music video) was released on October 7, 2016. On September 20, 2016, the band released a live play-through <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> video of [...] "Nostrum" [...] highlighting Tomas Haake's drum playing.|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{analysis of}} a production machine is a key factor of its functionality, service life and occupational safety. This work deals with mathematical dynamic modelling and its contribution to the improvement of a mechanical design and mechanism failure prevention. The whole process is presented on {{the example of a}} <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> rotary indexing table and on the example of actuators of multi spindle automatic lathes. The analysis consisted of complex nonlinear models based on basic linear models. It was computed using Matlab, Simulink and MSC ADAMS. Models of these mechanisms were validated with experimental measurements. The results were used for mechanical design improvement and for speed control optimization...|$|E

5000|$|Wyatt is a Canadian {{country music}} group from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan {{composed}} of Scott Patrick (vocals, guitar), Daniel Fortier (vocals, guitar), Bray Hudson (<b>drums)</b> and <b>Cam</b> Ewart (bass). Following {{the release of}} a Christmas album, Snowed In, in 2005, Wyatt released their debut album, Hard Road, in 2007. No singles were released from the project because the band [...] "didn't feel it was quite there yet." ...|$|R

The brakes were by Girling, hydraulically operated, with 9 in. (229 mm) <b>drums.</b> A <b>cam</b> and peg steering system was used.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} {{there is a}} dry {{single-plate}} clutch and six-speed gearbox that was made by ZF. The vehicle {{is equipped with a}} two-step reduction gear that doubles the number of gears. Both axles are rigid and driven and equipped with air S <b>cam</b> <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|R

5000|$|Barnes {{had started}} his extreme metal {{career at the}} age of 19. His first band was a death/thrash band called Tirant Sin, which was formed in 1986 in his' {{hometown}} of Buffalo. Other members of Tirant Sin included Paul Mazurkiewicz (<b>drums),</b> Bob Rusay, <b>Cam</b> V and Joe Morelli (guitars) and Rich Ziegler (bass guitar). In 1986, Barnes left Tirant Sin to join another New York-based death/thrash metal band named Leviathan that recorded the four-track demo [...] "Legions of the Undead" [...] in 1987, re-released on the 2005 Six Feet Under box set A Decade in the Grave.|$|R
50|$|CAM (Creazioni Artistiche Musicali) Jazz {{began as}} a branch {{of a company that}} issued movie soundtracks. Its {{catalogue}} is managed by producer Ermanno Basso. Early releases by the label were from Italian musicians such as drummer Roberto Gatto, trumpeter Enrico Rava, bassist Giovanni Tommaso, and pianist Enrico Pieranunzi, who recorded Play Morricone in a trio with bassist Marc Johnson and <b>drummer</b> Joey Baron. <b>CAM</b> Jazz signed Argentinian trumpeter Diego Urcola, Venezuelan pianist Edward Simon, and Italian saxophonist Francesco Cafiso when he was 16. The catalogue also includes American trumpeter Dave Douglas, Canadian trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, French pianist Martial Solal, Swedish bassist Palle Danielsson, and British drummer Martin France.|$|R
5000|$|Spencer {{patented}} {{his idea}} in 1873; unfortunately, his patent attorney failed {{to protect the}} most significant part, the <b>cam</b> <b>drum,</b> which Spencer called the [...] "brain wheel". Therefore many other people quickly took up the idea. Later important developers of fully automatic lathes (large and small) included S. L. Worsley, who developed a single-spindle machine for Brown & Sharpe; Edwin C. Henn, Reinhold Hakewessel, and George O. Gridley, who developed multiple-spindle variants and who were involved with a succession of corporations (Acme, National, National-Acme, Windsor Machine Company, Acme-Gridley, New Britain-Gridley); Edward P. Bullard Jr, who led {{the development of the}} Bullard Mult-Au-Matic; F.C. Fay and Otto A. Schaum, who developed the Fay automatic lathe; Ralph Flanders and his brother Ernest, who further refined the Fay lathe and who developed the automatic screw thread grinder; and many others. Meanwhile, engineers in Switzerland were also developing clever new manually and automatically controlled lathes during this same era. The technological developments in America and Switzerland flowed rapidly into other industrialized countries (via routes such as machine tool exports; trade journal articles and advertisements; trade shows, from world's fairs to regional events; and the turnover and emigration of engineers, setup hands, and operators). There, local innovators also developed further creative tooling for the machines and built clone machine models.|$|R
