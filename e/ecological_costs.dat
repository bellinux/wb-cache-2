40|$|Non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs) constitute {{the single largest}} determinant of livelihoods for scores of forest fringe communities and poor people in the tropics. In India over 50 million people {{are believed to be}} directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain <b>ecological</b> <b>cost</b> (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing ‘win-lose’ settings have to be steered to a ‘win-win’ mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods (‘lose-lose’). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the <b>ecological</b> <b>cost</b> of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the <b>ecological</b> <b>cost.</b> Certain interventions and recommendations that could optimize the balance between livelihood gains and <b>ecological</b> <b>cost</b> are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Traits that confer plant {{resistance}} to some herbivore species but increase plant susceptibility to other herbivore species {{are said to}} carry an "ecological cost" of herbivore resistance. The native perennial, Datura wrightii, is dimorphic for leaf trichome type, {{and the production of}} glandular trichomes carries a potential <b>ecological</b> <b>cost</b> over the production of non-glandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes provide {{resistance to}} at least six herbivore species, but they also confer susceptibility to Tupiocoris notatus, an abundant mirid bug with special adaptations to glandular trichomes. We estimated herbivore-specific damage to plants of each trichome type and measured plant seed production, a component of fitness, in a common garden over three years. Plant seed production increased with the size and persistence of leaf canopies and occasionally declined with increasing damage caused by some of the defoliating insects. Plant seed production was never reduced by T. notatus damage, however. Even though the <b>ecological</b> <b>cost</b> of glandular trichome production was not apparent in D. wrightii, the trait still was not beneficial. The fitness of plants with glandular trichomes never exceeded that of plants with non-glandular trichomes despite variation in both the composition of the herbivore community and the total level of damage inflicted by herbivores over three years of study. The persistence of the allele coding for glandular trichomes cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} the herbivore resistance that those trichomes provide...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>cost</b> {{results from}} the {{disruption}} of the many symbiotic relationships that a plant has with the environment. For example, jasmonic acid {{can be used to}} simulate an herbivore attack on plants and thus, induce plant defences. The use of jasmonic acid on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) resulted in plants with fewer but larger fruits, longer ripening time, delayed fruit-set, fewer seeds per plant and fewer seeds per unit of fruit weight. All these features {{play a critical role in}} attracting seed dispersers. Due to the consequences of induced defences on fruit characteristics, L. esculentum are less able to attract seed dispersers and this ultimately results in a reduced fitness.|$|R

50|$|Cost-based pricing {{strategy}} {{is based on}} the seller’s cost. It is product and production cost driven, meaning that the set price covers all the costs of the production and includes a target profit margin. This is typical for low-cost strategies that aim to reduce costs in purchasing and production processes, in order to offer low prices for the mass markets. Products are made affordable for consumers with low income, and contribute to sustainability because they meet certain social criteria. However, offering low prices to customers raises the question of the internalization of ecological and social costs. This means that sustainable products, for example, that have sought to internalize the social and <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> associated with consumption and production will involve increased costs that are reflected in a higher consumer price, when they are compared to those that do not. This is due to the implementation of a sustainability marketing strategy. Even if the production of sustainable products may require a higher initial capital costs, the changes in operations usually result in lower long-term costs. From a marketer perspective, increasing sales volume and achieving savings by cutting production costs of sustainable products may be the solutions to reduce the total customer cost.|$|E
5000|$|... Behavioural {{ecology of}} {{dolphins}} {{and impact of}} human activities on their lives: Much of the research work is based upon repeat observations of individually-recognisable dolphins, providing data {{for a range of}} long-term and ongoing studies on the abundance, site fidelity, home range, social structure and behaviour of this population. The study of dolphins social structures defines an important class of ecological relationships between individuals and their nearby conspecifics. Common bottlenose dolphins live in fission-fusion societies within which individuals associate in small groups that change in composition, often on a daily or hourly basis. Fission-fusion societies limit the effect of within-unit competition through unit splits during periods of high competition, and they enhance cooperative effects through unit cohesion when the <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> of aggregating are low or benefits of sociality are high. Human activities can influence the distribution of food resources, which may promote the evolution of social organizations as a response to fluctuations in the costs of feeding competition. Therefore, fission-fusion societies present a good opportunity to examine {{the costs and benefits of}} association in dolphin populations affected by human use of coastal waters, especially by fisheries activities and habitat modification. Individual-based studies focusing explicitly the variability of social unit structure in relation to anthropogenic factors are few. In this project, BDRI researchers will study the patterns of association of different populations of bottlenose dolphins (in Italy and Spain) and will describe the way in which their association behaviour is related to the way they respond to food patches created by human activities. BDRI researchers studied interactions between dolphins and gillnets along the north-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Although dolphins benefit from taking fish entangled in gillnets, the association with gillnets is harmful because it exposes dolphins to additional risk. An observed annual estimate of the number of dolphins caught in gillnets was 3.54%. The extent of the estimated by-catch is worrisome in terms of the ability of bottlenose dolphins off Sardinia to sustain such an annual loss. The higher annual numbers of immature dolphins than adults dolphins caught in gillnets was related with a lack of experience together with and the tendency of immatures to play and/or to spend a lot of time scouting.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperA rapid {{increase}} in the Thai trawl and push net fisheries had led to over fishing and thus fishery resource degradation. Catch per unit effort decreased from over 300 kg/hr in the past 30 years to less than 20 kg/hr recently. The impact has placed a greater burden on coastal fishermen who have limited alternative fishing grounds. In response to the degradation of resources, Thai fishermen adjusted their fishing gears, turning to the "available" resources. Examples were anchovy fisheries in place of small trawl fisheries. Nevertheless such a response led to the degradation of another resource. Ecological, economic and social factors can explain such patterns of resource exploitation. Societal cost - a concept being developed within the ECOST project - includes <b>ecological</b> <b>cost,</b> economic cost, and social cost to form a measure that would better elaborate the value of Thai fisheries resources. The objective is to help improve fisheries management, to enhance the living conditions of the coastal poor and ensure the sustainability of Thai fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{reproduction}} yields immediate fitness benefits but can {{be costly}} in terms of survival, growth, and future fecundity. Lifehistory theory posits that reproductive strategies are shaped by tradeoffs between current and future fitness that result from these direct costs of reproduction. Plant reproduction may also incur indirect <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> if it increases susceptibility to herbivores. Yet <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> of reproduction have received little empirical attention and remain poorly integrated into life-history theory. Here, we provide evidence for herbivore-mediated <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> of reproduction, and we develop theory to examine how these costs influence plant life-history strategies. Field experiments with an iteroparous cactus (Opuntia imbricata) indicated that greater reproductive effort (proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction) led to greater attack by a cactus-feeding insect (Narnia pallidicornis) and that damage by this herbivore reduced reproductive success. A dynamic programming model predicted strongly divergent optimal reproductive strategies when <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> were included, compared with when these costs were ignored. Meristem allocation by cacti in the field matched the optimal strategy expected under <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> of reproduction. The results indicate that plant reproductive allocation can strongly influence the intensity of interactions with herbivores and that associated <b>ecological</b> <b>costs</b> {{can play an important}} selective role in the evolution of plant life histories...|$|E
