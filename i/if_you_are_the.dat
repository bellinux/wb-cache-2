500|$|The Chinese {{media has}} {{capitalized}} {{on the subject}} matter with television shows, viral videos, newspapers and magazine articles, and pundits that have sharply criticized women for [...] "waiting it out {{for a man with}} a bigger house or fancier car". The television series comedy Will You Marry Me and My Family, which premièred on CCTV-8, that revolves around the principal concept of sheng nu as a family frantically searches for a prospective spouse of the main character who is in her 30s. The series Old Women Should Get Married and [...] You Are the One (MediaCorp Channel 8) have been accredited with minting terms like [...] "the shengnu economy" [...] and further bringing the subject into public fascination and obsession. <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> One (Jiangsu Satellite Television) is a popular Chinese game show, loosely based on Taken Out, whose rise has been credited with the [...] "national obsession" [...] surrounding sheng nu. The show between 2010-2013 was China's most viewed game show.|$|E
500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus <b>if</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E

If you are looking for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and perhaps you should concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Art therapy {{can take}} place in a variety of {{different}} settings. [...] Art therapists may vary the goals of art therapy and the way they provide art therapy, depending upon the institution's or client's needs. After an assessment of the client's strengths and needs, art therapy may be offered in either an individual or group format, according to which is better suited to the person. [...] Art therapist Dr. Ellen G. Horovitz wrote, [...] "My responsibilities vary from job to job. It is wholly different when one works as a consultant or in an agency as opposed to private practice. In private practice, it becomes more complex and far reaching. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> primary therapist then your responsibilities can swing from the spectrum of social work to the primary care of the patient. This includes dovetailing with physicians, judges, family members, and sometimes even community members that might be important in the caretaking of the individual." [...] Like other psychotherapists in private practice, some art therapists find it important to ensure, for the therapeutic relationship, that the sessions occur each week in the same space and at the same time.|$|E

Valrey made a film {{entitled}} “Operation Small Axe,” {{which focused}} on the Grant shooting, {{as well as the}} Lovelle Mixon case, within the larger context of police brutality in the Bay Area. Valrey showed his movie around the country in 2010. The film was directed and produced by Adimu Madyun and won the 2010 Rise Up Award from The Patois International Rights Film Festival in New Orleans, but Valrey also stirred controversy. [...] "The headline for a cover story in the East Bay Express called Valrey an 'Agent Provocateur' – a term generally associated with police informants assigned to cause violence," [...] wrote Temple University associate professor Linn Washington, Jr. after a Philadelphia screening. [...] "That article referred to Valrey as an 'advocacy journalist' who did things 'no mainstream journalist would do,' like speaking at an anti-police brutality rally. 'They tried to get the community to turn against me but I have strong support in the community,' said Valrey, who [...] serves [...] an editor at the San Francisco Bay View, a black owned online newspaper," [...] Washington continued. While in Washington, DC for a screening, Valrey was accompanied by Malcolm Shabazz, grandson of Malcolm X. Shabazz spoke of [...] "his life since being released from prison for the arson of his grandmother’s house" [...] in a joint appearance.
