Foreigners, who were centered in <b>foreign</b> sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. <b>Foreign</b> clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by <b>foreign</b> powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for <b>foreign</b> assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or <b>foreign</b> assets. However, both domestic and <b>foreign</b> assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on <b>foreign</b> assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and <b>foreign</b> investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

5|$|The Council on <b>Foreign</b> Relations {{began in}} 1917 {{with a group}} of New York {{academics}} who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the <b>foreign</b> policy of the United States in the interwar period.

The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called <b>Foreign</b> Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on <b>Foreign</b> Relations at that time.
