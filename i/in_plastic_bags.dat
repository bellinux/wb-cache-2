5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E

25|$|The {{murder of}} Karyn Hearn Slover {{occurred}} on September 27, 1996 in Decatur, Illinois, when Karyn disappeared shortly after leaving {{her job as}} an advertising sales representative at the Decatur Herald & Review.

25|$|Basil is most {{commonly}} used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept {{for a short time}} <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavor, like hay.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Nilsen {{purchased a}} Polaroid camera and photographed Ockenden's body in various suggestive positions. He then lay Ockenden's corpse spreadeagled above {{him on his}} bed as he watched television for several hours, before wrapping the body <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> and stowing the corpse beneath the floorboards. On approximately four occasions over the following fortnight, Nilsen disinterred Ockenden's body from beneath his floorboards and seated the body upon his armchair alongside him as he himself watched television and drank alcohol.|$|E
25|$|As {{had been}} the case with both Howlett and Allen, Sinclair's body was {{subsequently}} dissected, with the various dismembered parts wrapped <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> and stored in either a wardrobe, a tea chest or within a drawer located beneath the bathtub. The bags used to seal Sinclair's remains would be sealed with the same crepe bandages Nilsen had found upon Sinclair's wrists. Nilsen attempted to dispose of the flesh, internal organs and smaller bones of all three victims killed at Cranley Gardens by flushing their dissected remains down his toilet. In a practice which he had conducted upon several victims killed at Melrose Avenue, he also boiled the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh off these sections of the victims' bodies.|$|E

25|$|When {{questioned}} {{as to why}} {{the heads}} found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot on his stove in order that the internal contents would evaporate, thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address would be dissected within a week or so of their murder before being wrapped <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags</b> and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he would flush down the toilet. This practice — which had led to his arrest — had been the only method he could consider to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive usage of the garden of the property.|$|E
25|$|The Cadereyta Jiménez {{massacre}} {{occurred on}} the Mexican Federal Highway 40 on 13 May 2012. Mexican officials stated that 49 people were decapitated and mutilated by members of Los Zetas drug cartel and dumped by a roadside {{near the city of}} Monterrey in northern Mexico. The Blog del Narco, a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican Drug War anonymously, reported that the actual (unofficial) death toll may be more than 68 people. The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León at about 4a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The forty-three men and six women killed had their heads, feet, and hands cut off, making their identification difficult. Those killed also bore signs of torture and were stuffed <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> The arrested suspects have indicated that the victims were Gulf Cartel members, but the Mexican authorities have not ruled out the possibility that they were U.S.-bound migrants. Four days before this incident, 18 people were found decapitated and dismembered near Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the food}} aboard is vacuum sealed <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> Cans are rare because they are heavy and {{expensive}} to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity. Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward {{to the arrival of}} any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food warmers, a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E

500|$|Beecher's cheeses {{differ from}} similar cheeses {{in that they}} mix cheese growth {{cultures}} in unusual ways. For example, their signature [...] "Flagship" [...] cheese includes cultures typically used for non-cheddar cheeses, such as Gruyère and Emmental, changing the nature, flavor, and texture of their cheddar. Flagship cheese is produced using a cheddaring process, but owing to a different taste, Beecher's does not call this cheese cheddar. The cheese {{has been described as}} having a [...] "sweet finish and creamy texture" [...] unlike the tangier cheddars, owing to this being one of the cheeses they create with a mixture of different cheese cultures. After being prepared in [...] blocks and aged for approximately one year, the Flagship—unlike cheddars—lacks a rind, is moister, resembles butter visually, and carries a milky aroma due to being aged <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bags.</b> A variant called [...] "Flagship Reserve" [...] is aged in cheese cloth in [...] sizes on racks in open air, and is rubbed with butter while being turned daily. This preparation method causes the Reserve to lose up to 12% of its initial weight by the time it is completed. The Reserve is aged for a shorter amount of time, leading to a sharper, nuttier taste and texture, according to Food & Wine Magazine. Of the [...] of cheese they produce annually, approximately [...] will be Flagship, and only [...] will be Flagship Reserve.|$|E
