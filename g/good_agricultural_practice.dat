The producers were oriented and received educational material and utensils made from recyclable material to the achievement of good health practices. For evaluation of the physiological profile, biological samples such as blood, feces and milk were collected, and for the assessment of sanitation and welfare, a questionnaire was employed. A total of 79 mammary quarters from 20 cows were evaluated. Of the 36 negative quarters for California Mastitis Test, 12 were positive for bacteria, with Staphylococcus being the most frequently isolated. The results indicated that animal welfare was compromised by the incidence of subclinical mastitis, infestation with ectoparasites and the absence of prophylactic measures. It is concluded that the use of <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> is suitable for the identification of bovine mastitis, however, there is lack of knowledge regarding good practices, mainly related to preventive management and awareness of producers about the importance of implementing <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> in the dairy activity, which are key to improving animal welfare conditions, productivity and quality of mil...|$|R

5000|$|NVZs have fairly relaxed {{rules on}} {{fertiliser}} application involving not fertilising {{at certain times}} of the year (during the winter when runoff is greatest and uptake by plants at a minimum), reducing the amount of fertiliser used, and changing the times when animal waste is applied to the land (waste must be held in tanks over the period when it cannot be applied). Farmers who do not adhere to these restrictions can be fined by the Government. The restrictions are within the guidelines of GAP (<b>Good</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Practice)</b> and so the farmers are expected to adhere without receiving any subsidies.|$|E

5000|$|To limit mixing in {{the first}} stages of production, {{researchers}} and politicians are developing codes of <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice</b> for GM crops. In addition to the thorough cleaning of machinery, recommended measures include the establishment of [...] "isolation distances" [...] and [...] "pollen barriers". Isolation distances are the minimum distances required between GM and non-GM cultivations {{for most of the}} GM pollen to fall to the ground before reaching non-GM plants. Pollen barriers attempt actively catch pollen, and can consist of hedges and trees which physically hinder pollen movement. Pollen barriers consisting of conventional crops of the same species as the GM crop have a special advantage, as the conventional plants not only physically limit the GM pollen flow, but also produce competitive, conventional pollen. During harvest, the buffer strip of conventional crops is considered part of the GM crop yield.|$|E
50|$|The MRL {{is usually}} {{determined}} by repeated (on {{the order of}} 10) field trials, where the crop has been treated according to <b>good</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice</b> (GAP) and an appropriate pre harvest interval or withholding period has elapsed. For many pesticides this is set at the Limit of Determination (LOD) - since only major pesticides have been evaluated and understanding of Acceptable daily intake (ADI) is incomplete (i.e. producers or public bodies have not submitted MRL data - often because these were not required in the past). LOD {{can be considered a}} measure of presence/absence, but certain residues may not be quantifiable at very low levels. For this reason the limit of quantification (LOQ) is often used instead of the LOD. As a rule of thumb the LOQ is approximately two times the LOD. For substances that are not included in any of the annexes in EU regulations, a default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg normally applies.|$|E

The results indicate that the overcoming obstacles in GAP implementation and adopting these <b>Good</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Practices</b> are the sociocultural characteristics of the growers, the weak awareness among growers and other industry stakeholders (producers, wholesalers, processors and retailers) and the modest role played by Argentina in the potato export markets. Consumers need to be educated and encouraged to stimulate the demand for safe and quality foods like potato. The implementation of GAP may be limited by the capacity of government organization to provide resources and technical training.
