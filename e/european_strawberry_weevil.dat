In this study, single receptor neurons on the antenna of the oligophagous strawberry blossomweevil Anthonomus rubiwere screened for sensitivity to naturally produced plant compounds by the use of gas chromatography linked to electrophysiological recordings from single cells. The narrow tuning of the neurons was demonstrated by responses solely to a few structurally related sesquiterpenes, aromatics or monoterpene hydrocarbons out of {{hundreds of}} plant constituents tested. We present five olfactory receptor neuron types, identified according to one primary odorant i. e. the compound to which the neurons aremost sensitive.

Adult weevils emerged from the soil from late May until mid- June and were active in the field until late July. Active feeding by adults occurred between one and seven hours after sunset. No significant migration {{for the purpose of}} feeding or oviposition was observed and no adults were found to overwinter. Oviposition occurred from mid-June until September in the laboratory but ceased by late July in the field. Egg incubation periods averaged 13 days in the laboratory with fertility rates of 70 to 80 percent. Fertility declined substantially in the laboratory after late July. Larvae occurred in the peppermint root systems from early June until late May of the following year with pupation occurring from mid-April until the first of June.

5000|$|The <b>Strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus rubi is a weevil {{that feeds}} on {{members of the}} Rosaceae and is an {{important}} pest of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.). This insect is a particularly problematic pest of strawberry in Europe, in some cases responsible for up to 80% loss of the berry crop. Adults feed on strawberry foliage, and females lay eggs inside unopened flower buds (one egg per bud) before partially or totally severing the stalk; larvae develop inside the severed buds, feeding on the wilting tissue.|$|R
40|$|The alfalfa leaf-weevil (Phytonomus murinus Fab.) {{which has}} {{during the last}} three years been doing {{considerable}} damage in the central part of this State, is a European insect which by some means unknown has been introduced in to Utah. The species appears to be not uncommon throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the large order of hard-shelled insects called beetles (Coleoptera) and in a group generally called snout-beetles (Family Curculionidae). To this same group belong many of our most serious pests, such as the plum curculio, cotton boll-weevil and <b>strawberry</b> <b>weevil.</b> It occurs over all of Europe, a portion of northern Africa and eastern Asia. It probably occurs throughout all of the regions in which alfalfa is cultivated in the eastern hemisphere but rarely causing damage sufficient to be reported. Heeger (3) has given a brief synopsis of its life history and work. This weevil belongs to a genus of insects which feed principally upon leguminous plants and several species in the genus have been introduced into the United States and Canada. Two of these, the clover leaf-weevil (P. punctatus), and the lesser clover leaf-weevil (P. nigirostris), have done considerable damage to the clover crop in the eastern and central states and the former has been reported as injuring clover in Oregon.

50|$|The {{plants that}} the <b>strawberry</b> root <b>weevil</b> feeds on include strawberry, raspberry, rhododendron, grape, and {{peppermint}} {{and they have}} also been known to feed on grasses. Adults feed nocturnally on leaves and stems, leaving notches and causing slight damage, while the larvae cause significantly more damage by feeding on the roots and crowns of the plant, even as they overwinter, if the temperatures are mild. The plants that are fed upon by the larvae are stunted and have reddish leaves that curl exposing the underside, and the plant wilts as the fruits form, especially in dry weather. The fine roots and sometimes even the hard fibrous roots are destroyed, allowing for the plants to be easily pulled from the soil. These plants have significantly shortened lives, poor yields that result in losses in revenue. Fields with significant damage can be up to 0.2ha. Since adults do not fly, plants bordering older plantings show damage the first season, with damage spreading each year the planting is kept.Controlling the <b>strawberry</b> root <b>weevil</b> includes {{a wide variety of}} methods {{such as the use of}} insecticides, plowing under old crops and crop rotation, cleaning farm equipment before moving to a new field, and fall plowing infested beds or fields. Another control method is the use of entomopathogenic nematodes, though results have varied.|$|R
40|$|Organic {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} growing is increasing world-wide, but knowledge concerning best practice is generally empirical rather than field-based. This thesis extends knowledge concerning best practice in Swedish organic strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa (Duch)) production, which is usually based on a two-year crop. A series of four field experiments were conducted at Rånna Experimental Station (58 ° 27 ’N, 13 ° 51 ’E) on the strawberry cultivars ‘Honeoye’, ‘Cavendish’ and ‘Korona’. Specific objectives were to investigate: the effects of different organic fertilisers combined with degradable plastic mulch on plant establishment, yield and nitrogen mineralisation in soil; the efficiency of biological pest control using a predatory mite against strawberry mites (Phytonemus pallidus); innate within-field dispersal capacity of strawberry mite; the effects of pyrethrum combined with fleece covering on damage by <b>strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevil</b> (Anthonomus rubi). Plant establishment measured as fruit yield was improved by 60 % when degradable plastic mulch was used, probably through more flowers being initiated. Additional applications of organic fertiliser during the cropping period {{had little effect on}} yield. Biological control using the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris reduced strawberry mite populations by up to 50 % but there was no increase in yield. It was difficult to draw clear conclusions from the strawberry mite dispersal pilot study, but mites tended to move more easily along planted rows than between rows. Pyrethrum alone had no visible effect on flower bud damage by <b>strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevil</b> but when combined with fleece covering it reduced the number of ‘Honeoye’ buds damaged by weevils by approximately 10 %. This was followed by a corresponding increase in cultivar yield. Similar effects were not recorded in the other cultivar examined. The study identified the following practical consequences for organic strawberry production: • Choice of pest-resistant cultivars is extremely important for success. • Use of clean plants and an efficient predatory species is essential in controlling mite infestations. • Use of degradable plastic mulching is recommended. • Fleece covering is recommended for protecting some cultivars against <b>strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevils.</b> • Only an initial starter fertilisation is required. • Use of pyrethrum is not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{field trials}} with the {{strawberry}} cultivars Honeoye and BF 949603 (from Balsgård) were performed both in tunnel and outdoor at Rånna Experimental Station, Skövde 2006 - 2008. In tunnel, {{there were three}} treatments for control of powdery mildew, Podosphaera aphanis: sulphur, a test product from Koppert, rape seed oil in 2007 and AQ 10 (Ampelomyces quisqualis) in 2008, and two organic fertilizers, Binablå (6. 3. 12) and Vinass (4. 0. 9). In 2007 the percentage of fruits damaged by powdery mildew was significantly lowest in the treatment with sulphur. However, {{there were no significant}} differences between class 1 fruits or total yield. In 2006 and in 2008 there was no powdery mildew on the fruits. The two fertilizers yielded equally but Vinass had significantly more discarded fruits in 2008. There were no occurrences of grey mould, mites or trips in the tunnel production. In the outdoor production, treatments with and without the predatory mite Neuseiulus cucumeris for the control of the strawberry mite, Phytonemus pallidus, with and without net fence to control of the <b>strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus rubi and two organic fertilizers, Binablå and Vinass, were compared. The results showed significant fewer strawberry mites on plants treated with predatory mites in the cultivar Honeoye all three years. Using of net (mesh size 1. 4 mm) did not fence out the <b>strawberry</b> <b>weevils</b> but the improved micro climate inside the net resulted in a higher yield both 2007 and 2008. There were no differences in yield between fertilizers. A demonstration trial has been conducted in a commercial tunnel production in Lidköping. Bio-control of the strawberry mites with the predatory mite, N. cucumeris was introduced in 2006 and 2007 with very positive results. Release of the predatory mites twice and three times seasonally resulted in no capture of strawberry mites in 2007. Tunnel production of soft fruits is slowly increasing in West Sweden. There is a need of more examples of successful growers that earn money from tunnel production. The strawberry producer in Lidköping is convinced of that tunnels are needed for an extended season. Conclusions * Release of predatory mite, N. cucumeris, in April, May and July, gives good control of the strawberry mite, P. pallidus, and higher yield of the two first crops in Honeoye * The organic fertilizers Binablå (6. 3. 12) and Vinass (4. 0. 9) gives the same yield in the cultivars Honeoye and BF 949603 when used at the same nitrogen level, both in tunnel and outdoor. * Net fence, mesh size 1. 4 mm, is not efficient enough to exclude <b>strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevils</b> Powdery mildew, P. aphanis, is a big problem on strawberries in tunnels during spring.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{the second part of}} a project to assess the {{applicability}} of the male-produced, aggregation pheromone of the <b>strawberry</b> blossom <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus rubi, for commercial monitoring and control. Following optimisation of pheromone lure and trap in previous work, the potential of the pheromone traps for monitoring and control of the pest was investigated. There was no obvious relationship between total pheromone trap catches and numbers of weevils on the crop determined by beating. However, good correlations were obtained at five sites during two seasons between the cumulative numbers of weevils and the amount of severing damage on the crop. Early catches of weevils preceded the first occurrence of damage by at least 1 week in several instances, providing useful information for timing the application of insecticide sprays against the adults to prevent occurrence of damage. The number of flowers severed was usually in the range of 0. 5 – 2. 0 times the cumulative number of weevils captured per trap. Adult weevil catches started at a low level in April or early May with similar numbers of males and females. The catches showed a marked increase in mid June coinciding with the emergence of new adults from the damaged flower buds, even though these are in reproductive diapause. Male weevils predominated in catches beyond this date by a factor of approximately 2 : 1. Two field experiments investigated the interference between traps and the effects of the traps on populations and crop damage by this pest. There was no evidence for interference between traps at spacings as close as 1. 7 m, and no effect on weevil damage or distribution was observed.

The European tarnished plant bug (Lygus rugulipennis) causes large yield losses (10 -> 80 %) in conventional and organic strawberry.
