Canadian sales of the Geo Metro only began in 1992, after {{the demise of the}} Asüna brand. For 1990, the Metro's second model year, Geo introduced the Metro LSi models, which included an automatic transmission, air conditioning and a stereo with cassette player. Geo also introduced the frugal XFi model, featuring a lower powered economy-tuned version of the three-cylinder engine, a higher <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, and certain deleted interior amenities (e.g., the passenger mirror). It thereby achieved 43 city, 51 highway per the revised 2007 EPA mileage standards. XFi made up less than 10% of Metro sales. A little bit later, the Japanese-built convertible model debuted, available in LSi trim. In 1991, GM increased convertible production and added paint options. In 1992, the Metro received a facelift with new hubcaps, exterior modification and new interior controls.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to determine a passenger vehicles' acceleration and top speed change {{in response to the}} change in the ratio of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>gearing</b> coefficient. To accomplish this, the following tasks had to be completed: analysis of the transmission types, their construction and the operation of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> assembly, performing a numerical analysis and comparing it to dynamic real world test results using a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” as the test subject. The car chosen for {{this research}} is a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” due to its classical arrangement comprised of a front mounted four cylinder petrol engine and rear wheel drive. The analysis of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>gearing</b> in such arrangement is easier, due to the transmission being separate from the rear mounted differential assembly. By changing the differential housings which have different internal gearing, their effect on the vehicle's acceleration and top speed could be observed and compared to the calculations of expected values. The research was started by gathering and analyzing material about the power delivery chain in the manual transmission vehicle model to develop a familiarity with the components: flywheel, clutch, transmission and integrated subframe <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> assembly. In regards to the available <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> assemblies, four differential housings were chosen with the following internal gearing configurations to conduct this study: 2. 79 : 1 – the lowest one, available from the factory in the diesel powered vehicles known for their high torque. 3. 15 : 1 – the gear set mostly found in the high powered petrol engine cars. 3. 45 : 1 – the gear set that came standard with the chosen test vehicle. 4. 10 : 1 – the gear set used for the least powerful petrol engines, usually coupled with automatic transmissions. Changing the differential therefore changes the <b>gearing</b> of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> assembly and provides a change in vehicle dynamics. After conducting the gathering and analysis of the available information from the data-sheets and literal documentation, practical tests were conducted using a “DL 1 ” data collection tool to capture the information about the response of the car with all four aforementioned differentials. Using the “Analysis V 8 ” software with the said tool, the top speed and acceleration for each gear and all four differentials were determined, alongside the engine RPM for 50 km/h and 90 km/h for different gears. Finally the theoretical calculations for the top speed at max engine in every gear were calculated. They were correlated with the observed values for our measurements, including the top RPM for each gear and the engine RPM for 50 km/h in 3 'rd gear, 50 km/h and 90 km/h in 4 th gear, 90 km/h in 5 th gear. The observations conclude that increasing the ratio of the gear set in the differential leads to a quicker accelerating vehicle, but it negatively affects the comfort and fuel consumption. The best gear set ratio for fuel economy and acceleration for our test vehicle was determined to be the factory 3. 45 : 1 although with increased driving speed (above 90 km/h) fuel economy and comfort are reduced. For users who spend most of their commute at highway speeds, it would be recommended to switch their <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> assembly to the one with the ratio of 2. 79 : 1 for increased comfort and decreased fuel consumption. The conducted research is unique in terms of applicability. A user could tailor their car to their needs in regard to the expected driving conditions based on this research. Also- the calculated and observed data have a very close correlation, therefore a calculated <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> ratio selection could be trusted to have the expected result on the vehicle...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the overall gear ratio of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets {{on each side of the}} chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving sprockets and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized driven sprockets, allows up to 33 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills.

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} war Stuart {{introduced}} the P3 single-cylinder 2-stroke engine, designed by Alec Plint to drive lighting and pumping plants.

Casting were produced in Stuart Turner's own foundry. The P4 superseded the P3 in 1928, and in 1930 the marine variant was introduced, and was sold in considerable number for fitment in small yachts and other pleasure boats. In around 1935/1936 the P4 was joined by the larger-bore P5 (268 cc) and twin-cylinder P55 (535 cc). While the P4 was made until the war, the P5 and P55 continued in production for over 30 years. For the marine engines Stuart produced a reversing gearbox and optional <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> reduction <b>gear,</b> and everything else up to and including the propellor was available. The many variations of the engines (marine and otherwise) were indicated by suffixes to the engine number, so for example a P55ME would be a marine P55 with electric start (Lucas Dynamotor, Siba Dynastart, or separate dynamo and starter).|$|R
