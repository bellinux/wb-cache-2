40|$|We {{analyzed}} a 402 -bp {{sequence of}} the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 34 strains of Exophiala jeanselmei and 16 strains representing 12 related species. The strains of E. jeanselmei were classified into 20 DNA types and 17 amino acid <b>types.</b> <b>The</b> differences between these strains were found in 1 to 60 nucleotides and 1 to 17 amino acids. On {{the basis of the}} identities and similarities of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, some strains were reidentified: i. e., two strains of E. jeanselmei var. hetermorpha and one strain of E. castellanii as E. dermatitidis (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain), three strains of E. jeanselmei as E. jeanselmei var. lecanii-corni (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain), three strains of E. jeanselmei as E. bergeri (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain), seven strains of E. jeanselmei as E. pisciphila (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain), seven strains of E. jeanselmei as E. jeanselmei var. jeanselmei (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain), one strain of E. jeanselmei as Fonsecaea pedrosoi (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain), and one strain of E. jeanselmei as E. spinifera (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> strain). Some E. jeanselmei strains showed distinct nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

25|$|According to the WHO, {{all humans}} {{are exposed to}} some level of mercury. Factors that {{determine}} whether health effects occur and their severity <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of mercury concerned (methylmercury and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually {{discussed in terms of}} the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{extrinsic}} {{because it}} depends {{not on the}} responses of the trier of fact, but on specific criteria that can be listed and analyzed. Such criteria <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of artwork involved, the materials used, the subject matter, and the setting for the subject. Since it is an extrinsic test, analytic dissection and expert testimony are appropriate. Moreover, this question may often be decided as a matter of law. The determination of when there is substantial similarity between the forms of expression is necessarily more subtle and complex. As Judge Hand candidly observed, [...] "Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc." [...] Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2 Cir. 1960). If there is substantial similarity in ideas, then the trier of fact must decide whether there is substantial similarity in the expressions of the ideas so as to constitute infringement. The test to be applied in determining whether there is substantial similarity in expressions shall be labeled an intrinsic one depending on the response of the ordinary reasonable person. See International Luggage Registry v. Avery Products Corp., supra, 541 F.2d at 831; Harold Lloyd Corp. v. Witwer, 65 F.2d 1, 18–19 (9 Cir. 1933). See generally Nimmer § 143.5. It is intrinsic because it does not depend on the type of external criteria and analysis that marks the extrinsic test.... Because this is an intrinsic test, analytic dissection and expert testimony are not appropriate.|$|E
