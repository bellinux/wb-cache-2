40|$|The {{nitrogen}} {{of organic}} fertilizers {{does not fully}} mineralize within a season, and hence will partly become available in later years. This effect is taken into account {{for the first year}} but generally not in later fertilizer applications. If it would be taken into account, fertilizer use could be more efficient. This study is an analysis of a 13 -year field trial where crop yield was measured in 13 fertilizer treatments which differ in total N applied and decomposition rate. This is complemented with a model study in which mineralization and soil nitrogen content were calculated. We intended to show step by step that the use of fertilizers with a low decomposition rate, relative to fertilizers with a high decomposition rate, lead in the course of years to an increase in soil organic nitrogen, an increased nitrogen mineralization and availability and that this results in increased yields. Some of the results in these four steps in our work give support to this, but there are more factors at play. We show that when using, for example, <b>deep</b> <b>stable</b> <b>manure,</b> after some years the available nitrogen may for 50 % or more be derived from manure applied in former years. This makes clear that, at least in agricultural systems that use a substantial amount of organic fertilizers, it is worthwhile taking this delayed mineralization into account...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to, through {{temperature}} readings {{and evaluation of}} sowing, examine how materials containing more or less nitrogen generate heat in a hot bed. The method used to answer set questions {{has been carried out}} by gathering facts from literature, informants and digital resources, compiling this into a practical test with a hot bed containing six compartments with different materials. The materials being tested are fresh <b>stable</b> <b>manure,</b> garden waste, chicken manure, leaves, wool and old <b>stable</b> <b>manure,</b> where the hot bed with fresh manure is used as a reference. The {{temperature readings}} show that materials {{with a high level of}} nitrogen has a faster and higher heat generating capacity compared to materials with lower levels of nitrogen. It also show that these hot beds has a greater temperature loss when covered with soil. By the end of the test all hot beds, regardless previous temperature, has stabilized at 7 - 10 degrees Celsius. At this time germination has occurred in half of the examined hot beds; fresh manure, garden waste and wool. One week later, germination has occurred in all hot beds, with equivalent progress. This indicates that the alternative materials can be used instead of fresh <b>stable</b> <b>manure</b> to achieve a crop earlier than outdoor sowing. The temperature readings however show that neither of the hot beds work according to the gathered information. The temperature readings also show that the cooler hot beds to a large extent follow the outside temperature. The conclusion is by these parameters that the examined materials probably can be used as a component to fresh <b>stable</b> <b>manure,</b> but that the material per se, in the amount used in this test, are not potent enough to generate enough heat, had the outdoor climate been colder.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of organic soil amendments against S. sclerotiorum, {{the cause of}} soft rot of lettuce, and similar diseases {{of a range of}} other crops, was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. Lucerne hay, <b>stable</b> <b>manure</b> and fowl manure greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by S. sclerotiorum in lettuce and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular lucerne hay, <b>stable</b> <b>manure</b> and fowl manure, significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from lucerne hay, <b>stable</b> <b>manure</b> and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems. Organic amendments generally reduced the number of sclerotia in the soil over the experimental period. Disease incidence reflected levels of sclerotia in soil. The presence of organic substrate combined with high moisture levels, high relative humidity, and mild temperature suppressed Sclerotinia diseases, delayed onset of disease in some seasons and decreased the rate of disease development in lettuce and tomatoes.
