". A customer asks for the batch production of the casts, that he will be order step by step for working in regular intervals. The part of the customer's plan is the optimalization of the production and the press of the price, that should be lower after the finishing of the production technology. Along with the correction of the price, a customer expects cutting of the delivery time with the fully quali-ty of the working. In the first version, without a wide preparation, is all working realized on the general-purpose machines. The second version focuses on the production with use of drilling jigs, that is constructed and produced by the firm itself. The input costs of this preparation at the production will be compensated with the major production times, that will be destage from the expensive borer to the cheaper <b>drilling-machine.</b> The last third version supposes setting of the CNC machining centres and therethrough it will be reach to huge saving of the major and minor production times by the working...|$|E

Tools, <b>drilling-machines</b> and labor on the heading." [...] He read out the cost of each item. [...] "Then we have to provide a stamp-mill, turbines, flumes and dam; and, though Mr. Weston suggests a wood-burning engine to supply the crushing power, the saving effected would be no great matter. The point is that we now discover that the cost of these things will {{in one way or another}} be nearly double what we stated in our prospectus." ...|$|R
