5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, <b>figure</b> <b>8,</b> or theta graph; any handcuff or <b>figure</b> <b>8</b> graph may be {{contracted to}} form a butterfly graph (five-vertex <b>figure</b> <b>8),</b> and any theta graph may be contracted {{to form a}} diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a <b>figure</b> <b>8</b> pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a <b>figure</b> <b>8</b> around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E

An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman.

A selection of amphibians, invertebrates and fish are also displayed in the building's main entrance hall, including axolotl, blue poison dart frogs, mudskippers, <b>figure</b> <b>8</b> pufferfish, banded archerfish, blind cave fish, and a colony of leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|This form of Cotes's spirals {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the two Poinsot's spirals (<b>Figure</b> <b>8).</b> The possible values of λ range from zero to infinity, which {{corresponds to}} values of μ greater than the positive number L12/m. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that L is not too large for the given μ.|$|E
5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a <b>figure</b> <b>8</b> or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E

5|$|From the <b>figure</b> <b>8,</b> it {{is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. <b>Figure</b> <b>8</b> of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E

Since then, the wall has been a regular target for graffiti but is regularly restored by fans.|$|E

5|$|For any graph G = (V,E), we may {{define a}} matroid {{on the edges}} of G, in which a set of edges is {{independent}} if and only if it forms a pseudoforest; this matroid is known as the bicircular matroid (or bicycle matroid) of G. The smallest dependent sets for this matroid are the minimal connected subgraphs of G that have more than one cycle, and these subgraphs are sometimes called bicycles. There are three possible types of bicycle: a theta graph has two vertices that are connected by three internally disjoint paths, a <b>figure</b> <b>8</b> graph consists of two cycles sharing a single vertex, and a handcuff graph is formed by two disjoint cycles connected by a path.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (<b>figure</b> <b>8)</b> and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the <b>Figure</b> <b>8</b> album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E
