5|$|Marseille was {{becoming}} physically <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the frenetic pace of combat. After his last combat on 26 September, Marseille was reportedly {{on the verge}} of collapse after a 15-minute battle with a formation of Spitfires, during which he scored his seventh victory of that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} the Xbox 360 Premium version was dropped to US$299 in North America on July 13, 2008. Supplies of the {{existing}} 20GB model were <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> early August and it was replaced by an identical model with a 60GB HDD at a MSRP of US$349.|$|E
5|$|East of Porus' kingdom, {{near the}} Ganges River, were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal {{region of the}} Indian subcontinent). Fearing the {{prospect}} of facing other large armies and <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that this is a large and rapidly growing region, area code 365 was {{assigned}} for further relief on March 25, 2013, and area code 742 has been set aside for further relief as the area is expected to <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> 2036 at current growth rates.|$|R
5|$|Historically {{diamonds}} {{were known}} to be found only in alluvial deposits in southern India. India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in summer of 1914, the French {{military}} put Schweitzer and Albert, Germans in a French colony, under supervision at Lambaréné, where they continued their work. In 1917, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> over four years' work and by tropical anaemia, they were taken to Bordeaux and interned first in Garaison and then from March 1918 in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.|$|E
5|$|Although the Third Crusade, in the end, {{failed to}} retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was {{eventually}} negotiated with Saladin. The truce, {{known as the}} Treaty of Jaffa, ensured that Christian pilgrims from the west would once again be allowed to visit Jerusalem. Saladin also recognised the Crusaders' control of the Levantine coast {{as far south as}} Jaffa. Both sides had become <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France, and Palestine was in a ruinous state.|$|E
50|$|Chemical rockets are {{the most}} common type of rocket and they {{typically}} create their <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> the combustion of rocket propellant. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.|$|R
60|$|Yes, she slept. The Indian sleeps at {{the stake}} in the {{intervals}} between his tortures; and mental torments, in like manner, <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> long continuance the sensibility of the sufferer, so that an interval of lethargic repose must necessarily ensue, ere the pangs which they inflict can again be renewed.|$|R
50|$|In winter, {{the air in}} {{the cavity}} is {{buffered}} by warm ambient-temperature Earth under the floor (which is partially recharged by the natural convection flow loop during each winter day). In the summer, the convective flow is replaced with cooler near-ambient-temperature Earth replacement air, and the warm air <b>exhausts</b> <b>by</b> natural convection.|$|R
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became <b>exhausted.</b> <b>By</b> early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> {{the war and}} were {{prepared}} to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exhausted</b> <b>by</b> his labors {{during and}} after his {{scientific}} expedition to Egypt, Champollion died of an apoplectic attack (stroke) in Paris on the 4th of March 1832 {{at the age of}} 41. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. On his tomb is a simple obelisk erected by his wife, and a stone slab stating simply: Ici repose Jean-François Champollion, né à Figeac dept. du Lot le 23 décembre 1790, décédé à Paris le 4 mars 1832 (Here rests Jean-François Champollion, born at Figeac, Department of the Lot, on 23 December 1790, died at Paris on 4 March 1832).|$|E
50|$|Later {{developments}} included direct coil-on-plug ignition, roller lifters, {{and variable}} valve timing, which can vary intake {{by up to}} 40° and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> up to 50°. VVT was devised for the longitudinal LH2 version, and has not, to date, been used on the transverse front wheel drive engines due to packaging considerations.|$|R

The inlet manifold of a reverse-flow cylinder head may {{be connected to}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> a heat riser to transfer further heat, improving low rpm response and emissions as a result.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{diamonds}} {{were found}} only in alluvial deposits in Guntur and Krishna district of the Krishna River delta in Southern India. India led the world in diamond production {{from the time of}} their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725. Currently, {{one of the most prominent}} Indian mines is located at Panna.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Fisher, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the {{constant}} pressure, returned to Moscow {{for six months}} of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|In August 1878, Walker {{represented}} the United States {{at the third}} International Monetary Conference in Paris while also attending the 1878 Exposition. Not only were the attempts by the United States to re-establish an international silver standard defeated, but Walker also had to scramble to complete the report on the Exposition in only four days. Although {{he returned to the}} U.S. in October disheartened by the failure of the conference and <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> his obligations at the Exposition, the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation.|$|E
50|$|This {{area code}} is {{expected}} to <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> 2018 and a second area code will be needed as the state's population grows closer to two million; 11 other states with single area codes all have populations of about a million each.

50|$|Despite the 830 split, 210 {{has become}} part of the San Antonio area's {{identity}} and culture. However, amid projections that 210 would <b>exhaust</b> <b>by</b> mid-2018, it was decided to overlay 210 with a second area code, which would require the implementation of ten-digit dialing in San Antonio. Planning for that new area code began in June 2015. The new overlay code will be 726.|$|R
5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. <b>Exhausted</b> <b>by</b> their journey, they unroll their {{blankets}} and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.|$|E
5|$|Reshef {{decided to}} change tactics. He {{personally}} commanded the 40th Armored Battalions, after reinforcing it with tanks salvaged and repaired from the previous night's fighting, and maneuvered to attack from the west – {{from the direction of}} the canal – hitting Egyptian positions in the flank, while a tank company and an infantry company attacked from south to north. Reshef's forces engaged the Egyptians from long range, picking off defensive positions from afar, while using alternate fire and movement to advance to the crossroads. The defending infantry battalion, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> continuous fighting and suffering from a severe lack of ammunition, soon withdrew allowing the Israelis to at last seize the junction.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel kept up {{resistance}} against the Spanish {{for a number}} of years, but on 9 May 1530, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecpán, the rest to Sololá and other towns around Lake Atitlán.|$|E

In 1967, the California EPA set the nation's first air quality standards for total suspended particulates, photochemical oxidants, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and other pollutants. The United States Congress has allowed California to set its own pollution standards, and the state's legislators have responded with some of the strongest environmental laws ever passed.|$|R
5|$|The Spanish {{founded a}} new town at nearby Tecpán Guatemala, {{abandoned}} it in 1527 because of continuous Kaqchikel attacks, {{and moved to}} the Almolonga Valley to the east, refounding their capital at Ciudad Vieja.

The series has also achieved success outside the UK. In the United States, the first series' transmission on PBS in the autumn of 2012 drew an average audience of threemillion viewers. This figure was 50% higher than the network's primetime average for the 201112 season.|$|E
5|$|War with Sweden, {{now under}} Gustavus Adolphus, resumed in 1621 with his attack on Riga, {{followed}} by the Swedish occupation of much of Livonia, control of Baltic Sea coast up to Puck and the blockade of Danzig. The Commonwealth, <b>exhausted</b> <b>by</b> the warfare {{that had taken place}} elsewhere, in 1626–1627 mustered a response, utilizing the military talents of Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski and help from Austria. Under pressure from several European powers, the campaign was stopped and ended in the Truce of Altmark, leaving in Swedish hands much of what Gustavus Adolphus had conquered.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} acutely toxic indoor air {{contaminants}} is carbon monoxide (CO), a colourless, odourless gas that is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.
