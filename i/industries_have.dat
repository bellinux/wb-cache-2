30|$|From Table  1, we {{can observe}} that export {{promotion}} effect is positive, and export substitution effect and inverse import effect are negative, so the total effect of Japan’s outward FDI is negative. In export promotion effect A, transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> {{the most positive}} impact on domestic production. In export promotion effect B, iron and steel <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> the most positive impact and transportation equipment industry ranked second. In export substitution effect, transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> the most negative effect. In inverse import effect, information and communication electronics equipment industry and transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>have</b> very huge impact. In both total effect case A and case B, transportation equipment <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> the most impact and it is negative, which {{is the main reason}} that caused total effect of Japan’s outward FDI to be negative. Also, among three effects, export substitution effect is even greater other twos which determined total effect.|$|R

5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although other <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of ethanol in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{farming and}} its {{associated}} industries, including making cider, cheese and yoghurt, and peat extraction, the county has little industry.

5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> {{disappeared}} {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E
5|$|Since the deindustrialisation of {{the region}} in the mid-20th century, these <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> been {{replaced}} by newer sectors and industries, although many of the civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library.

5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 gross value added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain).|$|E
5|$|Design plays a {{vital role}} in product and brand development, and is of great {{economic}} importance for organisations and companies. Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers. Design generates 50% of world export revenue in the creative industries' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the state}} {{legislature}} began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} the Swedish computer and video game industry. The main focus is on the Swedish game development industry. Little research on the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> been done and the purpose is to define the companies involved and to create an initial overview of {{the development of the}} industry. This overview will later be used as a platform for the doctorial thesis. Games are a growing culture form and today {{a lot of people are}} playing different types of computer and video games. Internationally the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> expanded and some of the successful games have generated spectacular revenues. In Sweden the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> received attention from different actors like universities, government bodies and media. There are today educations that are focused on game development and there are programs which allocates grants towards game companies. The rapid development in the computers technology has had a great impact on the game industry, which is dependent on hardware development to create games. The first computer games were made for some of the very first computers in the 1940 ´s and 1950 ´s. In the 1970 ´s a market for games was created when arcade machines and somewhat later home consoles were introduced. The <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> grown and includes today some of the largest companies in the world. The Swedish industry follows the international pattern but developed a bit later and the first Swedish game companies were founded in the late 1980 ´s. The <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> expanded, especially between 1998 and 2002. In 2005 the number of people employed in the <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> increased to over 600. During the period under study the <b>industry</b> seems to <b>have</b> had a constant problem with making a profit. Especially in 2002 and 2003 the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> had economic problems and some of the lager companies were bankrupt...|$|R

5|$|Bridgwater was {{developed}} during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> contributed {{strongly to}} New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
5|$|Occupations in Tirunelveli include service-sector {{activities}} such as administration, agricultural trading, tourism, banking, agro-machinery, information technology and educational services. In 1991, the Tirunelveli region ranked second {{in the number of}} women workers. Service sectors such as tourism have developed, due to a growth in religious tourism. Tirunelveli has beedi and cement factories, tobacco companies, workshops for steel-based products and mills for cotton textiles, spinning and weaving; there are also small-scale industries, such as tanneries and brick kilns. The agricultural areas, hand-woven clothes and household industries contribute to the economic growth of the city. Food-processing <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> developed since the late 1990s; at the district level, it is the foremost industrial segment. Industries involving rice-making, blue-jelly metal manufacturing and jem power generating are located {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The major agricultural produce in the region is paddy and cotton. Beedi production during the 1990s earned an annual revenue of 190billion and a foreign exchange of 8billion across the three districts of Tirunelveli, Tiruchirapalli and Vellore.|$|E
