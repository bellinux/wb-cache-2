50|$|The Social Security Administration {{has stated}} that it {{believes}} unauthorized work by non-citizens is {{a major cause of}} wage items being posted as erroneous wage reports instead of on an <b>individual's</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>record.</b> When Social Security numbers are already in use; names do not match the numbers or the numbers are fake, or the person of record is too old, young, dead etc., the earnings reported to the Social Security Agency are put in an Earnings Suspense file ESF. The Social Security spends about $100 million a year and corrects all but about 2% of these. From tax years 1937 through 2003 the ESF had accumulated about 255 million mismatched wage reports, representing $520 billion in wages and about $75 billion in employment taxes paid into the over $1.5 trillion in the Social Security Trust funds. As of October 2005, approximately 8.8 million wage reports, representing $57.8 billion in wages remained unresolved in the suspense file for tax year 2003.|$|R

New statistical techniques were applied to data about a sample of Utah JTPA participants and data about Employment Security registrants linked with their <b>individual</b> Unemployment Insurance <b>earnings</b> <b>records</b> programs in order to derive bias-free "quasi-net impact " estimates. The analysis revealed that JTPA ccmpleters who were either placed in unsubsidized jobs or retained by their employer {{in the case of}} on-the-job training were significantly (10 percent) more likely to be employed 2 years after their original enrollment. The earnings of program completers placed into unsubsidized employment were also significantly higher (by nearly $ 1, 000 for women and by more than $ 1, 300 for men) than those of nen-JTPA participants.

Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Information on attitudes towards the NHS includes: how respondent finds conditions in general terms (3 point scale), if dissatisfied, whether more dissatisfied with pay (6 categories) or with conditions of practice other than pay. Type of remuneration system favoured (i. e. by scale of fees, salaried service, by capitation fee), and attitudes towards the limitation of <b>individual</b> <b>earnings</b> are <b>recorded</b> together with views on what an NHS patient should pay for treatment (7 statements), and whether priority classes should be exempt from any possible charges. Information is also given on attitudes towards the pattern of earnings of dental practitioners (i. e. high earnings early on, declining steeply after middle age). The degree of satisfaction with controls in the General Dental Service is given (e. g. RDO examinations, Dental Estimates Boards, Executive Councils) normally considered on a 3 or 4 point scale). Respondents are asked if, in present circumstances, they find it practicable to offer a fully comprehensive service to patients, and if not, why. They are also asked whether they would resign from the NHS if called upon to do so (4 point scale of willingness). Finally, information is given on what reforms, apart from a straight pay increase, respondents {{would like to see}} introduced. Background Variables Age, sex, type of practice (i. e. whether in NHS, if so, practice category is given: partnership etc.), and area of practice...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} intergenerational {{mobility of}} earnings and income among {{sons and daughters}} in Vietnam. In particular, my objective is to estimate intergenerational elasticity (IGE) of sons’ and daughters’ <b>individual</b> <b>earnings,</b> <b>individual</b> income, and family income with respective to father’s <b>individual</b> <b>earnings.</b> The two-sample two-stage least squares (TS 2 SLS) estimation is employed to achieve the research objective using two primary samples of father-son pairs and father-daughter pairs from Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys (VHLSS) of 2012 and one secondary sample from Vietnam Living Standard Surveys (VLSS) of 1997 - 98. My {{results show that the}} baseline IGE estimates of Vietnamese sons are 0. 361, 0. 394 and 0. 567 for <b>individual</b> <b>earnings,</b> <b>individual</b> income, and family income, respectively. For Vietnamese daughters, the baseline IGE estimates are 0. 284, 0. 333 and 0. 522 for <b>individual</b> <b>earnings,</b> <b>individual</b> income, and family income, respectively.

30|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{previous}} literature, several of our proxies for non-cognitive skills have explanatory power on <b>individual</b> <b>earnings</b> beyond the one captured by PIAAC test scores. Some evidence arises from questionnaire non-response.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the direct and indirect effects of personality characteristics on <b>individual</b> <b>earnings</b> and to examine a person’s leadership role occupancy as the potential mediator in the personality– earnings relationship. Design/Methodology/Approach Longitudinal survey data were collected from a sample of 209 individuals. Earnings were measured 6 years after the personality variables. Findings Two personality traits, i. e., Social Potency and Achievement, predict <b>individual</b> <b>earnings</b> longitudinally. The effects of personality were partially mediated by the person’s occupancy of leadership roles in the workplace. For those occupying similar leadership positions, people higher in social potency still have greater earnings. Implications These findings lend support for personality assessment in personnel selection and have important implications for leadership development and individual career success.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} {{providing}} additional feedback about <b>individual</b> contributions and <b>earnings</b> on the dynamics of contributions in a repeated public good game. We include treatments where subjects can freely choose whether to obtain additional information about individual contributions or <b>individual</b> <b>earnings.</b> We find that, in the aggregate, contributions decline less fast when additional information about contributions and earnings is provided on top of aggregate information. We also find that there exist substantial but intuitively appealing differences in the way individuals react to feedback. Particularly, individuals with a high propensity to contribute tend to imitate the highest contributor more often and are more inclined to obtain feedback about individual contributions than about <b>individual</b> <b>earnings</b> than <b>individuals</b> with a lower propensity to contribute. ...|$|R
