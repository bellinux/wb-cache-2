25|$|An {{efficiently}} insulated tank can retain {{stored heat}} for days, reducing fuel costs. Hot water tanks {{may have a}} built-in gas or oil burner system, <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heaters. Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a central heating system, or heated water from another energy source. The most typical, in the domestic context, is a fossil-fuel burner, <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> elements, or a district heating scheme.|$|E
50|$|In British {{electric}} locomotives the steam generator was usually an electric steam boiler, heated {{by a large}} <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heater running at the (then) line voltages of 600 volts from a third rail or 1,500 volts from an overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|Where hot-water {{space heating}} boilers are installed, {{domestic}} hot water cylinders are usually heated indirectly by primary water from the boiler, or by an <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heater (often as backup to the boiler). In the UK these vessels are called indirect cylinders, or direct cylinders, respectively. Additionally, if these cylinders form part of a sealed system, providing mains-pressure hot water, they are known as unvented cylinders. In the US, when connected to a boiler they are called indirect-fired water heaters.|$|E
40|$|Implementing {{the smart}} grid {{requires}} coordinating competing objectives and constraints from multiple engineering domains. This paper explores the challenges involved in scheduling flexible demand according to objectives in two: the power system and household heat domains. The context is the Northern Isles New Energy Solutions {{project on the}} Shetland Islands, UK, where Active Network Management {{is being used to}} schedule flexible <b>electric</b> storage and <b>immersion</b> heaters. The study highlights that simplifications and assumptions in both domains must be coordinated to understand the overall effectiveness of a scheme. In the case study, customer facing objectives such as home comfort levels are prioritised over the power system objective of reducing fossil fuel generation. Power system operation aggregates houses into a small number of groups to allow practical scheduling. Modelling results show that this prioritisation and aggregation achieves a reduction in fossil fuel generation of 0. 71 GWh; 65 % of that achieved if customer facing objectives are not prioritised...|$|R
2500|$|In September 1977, General Albano Harguindeguy, {{minister}} of the interior, admitted that in May of that year 5,618 disappeared {{in the form of}} PEN detenidos-desaparecidos were being held in detention camps throughout Argentina. The Montoneros tried to disrupt the World Cup Soccer Tournament being hosted in Argentina in 1978 by launching a number of bomb attacks. In a declassified memorandum from the US State Department dated May 1978, it is asserted that [...] "...if there has been a net reduction in reports of torture, this is not because torture has been forsworn but 'derives from fewer operations' because the number of terrorists and subversives has diminished", and presents that case that disappearances [...] "include not only suspected terrorists but also encompass a broader range of people, for example, labor leaders, workers, clergymen, human rights advocates, scientists, doctors, and political party leaders." [...] The report describes the torture methods used to intimidate and extract information, including <b>electric</b> shocks, prolonged <b>immersion</b> in water, cigarette burns, sexual abuse, rape, the removal of teeth and fingernails, burning with boiling water, oil and acid, and castration.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is today {{more important than}} ever, mainly due to the high energy prices and the approaching climate changes. Heating of buildings is an essential area within energy efficiency. Many buildings are old and were built {{at a time when}} the energy prices were low and the term “energy efficiency” was unheard of. By applying today’s broad range of energy saving actions on these old, and thereby often, heating ineffective buildings, this area has a large potential in reducing energy consumption and costs. Churches and chapels are generally old buildings with, in many cases, ineffective heating systems and therefore consume much more energy than needed. Significant part of the means of the parish goes to the heating of such a church/chapel, resources that could be used for other purposes instead. Another aspect is that if the heating is not performed properly, it could lead to major damages to the building and its fixtures. The churches of Laholm and Skummeslöv and the chapels of Skogaby and St. Gertrud are all buildings with heating systems that should be looked into. The buildings belong to Laholm Church Communion and they are a part of Gothenburg Diocese. These churches and the chapels are observed to consume a unnecessary large amount of energy at heating, primary because of that the majority of the heating systems are built up by different types of direct electricity, oil filled <b>electric</b> radiators and <b>immersion</b> heaters acting on a waterborne heating system...|$|R
5000|$|Home spas are a {{worldwide}} retail item {{in western countries}} since the 1980s, and are sold in dedicated spa stores, pool shops, department stores, the Internet, and catalog sales books. They are almost always made from heat-extruded acrylic sheet Perspex, often colored in marble look-alike patterns. They rarely exceed 6 m2 and are typically 1 m deep, restricted by {{the availability of the}} raw sheet sizes (typically manufactured in Japan). There is often a mid-depth seating or lounging system, and contoured lounger style reclining seats are common. Upmarket spas include various jet nozzles (massage, pulsating, etc.), a drinks tray, lights, LCD flat-screen TV sets and other features that make the pool a recreation center. Due to their family-oriented nature, home spas are normally operated from 36 to 39 C. Many pools are incorporated in a redwood or simulated wood surround, and are termed [...] "portable" [...] as they may be placed on a patio rather than sunken into a permanent location. Some portable spas are shallow and narrow enough to fit sideways through a standard door and be used inside a room. Low power <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heaters are common with home spas.|$|E
40|$|In hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, sport centres, {{block of}} flats and apartments {{buildings}} the annual energy demand for heating of domestic hot water (DHW) typically range from 25 to 60 % of the total annual heating demand of the building. Due to the considerable DHW heat load, a centralized DHW system that covers the entire demand {{can be a very}} profitable installation. Possible heating systems include <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heaters, solar collectors in combination with <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heaters for supplementary heating, gas-fired boilers, pellet-fired boilers and heat pump water heaters (HPWH) utilizing e. g. ambient air, exhaust ventilation air, groundwater, boreholes in crystalline rock or grey water as heat source. This papers shows that HPWH systems using carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) as working fluid will typically achieve 20 % higher COP than the most energy-efficient HPWH systems on the market using HFC or propane as working fluid. In terms of energy efficiency and utilization of renewable heat it even outperforms state-of-the-art solar heating systems. Air-to-water and water-to-water CO 2 HPWHs in the capacity range from about 5 to 60 kW have now become commercially available in Japan and Europe from a number of Japanese manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of engine cooling {{systems can be}} improved by replacing the traditional mechanical driven radiator fan and water pump assemblies with computer controlled components. The power requirements for electric servo-motors increase with larger cooling demands which necessitate larger motors and/or a distributed configuration. One solution may be the use of hydraulic-based components due to their high power density and compact size. This paper investigates a thermal management system that features a computer controlled hydraulic actuated automotive fan and water pump. A mathematical model was derived for the hydraulic and thermal system components. To experimentally study the concept, a hydraulic driven fan and coolant pump were integrated with <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heaters and radiator to emulate a vehicl...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the thermal performance of a solar water heating system with heat pipe evacuated tube collector using data obtained from a field trial installation over a year in Dublin, Ireland. An automated sub‐system was developed and incorporated to control the hot water draw‐offs and <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> heater to mimic the operation of solar water heating systems in domestic dwellings. The maximum recorded collector outlet fluid temperature was 70. 3 oC while the water temperature {{at the bottom of the}} hot water tank was 59. 5 oC. The annual average daily energy collected was 20. 4 MJd‐ 1, energy delivered by the solar coil was 16. 8 MJd‐ 1, supply pipe loss was 3. 6 MJd‐ 1, solar fraction was 33. 8 %, collector efficiency was 63. 2 % and system efficiency was 52. 0 %. Reducing the supply pipe losses which represented 17. 7 % of energy collected and 21. 5 % of energy delivered to the hot water tank, and developing a better pump control strategy for heavily overcast and intermittent cloud covered days could result in system improvement...|$|E
