2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, <b>gelatins,</b> beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>gelatin</b> concentration, pH and {{addition}} of milk proteins {{on the physical}} and microstructural properties of type B <b>gelatin</b> gels were studied by small deformation rheology, texture analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Whey protein isolate (WPI), milk protein concentrate (MPC) and skim milk powder (SMP) were used as sources of milk proteins. The elasticity of <b>gelatin</b> gels was significantly affected by the concentration of <b>gelatin.</b> Higher <b>gelatin</b> concentrations led to a stronger gel, and higher gelling and melting temperatures. However, all the <b>gelatin</b> gels at concentrations from 1. 0 to 5. 0 % melted below human body temperature. Rheological properties of <b>gelatin</b> gels were independent of pH in the range pH 4. 6 - 8. 0. At pH 3. 0 gelation of <b>gelatin</b> was significantly inhibited. Addition of SMP and MPC significantly enhanced the rheological properties of <b>gelatin</b> gels, while addition of WPI had {{a negative effect on}} them. However, the effect of addition of milk proteins was dependent on the <b>gelatin</b> concentration. Textural results showed that addition of all milk powders increased the hardness of <b>gelatin</b> gels at high <b>gelatin</b> concentration (5. 0 %). The fracturability of the gels was greatly influenced by pH. Addition of milk proteins and high <b>gelatin</b> concentration (5. 0 %) both caused loss of gel fracturability.
