As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> that Okonkwo lacked so severely.

40|$|Balanced edge {{partition}} {{has emerged}} as a new approach to partition an input graph data <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of scaling out parallel computations, which is of interest for several modern data analytics computation platforms, including platforms for iterative computations, machine learning problems, and graph databases. This new approach stands in a stark contrast to the traditional approach of balanced vertex partition, where for given number of partitions, the problem is to minimize the number of edges cut subject to <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> vertex cardinality of partitions. In this paper, we first characterize the expected costs of vertex and edge partitions with and without aggregation of messages, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> commonly deployed policy of placing a vertex or an edge uniformly at random to one of the partitions. We then obtain the first approximation algorithms <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> edge-partition problem which <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case of no aggregation matches the best known approximation ratio <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> vertex-partition problem, and show that this remains to hold <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case with aggregation up to factor that is equal to the maximum in-degree of a vertex. We report results of an extensive empirical evaluation on a set of real-world graphs, which quantifies the benefits of edge- vs. vertex-partition, and demonstrates efficiency of natural greedy online assignments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> edge-partition problem with and with no aggregation...|$|R
