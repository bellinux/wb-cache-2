40|$|Introduction: As {{with all}} social upheavals – {{large and small}} – {{cyberbullying}} and cyber misbehaviors confound and confuse us. That the modern child demonstrates such effortless and marked ease with electronic devices stymies adults even further. Despite their evident comfort with electronic devices, children today are not in fact particularly knowledgeable about the prudent and effective use of electronic communications, and thus all parties involved in cyberbullying may find themselves at a loss as to an effective response. The responses of school administrators and parts must differ. While the first concern of educators {{is to ensure that}} all children in the school are able to learn, parents must consider issues such as their child’s development, health, social skills, and family life. Our research and fieldwork around the issue of cyberbullying have enabled us to offer the following guides in responding effectively.

Second, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> eighteen or older and still dependent on you, give them some {{advice on how to}} get started on their own. Next, you might think about having your aging parents move into your home. It would save time and money while lessening the pressure of caring for someone in a different house. Not surprisingly, three generations living together is increasingly becoming a more popular trend. Additionally, claim tax benefits for caring for the elderly. You are also able to claim medical care reduction and deduct the medical bills on your tax returns. Finally, make sure that everyone is on the same page.

Cases requiring treatment so decisive as this must be very rare with children under ten years of age; and when they occur, the mother has reason to feel great self-condemnation--or at least great self-abasement--at finding that she has failed so entirely in the first great moral duty of the mother, which is to train her children to complete submission to her authority from the beginning.|$|R

40|$|Have {{you ever}} noticed that some {{children}} just don’t fit in? They {{want to have}} good relationships with their peers, but somehow or another, they always end up feeling rejected. And the worst part is, they don’t know why. They think they are being friendly, so the rejection comes as an unpleasant surprise. Social rejection is extremely painful during any stage of life, {{but it may be}} especially so for elementary school aged children. In fact, studies show poor peer relationships may be related to a variety of difficulties including depression and/or the development of risky behaviors such as drug and alcohol use. Several researchers have found that a common reason some children fail to develop good relationships with their peers is that they lack good communication skills. And, particularly problematic is a lack of nonverbal communication skills. In other words, children who are rejected—who don’t fit in— tend to make lots of nonverbal mistakes. They stand too close, stay too long, interrupt others, hug people who don’t want to be hugged, dress inappropriately for the occasion, and similar types of things. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> one of the unlucky crowd who has difficulty fitting in with his or her peers, how can you tell if your child would benefit from help in developing his or her nonverbal communication skills?

It’s important to understand that nonverbal communication is the language of relationships. It is in the way that we treat others, much more than in what we say to others, that lets them know whether they are liked or disliked, respected or disrespected, wanted or dismissed. And, there are different types of nonverbal messages and a grammar for understanding them that allows us to use and interpret nonverbal signals appropriately. First, there are several channels or types of nonverbal communication.

40|$|Information {{about drugs}} and alcohol - what parents need to know: {{information}} for parents, carers and anyone who works with young people. About this leaflet This is {{one in a series}} of leaflets for parents, teachers and young people entitled Mental Health and Growing Up. These leaflets aim to provide practical, up-to-date information about mental health problems (emotional, behavioural and psychiatric disorders) that can affect children and young people. This leaflet offers practical advice for parents, teachers and carers who are worried that a young person is misusing drugs or alcohol. Why do I need to know about a young person using drugs or alcohol? Many young people smoke, drink alcohol and may try drugs. It is important you are aware of this and do not ignore it as a time when they are just having fun or experimenting. It doesn’t take much for the young people to soon lose control and to need help to recover from this problem. How common is it? By the age of 16, up to half of young people have tried an illegal drug. Young people are trying drugs earlier and more are drinking alcohol. What are the different types of drugs which cause problems? The most commonly used, readily available and strongly addictive drugs are tobacco and alcohol. There are numerous others that can be addictive. Alcohol and cannabis are sometimes seen as ‘gateway’ drugs that lead to the world of other drugs like cocaine and heroin. Drugs are also classed as ‘legal’ and‘illegal’. The obviously illegal drugs include cannabis (hash), speed (amphetamines), ecstasy (E), cocaine and heroin. Using ‘legal’ drugs (like cigarettes, alcohol, petrol, glue) does not mean they are safe or allowed to be misused. It just means they may be bought or sold for specific purposes and are limited to use by specific age groups. There are clear laws regarding alcohol and young people. For more detailed information on various drugs, their side-effects and the law, see ‘Further Information’ {{at the end of the}} factsheet. Why do young people use drugs or alcohol? Young people may try or use drugs or alcohol for various reasons. They may do it for fun, because they are curious, or to be like their friends. Some are experimenting with the feeling of intoxication. Sometimes they use it to cope with difficult situations or feelings of worry and low mood. A young person is more likely to try or use drugs or alcohol if they hang out or stay with friends or family who use them. What can be the problems related to using drugs or alcohol? Drugs and alcohol can have different effects on different people. In young people especially the effects can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Even medications for sleep or painkillers can be addictive and harmful if not used the way they are prescribed by a doctor. Drugs and alcohol can damage health. Sharing needles or equipment can cause serious infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. Accidents, arguments and fights are more likely after drinking and drug use. Young people are more likely to engage in unprotected sex when using drugs. Using drugs can lead to serious mental illnesses, such as psychosis and depression. When does it become addiction or problem? It is very difficult to know when exactly using drugs or alcohol is more than just ‘casual’. Addiction becomes more obvious when the young person spends most of their time thinking about, looking for or using drugs. Drugs or alcohol then become the focus of the young person’s life. They ignore their usual work, such as not doing their schoolwork, or stop doing their usual hobbies/sports such as dancing or football. How do I know if there is a problem or addiction? Occasional use can be very difficult to detect. If the young person is using on a regular basis, their behaviour often changes. Look for signs such as: 	unexplained moodiness 	behaviour that is ‘out of character' 	loss of interest in school or friends 	unexplained loss of clothes or money 	unusual smells and items like silver foil, needle covers. Remember, the above changes can also mean other problems, such as depression, rather than using drugs. What do I do if I am worried? If you suspect young person is using drugs, remember some general rules. 	Pay attention to what the child is doing, including schoolwork, friends and leisure time. 	Learn about the effects of alcohol and drugs (see websites listed below). 	Listen to what the child says about alcohol and drugs, and talk about it with them. 	Encourage the young person to be informed and responsible about {{drugs and alcohol}}. 	Talk to other parents, friends or teachers about drugs - the facts and your fears and seek help. If someone in the family or close friend is using drugs or alcohol, it is important that they seek help too. It may be hard to expect the young person to give up, especially if a parent or carer is using it too. My child is abusing drugs. What do I do? 	<b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> using drugs or alcohol, seek help. 	Do stay calm and make sure of facts. 	Don't give up on them, get into long debates or arguments when they are drunk, stoned or high. 	Don’t be angry or blame them–they need your help and trust to make journey of recovery. Where can I get help? You can talk in confidence to a professional like your GP or practice nurse, a local drug project or your local child and adolescent mental health. They can refer your child to relevant services and they will be able to offer you advice and support. You may also be able to seek help through a school nurse, teacher or social worker. You can find this information from your local area telephone book or council website, or ask for the address from your health centre. [For the full factsheet, click on the link above...|$|E
40|$|Normal {{growth and}} {{development}} is a concern for every parent! <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> teeth <b>are</b> not straight, facial {{growth and development}} could also be affected. Current orthodontic treatment can damage teeth, restrict jaw growth and usually is not a stable result. Most importantly, braces and extractions do not address the real causes of crooked teeth and quite often once they are removed, the teeth crowd up again. Studies have shown that teeth will {{have a tendency to}} change their positions after treatment hence the potential need for lifetime retainers with traditional orthodontics. Our orthodontic treatment uses myofunctional techniques to address the poor oral habits (known as myofunctional habits) that are the real, underlying causes of crooked teeth and uses light, intermittent forces to align the teeth. Myofunctional orthodontic techniques have been practiced by Orthodontists and Dentists around the world for over 25 years. This is done {{through the use of a}} series of removable dental appliances that are worn for just 1 - 2 hours each day and overnight while sleeping. In traditional adult orthodontic treatment, certain factors can contribute to less stable results and likely long term or permanent retainers being required if poor oral habits have not been corrected. Orofacial Myofunctional therapy is a profound process used to address the improper function of the tongue and facial muscles used at rest. Treatment may help address the symptoms of a a wide variety of health issues, ranging from opening airways, to treating headaches, Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMD), and poor digestion just to name a few.

[...] We read no such words; God made no conditions with Noah and his sons. Whether they forgot the covenant or not, God would remember it. It was a covenant of free grace, even as all God's covenants are. Not a bargain, but a promise. [...] "By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that I will not fail David." [...] By Himself He sware to Abraham: [...] "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee." [...] That is the form of God's covenants. God swears by Himself--by God who cannot change. If God can change, then His covenant can change. If God can fail Himself, then can He fail His covenant to which He has sworn by Himself. If {{it had been a}} mere bargain, like men's bargains, and not a promise out of His absolute love, His free grace, His boundless mercy, would He have sworn by Himself? Nay, rather, He would have sworn by Abraham: [...] "By thy obedience or disobedience I swear to bless thee or curse thee." [...] But He swore by Himself, the absolute, the unchangeable, the Giver whose name is Love.|$|R
40|$|Wheat allergy {{occurs when}} the body’s immune system reacts {{to one or more}} of the {{proteins}} found in wheat. It occurs in children as well as adults but is usually outgrown in infancy (Keet et al 2009). <b>If</b> you or <b>your</b> <b>child</b> <b>are</b> experiencing allergic symptoms and suspect wheat is triggering them, it is important to visit your GP, who can organise a referral to an allergy specialist. This factsheet aims to answer some of the questions which you and your family might have about living with wheat allergy. Our aim is to provide information that will help you to avoid products containing wheat, minimise risks and know how to treat an allergic reaction should it occur. Throughout the text you will see brief medical references given in brackets. More complete references are published towards the end of this fact sheet. What is wheat allergy? Food allergy {{occurs when the}} body’s immune system reacts to a harmless food component, usually a protein, because it mistakenly registers that substance as a threat. In people with wheat allergy, the immune system has produced substances called immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE) which are specifically activated when they encounter wheat. When wheat is eaten, touched or inhaled, these IgE antibodies against wheat connect with wheat proteins and trigger the release of certain substances in the body, which provoke an allergic response.

40|$|The Public Health Agency {{is urging}} Northern Ireland parents {{to make sure}} {{children}} in 2 ̆ 7 at risk 2 ̆ 7 groups get their flu vaccine early. The message has been issued to parents and carers of children as the PHA 2 ̆ 7 s seasonal flu vaccination programme gets underway for 2011 / 12. It {{is very important that}} children with any condition that puts them more at risk of the complications of flu get the vaccine. These 2 ̆ 7 at risk 2 ̆ 7 conditions include:chronic lung conditions such as asthma;chest infections that have required hospital admission;chronic heart conditions;chronic liver disease;chronic kidney disease;diabetes;lowered immunity due to disease or treatment such as steroids or cancer therapy;chronic neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis or a condition that affects the nervous system, such as cerebral palsy;hereditary and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system or muscles. Children who attend special schools for severe learning or physical disabilities are considered to be particularly at risk, as well as those with other complex health needs. The PHA has written to principals of local special schools, as well as parents of children at these schools, to raise awareness of the importance of getting vaccinated early. Dr Richard Smithson, PHA Flu Vaccination Lead, said: "For many people, flu is a short, unpleasant illness, but it does not usually cause any serious problems. However, for others, it can have very serious complications including, in rare cases, being fatal. "We have been particularly reminded over the last two winters that children with chronic neurological problems and other complex health needs are very vulnerable to these complications. We have seen children become very seriously ill and, tragically, there have even been a few deaths in children who attend special schools. "For this reason, we recommend that all children who attend special schools for severe learning disability, and special schools for physical disability, are offered the flu vaccine early in the autumn, before the flu viruses start circulating. "The vaccine is now available from GP surgeries and the PHA recommends that parents check arrangements with their own GP 2 ̆ 7 s surgery so that their child can get the jab. The earlier you get vaccinated the better, as it takes the body about 10 - 14 days after the jab to develop antibodies. These will then protect you against the same or similar viruses if the body is exposed to them. The vaccine contains three strains of the flu virus, which are considered the most likely to be circulating this winter, including the H 1 N 1 (swine flu) virus. "Your child needs to get the flu jab every year - the protection it gives only lasts for one winter, so even if they got it last year, they still need to get it this year," added Dr Smithson. "Also, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> has <b>been</b> diagnosed with flu or swine flu {{in the past couple of}} years, they will still need the jab this year as there are different types of flu that the jab will protect against. Getting the flu jab is the best way to protect <b>your</b> <b>child</b> against flu and we would strongly recommend that you arrange for them to have it. "Although the vaccine gives good protection, no vaccine gives total protection, so <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> develops flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, aches and pains, and sore throat) you should contact your GP for advice. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> has any of these symptoms, they should be kept at home until they feel better.
