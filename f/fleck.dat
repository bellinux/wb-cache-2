5|$|Several cast changes {{took place}} in Season 2, some of them planned from the beginning. John <b>Fleck,</b> Karyne Steben and her sister Sarah had made their last {{appearance}} in the first season's finale, while Patrick Bauchau's and Diane Salinger's status was reduced to guest-starring. Ralph Waite joined the regular cast. Several new characters were introduced in recurring roles, most notably John Carroll Lynch as the escaped convict Varlyn Stroud and Bree Walker as Sabina the Scorpion Lady.|$|E

5000|$|The base colour of {{the coat}} is white with differing {{coloured}} ticking also called <b>flecks</b> or speckling. The various speckled coat colours when occurring in English Setters {{are referred to}} as belton; valid combinations are white with black (blue belton), white with orange <b>flecks</b> (orange belton), white with orange <b>flecks</b> and lighter nose (lemon belton), white with liver <b>flecks</b> (liver belton), or [...] "tricolour" [...] which is blue or liver belton with tan markings on the face, chest, and legs. The <b>flecking</b> should not form large patches on the body and the <b>flecks</b> should be distributed all over the body. The use of the word [...] "belton" [...] was first coined by Laverack, who developed the breed in the 19th-century, to describe his ideal for <b>flecking</b> and is also the name of a village in the extreme north of England. Puppies' coats may not have all the markings that they have as adults.|$|R

5|$|A {{recommendation}} from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, where a new chemical factory {{had been established}} to make sodium hydroxide. Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, {{who worked as a}} stenographer in nearby Stockton-on-Tees. The two became engaged, but before they could marry, Alexander <b>Fleck</b> had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in Widnes as head of the Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the register office in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and built their own home in Farnworth, where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick.|$|E

40|$|Purpose—To {{evaluate}} visual {{function of}} <b>flecked</b> areas {{in a series}} of patients with Stargardt disease (STGD) and compare them with adjacent non <b>flecked</b> areas. Methods—Twenty–seven patients with STGD, ABCA 4 mutations and yellowish retinal <b>flecks</b> at fundus examination were recruited. Microperimetry with the Nidek MP- 1 and fundus autofluorescence imaging (FAF) were performed in all the patients (27 eyes) while spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed in a subgroup of patients (20 eyes). Visual sensitivity (in dB) for each hyperfluorescent <b>flecked</b> area on FAF was compared with the value of the nearest adjacent non-flecked area in the MP- 1 grid and at approximately the same distance from the fovea. Retinal structure in some of the <b>flecked</b> areas tested by microperimetry was analysed with SD-OCT. All patients were screened for mutations in the ABCA 4 gene by APEX array and direct sequencing. Results—A total of 1836 locations (68 locations for each eye with the 10 - 2 program) were tested with the MP- 1 and 97 corresponded to hyperautofluorescent <b>flecks.</b> A repeated measure, linear regression analysis was used to evaluate differences between visual sensitivity associated with th...|$|R
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the <b>fleck</b> of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Wounded, he {{is taken}} to a Resistance safehouse in Brooklyn. With the Germans {{controlling}} the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, it is revealed that the aliens, known as the Na'kuhl, have sworn allegiance to Nazi Germany. Further, they are providing them with advanced weapons and technology in exchange for material and supplies to build a conduit that will take {{them back to their}} own time period. Meanwhile, Silik (John <b>Fleck),</b> the leader of the Suliban Cabal, had boarded Enterprise and manages to steal a shuttlepod to fly to Earth. Tucker and Mayweather are then sent to find Silik along with the shuttlepod. Archer contacts Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) using a stolen communicator and is transported back to Enterprise. Before dying, Daniels asks Archer to stop the Na'Kuhl from using the conduit and becoming even more dangerous. On Earth, the away team find and destroy the shuttlepod, but are captured and taken in for interrogation.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) programme, the MRC Harwell is {{conducting}} a large eye morphology phenotyping screen on genetically modified mice compared to the baseline phenotype observed in the background strain of C 57 BL/ 6 NTac. The C 57 BL/ 6 NTac strain is known to carry a spontaneous mutation in the Crb 1 gene that causes retinal degeneration characterized {{by the presence of}} white spots (<b>flecks)</b> in the fundus. These <b>flecks</b> potentially represent a confounding factor, masking similar retinal phenotype abnormalities that may be detected in mutants. Therefore we investigated the frequency, position and extent of the <b>flecks</b> in a large population of C 57 BL/ 6 NTac mice to provide the basis for evaluating the presence of <b>flecks</b> in mutant mice with the same genetic background. We found that in our facility males were more severely affected than females and that in both males and females the most common localisation of the <b>flecks</b> was in the inferior hemicycle of the fundus...|$|R
40|$|Nafstad O, Grønstøl H: The {{effect of}} {{eradication}} of lice on {{the occurrence of}} the grain defect light <b>flecks</b> and spots on cattle hides. Acta vet. scand. 2001, 42, 99 - 106. – The influence of an eradication programme for lice on the prevalence of light <b>flecks</b> and spots on cattle hides was studied in 33 dairy cattle herds {{during a period of}} two and a half years. Lice were eradicated from the main group of herds after 9 to 12 months {{and the quality of the}} hides before and after treatment was compared. Hides from slaughtered animals were collected during the study period, tanned and examined with special emphasis on the occurrence of the grain damage light <b>flecks</b> and spots. The prevalence of hides without light <b>flecks</b> and spots increased from 24. 2 % before treatment to 61. 6 % after treatment. The prevalence of hides free from the damage increased significantly in all examined anatomical regions. The improvement in hide quality was most marked in the shoulders and neck region which corresponded to the major predilection site of cattle lice. The prevalence of hides with light <b>flecks</b> and spots started to decrease in the first period (2 - 40 days) after eradication. The changes after treatment suggested that most healing process took place over a period of about 4 months. The eradication programme eliminated the seasonal variation in the prevalence of light <b>flecks</b> and spots which was present before treatment. cattle hide; leather; damage; light <b>flecks</b> and spots; eradication...|$|R

30|$|Fourteen {{out of the}} 31 {{sunflower}} cultivars/ accessions tested against P. spegazzinii (Peruvian pathotype) showed mild chlorotic <b>flecks</b> (PS 1) (Table  3) on a few {{top leaves}} that were directly below the heavy inoculum inside the dew chamber, around 6 – 8  days after inoculation. Out of those 14 plants, four had produced similar cholorotic <b>flecks</b> (Table  3) with the Trinidadian pathotype (Sreerama Kumar et al., 2016). On the other hand, six accessions that reacted against the Peruvian pathotype had not reacted to the Trinidadian pathotype, and three vice versa (Sreerama Kumar et al. 2016). Although EC- 68414, a sunflower accession positive to the Trinidadian pathotype (Sreerama Kumar et al. 2016), was left out this time, four additional accessions were included and all produced chlorotic <b>flecks</b> with the Peruvian pathotype (Table  3). As expected, however, there was no sporulation {{in any of the}} cultivars/accessions. When microscopically examined, no mycelial growth was observed in the leaf tissue of the plants showing chlorotic <b>flecks.</b> The inoculated sunflower plants grew and flowered normally. This specific screening precluded the risk of the alien rust fungus posing any threat to sunflower cultivation in India. Ellison et al. (2008) also observed similar chlorotic <b>flecks</b> on sunflower in the primary host-range screening with the Trinidadian pathotype of P. spegazzinii in the UK. Observations till senescence indicated no mycelial growth in the leaves that exhibited chlorotic <b>flecks.</b>|$|R
