500|$|In the UK, {{where the}} {{phenomenon}} had begun, Ian Johnson, creative manager for dress manufacturer Roman Originals, {{learned of the}} controversy from his Facebook news feed that morning. [...] "I was pretty gobsmacked. I <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> and told the wife that I'd better get to work," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang {{together}} before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E
500|$|The {{exploding}} pustules {{were carefully}} rigged to burst on command. Makeup supervisor Toby Lindala constructed a handheld device that connected via tube to the faux sores. When {{the device was}} pressed, the pustule would burst. Filming the scenes was particularly arduous; he later noted [...] "I was jammed underneath one of the bus seats with these extras basically stepping on my head." [...] The X-Files director Frank Spotnitz remarked, [...] "When we saw the pustule bursting on film, we <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> {{because it was just}} so over-the-top grotesque." [...] The Costa Rican forest at the opening was shot at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in Northern Vancouver, which also served as Puerto Rico in season opener [...] "Little Green Men". The city of Delta served for both the gas station and the bus station—actually a redecorated Dodge/Chrysler car dealership.|$|E

500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E
500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} between John Cena and Bray Wyatt. The Wyatt Family's {{entrance}} was voodoo-themed and performed live by a costumed Mark Crozer and the Rels. Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena {{to be the}} monster that he is and to finish him off; Cena refused. Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena's aggressive retaliation, but Wyatt <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> while taking punishment. Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self, attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron, {{but it was not}} enough to beat Cena. Cena climbed to the top rope, but instead of attacking Wyatt, Cena dove onto Wyatt's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside. Cena teased becoming a 'monster' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the steel ring steps, but he could not do it and threw them away. Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing [...] "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands", so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out. At ringside, Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper's area. Back in the ring, Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission, but Wyatt reached the ropes. Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall. Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena, again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy. Cena instead attacked Rowan (who had gotten on the ring apron) with the chair, so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall. Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win.|$|E

'Unfortunately we {{ran into}} a serious bit of {{corruption}} {{with one of the}} funders and the script was never transformed into film,' Perry told Chappell, 'I recall telling [...] Fred Schepisi about this. He <b>just</b> <b>laughed</b> and said that sort of thing happened to him {{a couple of times a}} year. But it was enough to make me decide to write another dozen books before looking at film again. I ended up writing another 24 books before returning to film, which I am now doing, but still as a secondary interest.' ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'.

I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I <b>just</b> <b>laughed.</b> He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E
