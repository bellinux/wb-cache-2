When these antibodies react with allergens, histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis are released from the mast cells.

Mast cells briefly stimulated with 48 / 80 (a synthetic polycation and well-known histamine-releasing agent) at 22 °C displayed single, narrow-necked pores (some as small as 0. 05 pm in diameter) joining single granules with the plasma membrane.

40|$|In this paper, we {{designed}} new automatic multi-angle observation device {{to improve the}} accuracy of measurement and to reduce the uncertainty from the measuring of directional thermal radiation The uncertainty in multi-angle thermal remote sensing is mainly due to the variance of components {{in the field of}} view of the sensor with the view angle changing and the heat balance change on the ground during the period of measurement. Using the device we presented two new observation methods named as "constant area method by thermal camera" and "concurrent method by dual sensors" respectively. We adopted a portable non-frozen thermal camera that can obtain 50 to 60 thermal images at most in one second. The directional radiometric temperature and the four component of ground objects can be measured by means of the thermal camera installed on the device, which include 4 parts: 1) A half circle roadway with 2 m diameter to change azimuth, 2) An elevator for changing measuring level. 3) A rotating mast installed the thermal camera for changing zenith. 4) A <b>fixed</b> <b>mast</b> installed another thermal radiometer for measuring radiometric temperature change process with time. All parts can be disassembled for transport. A computer system controls speeds of moving and rotating. It can supply a moment of 400 kg-cm to drive a 2 m long mast and the 1. 5 kg thermal camera. It takes about 2 minutes for the device to finish the measurement from 72 degrees zenith angle to minus 72 degrees zenith angle. Generally, we need only 20 to 40 thermal images for one azimuth angle. It turns out to be an ideal multi-angle observation device for directional radiometric temperatures. The experiments show that the data obtained by these methods and device abide some regularly directional distribution, which improved accuracy and is helpful for study rules of them. The analysis of the major factors in the directional thermal radiation is also conducted in the paper...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSimultaneous atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) and confocal {{fluorescence imaging}} were used to observe in aqueous buffer the three-dimensional landscape of the inner surface of membrane sheets stripped from <b>fixed</b> tumor <b>mast</b> cells. The AFM images reveal prominent, irregularly shaped raised domains that label with fluorescent markers for both resting and activated immunoglobin E receptors (FcɛRI), {{as well as with}} cholera toxin-aggregated GM 1 and clathrin. The latter suggests that coated pits bud from these regions. These features are interspersed with flatter regions of membrane and are frequently surrounded and interconnected by cytoskeletal assemblies. The raised domains shrink in height by ∼ 50 % when cholesterol is extracted with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Based on composition, the raised domains seen by AFM correspond to the cholesterol-enriched dark patches observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These patches were previously identified as sites of signaling and endocytosis based on their localization of activated FcɛRI, at least 10 associated signaling molecules, and the presence of clathrin-coated pits. Overall the data suggest that signaling and endocytosis occur in mast cells from raised membrane regions that depend on cholesterol for their integrity and may be organized in specific relationship with the cortical cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|Within {{seconds after}} {{exposure}} of rat peritoneal mast cells to polymyxin B, bulges {{appear on the}} surface of the cells. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that each bulge overlies a mast cell granule. In contrast to the even distribution of intramembranous particles in the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells, the intramembranous particles in the stimulated cells are unevenly distributed in the membrane of the bulges with large patches of membrane lacking intramembranous particles. The membranes over the most prominent bulges are entirely free of intramembranous particles, and in some instances there is an increased concentration of intramembranous particles at the margins of the bulges. Perigranule membranes exhibit the same changes in distribution of intramembranous particles. Electron microscopy of thin sections of rapidly <b>fixed,</b> stimulated <b>mast</b> cells shows a peculiar structure of the membrane overlying some bulges; instead of the pentalaminar membranes previously demonstrated, the membrane at these sites of presumptive fusion of perigranule and plasma membrane assumes the form of a single dense lamina with a fine fuzzy coating on either side. It seems possible that membrane fusion and subsequent pore formation proceed in the stimulated mast cell through a stage of flight of intramembranous particles and molecular rearrangement of the other membrane components...|$|R

Figures were moving all around her, there was noise and confusion of voices, and a general pushing and shouting which seemed strangely weird in this gloom. Here among the poorer passengers, there had not been thought any necessity for a light, one solitary lantern <b>fixed</b> to a <b>mast</b> only enhanced the intense blackness of everything around. Now and then a face would come within range of this meagre streak of yellow light, looking strangely distorted, with great, elongated shadows across the brow and chin, a grotesque, ghostly apparition which quickly vanished again, scurrying off like some frightened gnome, giving place other forms, other figures all equally grotesque and equally weird.|$|R
50|$|Guy derrick (also {{known as}} boom derrick) is a <b>fixed</b> guyed <b>mast</b> derrick {{that can be}} rotated and {{connected}} to a boom. The mast is in upright position with the base that can make the mast rotate, but not to be lean in any direction. The top of the mast is connected to many guy wires which are anchored to the ground to support the load. At the base, the mast is also connect to the bottom end of the boom. The boom extends outward and upward to the desired position. The top of the boom is a pulley system that {{is connected to the}} top of the mast to control how far the boom is to be from the mast. When the mast is rotated, the connected boom is swung from to the side. The control of the lifting location is done by the manipulation of the top pulley system and the rotation of the mast at the base. The load is lifted by another pulley system connected {{to the top of the}} boom. In a medium load lifting, another construction method can be used. In this case, the <b>mast</b> is <b>fixed</b> without being rotated, but the boom can be swung around the mast. This can be done by connecting the bottom of the boom with two boards on the opposite sides around the surface of the boom to form a fork. The fork and the bottom part of the boom is lashed to secure them together. Another lashing is between the fork area and the mast at a higher position to support the weight of the boom. The fork is put around the mast such that the bottom of the boom is rested on the <b>mast</b> without permanently <b>fixed</b> to it. The fork prevent the boom to come off the mast while swinging up to 180 degrees.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{section of}} our review article deals with prevalence, genetic factors, and some immune {{mechanisms}} of chronic urticaria in children. In {{any form of}} chronic urticaria, the main pathogenetic role is ascribed to mast cells and basophiles. Increased production of cyto- and chemokines, e. g., CCL 2, CХCL 8, IL- 1, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 13, IL- 17, is observed during chronic inflammatory reactions typical to this disease. Activation of mast cells and basophiles proceeds via specific receptors on the target cell membranes. Autoimmune urticaria is of special importance. In this disorder, autoantibodies are directed against IgE or FCεRIα, thus causing histamine release, due to cross-linking of α-chains of high-affinity IgE receptor, or binding of IgE <b>fixed</b> on the <b>mast</b> cells. Degranulation of basophils is followed by occurrence of activation molecules (СD 203 с, CD 63). Some workers presumet that association between СD 203 с expression and positive autologous serum skin test {{may be a sign}} of autoimmune process. Increased expression of CD 40 L ligand on the surface of activated T cells suggests enhanced signaling for B cell activation and production of autoantibodies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A six-span center pivot {{irrigation}} system {{was used as}} a platform for testing two wireless sensor networks (WSN) of infrared thermometers. The cropped field was a semi-circle, divided into six pie-slice sections of which three were irrigated manually and three were irrigated automatically based on the time temperature threshold method. One network was mounted on <b>masts</b> <b>fixed</b> to the pivot arm (Pivot-WSN) and was programmed with mesh networking firmware. The second wireless network was comprised of sensors programmed with non-mesh firmware and was deployed in the field (Field-WSN). Our objectives were to: (1) compare the performance of a mesh and non-mesh networking systems of wireless sensors on a center pivot platform; (2) investigate the relationships between crop canopy, sensor body, and air temperatures; and (3) investigate automatic irrigation scheduling using data from wireless sensor networks. The Field-WSN outperformed the Pivot-WSN; data packet retrieval was more than 90 % successful for 93 % of the growing season using the non-mesh networking firmware for the WSN established in the field. The Pivot-WSN performed only 70 % of the time at this same level of success. Temperature differences between the body temperature of the infrared thermometer and crop canopy varied as much as- 5. 1 and 7. 6 ºC.

The N 2 O concentration was measured by a Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectrometer (Aerodyne Research Inc.) : the system was operated at a frequency of 10 Hz, and the air sample was pulled through an inlet line to the sonic anemometer. Several chemical species were measured during the same field campaign: fluxes of size segregated aerosol, particle number and chemically speciated aerosol were measured by using respectively an Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer, a Condensation Particle Counter and an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer; fluxes of selected Volatile Organic Compounds were measured with a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer; CO 2 fluxes by InfraRed Gas Analyser, and CO fluxes by vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectrometry. The fluxes are representative of footprint source areas of several square kilometres (see Nemitz et al., 2002). Relationships are established between the fluxes of N 2 O and the other pollutant species measured at the site: in particular with the anthropogenic markers CO 2 and CO, to investigate the controls of the emission and provide a relative emission factor. ...|$|R

And the human animal being averse from change and timid before the unknown, I said to myself that I really would not mind being examined by the same man on a future occasion. But when the time of ordeal came round again the doorkeeper let me into another room, with the now familiar paraphernalia of models of ships and tackle, a board for signals on the wall, a big, long table covered with official forms and having an unrigged <b>mast</b> <b>fixed</b> to the edge. The solitary tenant was unknown to me by sight, though not by reputation, which was simply execrable. Short and sturdy, as far as I could judge, clad in an old brown morning-suit, he sat leaning on his elbow, his hand shading his eyes, and half averted from the chair I was to occupy {{on the other side of}} the table. He was motionless, mysterious, remote, enigmatical, with something mournful, too, in the pose, like that statue of Giugliano (I think) de Medici shading his face on the tomb by Michael Angelo, though, of course, he was far, far from being beautiful. He began by trying to make me talk nonsense. But I had been warned of that fiendish trait, and contradicted him with great assurance. After a while he left off. So far good. But his immobility, the thick elbow on the table, the abrupt, unhappy voice, the shaded and averted face grew more and more impressive. He kept inscrutably silent for a moment, and then, placing me in a ship of a certain size, at sea, under conditions of weather, season, locality, etc.--all very clear and precise--ordered me to execute a certain manoeuvre. Before I was half through with it he did some material damage to the ship. Directly I had grappled with the difficulty he caused another to present itself, and when that, too, was met he stuck another ship before me, creating a very dangerous situation. I felt slightly outraged by this ingenuity in piling trouble upon a man.|$|R
40|$|The Aerodynamics of sails and sails {{interaction}} problem are of {{high interest}} {{for many decades}} of racing yachts. Soft sails {{have a long history}} for sailing yachts. Rigs have changed over time and regions of the world. The square rig has been used for a long time but was mainly a downwind rig without positive interaction between sails. The Latin rig use triangular sails and has better performances than the square rig in upwind conditions and is more manoeuvrable. The Bermuda or Marconi rig with a mainsail <b>fixed</b> on a <b>mast</b> and a headsail or jib have higher performances in upwind conditions and allows more easy tackle. It is largely used today on racing yachts and is well adapted to a large range of boat size. It is the most known rig configuration for sails interaction. It will be one focus point of this paper. For simplicity, we will not consider the high length boats using multi masts system, as it is a variation on the same theme. Knowing this restriction, it is a complex subject if we think about the slow evolution and the many variations used in a given period of time. This may seems a paradox knowing that racing boats are driven by a unique objective which is speed on sea water in given wind conditions. But as every sailor know, the way to sail fast on water are numerous depending on sea state, wind conditions and boat architecture and is a subject of many contradictory stories. It will be seen how the sail and rig evolution may be related to aerodynamic research and tools evolution over years to help designing advanced sails and rigs for racing sailing yachts. The fact that aeronautic research has frequently played a role of precursor in maritime new findings will be emphasized. 	Interacting sails (mainsail + jib) is a solution, which {{is the result of a}} long evolution over years of practice, and trial and errors on various boats. It has been used for its ability to generate a high driving force without too much heeling force and its consequences leeway and heeling moment. It has been described and explained in a long list of publications. We will go through selected ones to focus on main parameters affecting sail interaction before to go further toward recent evolutions of this classic and largely used rig. 	It will be shown how tools evolution has play a key role in the understanding of the sail interaction problem with Gentry, Marchaj and Milgram publications. 	Later, a well-known evolution has been proposed on Star & Stripes in 1988 with a semi-rigid mainsail. Then, more recently a transition occurs by replacing softs or semi-rigid mainsails by fully rigid ones, as it has been popularized by the famous multi-elements wingsail of the giant BOR 90, and later, by the two last editions of the America’s cup yachts (AC 72, AC 45, AC 48, AC 50). All these evolutions are based on a symmetric rigid mainsail and a classic soft jib or gennaker. The aerodynamic basics and performances of these new configurations will be described from recent publications. Explaining the rational behind this evolution, and anticipate possible future evolution will be proposed. 	Putting this sail design evolution story in perspective, we will show how design tools for sails and rigs have largely contributed to the understanding of sails aerodynamics and to these evolutions from soft to rigid sails. Few figures illustrating these elements are given below and will be completed...|$|R
