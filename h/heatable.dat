50|$|Electrically <b>heatable</b> {{glass and}} windows are {{relatively}} new products, which help solve {{problems in the}} design of buildings and vehicles. The idea of heating glass is based on the use of energy-efficient low-emissive glass, which is generally simple silicate glass with a special metallic oxides coating. Low-emissive coating decreases heat loss by approximately 30%. <b>Heatable</b> glass can be used in all kinds of standard glazing systems, whether wood, plastic, aluminum or steel.|$|E
50|$|Windows play a {{significant}} role in room comfort. As a result, the area of glazing of buildings is constantly being increased. Window technologies always in progress and it is common today to use low-emissive glass. In spite of progress the low temperature of glass surface is still the problem of constructive glazing. <b>Heatable</b> glass helps to solve problems concerning low surface temperature and increase the level of comfort in the room significantly. <b>Heatable</b> glass can be used in practically all kinds of glazing systems made of wood, plastic or aluminum. <b>Heatable</b> glass and multiple glass panes can be used both in blind and openable constructions. Multiple glass panes made of heating glass can have one or two chambers. The advantages of multiple glass panes are their hermiticity and ability to decrease heat transfer significantly.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heatable</b> glass {{based on}} low-emissive {{coatings}} was first produced in high volume {{in the early}} 1980s. Today, heating glass {{is used in the}} construction of many kinds of buildings and in mass production of vehicles, ships and trains. <b>Heatable</b> glass removes discomfort and other disadvantages induced by the low heat-insulating features of silicate glass. The effect of “cold glass” disappears when the surface of the glass is heated. Condensation is eliminated, along with ice and snow covering, the window’s heat losses are compensated and room comfort is improved.|$|E

50|$|The idea of <b>heatable</b> {{glass is}} based on usage of {{energy-efficient}} low-emissive glass, where the coating {{plays the role of}} heating element. It can be used both in production of multiple glass panes and as a part of triplex, which has also the function of protective glazing. The technological process of production of multiple glass panes made of <b>heatable</b> glass is practically the same as the process of ordinary multiple glass panes production. The main difference is the presence of power supply and, if necessary, temperature sensor. The temperature sensor allows to track the temperature of heating glass and eliminates the possibility of overheating of the product. In order to prevent shocks, the conductive coating is always placed inside the multiple glass pane or laminated unit. Only safe tempered glass, the strength of which is a lot higher than the strength of ordinary glass, is used in production of <b>heatable</b> glass. When the hardened glass is destroyed there are safe splittings. Also the current-carrying coating loses its integrity and the automatic fuse, which turns off the power supply of the glass, is activated. The electrodes are placed inside the lamination and no one can reach them without destruction of the product.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heatable</b> glass {{can be used}} as the {{principal}} system of heating and can be combined with floor and ceiling heating. Such combination helps reduce the total rate of heat loss of the building, thereby lowering heating expenses. Also, the active area of the room can be used more efficiently, as massive window-sill radiators are not needed. Initially, heating glass was produced by sputtering ordinary glass, and stable quality could not be guaranteed. A technological breakthrough took place in 1989 when the mass production of low-emissive glass began. The glass was coated during the manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two reasons}} why people feel {{discomfort}} when they are close to a cold window surface. First, a cold window {{is the reason for}} outflow of heat, which is produced by the cutaneous covering of the individual. Second, a cold window provokes the circulation of air, which is felt like a draft. In order to reduce these factors the heating radiators are always placed under window sills. As far as people can feel cold and heat, the actual temperature of environment is not the only factor which defines the total level of comfort. In reality, the heat radiation of surrounding surfaces has a greater influence than air temperature. If the window surface is cold then to maintain the comfort atmosphere it is necessary to increase the heating temperature, but it will also increase energy consumption. The problem of cold window can be solved effectively with the help of <b>heatable</b> glass. These windows allow to maintain the optimal comfort level and temperature of the room. The air temperature can be decreased at least by 1 degree if the temperature of surrounding surfaces has the same significance. You also do not have to install heating radiators and free the additional space for that. Besides, when turned off the multiple glass panes made of <b>heatable</b> glass act like ordinary low-emissive glass.|$|E

Rear windows have evolved similarly, with plastic rear windows appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature <b>heatable</b> glass rear windows to maximize visibility - though rear windows often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small rear window and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{glass is}} mostly used for heating of windows. It is {{especially}} useful for rooms where people {{spend much time}} by the windows, at home or at work. The most common usage of heating glass—windows of cottages, office buildings and also big areas—leaded panes, translucent roofing, garret windows, canopies and so on. Heating glass is used for defogging and prevention of frosting of windows of pools, saunas and other buildings of such kind. Insofar as <b>heatable</b> glass has a current-carrying coating, {{it can be used}} as the sensor of alarm systems. When the glass is destroyed the system of protection is activated and it results in activation of alarm system. This kind of product is widely used on objects of tightened standards in questions of protection: nuclear power plants, stations of air navigation control, museums, special storehouses, etc. <b>Heatable</b> glass is also used in production of windows for different kinds of vehicles: electric and diesel locomotives, vessels and boats, various kinds of aircraft and automobiles. One of well-known examples of application of heating glass is armored windows, because the protective glazing is very thick and is disposed to frosting. The usage of heating glass is especially urgent in terms of being the part of armored multiple glass of Smart Glass of switchable transparency, because the heating significantly decreases the period of reaction of liquid crystals structure. The power consumed by products depends on the type of use. Power of about 50-100 watts per square meter of the window is generally enough for maintenance of comfort temperature in the room and for maintenance of glass surface temperature at the rate from +20 degrees to +30 degrees. When the <b>heatable</b> glass is used as the only source of heat it is necessary to maintain the glass surface temperature at the rate from +30 degrees to -45 degrees and provide the power of 100 to 300 watt for 1 square meter of the window. The power needed for vehicle windows reaches 1.5 kilowatts per square meter or more, which is why there are such tight standards in terms of sputtering of current-carrying components. Heat power of about 500-700 watts per square meter of glazing is necessary for snow unloading and taking ice-covering off the outside protective translucent constructions in low temperatures and windy environments.|$|E

50|$|Drophead coupe, coupé {{cabriolet}} or coupé cabrio:A type of convertible {{with only}} two doors, and thereby recalling the cabriolet carriage. With its Mazda RX-7 convertible, Mazda introduced a two-seater convertible with a removable rigid section over the passengers, removable independently of power-operated textile section behind with <b>heatable</b> glass rear window. During the 1980s, Jaguar produced an XJ-SC with two removable panels over the front seats and a partial fold-down convertible section in the back. It retained the rear side windows of the coupe and had fixed cant rails above these and the door glass. This allowed an almost full convertible with rollover safety.

50|$|Around 1354 Hermann von Landenberg-Greifensee {{lived at}} Alt-Regensberg. He and his successors massively rebuilt the castle, raised {{the walls and}} filled the castle grounds {{in the south and}} east. The decisive changes also {{included}} the construction of the palace and the new stables, maybe by Ulrich and his wife Verena von Altenklingen around 1386. On 2 September 1407 Uolrich von Landenberg von Griffense der Älteste and his son Walther confirmed the conditions to sell the castle, rights and lands to the city of Zürich. The decline in importance of the castle had been shown already in the Old Zürich War, when Zürich's opponent Alt-Regensberg occupied without resistance. Martin von Landenberg-Greifensee died in 1442, whereupon his daughter Martha inherited the castle. After she married Johann Schwend, a citizen of Zürich, the couple sold the castle to the merchant Rudolf Mötteli on 4 February 1458. With great effort, he re-designed especially the interior of the castle. In his report Mötteli wrote to have installed six <b>heatable</b> rooms that he had provided with belt floors and wood paneling, glass windows, stove tiles, a new oven and a deeper cellar. Ten years later, Luzern whose citizen Mötteli became, supported the claims of the city of Zürich on Alt-Regensberg. Therefore, the castle came with {{what was left of the}} former rights and lands to the city of Zürich and became part of the Herrschaft Regensberg, but the castle itself got disintegrate. The ruins henceforth had to serve as a quarry: in 1705 to build the church of Regensdorf and in 1775 for the construction of the bridge of Adlikon. Yet in 1897 a complete demolition of the ruins was planned, but in 1902 and 1909 first backup masonry work were done. Nevertheless, in 1919 the castle area was rebuilt into a water reservoir for the hamlet of Altburg. As a result of the extensive archaeological investigations in 1955/57, the area was excavated and conserved, and since the 1980s, the Canton of Zürich repeatedly executed wall coatings to preserve the most important castle in the Zürich Unterland from further decay. Today, the site of the castle, but not the castle's hill, are the property of the Canton of Zürich.|$|E
