5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint <b>green</b> <b>sheen.</b> The tail is blackish with a dark <b>green</b> <b>sheen,</b> brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
25|$|Javas {{appear in}} three color {{variations}} today: Black, Mottled, and White. The Black has black shanks and beaks, though some yellow may {{appear in the}} legs. The plumage is a uniform black hue that has a dark <b>green</b> <b>sheen</b> in the light. The Mottled and White have mostly yellow skin, with horn colored beaks. The plumage of the Mottled is a black base with white markings on the tips of feathers, which imparts a spotted appearance.|$|E

40|$|The API 20 E {{technique}} for identification of E. coli was evaluated {{and the results}} compared with those obtained by the conventional biochemical tests recommended in Report 71. The results obtained showed very close correlation between the two methods. A total of 196 (81. 6 %) out of 240 isolates were identified as E. coli by API. System, while the conventional method identified only 194 (80. 8 %). Therefore the recommended tests in Report 71, {{which are based on}} very small number of data was found to be acceptable for the identification of E. coli.

500|$|It {{was already}} a rare bird {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, {{confined}} to the Ruahine, Tararua, Rimutaka and Kaimanawa mountain ranges in the south-east of the North Island. It was remarkable for having the most pronounced sexual dimorphism in bill shape of any bird species in the world. The female's beak was long, thin and arched downward, while the male's was short and stout, like that of a crow. Males were [...] long, while females were larger at [...] The sexes were otherwise similar, with orange wattles and predominantly black plumage with a <b>green</b> <b>sheen.</b> The huia was a bird of deep metallic, bluish-black plumage with a greenish iridescence on the upper surface, especially about the head.

500|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a large}} bird, {{measuring}} between [...] in length with a [...] wingspan, and weighing around [...] Standing as tall as , it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red beak. It bears some resemblance to Abdim's stork (C. abdimii), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish <b>green</b> <b>sheen,</b> except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown irises, and bare red skin around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. Moulting takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It walks slowly and steadily {{on the ground and}} like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.|$|E
500|$|The Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the genus}} Corvus native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring [...] in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or <b>green</b> <b>sheen,</b> and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (C. corone). Two subspecies are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.|$|E

500|$|The {{long and}} wide {{pectoral}} fins have pointed tips and nearly straight margins. The first dorsal fin originates roughly over {{the rear of}} the pectoral fin bases; it is fairly tall and falcate (sickle-shaped), with a blunt apex and a long free rear tip. The second dorsal fin is relatively large with a short free rear tip, and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. A high midline ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle has a crescent-shaped notch at the origin of the upper caudal fin margin. The caudal fin has a large lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are closely spaced but non-overlapping, such as that the skin shows between them; each is oval with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. The coloration is gray to bronze above, with a faint pale stripe on the flank, and white below; sometimes there is a <b>green</b> <b>sheen</b> along the gills. The tips of the fins (except for the pelvic fins) are darker; this is most obvious in young sharks. Males and females grow to at least [...] and [...] long respectively; this species possibly reaches [...] in length. The maximum weight on record is [...]|$|E
500|$|As in {{most species}} of the genus, the bodies of female Portia labiatas are 7 to 10millimetres long and their carapaces are 2.8 to 3.8millimetres long. Males' bodies are 5 to 7.5millimetres long, [...] with carapaces 2.4 to 3.3millimetres long. The carapaces of females are orange-brown, {{slightly}} lighter around the eyes, where there are sooty streaks and sometimes a violet to <b>green</b> <b>sheen</b> in certain lights. There is a broad white moustache {{along the bottom of}} the carapace, and running back from each main eye is a ridge that looks like a horn. Females' chelicerae are dark orange-brown and decorated with sparse white hairs, which form bands near the carapaces. The abdomens of females are mottled brown and black, and bear hairs of gold, white and black, and there are tufts consisting of brown hairs tipped with white. The carapaces of males are orange-brown, slightly lighter around the eyes, and have brown-black hairs lying on the surface but with a white wedge-shape stripe from the highest point down to the back, and white bands just above the legs. Males' chelicerae are also orange-brown with brown-black markings. The abdomens of males are brown with lighter markings and with brown-black hairs lying on the surface, and a short band of white hairs. The legs of both sexes are dark brown, with light markings in the femora (the sections of the legs nearest the body). All {{species of the}} genus Portia have elastic abdomens, so that those of both sexes can become almost spherical when well fed, and females' can stretch as much when producing eggs.|$|E

50|$|Identification of Xylotoles costatus is {{difficult}} as it is very similar in appearance to another longhorn beetle found in the Chatham Islands, Xylotoles traversii. Both species are coloured black with a <b>green</b> bronze <b>sheen,</b> however {{it is likely that}} X. costatus has more of a bronze sheen than X. traversii. Of the two species X. costatus also has the more pronounced ridges on its wing cases. Generally X. traversii is the smaller beetle of the two, but the size of the two species can overlap. However, if a longhorn beetle specimen is found in the Chatham Islands that is greater than 16 mm in length {{it is likely to be}} X. costatus.|$|R

50|$|The {{metallic}} pinktoe is a tarantula with {{a diagonal}} leg span of approximately 13 - 15 cm. The metallic pinktoe is noted for iridescent <b>sheen,</b> <b>green</b> to dark blue prosoma, {{and the white}} tipped hairs on the opisthosoma. Males and females look the same until the ultimate (final) molt of the males. At this point, males will gain embolus on the pedipalps and tibial apophysis (also called tibial spurs or tibial hooks), used for mating. The metallic pinktoe tarantula is an arboreal species that will often construct a tube web in the tree canopy.|$|R

40|$|The {{membrane}} filter (MF) {{method for detection}} and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a <b>green</b> metallic <b>sheen</b> when the filter is incubated on modified Endo medium at 35 degrees C for 22 h. Large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (SPC) technique, can interfere with the detection of coliforms on MF. This paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific SPC bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on MF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in Escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3, 000 and 220 per filter, respectively. The Flavobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. selected for this study from SPC did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. Excessive crowding of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae colonies on MF also caused {{a reduction in the}} number of colonies that produced sheen. Even when there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the E. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified Endo medium...|$|R
50|$|The Ascension frigatebird {{is a dark}} {{coloured}} seabird {{with long}} slender pointed wings, a long deeply forked tail and a long hooked bill. It measures 89 - 96 cm in length, has a wingspan of 196 - 201 cm and weighs around 1250 g. Male birds are entirely black except for the nape, mantle and scapulars that are covered with elongated lanceolate feathers that have a <b>green</b> metallic <b>sheen.</b> The birds have a striking red gular sack that they inflate to attract a mate. Their bills are pale blueish grey, their eyes are dark brown with a black eye-ring and their legs are grey. Female birds are brownish black and lack the green lanceolate feathers. Birds with the more common dark morph have a brown panel on the front that stretches from the collar down to the chest. Their eye-rings and {{the base of the}} bill are pale blue. Birds with the pale morph have some white on their chest. It is possible that they are young breeding females that have not yet acquired the full adult plumage.|$|R

Haim turned 14 {{on the set}} in Chicago, {{and fell in love}} with Green, who played his romantic interest in the film. Not realizing she was 18, he asked her out in an elevator. Haim's unrequited love for Green helped inspire his performance, with the real-life dynamics between them mirrored on-screen. Nevertheless, director David Seltzer noticed that unlike some of his peers, Haim seemed at ease with his burgeoning heartthrob status: [...] "He took it in stride. Not in a negative way, but he was something of a magnet and he knew it." [...] Haim had read for River Phoenix's role in Stand By Me while eating lunch in director Rob Reiner's backyard, and got the part the same day that he was offered Lucas. He later said he would not have changed his decision.|$|R
