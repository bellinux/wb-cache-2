40|$|We {{were able}} to attach CdSe quantum dots (QDs) having a ZnS <b>inorganic</b> <b>glue</b> layer {{directly}} to a mesoporous TiO(2) (mp-TiO(2)) surface by spray coating and thermal annealing. Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells based on CdSe QDs having ZnS as the <b>inorganic</b> <b>glue</b> layer could easily transport generated charge carriers because of the intimate bonding between CdSe and mp-TiO(2). The application of spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) to obtain additional CdSe layers improved the performance characteristics to V(oc) = 0. 45 V, J(sc) = 10. 7 mA/cm(2), fill factor = 35. 8 %, and power conversion efficiency = 1. 7 %. Furthermore, ZnS post-treatment improved the device performance to V(oc) = 0. 57 V, J(sc) = 11. 2 mA/cm(2), fill factor = 35. 4 %, and power conversion efficiency = 2. 2 %clos...|$|E
40|$|Silicon, as an alloy-type anode material, has {{recently}} attracted lots of attention {{because of its}} highest known Li+ storage capacity (4200 mAh/g). But lithium insertion into and extraction from silicon are accompanied by a huge volume change, up to 300, which induces a strong strain on silicon and causes pulverization and rapid capacity fading due {{to the loss of}} the electrical contact between part of silicon and current collector. Silicon nanostructures such as nanowires and nanotubes can overcome the pulverization problem, however these nano-engineered silicon anodes usually involve very expensive processes and have difficulty being applied in commercial lithium ion batteries. In this study, we report a novel method using amorphous silicon as <b>inorganic</b> <b>glue</b> replacing conventional polymer binder. This <b>inorganic</b> <b>glue</b> method can solve the loss of contact issue in conventional silicon particle anode and enables successful cycling of various sizes of silicon particles, both nano-particles and micron particles. With a limited capacity of 800 mAh/g, relatively large silicon micron-particles can be stably cycled over 200 cycles. The very cheap production of these silicon particle anodes makes our method promising and competitive in lithium ion battery industry. © 2011 The Electrochemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：The {{properties}} of <b>inorganic</b> cohesive <b>glue</b> and its appliance to repairing ordinary and high strength concrete were studied in this paper. <b>Inorganic</b> cohesive <b>glue</b> {{not only has}} high strength, but also has equivalent coefficient of expansion with that of concrete and steel. The mechanical performance of <b>inorganic</b> cohesive <b>glue</b> is better than that of concrete, and other performances {{are similar to those}} of concrete. In the concrete repair work, it can mend the ruinate concrete well, and the strength of the repaired concrete is as high as or higher than that of original specimen...|$|R
