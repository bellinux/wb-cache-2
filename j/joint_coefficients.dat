40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a new {{algorithm}} for image magnification is presented. Because linear magnification/interpolation techniques diminish the contrast and produce sawtooth effects, in recent years, many nonlinear interpolation methods especially nonlinear diffusion based approaches are proposed {{to solve these}} problems. The two recently proposed techniques for interpolation by diffusion—forward and backward diffusion (FAB) and level-set reconstruction (LSR) can not enhance the contrast and smooth edges simultaneously. In this article, a novel Partial Differential Equations (PDE) based approach is presented to solve their respective problems. The contributions of our paper include: firstly, a unified form of diffusion joining FAB and LSR is constructed {{to have all of}} their virtues; secondly, to eliminate artifacts of the joint diffusion, soft constraint takes place of hard constraint presented by LSR; thirdly, the determination of <b>joint</b> <b>coefficients,</b> criterion for stopping time and color image processing are also discussed. The results demonstrate that the method is visually and quantitatively better than Bicubic, FAB and LSR...|$|E
40|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) -orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) scheme {{has been considered}} as the most promising physical-layer architecture for the future wireless systems to provide high-speed communications. However, {{the performance of the}} MIMO-OFDM system may be degraded by in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalances caused by component imperfections in the analog front-ends of the transceivers. I/Q imbalances result in inter-carrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems and cause inaccurate estimate of the channel state information (CSI), which is essential for diversity combining at the MIMO receiver. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to analyzing a MIMO-OFDM wireless communi-cation system with I/Q imbalances over multi-path fading channels. A virtual channel is proposed as the combination of multi-path fading channel effects and I/Q imbalances at the transmitter and receiver. Based on this new approach, the effects of the channel and I/Q imbalances can be jointly estimated, and the influ-ence of channel estimation error due to I/Q imbalances can be greatly reduced. An optimal minimal mean square error (MMSE) estimator and a low-complexity least square (LS) estimator are employed to estimate the <b>joint</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the virtual channel, which are then used to equalize the distorted signals.

This paper describes an approach for {{the determination of}} a most probable sliding path. For this particular study, several blocks of gypsum with the dimensions of 15 × 15 × 15 cm containing coplanar non-persistent open joints were fabricated. The models have various configurations of rock bridges occupying 45, 90 and 135 cm 2 of total shear surface (225 cm 2) respectively. In order to study the complete failure behavior in the discontinuous joint, from each model, two similar blocks were prepared and were subjected to shear tests under two different normal stresses of 3. 33 kg cm − 2 and 7. 77 kg cm − 2. The failure mechanisms were monitored by visual inspection and a low power microscope to detect crack initiation and propagation. For each test, the failure surfaces were investigated to determine the characteristics of each surface. Two types of newborn cracks were observed: wing (tensile) cracks and secondary (shear) cracks. Both types of cracks initiate from {{the tips of the}} joints and propagate in a stable manner. Based on the change in the configuration of rock-bridges, a factor called the Effective <b>Joint</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (EJC) was formulated, that is the ratio of the effective joint surface that is in front of the rock-bridge and the total shear surface. In general, the failure pattern is mostly influenced by the EJC while shear strength is closely related to the failure pattern and its failure mechanism. It is observed that the propagation of wing cracks or shear cracks depends on the EJC and the connection of wing cracks or shear cracks dominates the eventual failure pattern and determines the peak shear load of the rock specimens. So the EJC is a key factor in determination of sliding path.

40|$|Abstract: Fractal Image Coder (FIC) {{makes use}} of the {{self-similarity}} inside a natural image to achieve high compression ratio and maintain good image quality. In FIC, {{the most important factor}} affecting the compression ratio and the image quality is the quantization of the contrast scaling and brightness offset coefficients. Most quantization methods treat the two coefficients independently and quantize them separately. However, the two coefficients are highly correlated and scatter around a line. In this paper, a <b>joint</b> <b>coefficient</b> quantization method is proposed that considers the two coefficients together and thereby achieves better compression ratio and image quality. The proposed method is especially effective under parsimonious conditions. For example, using only 3 bits each to represent the contrast and brightness coefficients of Lena, the proposed method yields quality of 27. 04 dB, which is significantly better than 22. 87 dB obtained from the traditional linear quantization msethod...|$|R

The deviation effect of three-dimensional positions, such as horizontal angle, vertical angle, and embedded depth, on joint load-transfer capacity was analyzed. A load-transfer capacity prediction model that considered dowel bar position deviation was established via ternary nonlinear regression. Load correction factor and its range were also proposed. This prediction model can effectively reflect the joint load-transfer capacity during dowel position deviation after verification via falling weight deflectometer testing. The horizontal angle of the dowel bar minimally affected <b>joint</b> load-transfer <b>coefficient.</b> By contrast, the <b>joint</b> load-transfer <b>coefficient</b> decreased almost linearly as the vertical angle increased.

Irregular fracture profiles were created using Barton's <b>joint</b> roughness <b>coefficient.</b> The Navier-Stokes (NS) equation was used to simulate the flow of water in those micro-fractures.

In order to directly demonstrate the power of this model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (Embedded Predictive Wavelet Image Coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a non-adaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit.

40|$|Background: Spasticity, an {{increased}} resistance of a limb to movement, {{is associated with}} functional limitations and {{a major source of}} disability in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke. Despite the clinical significance of spasticity in brain and spinal cord injuries, it is often not clear whether the spasticity is due to reflex or non-reflex changes. New method: Reflex and nonreflex properties of the human knee joint were studied in eight MS patients with spasticity and ten healthy subjects. A digitally controlled joint driving device was used to apply small-amplitude, and band-limited white-noise perturbations to the knee to manifest the reflex and nonreflex properties. The subjects were asked to maintain a steady level of background muscle torque during the perturbation. A nonlinear delay differential equation model was used to characterize the reflex and intrinsic properties of the knee in terms of phasic stretch reflex gain, tonic stretch reflex gain, joint elastic stiffness, and coefficient of viscosity. Results: It was found that <b>joint</b> <b>coefficient</b> of viscosity and tonic stretch reflex gain of the spastic MS patients were significantly lower than those of normal controls. On the other hand, spastic MS patients showed higher phasic stretch reflex gains than normal controls and a trend of increased joint stiffness. Conclusions: Simultaneous characterizations of changes in tonic and phasic reflexes and nonreflex changes in joint elastic stiffness and viscosity in neurological disorders may help us gain insight into mechanisms underlying spasticity and develop impairment-specific treatment.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{acceptance}} has recently received growing attention within tinnitus research {{due to the}} fact that tinnitus acceptance is one of the major targets of psychotherapeutic treatments. Accordingly, acceptance-based treatments will most likely be increasingly offered to tinnitus patients and assessments of acceptance-related behaviours will thus be needed. The current study investigated the factorial structure of the Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ) and the role of tinnitus acceptance as mediating link between sound perception (i. e. subjective loudness of tinnitus) and tinnitus distress. In total, 424 patients with chronic tinnitus completed the TAQ and validated measures of tinnitus distress, anxiety, and depression online. Confirmatory factor analysis provided support to a good fit of the data to the hypothesised bifactor model (root-mean-square-error of approximation = . 065; Comparative Fit Index = . 974; Tucker–Lewis Index = . 958; standardised root mean square residual = . 032). In addition, mediation analysis, using a non-parametric <b>joint</b> <b>coefficient</b> approach, revealed that tinnitus-specific acceptance partially mediated the relation between subjective tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress (path ab =  5. 96; 95 % CI: 4. 49, 7. 69).

The results confirm the factorial structure of the TAQ and suggest the importance of a general acceptance factor that contributes important unique variance beyond that of the first-order factors activity engagement and tinnitus suppression.

How cartilage mineralization affects joint degeneration has yet to be determined. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether BCP in the synovial fluid affects the rat knee <b>joint</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction (COF). MethodsThe COFs of knees from both hind limbs of four mature male rats were measured post mortem using a pendulum apparatus with an infrared tracking system. The three conditions evaluated were (1) the naïve state, (2) after the injection of 100  μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (sham) and (3) after the injection of 100  μL of a 1  mg/mL BCP suspension. The decrease in the pendulum amplitude (decay) was fit using two friction models: (1) a one parameter Stanton linear decay model and (2) a two parameters combination Stanton linear decay and viscous damping exponential decay model. ResultsThe COF increased 17. 6 % after injection of BCP compared to the naïve (P =  0. 0012) and 16. 0 % compared to the saline injected (P =  0. 0018) joints as derived from the one parameter model. The COF did not differ between naïve and saline injected joints. Results from the two parameters model showed a similar increase in COF after injection of BCP while the viscous damping was not significantly different between conditions.

The endpoint stiffness and joint stiffness of the arm were measured during a postural task in which subjects exerted up to 30 % maximum voluntary force in each of four directions while control-ling the position of the hand. All four <b>coefficients</b> of the <b>joint</b> stiffness matrix were found to vary linearly with both elbow and shoulder torque. This contrasts with the results of a previous study, which employed a force control task and concluded that the <b>joint</b> stiffness <b>coefficients</b> varied linearly with either shoulder or elbow torque but not both. Joint stiffness was transformed into endpoint stiffness to compare the effect on stability as endpoint force increased. When the joint stiffness coef-ficients were modeled as varying with the net torque at only one joint, as in the previous study, we found that hand position became unstable if endpoint force exceeded about 22 N in a specific direction. This did not occur when the <b>joint</b> stiffness <b>coefficients</b> were modeled as varying with the net torque at both joints, as in the present study. Rather, hand position became increasingly more stable as endpoint force increased for all directions of applied force. Our analysis suggests that co-contraction of biarticular muscles was primarily responsible for the increased stability. This clearly demonstrates how the central nervous system can selectively adapt the imped-ance of the arm in a specific direction to stabilize hand position when the force applied by the hand has a destabilizing effect in that direction...|$|R
