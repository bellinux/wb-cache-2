5|$|In the rideability test, {{the horse}} is {{evaluated}} {{by a member of}} the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, <b>gentleness,</b> attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E
5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the <b>gentleness</b> of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Mu'azzam {{organised}} {{an insurgency}} to overthrow Aurangzeb and proclaim himself the Mughal emperor. This plan {{may have been}} hatched at the instigation of the Marathas, and Mu'azzam's own inclinations and sincerity are difficult to gauge. Anyway, Aurangzeb learned about the plot and sent Mu'azzam's mother Begum Nawab Bai (a Muslim Rajput princess by birth) to dissuade Mu'azzam from rebellion. Nawab Bai brought Mu'azzam back to the Mughal court, where {{he spent the next}} several years under Aurangzeb's supervision. However, Mu'azzam revolted in 1680 on the pretext of protesting Aurangzeb's treatment of Rajput chiefs. Once again, Aurangzeb followed his previous policy to dissuade Mu'azzam with <b>gentleness</b> and then to place him under greater vigilance.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on <b>gentleness</b> and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E
25|$|At {{times he}} was so laid back as to be infuriating... {{but there was a}} {{remarkable}} warmth and <b>gentleness</b> in his character. Amongst the youngsters he was simply one thing: cool.|$|E
25|$|Zafimaniry {{society is}} {{comparatively}} less hierarchical {{than that of}} the Merina people. This has historically manifested as an opposition to centralized government. They are generally non-violent and place a high degree of value on civility and politeness, as well as <b>gentleness</b> in regards to disciplining children.|$|E
25|$|David Berkeley's live concerts, {{both those}} with a full band and the solo ones (not to mention the dates {{in which he has}} {{performed}} in duo with Jordan Katz), have been praised for their <b>gentleness</b> and richness. Between songs he uses to tell short anecdotes usually extremely funny, witty and erudite.|$|E
25|$|Duties to women: this is {{probably}} the most familiar aspect of chivalry. This would contain what is often called courtly love, the idea that the knight is to serve a lady, and after her all other ladies. Most especially in this category is a general <b>gentleness</b> and graciousness to all women.|$|E
25|$|Short as {{the session}} was, {{it was long}} enough for the deputies to realize that their {{political}} supremacy was over. They had changed places with the king. He was now indeed their sovereign lord. For all his <b>gentleness,</b> he guarded the royal prerogative fiercely and plainly showed that he would continue to do so.|$|E
25|$|Sea anemones {{are common}} on reefs. The tentacles of sea anemones bristle with tiny {{harpoons}} (nematocysts) primed with toxins, and are an effective deterrent against most predators. However, saddle butterflyfish, which {{are up to}} 30cm (12in) long, have developed a resistance to these toxins. Saddle butterflyfish usually flutter gently rather than swim. But {{in the presence of}} their preferred food, sea anemones, this <b>gentleness</b> disappears, and the butterflyfish dash in and out, ripping off the anemone tentacles.|$|E
25|$|In Caesar's Daughter, a {{novel by}} Edward Burton, Julia is a {{three-dimensional}} character. Julia {{is described as a}} rebellious little girl who is willful and passionate but with a <b>gentleness</b> and compassion for the people of Rome. She is dearly beloved by nearly everyone she meets except her stepmother, Livia. Loyal to her father, but not afraid to criticize his decisions she is (after Livia) his favourite consort. Julia grows up among intrigue and ultimately becomes its victim. Despite her tragic fate, Julia remains very cheerful and kind nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} cats {{are seen as}} yōkai in Japanese mythology is {{attributed}} {{to many of the}} characteristics that they possess: for example, the way the irises of their eyes change shape depending on the time of day, the way their fur seems to cause sparks due to static electricity when they are petted (especially in winter), the way they sometimes lick blood, the way they can walk without making a sound, their wild nature that remains despite the <b>gentleness</b> they can show at times, the way they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), the sharpness of their claws and teeth, their nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.|$|E
25|$|News of the Boxer Rebellion and the {{resulting}} disruption of missionary work in 1900 distressed Taylor, even though it led to further interest in missions {{in the area and}} additional growth of his China Inland Mission. Though the CIM suffered more than any other mission in China (58 missionaries, 21 children were killed), Taylor refused to accept payment for loss of property or life, to show the 'meekness and <b>gentleness</b> of Christ'. He was criticised by some but was commended by the British Foreign Office, whose minister in Beijing donated £200 to the CIM, expressing his 'admiration' and sympathy. The Chinese were also touched by Taylor's attitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{practices}} of Maharishi Ayur-Veda {{are said to}} be authentic, though Francis Zimmerman says that they are biased toward <b>gentleness,</b> avoiding violent or painful treatments that were historically part of ayurveda in early India. He also says that Maharishi Ayur-Veda involves an ideological confusion of Ayurvedic categories. In 1985, Maharishi Ayurveda doctors met with outside consultants, who suggested that some traditional Ayurvedic remedies would not be accepted by American consumers. The principal difference between Maharishi Ayur-Veda and traditional Ayurveda is the emphasis on the role of consciousness and the use of Transcendental Meditation, as well as the highlighting of the need to express positive emotions and attuning one's life to the natural rhythms of the body.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} styles of mechanical press, these can range from a simple wooden basket with vertical slats and a capstan providing pressure to large hydraulic presses that can even be enclosed to prevent exposure oxygen. An advantage of this style of press is the usually gentle means that it presses the grape but its disadvantages includes the labor intensiveness of its use, small volumes and tendency to provide uneven pressure to {{all parts of the}} cake as well as usually exposing the must to significant amounts of oxygen. Another disadvantage from a time perspective but an advantage in other regards such as <b>gentleness,</b> is that by its nature pressing with a basket press is very slow. Applying too much pressure too rapidly can break the press.|$|E
25|$|His father betrothed him to Claire-Clémence de Maillé-Brézé, niece of the {{powerful}} Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of the king, before he joined the army in 1640. Despite being barely twenty {{years of age and}} in love with Mlle du Vigean (Marthe Poussard, called mademoiselle du Vigean, daughter of the king's gentleman of the bedchamber François Poussard, marquis de Fors and baron du Vigean, by his wife Anne de Neubourg, daughter of Roland, sieur de Sercelles), he was compelled by his father to marry his fiancée, a child of thirteen. Although she bore her husband three children, Enghien later claimed she committed adultery with different men in order to justify locking her away at Châteauroux, but the charge was widely disbelieved: Saint-Simon, while admitting that she was homely and dull, praised her virtue, piety and <b>gentleness</b> in the face of relentless abuse.|$|E
25|$|With little {{talent and}} less acquirements, he was, {{throughout}} his life, {{one of the}} most considerable men in the country and a striking instance of that most agreeable truth—that courage and honesty in great situations more than supply the place of policy or talent. It was not his relationship to Lord Rockingham, though no doubt an advantage, nor his princely fortune, though a yet greater, which conferred the sort of importance he enjoyed for half a century in this country. He derived it more directly and more certainly from his goodness and generosity, and from the combination of <b>gentleness</b> and courage which distinguished his amiable and unpretending character. Such unblemished purity and such unobtrusive intrepidity, such generosity of feeling, firmness of purpose, and tenderness of heart, meeting in one of high station and princely fortune, commanded the affection and confidence of the public; and Lord Fitzwilliam enjoyed them, beyond even those of his own class who united much greater reach of understanding and more assiduity of business to superior personal accomplishments and advantages.|$|E
25|$|Within the earth's spherical limit, in a cosmological sense, is a {{designation}} of the 'earth's bosom' within, ímé àlà, a hemispherical base {{to the earth}} with an opening or 'mouth' at its highest point, ónụ́ àlà. This is composed of mainly deep dark sea water (ohimiri). Ime ala is considered as the underworld. Ala in addition to embodying nature, is the cosmic base on which the vault of heaven, ígwé, rests. As the foundation of all existence, children's umbilical cords are saved and symbolically buried under a tree to mark the child's first sharing of family owned lands; this tree could either be an oil palm, bread-fruit tree, raffia palm, or plantain tree depending on the cultural region. In some places, such as Nri, the royal python, éké, is considered a sacred and tame agent of Ala and a harbinger of good fortune when found in a home. The python {{is referred to as}} nne 'mother' in areas where the python is revered, it is a symbol of female beauty and <b>gentleness.</b> Killing of the python is expressly forbidden in these places and sanctions are taken against the killer including the funding of expensive human sized burials that are given to slain pythons.|$|E
25|$|She met Rimsky-Korsakov at Dargomyzhsky's home in {{the spring}} of 1868. Not long after their first meeting he wrote a song which he {{dedicated}} to her. He also started visiting her frequently, both at the Purgold home in St. Petersburg and at the family's summer residence in Lyesnov. She found in him an abundance of warmth and <b>gentleness</b> He proposed to her in December 1871, and they married in July 1872. Mussorgsky was Rimsky-Korsakov's best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs would eventually have seven children. Nadezhda was to become a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband, much as Clara Schumann had been with her own husband Robert. Beautiful, capable, strong-willed and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they married, she proved a good and most demanding critic of his work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder sometimes whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences. Although she gradually gave up composition after her marriage, she had a considerable influence on the creation of his first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and proofread and arranged compositions by him and others.|$|E
25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: <b>gentleness</b> and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E
500|$|Flanagan {{was usually}} self-effacing, {{reserved}} and amiable. His personality was summarized by his second wife: [...] "His <b>gentleness</b> and quietness are deceptive. He {{is a strong}} man, {{and he has a}} lot of spirit and firmness." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Gibson {{wrote about}} him more volubly: [...] "He {{thought about the}} game a lot. Many Australian cricketers do, more than English cricketers probably, but McCool was in some ways an untypical Australian. He had a diffidence and <b>gentleness,</b> which do not always spring to mind as {{familiar}} Australian qualities: but he had plenty of Australian determination." ...|$|E
500|$|Desdemona's {{character}} {{is shown in}} her attachment to her husband. [...] "Her beauty and external graces are only indirectly glanced at." [...] Her attachment to Othello begins in a manner [...] "a little fantastical and headstrong." [...] But after that her [...] "whole character consists in having no will of her own, no prompter but her obedience." [...] Even [...] "the extravagance of her resolutions, the pertinacity of her affections, {{may be said to}} arise out of the <b>gentleness</b> of her nature." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Japanese {{versions}} of the games Yuna has been voiced by Mayuko Aoki. Hedy Burress provides the character's voice in the English adaptations of the game. In voicing Yuna, Burress remembers trying to translate Yuna's duty, respect and honor, but also wanting to retain the <b>gentleness</b> and femininity of her character. When commenting on how the audiences would react to Final Fantasy X, Burress said that she wanted {{them to participate in}} the game itself and to [...] "transport them into a completely different world" [...] through the voices.|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing the}} news Kenneth Williams {{wrote in his}} diary that [...] "I loved that man. His unselfish nature, his kindness, {{tolerance}} and <b>gentleness</b> were an example to everyone". In The Sunday Times in February 1969, Paul Jennings wrote of him: [...] "If I ever knew a gentleman, it was Kenneth Horne.... He gave you his whole attention, his whole courtesy. And what a courtesy it was!... I knew him {{in the context of}} panel games, to which his marvellous unforced humour, spontaneous but beautifully timed, always added sparkle." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{aimed for}} Tommy's physical appearance to resemble Joel [...] "in stature and rugged toughness", {{but also to}} express his compassionate approach to the world. While Tommy shares Joel's [...] "gritty masculinity", {{he also has a}} <b>gentleness</b> which Joel lacks. Pierce originally auditioned for the role of Joel, which was later given to Troy Baker. When the team was required to cast an actor for the role of Tommy, they immediately contacted Pierce, as they were impressed by his audition. Baker felt that the chemistry between him and Pierce assisted in the realistic relationship between Joel and Tommy.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1971, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice {{called it}} [...] "one of [...] truest and most forthright love songs" [...] and was {{critical}} of its omission from the album The Beatles. In their 1975 book , critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler wrote that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] "promised great things" [...] for the ill-conceived Apple enterprise and described the song as [...] "the last great Beatles single recorded specifically for the 45s market". They noted also that [...] "the epic proportions of the piece" [...] encouraged many imitators, yet these other artists [...] " [...] to capture the <b>gentleness</b> and sympathy of the Beatles' communal feel".|$|E
500|$|An {{interesting}} area {{of research}} in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of animals, whether animals in human society (pets, working animals, even animals grown for food) or in the wild. One idea is that as people or animals perceive a social relationship as important to preserve, their conscience begins to respect that former [...] "other", and urge actions that protect it. Similarly, in complex territorial and cooperative breeding bird communities (such as the Australian magpie) that have {{a high degree of}} etiquettes, rules, hierarchies, play, songs and negotiations, rule-breaking seems tolerated on occasions not obviously related to survival of the individual or group; behaviour often appearing to exhibit a touching <b>gentleness</b> and tenderness.|$|E
500|$|She {{appeared}} in The Incredible Hulk (2008), {{in which she}} played Dr. Betty Ross, the love interest of the title character, played by Edward Norton. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script, and was {{a fan of the}} television show. She said filming the part was [...] "very physical, which was fun", and compared her performance to [...] "a deer caught in the headlights". The Incredible Hulk was a box office success, earning over $262million worldwide. The Washington Post, in review of the film, wrote: [...] "Tyler gives Betty an appropriately angelic nimbus of ethereal <b>gentleness</b> as the one Beauty who can tame the Beast... during their most pivotal encounters." ...|$|E
500|$|Foote based Sledge's {{victory over}} {{alcoholism}} on his observations of theater people {{struggling with the}} problem. He sought to avoid a melodramatic slant in telling that aspect of the story. Foote described his protagonist as [...] "a very hurt, damaged man... silence was his weapon". He chose the title Tender Mercies, from the Book of Psalms, for its relation to the Rosa Lee character, who he said seeks only [...] "certain moments of <b>gentleness</b> or respite, [...] grandness or largeness". Foote sought to portray each character as realistic and flawed, but not unsympathetic. Although the script conveyed a strong spiritual message with religious undertones, Foote {{felt it was important}} to balance those religious elements with a focus on the practical challenges of everyday life.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{appeared}} to have a complicated relationship with Brisbane, a city [...] "where brutality and <b>gentleness</b> rested so easily side by side." [...] Although she believed 1920s Brisbane to be quite parochial, she stated {{that it was not}} [...] "altogether narrow and rigid." [...] She took the well-thumbed copies of the great Russian novels in Brisbane's public libraries as evidence of the presence of many frustrated people in Brisbane; [...] "people with aspiration beyond their society." [...] Herself a victim of the stifling social expectations of the old colonial town, she has stated that she [...] "would have like to be an architect, but it seemed at the time absolutely impossible for a girl to be an architect, especially in Brisbane." ...|$|E
500|$|Christ {{is seated}} at the centre of a large array of angels, saints and holy elders. According to Pächt, in this scene in heaven that [...] "all is sweetness, <b>gentleness</b> and order." [...] Mary and John the Baptist kneel in prayer to his {{immediate}} right and left. Both have halos and are rendered at a far larger scale than the surrounding figures, over whom they seem to tower. Mary holds her right hand at her breast, while her left is raised as if to ask for mercy for the smaller naked figures sheltered by her cloak, evoking the conventional pose of the Virgin of Mercy. A choir of virgins gather directly under Christ's feet. They face outwards towards the viewer and sing Christ's praise.|$|E
500|$|The {{climax of}} George's sexual and artistic coming-of-age {{comes in the}} second-to-last story of the collection, [...] "Sophistication". Early in the story, while walking amongst the crowds of the Winesburg County Fair, George felt [...] "...a thing known to men and unknown to boys. He felt old and little tired......he wanted someone to {{understand}} the feeling that had taken possession of him after his mother's death [...] ". That someone {{turned out to be}} Helen White, who herself had [...] "...come to a period of change". It is in the time they spend together that readers see [...] "his acceptance of Helen as a spiritual mediator..." [...] which signifies that [...] "...George's masculinity is balanced by the feminine qualities of tenderness and <b>gentleness,</b> an integration that Anderson suggests is necessary for the artist." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{assessments of}} David I portray {{him as a}} pious king, a reformer and a civilising agent in a barbarian nation. For William of Newburgh, David was a [...] "King not barbarous of a barbarous nation", who [...] "wisely tempered the fierceness of his barbarous nation". William praises David for his piety, noting that, among other saintly activities, [...] "he was frequent in washing {{the feet of the}} poor". Another of David's eulogists, his former courtier Ailred of Rievaulx, echoes Newburgh's assertions and praises David for his justice as well as his piety, commenting that David's rule of the Scots meant that [...] "the whole barbarity of that nation was softened... as if forgetting their natural fierceness they submitted their necks to the laws which the royal <b>gentleness</b> dictated".|$|E
500|$|Belisarius {{knew that}} success for his {{expedition}} relied on gaining {{the support of}} the local population, which had largely retained its Roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator. Thus on the next day of the landing, when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard, he severely punished them, and assembled the army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards the native population, lest they abandon their Roman sympathies and go over to the Vandals. Belisarius' pleas bore results, for, as Procopius reports (The Vandalic War, I.17), [...] "the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything out of the way, and , by displaying great <b>gentleness</b> and kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land".|$|E
500|$|The AKC {{describes}} the Labrador's temperament as a kind, pleasant, outgoing and tractable nature. Labradors' {{sense of smell}} allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. They generally stay on the scent until they find it. Navies, military forces and police forces use them as detection dogs to track down smugglers, thieves, terrorists and black marketers. [...] Labradors instinctively enjoy holding objects and even hands or arms in their mouths, which they can do with great <b>gentleness</b> (a Labrador can carry an egg in its mouth without breaking it). They {{are known to have}} a very soft feel to the mouth, as a result of being bred to retrieve game such as waterfowl. They are prone to chewing objects (though they can be trained to abandon this behaviour).|$|E
