30|$|The {{emerging}} {{technologies for}} creating complex and specific <b>engineered</b> <b>surface</b> chemistry {{has increased the}} need for surface analysis methods that can accurately characterize and verify the actual surface chemistry [1]. This is particularly challenging when one considers the complexity of even simple surface modifications, and the trend towards using multicomponent, patterned surface chemistry {{in a wide range}} of biomedical applications, including biosensing. For example, an <b>engineered</b> <b>surface</b> may have a linker molecule to tether a coating to the substrate, molecules with binding groups for a specific analyte, and other molecules to provide a non-fouling background to avoid non-specific adsorption [2]. Each of these surface components could have a similar chemical composition with differences only in the structure or arrangement of the chemical groups. To optimize the performance of biosensors it is essential to minimize non-specific interactions via a non-fouling background and to maximize the biological activity of surface tethered probe molecule via control of orientation, conformation, and density [3]. Though no one technique can provide a complete characterization of such a surface, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is one method that shows great promise due to its molecular specificity, relatively high mass resolution, and high sensitivity [4]. However, ToF-SIMS data from even a set of simple homogenous surfaces can be very complex.|$|E

Most of the new surfaces tend to promote drop-wise condensation, which leads to higher rates of {{heat transfer}} when compared with film wise condensation. In the current study, the effects of surface morphology and surface chemistry on the condensation mechanisms have been investigated using <b>engineered</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Firstly, hybrid surfaces consisting of an array of micropillars with hydrophobic and hydrophilic sites have been designed to exhibit a distinct Cassie-Baxter wetting behavior at different temperatures. Characterization experiments have revealed that hybrid surfaces depict a unique wetting behavior. Furthermore, more types of <b>engineered</b> <b>surfaces</b> were fabricated including nanoparticle-based hydrophobic surface, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface, and self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) surface. Experiments have been conducted to determine the heat transfer performance of all <b>engineered</b> <b>surfaces</b> under a constant humidity level, surface-to-ambient temperature difference, and laminar flow conditions. Experimental results reveal that droplet sliding can have an important effect on heat transfer performance. Also, empirical heat transfer correlations have been postulated and fitted using experimental data using condensing and air temperature difference and Reynolds number as independent variables. Results indicate that the postulated correlations are in excellent agreement with experimental data. In addition, surface temperature data obtained using an advanced IR imaging system have been analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} the surface features on droplet growth dynamics. The non-invasive IR measurement technique has been helpful in understanding the droplet growth dynamics such as droplet coalescence.

Furthermore, results also reveal that droplet sliding angles can have an important effect on droplet sliding motion and condensed droplet dynamics play an important role during the overall condensation process. In summary, the effect of surface morphology and droplet growth dynamics on heat transfer during condensation were investigated and elucidated...|$|R
