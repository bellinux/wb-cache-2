5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way, either through cutting or fogging. Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily to Japanese tourist audiences for several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. Though it was a low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards she closed the island {{to the public and}} <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed to camp on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, {{more than a quarter of}} the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} eighties, Mitsubishi Motors {{also wanted to}} renew its aging Debonair model, which had not been {{substantially}} updated since its market launch in 1964. Given the existing relationship of sharing technologies and innovations, Mitsubishi accepted Hyundai's request to share a platform, internal configuration, and most importantly, an engine. As Hyundai was an official sponsor of 1988 Seoul Olympics, it used this opportunity to notify all the executives and important people about their new car, the Grandeur. Because of its Mitsubishi basis and good quality, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> popular in Korea.|$|E

Clayton supported the change, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> controversial, and his support of it caused him to lose the nomination of the Federalist Party to Louis McLane, beginning a long rivalry between the two men.|$|E

The project has been reported to have been cancelled by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson as a cost-cutting measure, although there have been calls for this to be reconsidered, the extension being regarded by Barking and Dagenham council as essential to regenerating the area.|$|E
25|$|The more {{influential}} early developers of Hospice included the Irish Religious Sisters of Charity, who opened Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross, Dublin, Ireland in 1879. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> busy, {{with as many}} as 20,000 people—primarily suffering tuberculosis and cancer—coming to the hospice to die between 1845 and 1945. The Sisters of Charity expanded internationally, opening the Sacred Heart Hospice for the Dying in Sydney in 1890, with hospices in Melbourne and New South Wales following in the 1930s. In 1905, they opened St Joseph's Hospice in London. There in the 1950s Cicely Saunders developed many of the foundational principles of modern hospice care.|$|E

25|$|Psychoanalysis {{comprises}} {{a method}} of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially conflict originating in the unconscious mind. This school of thought originated in the 1890s with Austrian medical doctors including Josef Breuer (physician), Alfred Adler (physician), Otto Rank (psychoanalyst), and most prominently Sigmund Freud (neurologist). Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and clinical observations. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society. Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of free association and a therapeutic interest in dream interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Chitrakatha Guchchamu is a {{collection}} of eight stories that are full of wit and morality. Chilakamarti recorded common stories related to humour, morals, real life incidents etc popular among Telugu people into two volumes under the title Vinodamulu (which literally means humour). In the second part, he included some poems too. Navvula Gani (which literally means laughing mine) is yet another humorous creation of Chilakamarti that comes in two parts. It mainly consisted of fun tit bits in various forms and <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> popular in those days. He introduced a feature called Hasya Latalu (creepers of humour) in the magazines run by him which was well received and enjoyed by large numbers of readers. Quite possibly, those Hasya Latalu were like the current day tit bits, cartoons and jokes published in the popular weeklies and dailies.|$|E
25|$|The country boasts {{one of the}} ten most {{important}} design schools in the region, La Escuela de Diseño de Altos de Chavón, which is making the country {{a key player in}} the world of fashion and design. Noted fashion designer Oscar de la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer Cristóbal Balenciaga and then worked with the house of Lanvin in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles. Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America, where <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> popular, and remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Cristóbal Colón.

25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>very</b> common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E
