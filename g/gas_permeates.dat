40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} identifying wood morphological parameters from gas apparent-permeability measurements. The apparent permeability at a given mean pressure is typically determined from the pressure relaxation kinetics when the <b>gas</b> <b>permeates</b> through the wood sample between two compartments which have different initial pressures. Using the proposed setup apparent permeability values ranging from 10 - 10 to 10 - 18 m 2 can be measured with a mean gas pressure varying from 2 bar down to 35 mbar. Morphological and topological parameters are then identified from the variations in apparent permeability {{as a function of}} the mean gas pressure using a pore network model. The network consists of elements such as pipes or orifices connected in series or in parallel. The rarefied gas flow is described in each element by an appropriate model and the unknowns are determined by an inverse method. This approach was first applied to track-etched polycarbonate membranes for validation purposes. The calculated pore radius and pore density values were compared to observations by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Softwood specimens were then investigated. The mean radius of the pores controlling permeability in the longitudinal and tangential directions was determined and found to be in good agreement with literature data...|$|E

The elemental analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This phenomenon was reproduced qualitatively in the present replication experiment.

40|$|The {{conditions}} and occurrence of gas in crude oil stored in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, caverns is characterized in this report. Many caverns in the SPR show that gas has intruded into the {{oil from the}} surrounding salt dome. Historical evidence and the analyses presented here suggest that gas will continue to intrude into many SPR caverns in the future. In considering why only some caverns contain gas, it is concluded that the naturally occurring spatial variability in salt permeability can explain the range of gas content measured in SPR caverns. Further, {{it is not possible}} to make a one-to-one correlation between specific geologic phenomena and the occurrence of gas in salt caverns. However, gas is concluded to be petrogenic in origin. Consequently, attempts have been made to associate the occurrence of gas with salt inhomogeneities including anomalies and other structural features. Two scenarios for actual gas intrusion into caverns were investigated for consistency with existing information. These scenarios are gas release during leaching and gas permeation through salt. Of these mechanisms, the greater consistency comes from the belief that <b>gas</b> <b>permeates</b> to caverns through the salt. A review of historical operating data for five Bryan Mound caverns loosely supports the hypothesis that higher operating pressures reduce gas intrusion into caverns. This conclusion supports a permeability intrusion mechanism. Further, it provides justification for operating the caverns near maximum operating pressure to minimize gas intrusion. Historical gas intrusion rates and estimates of future gas intrusion are given for all caverns...|$|E

The floating bead formulations were prepared by dispersing famotidine together with calcium carbonate into a mixture of sodium alginate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution and then dripping the dispersion into a solution of calcium chloride. Calcium alginate beads were formed, as alginate undergoes ionotropic gelation by calcium ions and carbon dioxide develops from the reaction of carbonate salts with acid.

40|$|The {{properties}} of polymeric membranes and measurements of gas concentrations are common elements of industrial processes and scientific research.

This approach is founded on the different rates at which the <b>gases</b> <b>permeate</b> {{into and out of the}} interior of the polymeric tube. The difference between the amounts of gas entering and leaving the tube triggers a pressure transient. The features of this transient depend on the species of the involved gases and their partial pressures and under certain conditions, allow the concentration of one or more species to be estimated.

40|$|Objectives: The study {{objective}} was to assemble emission characteristics {{of the sources of}} the ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and to elaborate methods of organizing them into the sources’ chemical profiles. Material and Methods: The UNMIX – sensor modeling method from the U. S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) – was used to process the VOC concentration data acquired over the years 2000 – 2009 for 175 VOC species in 4 air quality monitoring stations in Montreal, Quebec. Results: The method enabled to assess VOC emissions from the typically distributed sources existing in urban environment and VOC occurrences characterizing the local, or point-like, sources. The distributed sources were inextricably associated with hydrocarbons from exhaust, heavier hydrocarbons from contaminated urban soil, fugitive evaporations of gasoline and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), leakage from the industrial and commercial use of solvents, and the inert, ozone depleting <b>gases</b> <b>permeating</b> urban atmosphere. The sources’ profiles were charted involving 60 – 120 VOC species per source. Spatial distribution of the sources was examined. Conclusions: The UNMIX application and the source profiling methods, by building robust chemical profiles of VOC sources, provided information {{that can be used to}} assign the measured VOC emissions to physical sources.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that coherent relative streaming velocities of order 30 km / s between dark matter and <b>gas</b> <b>permeated</b> the universe on scales below a few Mpc directly after recombination. We here use a series of high-resolution moving-mesh calculations to show that these supersonic motions significantly influence the virialization of the gas in minihalos, and delay {{the formation of the}} first stars. As the gas streams into minihalos with bulk velocities around 1 km / s at z ~ 20, the additional momentum and energy input reduces the gas fractions and central densities of the halos, increasing the typical virial mass required for efficient cooling by a factor of three, and delaying Population III star formation by dz ~ 4. Since the distribution of the magnitude of the streaming velocities is narrowly peaked around a non-negligible value, this effect is important in most regions of the universe. As a consequence, the increased minimum halo mass implies a reduction of the absolute number of minihalos that can be expected to cool and form Population III stars by up to an order of magnitude. We further find that the streaming velocities increase the turbulent velocity dispersion of the minihalo gas, which could affect its ability to fragment and hence alter the mass function of the first stars.
