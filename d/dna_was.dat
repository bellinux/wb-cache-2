5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (<b>DNA)</b> <b>was</b> {{shown to be}} the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{mitochondrial}} <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> used {{to identify}} that a partial skeleton found in a Roman grave from the 1st or 2nd century AD in Vagnari, Italy, had East Asian ancestry on his mother's side.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{three-dimensional}} lattices of <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{the earliest}} goal of DNA nanotechnology, but this {{proved to be}} one of the most difficult to realize. Success using a motif based on the concept of tensegrity, a balance between tension and compression forces, was finally reported in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In prokaryotes, nonviral {{extrachromosomal}} <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> primarily {{found in}} plasmids whereas in eukaryotes extrachromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> primarily found in organelles. Mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> a {{main source of}} this extrachromosomal DNA in eukaryotes. Extrachromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> often used in research of replication because {{it is easy to}} identify and isolate.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear DNA and {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{differ in}} many ways, starting with location and structure. Nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{located within the}} nucleus of eukaryote cells and usually has two copies per cell while mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> located in the mitochondria and contains 100-1,000 copies per cell. The structure of nuclear <b>DNA</b> chromosomes <b>is</b> linear with open ends and includes 46 chromosomes containing 3 billion nucleotides. Mitochondrial DNA chromosomes usually have closed, circular structures, and contain for example 16,569 nucleotides in human. Nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> diploid, inheriting the DNA from both mother and father, while mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> haploid, coming only from the mother. The mutation rate for nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> less than 0.3% while that of mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> generally higher.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{extracted}} <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> crucial for several applications in molecular biology. If the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{to be used}} for next-generation sequencing (NGS), then microgram quantities of good-quality <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> required. In addition, the <b>DNA</b> must substantially <b>be</b> of high molecular weight {{so that it can be}} used for library preparation and NGS sequencing. Contaminating phenol or starch in the isolated <b>DNA</b> can <b>be</b> easily removed by filtration through kit-based cartridges. In this chapter we describe a simple two-reagent DNA extraction protocol which yields a high quality and quantity of <b>DNA</b> which can <b>be</b> used for different applications including NGS...|$|R
5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> first {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its {{molecular structure}} was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of the child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the bodies}} of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Yekaterinburg. They were {{identified}} {{on the basis of}} both skeletal analysis and DNA testing. For example, mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> used to match maternal relations, and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine was a sister of Alexandra. The bodies of Tsarevich Alexei and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007. Repeated and independent DNA tests confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the Romanov family, and proved that none of the Tsar's four daughters survived the shooting of the Romanov family.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the cell}} most <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> topologically restricted. <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} found in closed loops (such as plasmids in prokaryotes) which are topologically closed, or as very long molecules whose diffusion coefficients produce effectively topologically closed domains. Linear sections of <b>DNA</b> <b>are</b> also commonly bound to proteins or physical structures (such as membranes) to form closed topological loops.|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} human/Kryptonian hybrid, Superboy, {{inherited}} (eventually, through retcon) more traditional powers because his <b>D.N.A.</b> <b>is</b> 50 percent Kryptonian, whereas Cir-El's <b>D.N.A.</b> <b>is</b> primarily human, with some grafted-on Kryptonian attributes.|$|R
50|$|Cells {{with the}} normal amount of <b>DNA</b> <b>are</b> called diploid. Cells {{with too much}} or too little <b>DNA</b> <b>are</b> called aneuploid. Aneuploid cells are more likely to spread than diploid cells.|$|R
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
5|$|Ashdown-Hill's {{research}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} a challenge in 2003 to provide a DNA sequence for Richard's sister Margaret, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in Mechelen, Belgium. He tried to extract a mitochondrial DNA sequence from a preserved hair from Edward IV held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford but the attempt proved unsuccessful, owing to degradation of the DNA. Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born woman who had emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (née Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> tested and found to belong to mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup J, which by deduction should be Richard's mitochondrial DNA haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> easier to synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence {{were obtained by}} mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
50|$|Recombinant DNA (rDNA), or {{molecular}} cloning, is {{the process}} by which a single gene, or segment of <b>DNA,</b> <b>is</b> isolated and amplified. Recombinant <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> also known as in vitro recombination.A cloning vector <b>is</b> a <b>DNA</b> molecule that carries foreign DNA into a host cell, where it replicates, producing many copies of itself along with the foreign <b>DNA.</b> There <b>are</b> many types of cloning vectors such plasmid, phage. In order to carry out recombination between vector and the foreign <b>DNA,</b> it <b>is</b> necessary the vector and <b>DNA</b> to <b>be</b> cloned by digestion, ligase the foreign DNA into the vector with the enzyme DNA ligase. And <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> inserted by introducing the DNA into bacteria cells by transformation.|$|R
50|$|Most {{hardware}} {{screw threads}} are right-handed helices. The alpha helix in biology {{as well as}} the A and B forms of <b>DNA</b> <b>are</b> also right-handed helices. The Z form of <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> left-handed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{integrity}} of the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> maintained {{by a group of}} maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> also protected by DNA-binding proteins like histones.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> understood to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was {{the first step in a}} globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{genetic code}} {{was most likely}} based on DNA. Some {{studies suggest that the}} LUCA may have lacked DNA and been defined wholly through RNA. If <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> present, it was {{composed}} of four nucleotides (deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides. The <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.|$|E

30|$|During {{the reverse}} {{transcription}} of HIV viral RNAs, only single-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> generated. However, {{based on previous}} knowledge on cGAS, only double-stranded DNA can associate with and activate cGAS (Wu and Chen, 2014). Then how HIV-derived <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> recognized by cGAS? Actually, HIV-derived single-stranded DNA forms short base-paired <b>DNA</b> stretches that <b>are</b> strong activators of cGAS (Herzner et al., 2015). These short dsDNAs (also called Y-form DNA) formed from single-stranded <b>DNAs</b> <b>are</b> the predominant viral DNAs in the cytosol during the early infection of host cells. Y-form <b>DNAs</b> <b>are</b> characterized by unpaired guanosines flanking the stem region. They are flexible in respect of the numbers of unpaired guanosines and represent a newly discovered robust PAMP.|$|R

40|$|A {{novel and}} {{efficient}} method {{has been developed}} for isolation of correctly digested DNA fragments {{without the use of}} classic size-dependent electrophoretic separation methods.
