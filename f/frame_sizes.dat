The {{effects of}} heifer <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> on {{subsequent}} {{performance and the}} preweaning growth of calves were evaluated using records collected from theWaterburgEstates atOtjiwarongo,Namibia. Basedonhip height at 18 months of age, heifers were assigned to three different <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> groups: small ( 135 cm). Calving rate (CR), calving date (CD), postnatal calf survival rate (CSR), reproductive efficiency (Sandex), weaning rate (WR), birthweight (BW), weaning weight (WT) and preweaning average daily gain (ADG) were collected from first (n = 830), second (n = 623) and third and greater parity (n = 571) cows. <b>Frame</b> <b>size</b> of heifers significantly influenced (P < 0. 001) CR in second and third and greater parity. The postnatal CSRwas similar for all <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> and parity groups.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> is a problematic and ambiguous area. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the level of agreement between various techniques of assessing <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> in a group of 27 healthy and active men aged 18 - 24 years, and also to assess which anthropometric variables were best associated with a measure of actual <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> (AFS) which is proposed in this study. Actual <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> was measured by the summation of a series of bone breadths, lengths and depths on a sub-sample of 17 men. The results of the study revealed substantial discordance between methods of assessing <b>frame</b> <b>size.</b> The variables which correlated most highly with AFS (P < 0. 01) were body mass, ankle breadth, hand length and chest breadth, respectively. These variables were also positively correlated (P < 0. 01) with fat-free mass (FFM), with no significant correlation with fat mass in either case. Of the various documented methods used to assess <b>frame</b> <b>size,</b> the 'HAT' technique, which incorporates biacromial and bitrochanteric breadths, was more highly correlated with AFS than both elbow breadth (currently used in height-weight insurance tables) and the height/wrist circumference index. The latter measure was not highly correlated with AFS, body mass and FFM in this study. It was concluded that ankle breadth and hand length may be better predictors of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> in young men than other bone dimensions. In addition, the results of this preliminary investigation have substantiated the potential viability of an AFS model. Future research using this technique is recommended to determine true indicators of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> in a larger and more heterogeneous population...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{simulate}} an office LAN using IT Guru Opnet 9. 1 {{and then we}} calculate the performance of this network under 10 BaseT and 100 BaseT Ethernet wiring standards with different <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> and finally we compare the results i. e. which standard perform better for which <b>frame</b> <b>size.</b> We find that numbers of collision counts at hubs are always more in 10 BaseT, {{because of the nature}} of this standard. Hubs are always more utilized in 10 BaseT, because of more retransmission attempts due to high number collisions under 10 BaseT. Initially when <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> is 1500 Bytes, we find that 100 BaseT standard is performing well because the switch filters more traffic. We again reduce the <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> to 1024 Bytes in this case performances are equivalent. When we further reduce <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> to 512 Bytes we get a shocking result because 10 BaseT standard performs well and the switch filters more traffic. Then we come to point that if we have a low traffic LAN and we fix <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> to 512 Bytes then we have to use 10 BaseT Ethernet wiring standard in the implementation of LAN because it will give us good performance as compares to 100 BaseT. To our best knowledge this is the first paper that calculates the performance of a LAN under these assumptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> has not {{undergone}} a thorough evaluation in non-Caucasian populations. Using {{data from the}} Central Asia High Altitude Population (CAHAP) study, we tested whether: (1) the relationship between <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> and body composition is different in high-, medium- and low-altitude populations; (2) elbow breadth is a better index of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> than biacromial and biiliac breadth; and (3) measures of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> are associated with blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides. A number of 334 male subjects aged 33 +/- 10 years (mean +/- standard deviation) were selected from the CAHAP population (n = 384) {{on the basis of}} the availability of breadth measurements. The subjects were 85 high-altitude Kirghizs, 105 medium-altitude Kazakhs, 79 low-altitude Kirghizs and 65 low-altitude Uighurs. A detailed anthropometric evaluation and blood pressure, cholesterol and trygliceride measurements were performed on all individuals. Among breadths, elbow had the lowest correlation with arm fat area, thigh fat area, calf fat area and the sum of trunk skinfolds (r < or = 0. 196, P < 0. 01). Even if elbow breadth did not have the highest correlation with muscularity indexes, its constantly lower association with adiposity indexes shows that it is a better measure of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> than biacromial breadth and biiliac breadth. The relationship between <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> and body composition did not differ in high-, medium- and low-altitude subjects (P = not significant, analysis of co-variance). Only a weak association was present between breadths, blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides (r < or = 0. 230, P < 0. 01) and it was not influenced by altitude (P = not significant, analysis of co-variance). Elbow breadth was significantly correlated only with diastolic blood pressure (r = 0. 121, P < 0. 05). In conclusion: (1) the relationship between <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> and body composition is similar in high- and low-altitude populations; (2) elbow breadth is an index of <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> independent of altitude; and (3) elbow breadth is correlated with diastolic blood pressure, but this correlation is of doubtful biological relevance...|$|R

Results indicated that treatments did significantly affect (P <. 01) carcass traits. However, R squared values differed greatly between the response variables, ribeye area (. 23), hot carcass weight (. 02), yield grade (. 05), backfat thickness (. 08), marbling score (. 03) and percentage kidney pelvic and heart fat (. 23). It was determined that ribeye area was the only critical response variable that could be affected using the implemented treatments. Of the treatments, the <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> group was most effective in reducing ribeye area variation, (COV 8. 64) while the <b>frame</b> <b>size</b> x muscle thickness was most effective in reducing ribeye area size, (91. 72 cm?).
