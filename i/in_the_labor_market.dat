5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment {{outside the home}} in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same time}} frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E
5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of postwar real U. S.

Three different statistical tests for nonlinearity are implemented: the McLeod-Li test, the BDS test, and the Hinich bicovariance test. We find substantial evidence for nonlinearity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> generating mechanism of real GNP growth but no evidence for nonlinearity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solow residuals. We further find that the generating mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> input series is nonlinear, whereas that of the capital services input appears to be linear. We therefore conclude that <b>the</b> observed nonlinearity <b>in</b> real output arisesfrom nonlinearities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets,</b> not from nonlinearities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> technical shocks driving the system.

25|$|Gender egalitarian {{cultural}} principles, {{or changes}} in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation {{in that they}} reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. Horizontal segregation, however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures. Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that once people see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> might be changed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls {{are much more likely to}} drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{segregation}} {{refers to}} the way that some jobs (such as truck driver) are dominated by men, and other jobs (such as child care worker) are dominated by women. Considerable research suggests that predominantly female occupations pay less, even controlling for individual and workplace characteristics. Economists Blau and Kahn stated that women's pay compared to men's had improved because of a decrease in occupational segregation. They also argued that the gender wage difference will decline modestly and that the extent of discrimination against women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> seems to be decreasing.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women.

If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.

25|$|Despite its {{reliance}} on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by declines in traditional Rust Belt manufactures than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market.</b> First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is located primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This {{makes it possible for}} firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E
25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage.

Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists.
