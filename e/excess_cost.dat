Objective To examine the economic costs of neuroticism to get an impression of the overall effect of neuroticism on mental health care and on society in general. Design Cross-sectional population-based study. Setting General population. Participants A large representative sample (N = 5504) of the Dutch general population. Main Outcome Measures The costs (health service uptake in primary and secondary mental health care, out-of-pocket costs, and production losses) associated with neuroticism. Results The total per capita <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> were $ 12 362 per year for the reference year 2007 in the 5 % highest scorers of neuroticism, $ 8243 in the 10 % highest scorers, and $ 5572 in the 25 % highest scorers. The per capita <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> of neuroticism are considerably higher than those of mental disorders. The total <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> of neuroticism per 1 million inhabitants resulting from the 25 % highest scorers ($ 1. 393 billion) were approximately 2. 5 times as high as the <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> of common mental disorders ($ 585 million).

MethodsA retrospective matched cohort analysis was conducted by using data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Databases between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008. All patients newly diagnosed with vision impairment were categorized as having moderate vision loss, severe vision loss, or blindness. Each patient with vision impairment was matched to one randomly selected patient with normal vision by age (± 1 year) and sex. At each level of vision impairment, generalized linear models were used to {{quantify the}} total annual <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> and component costs incurred in the first and second years. ResultsVision impairment was associated with significantly higher crude <b>excess</b> medical <b>costs.</b> At each level of vision impairment, the total crude medical costs were attributable to different resource utilization and dominated by non–eye-related medical care. After adjusting for covariates, the first-year annual <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> increased with escalating severity of vision impairment: New Taiwan (NT) $ 9894 for moderate vision loss, NT $ 22, 760 for severe vision loss, and NT $ 52, 687 for blindness.

Although cardiac surgery is commonly studied, risk-adjusted analysis of <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> of lung resection has not been pursued. MethodsWe used 2002 to 2005 National Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data to evaluate adverse outcomes and costs in elective lung resections in hospitals with more than 20 cases during that period. Adverse outcomes were inpatient death or excessive risk-adjusted postoperative stay. Logistic models were defined to predict adverse outcomes. Linear models were designed to predict costs. Hospital-specific adverse outcome rates and costs were measured to define performance outliers. Cost-effective reference hospitals were used to define total <b>excess</b> <b>costs.</b> ResultsAmong 12, 182 patients at 215 hospitals undergoing lung resection, there were 336 inpatient deaths (2. 8 %) and 880 live discharges with prolonged risk-adjusted postoperative stay (7. 2 %). Predictive models for mortality and risk-adjusted postoperative stay had C statistics of 0. 773 and 0. 643, respectively. There were 11 ineffective hospitals (5. 1 %) with excessive adverse outcomes (P < . 005) and 34 inefficient hospitals (15. 8 %) meeting quality measures but with higher than predicted costs (P < . 0005). Ineffective hospitals had costs $ 1020 per case lower than predicted. Inefficient hospitals had costs $ 9978 higher than predicted. ConclusionsInefficiency is the major factor in <b>excess</b> inpatient <b>costs</b> associated with lung resection in this model.

40|$|Objective: <b>Excess</b> direct medical <b>costs</b> {{of severe}} obesity {{are by far}} higher than of {{moderate}} obesity. At the same time, severely obese adults with low socioeconomic status (SES) {{may be expected to}} have higher <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> than those with higher SES, e. g. due to more comorbidities. This study compares <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> of severe obesity among German adults across different SES groups. Methods: In a subsample (N= 947) of the KORA-Survey S 4 1999 / 2001 (a cross-sectional health survey in the Augsburg region, Germany; age group: 25 – 74 years), visits to physicians, inpatient days in hospital, and received and purchased medication were assessed via computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) over half a year. Body mass index (BMI in kg/m²) was measured anthropometrically. SES was determined via reports of education, income, and occupational status from computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) (used both as single indicators, and as indexed by the Helmert algorithm); due to small subsample sizes all were median-split. Data of respondents in normal weight (18. 5 ≤ BMI < 25), preobese (25 ≤ BMI < 30), moderately (class 1 : 30 ≤ BMI < 35) and severely obese (classes 2 – 3 : BMI ≥ 35) range were analysed by generalized linear models with mixed poisson-gamma (Tweedie) distributions. Physician visits and inpatient days were valuated as recommended by the Working Group Methods in Health Economic Evaluation (AG MEG), and drugs were valuated by actual costs. Sex, age, kind of sickness fund (statutory/private) and place of residence (urban/rural) were adjusted for, and comorbidities were considered by the Physical Functional Comorbidity Index (PFCI). Results: <b>Excess</b> <b>costs</b> of severe obesity were higher in respondents with high SES, regardless of the SES indicator used. For instance, annual <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> were almost three times higher in those with an above-median SES-Index as compared with those with a median or lower SES-Index (plus € 2, 966 vs. plus € 1, 012; contrast significant at p<. 001). Mediation of <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> of severe obesity by physical comorbidities pertained to the low SES-Index and the low occupational status groups: differences in costs between severe obesity and normal weight were still positive, but statistically insignificant, in the lower status groups after adjusting for the PFCI, but still positive and significant given higher SES. For example, severe obesity’s <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> were € 2, 406 after PFCI-adjustment in the high SES-Index group (p<. 001), but € 539 in the lower status group (p=. 17). At the same time, physical comorbidities as defined by the PCFI increased with BMI and decreased with SES, however the factors BMI and SES did not significantly interact in this context. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show in Germany that <b>excess</b> direct medical <b>costs</b> of severe obesity are not distributed equitably across different SES groups, do not reflect comorbidity status, and are significantly higher in those with high SES than in those with lower SES. Thus, allocation of health care resources spent on severely obese adults seems to be in need of readjustment towards an equitable utilization across all socioeconomic groups...|$|R

40|$|Background: Concerns {{regarding}} the effectiveness {{and impact of}} disease management are largely based on disease compliance measures. Although disease management programs have measured improvements in compliance {{and quality of life}} and cost savings from reductions in hospitalizations and emergency room visits, few programs have focused on changing behavioral health risks not directly related to the specific disease. The basic relationship between behavioral health risks and healthcare costs shows that those individuals with more high-risk behaviors are associated with higher healthcare costs compared with those with low-risk behaviors. The concept of <b>excess</b> <b>costs</b> associated with <b>excess</b> risks is a calculation of theoretical maximum percent savings for an entire group assuming everyone reduces to low risk, and changes in healthcare costs follow the changes in risks. Objective: To establish the magnitude of <b>excess</b> healthcare <b>costs</b> associated with <b>excess</b> health risks, given a diagnosed chronic disease. Methods: 135 251 current and retired employees of General Motors Corporation who had completed a Health Risk Appraisal (HRA) were evaluated. Participants were continuously enrolled in traditional or Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) medical plans from 1996 to 1999 and had completed at least one HRA between 1996 and 1998. Results: Those with and without self-reported disease averaged 19. 2 and 9. 1 % <b>excess</b> healthcare <b>costs</b> associated with <b>excess</b> health risks, respectively. However, the magnitude of the impact differed across age groups and diseases. Individuals less than 45 years of age with self-reported disease were most affected by the presence of additional health risks (44 % <b>excess</b> <b>costs)</b> while those aged >= 65 years without disease were least affected (8. 2 % <b>excess</b> <b>costs).</b> Among those with diseases, those with diabetes mellitus and bronchitis/emphysema were most affected (19. 2 and 21. 0 %, respectively). Conclusions: Disease management programs should ideally provide a systematic approach to assist patients with interventions that improve overall health, as well as focusing on disease compliance measures. The implications for disease management programs are that, even given the presence of disease, promoting and/or maintaining low-risk status can result in potential cost savings.
