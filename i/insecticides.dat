5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as <b>insecticides.</b> Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of <b>insecticides</b> across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the <b>insecticides</b> pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic <b>insecticides,</b> such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E

40|$|Background: Knowledge on <b>insecticide</b> {{resistance}} in target species {{is a basic}} requirement to guide <b>insecticide</b> use in malaria control programmes. Malaria transmission in the Mekong region is mainly concentrated in forested areas along the country borders, so that decisions on <b>insecticide</b> use should ideally be made at regional level.

5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of <b>insecticides</b> on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with <b>insecticides,</b> the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 <b>insecticides</b> in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene <b>insecticides</b> – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the <b>insecticides.</b> Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding <b>insecticides</b> or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid <b>insecticides,</b> while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from <b>insecticides</b> and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles funestus {{is a major}} malaria vector in {{southern}} Africa. Vector control relies {{on the use of}} <b>insecticide</b> chemicals to significantly reduce the number of malaria vectors by targeting that portion of the female population that takes blood meals and subsequently rests indoors. It has been suggested that the intake of a blood meal may assist female mosquitoes to tolerate higher doses of <b>insecticide</b> through vigour tolerance. It is hypothesized that during the process of blood digestion, detoxification mechanisms required for the neutralizing of harmful components in the blood meal may also confer an increased ability to tolerate <b>insecticide</b> intoxication through increased enzyme regulation. Methods Bottle bioassays using a range of concentrations of the pyrethroid <b>insecticide</b> permethrin were performed on pyrethroid susceptible and resistant laboratory strains of An. funestus in order to detect differences in <b>insecticide</b> susceptibility following a single blood meal. Based on these results, a discriminating dosage was identified (double the lowest dosage that resulted in 100 % mortality of the susceptible strain). Blood-fed and unfed females drawn from the resistant strain of An. funestus were then assayed against this discriminating dose, and the percentage mortality for each sample was scored and compared. Results In the <b>insecticide</b> dose response assays neither the fully susceptible nor the resistant strain of An. funestus showed any significant difference in <b>insecticide</b> susceptibility following a blood meal, regardless of the stage of blood meal digestion. A significant increase in the level of resistance was however detected in the resistant An. funestus strain following a single blood meal, based on exposure to a discriminating dose of permethrin. Conclusion The fully susceptible An. funestus strain did not show any significant alteration in susceptibility to <b>insecticide</b> following a blood meal suggesting that vigour tolerance through increased body mass (and increased dilution of internalized <b>insecticide)</b> does not {{play a significant role in}} tolerance to <b>insecticide</b> intoxication. The increase in <b>insecticide</b> tolerance in the pyrethroid resistant strain of An. funestus following a blood meal suggests that <b>insecticide</b> detoxification mechanisms involved in <b>insecticide</b> resistance are stimulated by the presence of a blood meal prior to <b>insecticide</b> exposure, leading to enhanced expression of the resistance phenotype. This finding may be significant in terms of the methods used to control indoor resting populations of An. funestus if the mass killing effect of <b>insecticide</b> application proves increasingly inadequate against blood-feeding females already carrying the <b>insecticide</b> resistance phenotype. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Insecticide</b> {{resistance}} raises {{concerns for}} the control of vector-borne diseases. However, its impact on parasite transmission could be diverse when considering the ecological interactions between vector and parasite. Thus we investigated the fitness cost associated with <b>insecticide</b> resistance and Plasmodium falciparum infection {{as well as their}} interactive cost on Anopheles gambiae survival and fecundity. In absence of infection, we observed a cost on fecundity associated with <b>insecticide</b> resistance. However, survival was higher for mosquito bearing the kdr mutation and equal for those with the ace- 1 (R) mutation compared to their <b>insecticide</b> susceptible counterparts. Interestingly, Plasmodium infection reduced survival only in the <b>insecticide</b> resistant strains but not in the susceptible one and infection was associated with an increase in fecundity independently of the strain considered. This study provides evidence for a survival cost associated with infection by Plasmodium parasite only in mosquito selected for <b>insecticide</b> resistance. This suggests that the selection of <b>insecticide</b> resistance mutation may have disturbed the interaction between parasites and vectors, resulting in increased cost of infection. Considering the fitness cost as well as other ecological aspects of this natural mosquito-parasite combination is important to predict the epidemiological impact of <b>insecticide</b> resistance...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Insecticide</b> {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the best examples of rapid micro-evolution found in nature. Since the development of the first synthetic <b>insecticide</b> in 1939, humans have invested considerable effort to stay ahead of resistance phenotypes that repeatedly develop in insects. Aphids are a group of insects that have become global pests in agriculture and frequently exhibit <b>insecticide</b> resistance. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, has developed resistance to at least seventy different synthetic compounds, and different <b>insecticide</b> resistance mechanisms have been reported worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings: To further characterize this resistance, we analyzed genome-wide transcriptional responses in three genotypes of M. persicae, each exhibiting different resistance mechanisms, in response to an anti-cholinesterase <b>insecticide.</b> The sensitive genotype (exhibiting no resistance mechanism) responded to the <b>insecticide</b> by up-regulating 183 genes primarily ones related to energy metabolism, detoxifying enzymes, proteins of extracellular transport, peptidases and cuticular proteins. The second genotype (resistant through a kdr sodium channel mutation), up-regulated 17 genes coding for detoxifying enzymes, peptidase and cuticular proteins. Finally, a multiply resistant genotype (carrying kdr and a modified acetylcholinesterase), up-regulated only 7 genes, appears not to require induced <b>insecticide</b> detoxification, and instead down-regulated many genes. Conclusions/Significance: This study suggests strongly that <b>insecticide</b> resistance in M. persicae is more complex that ha...|$|R
