5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland.

For the independent <b>farmers</b> <b>of</b> Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E

5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United <b>Farmers</b> <b>of</b> Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United <b>Farmers</b> <b>of</b> Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E
5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 â€“ August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky.

From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an antitrust investigation of the American Tobacco Company, claiming they were a monopsony that drove down prices for the tobacco <b>farmers</b> <b>of</b> his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States broke up the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco <b>farmers</b> <b>of</b> his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue and {{the huge}} cost of the indecisive battles {{eventually}} led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to Morkinskinna) the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement. By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, {{and there would be}} no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the <b>farmers</b> <b>of</b> withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had peopled maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him. Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird, a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915â€“1916.

The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The <b>farmers</b> <b>of</b> the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E
