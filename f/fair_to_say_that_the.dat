500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Camp Peary {{later became}} {{well known as}} [...] "The Farm," [...] a {{training}} facility for joint forces in the U.S. military. Though the roads and structures are still there and occupied, access to the base is still restricted. It would be <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two towns are [...] "lost" [...] to Virginia, albeit for purposes of national defense. Also in 1943, the site of another nearby town, Penniman, was acquired and absorbed into the Cheatham Annex complex, which adjoins Camp Peary, and {{is part of the}} Naval Weapons Station Yorktown.|$|E

A specialist in neurosurgery, one in neurology, one in psychiatry, one in orthopedics, {{and one in}} {{physical medicine and rehabilitation}} add up to definitive opinion in five medical specialties, all somewhat related, but different in their emphases. It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claimant received professional examination and opinion on a scale beyond the reach of most persons and that this case reveals a patient and careful endeavor by the state agency and the examiner to ascertain the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the play}} was never performed, its {{revisions}} reflect how Fielding sought to cater to what the audiences saw was popular in the earlier version, The Welsh Opera, which including adding more songs. Although not performed on stage, the songs became popular on their own. This was especially true {{in the case of}} [...] "The Roast Beef of Old England". Edgar Roberts, when examining the quality of the songs of the play, declared that [...] "it is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Grub-Street Opera is musically the most satisfactory of all the ballad operas written in the decade following The Beggar's Opera." [...] Likewise, Robert Hume determined that The Grub-Street Opera was [...] "one of the finest ballad operas of its time".|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, {{the courts}} have also {{demonstrated}} an unwillingness to consult foreign constitutional case law, and have crafted a [...] "local conditions" [...] rationale which prescribes reading the Constitution [...] "within its own four walls {{and not in the}} light of analogies drawn from other countries such as Great Britain, the United States of America or Australia". This has been termed a conservative and restrictive approach that seems to undermine the court's duty to generously interpret fundamental liberties. However, it has been noted that this approach to constitutional interpretation was never applied consistently, and that [...] "it appears that the 'four walls' doctrine has quietly fallen out of fashion at least in practice, as courts now regularly consider foreign cases which have only persuasive, not precedential value. ... It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development of Singapore public law is not accomplished in a cloister sealed off from transnational models, but through a thoughtful engagement with foreign cases." ...|$|E
2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E

"Well," [...] resumed Father Brown, [...] "it's not <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public {{impression}} {{is just what}} I've said, without adding that two things have happened since. I can't say they threw a new light; for nobody can make sense of them. But they threw {{a new kind of}} darkness; they threw the darkness in new directions. The first was this. The family physician of the St. Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a violent series of articles, in which he said that the late general was a religious maniac; {{but as far as the}} tale went, this seemed to mean little more than a religious man.|$|E
60|$|Marie Leszcynska {{had listened}} in silence at the awful {{accusation}} thus hurled by one woman against the other. At Irène's final words {{she turned and}} looked at Lydie, saw the marble-like hue of the face, the rigidity of the young form, the hopeless despair expressed in the half-closed eyes. It is but <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Queen even now did not altogether believe Madame de Stainville's story: she instinctively was still drawing a comparison between the gaudily apparelled doll with the shrill voice, and the impudently bared shoulders, and the proud, graceful woman in robes of virginal white, of whom, during all these years of public life, unkind tongues were only able to say that she was cold, rigid, dull, uninteresting perhaps, but whose vestal robes the breath of evil scandal had never dared to pollute.|$|E
60|$|But the {{influence}} of children goes further than its first trifling effort of remaking heaven and earth. It forces us actually to remodel our conduct in accordance with this revolutionary theory of the marvellousness of all things. We do (even when we are perfectly simple or ignorant)--we do actually treat talking in children as marvellous, walking in children as marvellous, common intelligence in children as marvellous. The cynical philosopher fancies he has a victory in this matter--that he can laugh when he shows that the words or antics of the child, so much admired by its worshippers, are common enough. The fact {{is that this is}} precisely where baby-worship is so profoundly right. Any words and any antics in a lump of clay are wonderful, the child's words and antics are wonderful, and it is only <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> philosopher's words and antics are equally wonderful.|$|E

60|$|There {{may have}} been some excuse for their curiosity. As before hinted, Guest's {{appearance}} in his overalls and woolen shirt was somewhat incongruous, and, for some inexplicable reason, the same face and figure which did not look inconsistent in rags and extreme poverty now at once suggested a higher social rank both of intellect and refinement than his workman's dress indicated. This, added to his surliness of manner and expression, strengthened a growing suspicion {{in the mind of the}} party that he was a fugitive from justice--a forger, a derelict banker, or possibly a murderer. It is only <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> moral sense of the spectators was not shocked at the suspicion, and that a more active sympathy was only withheld by his reticence. An unfortunate incident seemed to complete the evidence against him. In impatiently responding to the landlord's curt demand for prepayment of his supper, he allowed three or four pieces of gold to escape from his pocket on the veranda. In the quick glances of the party, as he stooped to pick them up, he read the danger of his carelessness.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} the refusal of the Committee to face my statement, I {{transferred}} the scene of action to the columns of The Times, which did yeoman's service to the public on this, as on many other occasions, by treating the question as a public one without the least regard to the supposed susceptibilities of the Court on the one side, or the avowed prejudices of the Free Churches or {{the interests of the}} managers or theatrical speculators on the other. The Times published the summarized conclusions of my statement, and gave me an opportunity of saying as much as it was then advisable to say of what had occurred. For it must be remembered that, however impatient and contemptuous I might feel of the intellectual cowardice shewn by the majority of the Committee face to face with myself, it was none the less necessary to keep up its prestige in every possible way, not only {{for the sake of the}} dignity and importance of the matter with which it had to deal, and in the hope that the treatment of subsequent witnesses and the final report might make amends for a feeble beginning, but also out of respect and consideration for the minority. For it is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority was never more than a bare majority, and that the worst thing the Committee did--the exclusion of references to particular plays--was perpetrated in the absence of the Chairman.|$|E
6000|$|And as I {{came into}} the cloud of London I met {{a friend of mine}} who {{actually}} is in a bank, and submitted these suggestions in rhyme to him for use among his colleagues. But he was not very hopeful about the matter. It was not (he assured me) that he underrated the verses, or in any sense lamented their lack of polish. No; it was rather, he felt, an indefinable something in the very atmosphere of the society in which we live that makes it spiritually difficult to sing in banks. And I think he must be right; though the matter is very mysterious. I may observe here that I think there must be some mistake in the calculations of the Socialists. They put down all our distress, not to a moral tone, but to the chaos of private enterprise. Now, banks are private; but post-offices are Socialistic: therefore I naturally expected that the post-office would fall into the collectivist idea of a chorus. Judge of my surprise when the lady in my local post-office (whom I urged to sing) dismissed the idea with far more coldness than the bank clerk had done. She seemed indeed, to be in a considerably greater state of depression than he. Should any one suppose that this was the effect of the verses themselves, it is only <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> specimen verse of the Post-Office Hymn ran thus: ...|$|E
