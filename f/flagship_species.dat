The Kitcisakik Algonquin community of western Quebec is calling for restoration and sustainable management of white pine on its ancestral territory, to ensure provision of associated ecosystem services. We present five white pine restoration and management scenarios taking into account community needs and ecological types: (1) natural regeneration of scattered white pines to produce individuals of different sizes and ages used as medicinal plants; (2) protection of supercanopy white pines used as landmarks and for providing habitat for <b>flagship</b> wildlife <b>species,</b> and younger individuals left as regeneration and future canopy trees; (3) the uniform shelterwood system to create white pine-dominated stands that provide habitat for <b>flagship</b> wildlife <b>species</b> and support cultural activities; (4) under-canopy plantations to yield mature white pine stands for timber production; (5) mixed plantations to produce forests with aesthetic qualities that provide wildlife habitat and protect biodiversity...|$|R

5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as <b>flagship</b> <b>species,</b> whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E

Here, using genome-wide data from the whole Antarctic continent, we reveal that this top-predator is organized as one single global population with a shared demography since the late Quaternary. We refute the view of the local population as a relevant demographic unit, and highlight that (i) robust extinction risk estimations are only possible by including dispersal rates and (ii) colony-scaled population size is rather indicative of local stochastic events, whereas the species’ response to global environmental change is likely to follow a shared evolutionary trajectory...|$|R

5|$|Since beetles form such a {{large part}} of the world's biodiversity, their {{conservation}} is important, and equally, loss of habitat and biodiversity is essentially certain to impact on beetles. Unfortunately, with exceptions for groups such as ladybirds and fireflies, beetles as a whole have a less positive image than other insect groups like the butterflies: many are indeed pests, and others arouse disgust. Many species of beetles have very specific habitats and long life cycles that make them vulnerable. Some species are highly threatened while others are already feared extinct. Island species tend to be more susceptible as in the case of Helictopleurus undatus of Madagascar which is thought to have gone extinct during the late 20th century. Conservationists have attempted to arouse a liking for beetles with <b>flagship</b> <b>species</b> like the stag beetle, Lucanus cervus, and tiger beetles (Cicindelidae). In Japan the Genji firefly, Luciola cruciata, is extremely popular, and in South Africa the Addo elephant dung beetle offers promise for broadening ecotourism beyond the big five tourist mammal species. Popular dislike of pest beetles, too, can be turned into public interest in insects, as can unusual ecological adaptations of species like the fairy shrimp hunting beetle, Cicinis bruchi.|$|E

40|$|Freshwater {{ecosystem}} degradation in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins is increasing due to rising human population numbers, and large water development projects. Therefore, monitoring ecosystem condition in these rivers of high biodiversity is of global conservation importance. This dissertation evaluated {{the potential of}} using river dolphins as indicators of ecosystem condition in large tropical rivers of South America.  First, population estimates of river dolphins were obtained by line-strip transect surveys and mark-recapture methods on photo-identifications. Using this information, I identified critical habitat, hotspots, and areas of concern for river dolphins, {{as well as the}} relationship between dolphin density and group size estimates with ecological features. Second, I evaluated the relationship between dolphin estimates and human stressors. Higher densities of dolphins occurred in rivers with low indices of overall freshwater degradation, such as rivers with high water quality and the lowest human population numbers. Thus, dolphin density estimates seem to be good indicators of freshwater {{ecosystem degradation}} in the Amazon and Orinoco basins. These top predators not only are indicator species, but also have the potential to act as <b>flagship</b> and sentinel <b>species,</b> indicating freshwater ecosystem degradation and stimulating conservation action.  This dissertation highlights the large changes in the Amazon and Orinoco that are approaching fast.

Madagascar's geography, history, and economic constraints contribute to severe biodiversity loss. Deforestation on Madagascar is reported to be over 100, 000 ha/year, with only 10 – 15 % of the island retaining natural forest [Green & Sussman, 1990]. Educating children, teacher-training, and community projects about environmental and conservation efforts to protect the remaining natural habitats of endangered lemur species provide a basis for long-term changes in attitudes and practices. Case studies of three conservation education projects located in different geographical regions of Madagascar, Centre ValBio, Madagacar Wildlife Conservation Alaotra Comic Book Project, and The Ako Book Project, are presented together with their ongoing stages of development, assessment, and outcomes.

40|$|Background: The {{international}} wildlife {{trade is}} a key threat to biodiversity. Temporal genetic marketplace monitoring can determine if wildlife trade regulation efforts such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are succeeding. Protected under CITES effective 1997, sturgeons and paddlefishes, the producers of black caviar, are <b>flagship</b> CITES <b>species.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We test whether CITES has limited the amount of fraudulent black caviar reaching the marketplace. Using mitochondrial DNA-based methods, we compare mislabeling in caviar and meat purchased in the New York City area pre and post CITES listing. Our recent sampling of this market reveals a decrease in mislabeled caviar (2006 – 2008; 10 %; n = 90) compared to pre-CITES implementation (1995 – 1996; 19 %; n = 95). Mislabeled caviar was found only in online purchase (n = 49 online/ 41 retail). Conclusions/Significance: Stricter controls on importing and exporting as per CITES policies may be having a positive conservation effect by limiting the amount of fraudulent caviar reaching the marketplace. Sturgeons and paddlefishes remain a conservation priority, however, due to continued overfishing and habitat degradation. Other marine and aquati...|$|R

In one planted and one natural forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, respectively four and 37 Pericopsis stem disks were collected. The tree-ring series of planted trees were used to confirm annual tree-ring formation. For the natural forest, a tree-ring chronology with 24 stem disks ranged from 1852 up to 2008. This chronology was compared with time-series of local precipitation, resulting in a significant correlation with {{the second half of the}} rainy season (September–November). This seasonal precipitation was related with sea surface temperatures of the West Indian Ocean. Higher precipitation during El Niño years corresponded with higher tree-ring indices but differences were not significant. In addition, pointer years were rare and did not have a consistent link with extreme climatic conditions.

The dormant cambium was characterized by the abrupt boundary between xylem and cambial zone, absence of enlarging or differentiating cambial derivatives, lower number of cambial cells and thicker radial walls in cambial cells. Growth ring anomalies, i. e., wedging and partially missing rings were also found.

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{decreasing}} pristine areas worldwide, conservation efforts now regularly include actions to restore disturbed landscapes. The field of restoration ecology is relatively new and rapidly growing, but it is currently heavily biased towards studies of flora rather than fauna. This bias is also reflected in rehabilitation work conducted as part of legislated requirements of, for example, mining restoration. Fauna is probably overlooked because of the largely untested assumption that successful rehabilitation of flora will bring the recovery of fauna. However, ignoring fauna is problematic given that it represents {{an essential element of}} biodiversity that is likely to show unique responses to rehabilitation, and plays many crucial roles in ecosystem function. This thesis was conceived to challenge the notion that &# 147;flora equals fauna&# 148; in post-mining rehabilitation, by examining recolonisation characteristics for one species of particular interest, the koala Phascolarctos cinereus in an area of post-mining rehabilitation on North Stradbroke Island, Queensland. I first review the Australian literature on post-mining rehabilitation and highlight some common processes of fauna recolonisation after mining rehabilitation. I then report on an experimental assessment of the reliability of faecal pellets surveys for koalas, a methodology commonly used in koala studies. Next I test the assumption that successful rehabilitation based on flora criteria would reflect success in koala recolonisation. I found that flora will rarely be a perfect surrogate for fauna, and that this relationship cannot always be assumed but should be demonstrated. I then further investigate koala recolonisation of mining rehabilitation by comparing habitat characteristics, roosting trees, diet, and predation risk for koalas in undisturbed and rehabilitated areas. This chapter explores and rejects the possibility that rehabilitated areas could lure koalas into an ecological trap. Finally, I test the popular conservation paradigm that a single <b>flagship</b> fauna <b>species</b> like the koala can be used as an indicator for rehabilitation success of other fauna (e. g. arboreal marsupials). This hypothesis was rejected; gliders&# 8223; recolonisation of rehabilitated areas was variable whereas koala presence was more widespread. I conclude with an examination of how successful rehabilitation is for arboreal marsupials in my study site, and make general suggestions for developing fauna criteria for assessing the success of rehabilitation...|$|R

However, {{there is a lack}} of standardized monitoring programs to track these human stressors in most of the countries that overlap these basins, and no clear ecological indicators have been identified. In this study we investigated the relationships between measures of ecosystem degradation and river dolphins as potential ecological indicators. The presence of human stressors and their distance from the areas surveyed were used to provide an estimate of ecosystem degradation. We tested three ecological indicators of freshwater ecosystem degradation using river dolphins: (i) density of river dolphins, (ii) mean group size of dolphins, and (iii) dolphin sighting rates. We found a strong negative relationship between measures of habitat degradation and river dolphin density estimates in selected locations of the Amazon and Orinoco. Therefore, we suggest that river dolphins are good candidates as ecological indicators, <b>flagship</b> and sentinel <b>species</b> for monitoring the conservation status of large tropical rivers in South America. We suggest that further effort should be directed toward collecting reliable data on human stressors, creating collaborative networks for compiling existing data, and documenting and monitoring current trends in freshwater ecosystem degradation and indicator species in the Amazon and Orinoco basins with the goal of targeting areas for recovery or sustainable management.
