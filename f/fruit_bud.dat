40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In 1960 {{tests were}} {{initiated}} on the Marion blackberry (Rubus hybrid) {{to study the}} effect of (1) plant spacing, (2) time of training canes to the trellis and (3) amount of cane to train to the trellis with regard to <b>fruit</b> <b>bud</b> formation and total yield. Plant spacing varied with 2. 5, 5 and 10 feet between plants in the row. Time of training the canes to the trellis was approximately {{the middle of the}} months of August, September, October and February. The amount of cane trained on the trellis was either the entire length of all sound canes or only enough of each cane to reach the adjacent plant. Total yield of fruit, fruit spur determinations, time of <b>fruit</b> <b>bud</b> formation, leaf size and number and carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves were studied and/or measured. Although yield differences were greatest {{in the early years of}} the planting, 4 -year averages indicate that closer spacing of plants resulted in highly significant increases. August-trained canes produced the highest yields, followed in order by February, September and October. Differences in yield between the length of canes trained were very small and generally non-significant. When more cane grox<rth was trained, a corresponding increase in training time was required, particularly at the closer plant spacings. August and September training of canes stimulated the axillary buds to elongate and produce lateral growth. These laterals on August-trained canes matured enough to allow the formation of fruit buds, while laterals on September-trained canes were generally too succulent to form fruit buds. August-trained canes produced more fruit spurs per foot of row than February-trained canes. No difference in number of flower buds per fruit spur occurred between August and February training. Leaf counts on November 1 indicated that trellis training done in August produced more trifoliate leaves per foot of row than when the canes remained on the ground. Trifoliate leaves from ground-level training were larger. Axillary buds were collected at 2 -week intervals starting on August 1 and continuing until November 15 for the purpose of determining the time of <b>fruit</b> <b>bud</b> formation. The canes were divided into three sections, (1) basal, (2) mid-and (3) terminal, and each sampled separately. Buds from trellis-level training changed little during August and September; however, on October 2, buds from the terminal area only of canes and laterals were showing elongation. By mid-October, buds from all areas of the cane were showing an elongation of the apex. The first and only floral structure, expressed as a broadening and flattening of the apex, was observed in terminal section buds sampled on November 15. In contrast, basal and mid-section buds from canes trained along the ground during the summer showed an elongation of the apex by October 2, and by November 15 well defined floral structures were observed. Buds from the terminal section of cane were beginning to show some elongation by mid-November. Carbohydrate and nitrogen determinations were made on trifoliate leaves sampled from various loci on the canes on November 1. Older leaves, regardless of plant spacing or time of training, had the lowest nitrogen content. Carbohydrate content of leaves was quite variable. The C:N ratio was lowest for the 5 -foot spacing in both trellis-level and ground-level training. Leaves from the terminal area of the. canes had the lowest C:N ratio...|$|E

30|$|Fruit {{initiation}} {{happens with}} reduction in minimum temperature {{or with the}} advent of a warm period. In the present study, the initiation of the <b>fruit</b> <b>bud</b> happened in certain species with leaf expansion including Bassia latifolia, Semecarpus anacardium, Lagerstroemia lanceolata, and Tectona grandis. For fruits to mature, trees require temporally concentrated rainfall during the preceding months. A similar trend was also observed in the dry forest of Australia (Bach 2002), in other dry forests of India (Murali and Sukumar 1994; Krishnan 2002), and tropical montane forests in Rwanda (Sun et al. 1996). In Bhadra wildlife sanctuary ripening of fruit began in March and increased with the onset of the wet season from August to September. Ripened fruiting peaks have been reported to occur in the wet season (Foster 1982; Heideman 1989; Chapman et al. 1999). Fleshy-fruited species produced fruits preferentially during the wet season in the dry tropical forest of Ghana (Lieberman 1982). Peak activity of fruiting occurred in the dry season (Chapman et al. 2005), and pre-monsoon fruit ripening occurred in the dry period or close to rainfall to gain post-dispersal success (Rathcke and Lacey 1985), enhance dispersal (Prasad and Sharatchandra 1984; Sundrapandian et al. 2005), and to avoid pathogen infection (Augspurger, 1983).|$|E

30|$|Metal {{nanoparticles}} exhibit unique {{chemical and}} physical properties including large surface/volume ratio, which {{is useful in}} {{different fields such as}} electronics, photonics, biomedical, catalysis, etc [1]. Among the various noble metals, silver is the metal of the first choice due to their diverse properties especially high antimicrobial and catalytic nature [2, 3]. Many standard approaches by means of physical and chemical have been used for the preparation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by several researchers. Generally, conventional physical and chemical methods seem to be very expensive and hazardous [4]. Hence, there is always a need for developing an eco-friendly process for the synthesis of nanoparticles which does not use any harmful or toxic agents. The most recent environment-friendly approach is using green chemistry technology [5]. The green synthesis approach provides most advantages over the chemical and physical method as it is fast, cost-effective, eco-friendly and easy to scale up for large-scale synthesis without applying high energy, high pressure, high temperature and toxic chemicals [6]. The green synthesis approach usually employs microorganism or plant parts for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Recently, many researchers have employed different plant parts such as root, stem, bark, leaf, <b>fruit,</b> <b>bud,</b> and latex for the synthesis of AgNPs [7, 8, 9, 10]. Reports have suggested that nanoparticles synthesized from medicinal plants {{have been found to be}} pharmacologically active and stable, but no hazardous by-products or toxic chemicals are used in their synthesis [11]. Therefore, as a green approach for the first time, we report the use of Symphytum officinale (Comfrey) leaf extract for the synthesis of AgNPs and further investigating their role in protection against UVB-induced photoaging.|$|E

Impacts and magnitude of climate change, a global phenomenon though not precisely understood as they become discernible at their tipping points, gradually increased risks originating from erratic weather, altering dynamics of pests and diseases have the potential to adversely impact crop yields and crop distribution in the country. Crop production dynamics in mango {{in different parts of the}} country in recent years is gripped with uncertainties due to occurrence of weather extremes, inadequacies of water and nutrient management and impacts of altered pests and diseases prevalence. The Konkan region of Maharashtra where the production of country's premier variety, 'Alphonso' is under monoculture getting impacted by weather vagaries for the last four years under the influence of western disturbances needs elaborate studies for understanding in order to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. Despite some regional studies undertaken to profile the effects of some weather parameters on response of mango crop in some agro-ecologies, a clear understanding of its vulnerability to different phenophases events vis a vis production constraints is yet to emerge. This is especially important as mango production in recent years is getting adversely impacted by such weather variables as both high as well as low temperatures, unseasonal rainfall, floods, sunshine hours, relative humidity, wind speed etc., These variables potentially affected the different phenophases viz., vegetative growth dynamics, <b>fruit</b> <b>bud</b> differentiation, flowering, pests and diseases dynamics, fruit set and development, maturity, harvests and eventually the markets. Limited information however, is available on the understanding the impacts of weather components either individually or conjunctively influencing individual phenophases and their contribution to over all crop outputs in order to put in place effective horticultural interventions. The spatio-temporal relationships and relative effects of critical weather variables on phenophases and crop productivity when appraised on collective and regional basis will facilitate development of models that could form part of the Decision Support System (DSS) for empowering growers' communities. Long term adaptation and mitigation strategies however need to entail studies on carbon sequestration, development of climate resilient varieties, improved crop husbandry practices for risk management, productive use of water and nutrient resources and integrated management of pests and diseases.
