40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A {{classical}} {{biological control}} project was undertaken against the <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzocallis coryli (Goetze), in western Oregon. Hazelnut orchards in Spain, France, and Italy were searched for natural {{enemies of the}} aphid, and a parasitic wasp, Trioxys pallidus Haliday, was imported, quarantined, mass-reared, and released in Oregon orchards. The wasp successfully attacks and completes its development on the Oregon race of the <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid.</b> A greenhouse culture of the parasitoid has been maintained continuously for over 50 generations, and approximately 30, 000 adult wasps have been released in the Willamette Valley. Overwintering survival has been documented in at least eight different locations. In three commercial orchards, the parasitoids reduced aphid populations by 26 - 32...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Levels of {{resistance}} to six selected insecticides of eleven field populations of the <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> Mvzocallis coryli (Goetze) were determined by using the leaf-dip residue technique. Test insecticides included compounds widely used in commercial filbert orchards, namely, carbaryl, diazinon, endosulfan, phosalone, fenvalerate and oxydemetonmethyl. Aphid samples were collected within a 100 -mile range from Eugene {{in the south to}} Wilsonville in the north of the Willamette Valley, Oregon. The filbert orchards were characterized by different levels of insecticide exposure, age and management conditions. The tests were conducted to detect seasonality {{of resistance}} during the different phases of the population in the summer, fall and early spring months of 1985 - 1986. Toxicological responses of various <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> populations exhibited significantly different resistance to tested insecticides. All populations exhibited lethal concentration (Lc₅₀) values of 0. 0013 g AI/ 1 to 0. 1507 g AI/ 1 of endosulfan which, when compared to the susceptible OSU population, were categorized as zero to moderate levels of resistance. With the exception of a high Lc₅₀ value of 1. 7853 g AI/ 1 exhibited by the Harnisch population, resistance to diazinon is still at low levels or non existent in most populations of M. coryli in the Willamette Valley. Lc₅₀ values of carbaryl varied from 0. 0075 g AI/ 1 to more than 1. 2 g AI/ 1, indicating significant differences in tolerance among the <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> populations to this insecticide. The majority of the populations were moderately resistant, but extremely high levels (> 1000 -fold) of resistance were evident in populations collected from two orchards. Lc₅₀ values for these populations were well above the maximum range of recommended field dosages. Highest resistance levels of more than 1000 -fold of fenvalerate also were noticed in <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> populations from these orchards; Lc₅₀'s were more than the maximum field rate. Populations of M. coryli from other orchards were non-resistant (Lc₅₀ value of 0. 0003 g AI/ 1) to highly resistant (Lc₅₀ value of 0. 0989 g AI/ 1) to fenvalerate. Selection for high resistance to fenvalerate after just a few seasons of use in commercial orchards was not expected. Although failure of field control of filbert aphids by phosalone has not been reported, several populations have developed high resistance to this insecticide. <b>Filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> populations from three orchards had Lc₅₀'s above the maximum recomended field dosage of 0. 563 g AI/ 1 of phosalone. The maximum Lc₅₀ values {{for the rest of the}} populations ranged from 0. 0012 g AI/ 1 to 0. 2499 g AI/ 1 and were categorized respectively, as non-resistant to highly resistant strains. From one series of experiments in early spring of 1986, the majority of <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> populations indicated zero to moderate levels {{of resistance to}} oxydemetonmethyl. One population with Lc₅₀ value of 0. 2135 g AI/ 1 showed the highest tolerance to this insecticide. The shallow slopes of the log dosage mortality curves indicated heterogeneity of responses of the various <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> populations to the insecticides. These responses could be explained by the widespread use and rotational spraying patterns of the insecticides in commercial orchards. The distribution of resistance was not a regional phenomenon. It was associated with, 1) the pattern of insecticide usage and 2) the proximity of the source of aphid population to more intensively managed commercial orchards. The tendency for increased resistance to all insecticides in summer and fall populations of M. coryli was evident. However, as an exception, phosalone resistance of Lemert population was also high when treated in early spring. Seasonal variations in susceptibility of less than 10 -fold to endosulfan, and 237 -fold to diazinon were measured. Extrapolation of Lc₅₀ values beyond the range of tested concentrations resulted in variations in tolerance of more than 1000 -fold among some populations treated with carbaryl, phosalone and fenvalerate. Several factors which may influence the widespread expression and the seasonality of insecticide resistance have been discussed without giving a generalized explanation. Rather than considering these results quantitatively, what is vital from the present studies is the information on changes in susceptibility of M. coryli to those insecticides recommended to filbert growers in this area. Resistance monitoring is considered critical to effective insect control programs in commercial filbert orchards of the Willamette Valley, Oregon...|$|E
40|$|The {{densities of}} <b>filbert</b> (hazelnut) <b>aphid,</b> Myzocallis coryli (Goetze) on the hazel bushes were {{measured}} in both 1993 and 1994. The aphids were {{present on the}} hazel during from May to September, and peaked in July. Significantly greater densities of M. coryli were found in block 1 in the tree rows in both years (1993 & 1994). The population densities of aphids on hazel bushes {{were found to be}} significantly greater in the forestry plots than in the tree rows. The fewer predators observed provided too small a sample size for any meaningful comparisons of percentage predation to be made. ...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{related to}} {{morphological}} and anatomical traits of leaves of four largefruited hazelnut (Corylus L.) cultivars characterised by different susceptibility to <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzocallis coryli Goetze) feeding. The following parameters were measured: {{the thickness of}} leaf blade, the number of stomata, the length of secretory and mechanical hairs and their density on the leaf, the thickness of adaxial and abaxial epidermis and the thickness of their external cell walls. Observations of cross sections of the leaves were made in a light microscope and {{the surface of the}} adaxial epidermis was analysed in a scanning electron microscope. It was shown that leaves of the cultivars susceptible to M. coryli feeding had the thinnest leaf blade, especially in the main vein, and many more stomata. Besides, the cultivar most resistant to <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding, White Filbert, was marked by the largest height of the adaxial epidermis cells and the strongest striation of the cuticle in abaxial epidermis. On leaves of this cultivar, the number of mechanical hairs was the highest, while the lowest number of them was noted on Wonder from Bollwiller, the most susceptible cultivar...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of aphid feeding on chlorophyll a fluorescence {{in the leaves}} of four cultivated hazel cultivars, with different levels of resistance to <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> (Myzocallis coryli Goetze), was studied. The maximum effect of photosystem reaction measured on dark-adapted hazel leaves (Fv/Fm parameter) and maximum efficiency of photon energy PAR conversion to chemical energy in light conditions (Y parameter) were estimated twice, in the leaves of four hazel cultivars with different levels of resistance to <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid,</b> using a fluorometer PAM- 2000 by Walz GmbH - Germany. The analysis of changes of these parameters showed that aphid feeding caused a reaction in all tested cultivars. The most visible reduction of the Fv/Fm and Y values {{as a result of}} aphid feeding was observed in the cultivars 'Cud z Bollwiller' and 'Olbrzymi z Halle', numerously colonized by aphids. A smaller number of aphids found on the leaves of more resistant cultivars - 'Kataloński' and 'Lamberta Biały', caused a weaker response of plants and a smaller decline in the value of this parameter. 'Cud z Bollwiller' cultivar showed higher tolerance than other tested cultivars to stress caused by the feeding of sucking insects. The Fv/Fm and Y parameters can be regarded as reliable indexes useful in diagnosing susceptibility of hazel cultivars to aphids, helpful in determining, for example, harmfulness thresholds...|$|E
40|$|Commercial filbert {{orchards}} {{throughout the}} Willamette Valley were surveyed for natural {{enemies of the}} <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzocallis coryli (Goetze). A large number of predaceous insects were found to prey upon M. coryli, particularly members of the families Coccinellidae, Miridae, Chrysopidae, Hemerobiidae, and Syrphidae. Also, a parasitic Hymenopteran (Mesidiopsis sp.) and a fungal pathogen (Triplosporium fresenii) were found to attack this aphid species. Populations of major predators were monitored closely during 1981 to determine phenology and synchrony with aphid populations and to determine their relative importance. Adalia bipunctata, Deraeocoris brevis, Chrysopa sp. and Hemerobius sp. {{were found to be}} extremely well synchronized with aphid population development cycles. Laboratory feeding trials demonstrated that all 4 predaceous insects tested (Deraeocoris brevis, Heterotoma meriopterum, Compsidolon salicellum and Adalia bipunctata) had a severe impact upon <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> population growth. A. bipunctata was more voracious than the other 3 species, but could not live as long in the absence of aphid prey. Several insecticides were tested both in the laboratory and field to determine their relative toxicity to filbert aphids and the major natural enemies. Field tests showed Metasystox-R to be the most effective against filbert aphids, while Diazinon, Systox, Zolone, and Thiodan were moderately effective. Sevin was relatively ineffective. All insecticides tested in the field severely disrupted the predator complex. Laboratory tests showed all insecticides to be very toxic to Adalia bipunctata and Deraeocoris brevis, although Zolone caused a significantly lower mortality. Samples from a block of trees sprayed twice with Sevin showed higher aphid numbers late in the season than a comparable unsprayed block. This is interpreted as an indication that many aphid problems in commercial orchards are induced by insecticide disruption of natural biological control. Possible solutions to this problem are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 A {{parasitic}} wasp, Trioxys pallidus Haliday (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) was {{imported from}} Europe and initially released against the <b>filbert</b> <b>aphid</b> Mvzocallis coryli (Goetze) in hazelnut (filbert) orchards of the Willamette Valley, Oregon beginning in 1984. In the present study, I investigated the establishment rates of this parasitoid. A total of 13 orchards in 1987 and 30 orchards in 1988 were sampled twice per year. Five to ten trees were selected at random in each orchard and these trees were sampled by collecting and examining ten twigs per tree and counting {{the number of}} aphids and aphid mummies on four leaves per twig. The rate of parasitization was calculated by Total No. of mummies / Total No. of aphids + mummies X 100. Data show that the parasitoid has established in many commercial orchards and out of the total of 3 0 orchards studied eleven had breeding population of Trioxys pallidus and that is rapidly moving to adjoining orchards. The parasitoid appears to have survived the standard insecticide applications in commercial orchards. The level of resistance of a field collected population of Trioxys pallidus to the most commonly used pesticides in the filbert system including Metasystox-R, Pydrin, Zolone, Diazinon, and Lorsban was determined. Adult parasitoid populations continuously exposed to Pydrin (2 sprays per year) and carbaryl (1 spray per year) since 1985, were collected near Corvallis, Benton County, Oregon and their response to various insecticides was assessed. Similar data were collected from a laboratory reared susceptible population which was never exposed to insecticides. Comparasion of LC 50 and LC 95 values showed no significant differences in the susceptibility of these two populations to test insecticides, although build up of some tolerance against Pydrin was evident. The field population required 1. 9 times higher rate than the laboratory population for 50...|$|E
