2500|$|To <b>help</b> <b>display</b> {{its many}} prizes, {{the show has}} {{featured}} several models who were known, during Barker's time on the show, as [...] "Barker's Beauties". Some longer-tenured Barker's Beauties included Kathleen Bradley (1990–2000), Holly Hallstrom (1977–1995), Dian Parkinson (1975–1993), and Janice Pennington (1972–2000). Pennington and Bradley were both dismissed from the program in 2000, allegedly because they had given testimony on Hallstrom's behalf in the wrongful termination litigation she pursued against Barker and the show. Following the departures of Nikki Ziering, Heather Kozar and Claudia Jordan in the 2000s, producers decided to use a rotating cast of models (up to ten) {{until the middle of}} season 37, after which the show reverted to five regular models. Since March 2008, the models include Rachel Reynolds, Amber Lancaster and Gwendolyn Osbourne; Manuela Arbeláez joined the cast in April 2009, replacing Brandi Sherwood and James O'Halloran joined the cast in December 2014. Carey does not use a collective name for the models, but refers to them by name, hoping that the models {{will be able to use}} the show as a [...] "springboard" [...] to further their careers. In a change from previous policy, the models appearing on a given episode are named individually in the show's credits and are formally referred as [...] "The Price Is Right models" [...] when collectively grouped at events. Since season 37, the show often uses a guest model for certain prizes, often crossing over from another CBS property or come courtesy of the company providing the prize. Some such models have been male, especially for musical instruments, tools, trucks and motorcycles, and used in guest appearances during the Showcase. Owing to the traditionally female demographic of daytime television shows, along with the pregnancies of Reynolds and Osbourne, CBS announced that the game show would add a male model for a week during season 41, fitting with other countries with the franchise that have used an occasional male model. The show held an internet search for the man in an online competition that featured Mike Richards, the show's executive producer, Reynolds, Lancaster, Osbourne and Arbeláez serving as judges and mentors during the web series, narrated by Gray. Viewers selected the winner in October 2012. On October 5, 2012, CBS announced that the winner of the male model online competition was Rob Wilson of Boston, Massachusetts. Wilson appeared as a model on episodes through April 15, 2014. This contest was scheduled to be repeated in 2014, with auditions taking place during the FIFA World Cup break between May and July 2014. On December 8, 2014, CBS announced that the winner of the second male model online competition was James O'Halloran.|$|E

50|$|To <b>help</b> <b>display</b> and {{organize}} his Color Theory, Munsell created the Munsell Color System. It {{is set up}} to organize each color by the color's hue, value, and chroma. Each dimension of a color can be changed independently of the other dimensions. This helped Munsell organize the colors in a three-dimensional space, known as the Munsell Color Space. To create this space, Munsell first took the neutral colors, and aligned them vertically, with black {{on the bottom and}} white on the top. In between, the neutral greys were spaced out in equal visual intervals. So, as one moves up in the space, the value of each row increases. Next, Munsell organized the chroma as increasing away from the center. So as one gets farther away from the center, the chroma increases. The hue is positioned at different angles protruding away from the center neutral colors. The distance between each color was visually uniform, because the system was derived from vigorous testing of the human visual response to color. This arrangement turned out {{to be known as the}} Munsell Color Tree.|$|E

5000|$|As was {{highlighted}} by Hadas Mandel and Michael Shalev in their theoretical analysis {{looking at how}} the welfare states shape the gender pay gap, the theories of decommodfication and defamilialization underline the key differences. ‘Decommodification believes in decommodifying labour in order to substitute a workers wage with direct means of income transfers, or indirectly through free or subsidized goods and services (social insurance, cash benefits, public housing, free public services). Defamilialization is the state taking action for care work {{in order to allow}} more females to be able to join the work force as opposed to tending to the family all day’. Both of these theories combine to allow the labour force to grow with a larger female population. The liberal welfare state regime and the social democratic welfare state regime both support these theories. The liberal welfare state looks to encourage the activity of people in a free market economy {{and to be able to}} support themselves with private social and family services. The liberal regime calls for women to join the work force in order to pay for these services and contribute to the economy. The social democratic welfare state believes in universalism which means that government provides public services, and thus allows more women to join the work force. In opposition to both of these regimes, the conservative welfare state mostly rejects decommodification and defamilialization. Conservative beliefs prefer a status differentiating society and value the traditional family roles to maintain that. Thus, women are expected to tend to the family, while men remain the primary breadwinners. To <b>help</b> <b>display</b> the differences that these theories have on the gender pay gap, Hadas Mandel continued his research to discover how welfare state policies effect socio-economic positions. He did so using the Luxembourg Income Study from 21 advanced countries, looking at the gender pay gap with low and high income earners. When it comes to low income earners, the study found that there was not a significant wage gap between men and women in the liberal and social democratic regimes. Where there was a significant wage gap was in social democratic regimes and high income wage earners. The study found that this category of earners had a considerably larger gap than the liberal and conservative regimes for high income earners. Also, as was hypothesized in the study, the conservative welfare state had higher gender wage gaps than the other welfare states with low income earners and still had a recognizable gap with high income earners. The conclusion of the study was that the gender wage gap was determined by the advantage or disadvantage mothers faced with the welfare states interference. A similar study done by Solomon Polachek and Jun Xiang, used the same Luxembourg Income Study, but looked at different factors that influence the gender income wage gaps. This study concluded that fertility rate, age gap between spouses in their first marriage, and the top marginal income tax rate are all factors which correlate with the results. This states that there are external social factors which influence the pay gap between men and women, as well as the institutional factors which were noted previously.|$|E

This calculation is based on the real-option theory, applied to drug development questions. Simple decision analyses suffice to determine the best sequence of research projects, and detailed pharmaco-economic models are unnecessary for this purpose.

40|$|Sometimes {{documentation}} {{only available}} for the post delivery maintenance is the source code itself. This happens all too frequently when maintaining legacy systems, i. e. software in current use but developed not earlier than 15 or 20 years. Under these circumstances, maintaining the code can be extremely difficult. One way of handling this problem is to start with source code and attempt to recreate the design documents or even the specifications. This process is called Reverse Engineering. CASE tools can assist with this process. One of the simplest is a pretty printer, which may <b>help</b> <b>display</b> the code more clearly. Other tools construct diagrams such as flow charts or UML diagrams, directly from the source code, these visual aids can help {{in the process of}} design recovery.

The process of forward engineering and reverse engineering combinely called as roundtrip engineering. This paper explains about how it can be achieved using UML with Rational Rose and JAV...|$|E
30|$|Apart from {{molecular}} methods {{based on}} whole genome sequences of MTB, signal processing of complete genomic sequences can <b>help</b> <b>display</b> and explore structural patterns {{capable of being}} interpreted and compared. Graphical representations obtained from signal processing methods can {{provide insight into the}} evolution, structure and function of genomes (Anastassiou 2000). With the huge amount of genomic data available after the completion of genome sequencing projects, rapid analysis of genomic data is possible using signal processing methods. These methods help characterize DNA sequences by distinct visual patterns using graphical representations in comparison to conventional laboratory methods (Cristea et al. 2007; Nandy et al. 2006). Several graphical approaches for genomic sequence analysis such as DNA walks (Berger et al. 2003), Z-curves (Zhang et al. 2003), Fourier transforms, phase analysis (Cristea 2003) and wavelet transforms (Lorenzo-Ginori et al. 2009) have been reported in literature. DNA walk {{has been used as a}} tool to visualise changes in nucleotide composition, locating coding and non coding regions, identifying periodicities and large scale local and global features present in many genomes (Li’O 2003; Haimovich et al. 2006). Fourier transforms have been used to determine periodicities in proteins, identification of protein coding DNA regions and open reading frames (Zhou et al. 2007). Z-curves have been used in identifying replication origins of archaeal genomes (Zhang and Zhang 2005). Phase analysis has been used to report the existence of global helicoidal wrapping of DNA sequences (Cristea 2003), determining pathogen drug resistance in HIV, H 5 N 1 (Cristea 2006).|$|E
