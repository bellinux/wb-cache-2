40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} the coercive force and Vickers hardness for cold-rolled and thermally aged Fe–Cu alloys with varying isothermal aging times. Fe– 1 wt% Cu alloys were cold-rolled and then thermally aged at 553 or 773 K from 0 to 104 min. The coercive force for the cold-rolled specimen decreases with <b>increasing</b> <b>aging</b> time, and the slope of the reduction becomes higher with <b>increasing</b> <b>aging</b> temperature. The recovery process contributes to the change in the coercive force.

30|$|The same {{phenomenon}} {{was also}} found in experiments on Al-Cu brazed joints by Feng and Xue (2013). Their work showed that the intermetallic layer grew with <b>increase</b> in <b>ageing</b> time. In addition, the shear strength decreased with <b>increased</b> <b>ageing</b> time, due to growth in the intermetallic compound thickness. It was noted that Al-Cu brazed joints formed with a Zn- 22 Al- 0.05 Ce filler metal had higher shear strength compared to those formed with a Zn- 22 Al filler metal. With a nominal ageing time, the joint had a ductile fracture mode; however, <b>increased</b> <b>ageing</b> time changed the joint to brittle fracture mode.|$|R
5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the <b>increasing</b> <b>age</b> and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his <b>increasing</b> <b>age</b> and {{the wear}} {{catching}} places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping {{to keep him}} fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, <b>increasing</b> <b>age,</b> and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} consistently {{shows that}} with <b>increased</b> <b>age,</b> movements {{tend to become}} slower (or decrease in dexterity). Some papers suggest that the relationship results from reduced strength with <b>increased</b> <b>age,</b> as there is good evidence that strength also reduces with <b>increased</b> <b>age.</b> Surprisingly, {{it appears that the}} relationship between age, strength and movement dexterity has received little investigation, especially using accurate movement recording methods for upper‐limb actions. In the data reported here, we tested 107 adults between 18 and 86 years of age on a variety of fine motor ability movement dexterity measures. In each dependent measure, we first tested the relationships between: (i) age and strength; (ii) age and movement performance, and; (iii) strength and movement performance, and then use multiple linear regression models to determine which of age and strength accounts for the greater variance. The results showed clear relationships between <b>increased</b> <b>age</b> and decreased strength, <b>increased</b> <b>age</b> and reduced movement performance, and decreased strength and reduced movement performance. Standard multiple linear regression analyses showed that both age and strength made significant contributions to the data variance. Moreover, post‐hoc analyses showed that age explained more of the variance for steadiness and line tracking movement tasks, whereas strength explained more of the variance for aiming and tapping movement tasks. The data are discussed in terms of the relationships between age and strength on the resultant movement performance, and the importance of measuring strength when considering the effects of age on dexterity and movement performance...|$|R
40|$|In the {{scientific}} literature, {{there is much}} evidence of a relationship between age and dexteri-ty, where <b>increased</b> <b>age</b> is related to slower, less nimble and less smooth, less coordinated and less controlled performances. While some suggest that the relationship is a direct con-sequence of reduced muscle strength associated to <b>increased</b> <b>age,</b> {{there is a lack}} of re-search that has systematically investigated the relationships between age, strength and hand dexterity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between age, grip strength and dexterity. 107 adults (range 18 - 93 years) completed a series of hand dexterity tasks (i. e. steadiness, line tracking, aiming, and tapping) and a test of maximal grip strength. We performed three phases of analyses. Firstly, we evaluated the simple relation-ships between pairs of variables; replicating the existing literature; and found significant re-lationships of <b>increased</b> <b>age</b> and reduced strength; <b>increased</b> <b>age</b> and reduced dexterity, and; reduced strength and reduced dexterity.

Tender cuts were cooked by a dry heat method, and less tender cuts were cooked by moist heat methods. A trained panel (n= 10) evaluated sensory quality characteristics including initial and sustained juiciness, aroma and flavour.

5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} {{at the edge of}} lakes in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With <b>increasing</b> <b>age,</b> however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with <b>increasing</b> <b>age.</b> In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do.

Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the <b>increasing</b> <b>age</b> of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E

5|$|Kilner {{began the}} 1920 season with an innings of 206 not {{out in his}} first match, against Derbyshire, and the effort {{remained}} the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two sixes. He could have been caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his driving and pulling being particularly effective. Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season Scarborough Festival, he played for CI Thornton's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side which visited Australia in the winter—at the time, the MCC administered English cricket, and the England team toured under its name. In total, he scored 1,316 runs {{at an average of}} 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages. With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high. The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners. Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main slow left-arm spinner. Conscious of his <b>increasing</b> <b>age,</b> the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the best option and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin. Consequently, during the winter, Kilner practised bowling in the yard of the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord. Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the effects of an {{educational}} intervention on the aging knowledge of graduate counseling students. Overcoming misconceptions, such as positive and negative stereotypes about older adults, is essential for graduate counseling students to be effectively trained to work with the aging population. Educational interventions have been found to be the most consistently effective way of <b>increasing</b> <b>aging</b> knowledge and helping individuals overcome ageist beliefs rooted in faulty aging knowledge. For this study, it was hypothesized that a comprehensive educational intervention (approximately 2 hours in duration) would <b>increase</b> overall <b>aging</b> knowledge, <b>increase</b> <b>aging</b> and mental health knowledge, and lower levels of negative aging bias; moreover, this study hypothesized that adding a structured discussion (approximately 20 minutes in duration) after the educational intervention would further <b>increase</b> overall <b>aging</b> knowledge and overall aging and mental health knowledge and further reduce levels of negative aging bias. In addition, it was hypothesized that students who received the educational intervention or the educational intervention with structured discussion would be better able to process three exploratory aging related vignettes than the group of students who received no educational intervention. The findings of this study suggest that the use of an educational intervention alone may not be enough to <b>increase</b> overall <b>aging</b> knowledge, <b>increase</b> <b>aging</b> and mental health knowledge, and decrease negative aging bias among graduate counseling students. However, it does appear that adding a structured discussion to an educational intervention is an easy way to produce superior results. In addition, it does not appear that using a short-term educational intervention, with or without structured discussion, is enough to impart the level of aging knowledge to graduate counseling students for them to be able to do more complicated tasks, such as processing an aging related vignette using factual knowledge...|$|R
