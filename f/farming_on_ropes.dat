25|$|Survival for sponges <b>farmed</b> <b>on</b> <b>ropes</b> is {{generally}} lower as unrecoverable damage occurs to the explant when ‘threading’ onto the rope takes place. Furthermore, sponges cultured <b>on</b> the <b>rope</b> {{have the potential}} to be torn off the rope during storms as water flow increases significantly, or grow away from the rope and form an unmarketable, low value, characteristic doughnut shaped sponge. Differences in sponge growth and health do occur within species characterised by variations in regenerative ability, susceptibility to infection after cutting, hardiness and growth potential.|$|R
40|$|Seaweed {{represents}} a valuable, underused sustainable resource. Current investment in seaweed farming will provide {{large quantities of}} biomaterial {{for a range of}} applications. The major focus of this thesis is on a class of polyphenols known as phlorotannin, of interest for their antioxidant and biomedical applications. Seaweed polyphenols have strong radical scavenging properties. Whilst there are many reported extraction methods for phlorotannin, it was not clear how different solvent systems affect the antioxidant capacity of the phlorotannin extracted. This work represents the first comparable study of its kind in which phlorotannin was isolated from seaweed using several extraction solvents and the antioxidant capacity evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging assay. The structural profile and radical scavenging capacity of the phlorotannin did not change between the extracts. Water and ethanol-water mixtures were found to be the most suitable solvents for large-scale extraction of phlorotannin. The first study on the seasonal variation in phenolic content of industrially <b>farmed</b> seaweed grown <b>on</b> <b>ropes</b> was performed. The phenolic content of the two species studied, Fucus vesiculosus and Ascophyllum nodosum varied between 4 - 9...|$|R

In spite of the many advantages the technology did not find many takers.
