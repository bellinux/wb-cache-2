The relationship between photosynthetic gas exchange rate and measured physiological responses was analyzed. In addition,the soil moisture and the physi-chemical analysis of different cover plots were tested to explain {{the improvement of the}} soil property by vegetation covering. The results are summarized as follows: Acacia confusa and Eupatorium ambile have higher transpiration rates in the rainy season, so their soil moistures are lower than the other two. Among thefour species, the pennistum setsum cover plot has the highest soil moisture. The Rhus semialata and Eupatorium ambile have higher soil moisture in the dry season (11. 85 %﹑ 11. 89 %), while Acacia confusa group has the lowest (8. 63 %). The water-use <b>effeciencies</b> (WUE) in the dry season were higher (about 160 %) than that in the rainy season. It shows the adaptive response to the drought stress in mudstone area. Acacia confusa and Pennisetum setosum have higher relative net photosynthetic rates in the dry season. This implies that they still grow well in drought condition. Light-photosynthesis curve of the four selected plants were hyperbolic forms. Among the four plant species, Pennisetum setosum and Rhus semialata have higher light-saturation point than the other two plant species. Rhus semialata which can stand to coldness and high temperature ﹐belongs to wide-temperature-adapted type plant. Both Pennisetum setosum and Rhus semialata had more toleranceto high temperature. The water-use <b>effeciencies</b> (WUE) of four tested plant species decreased with increasing temperature. The leaf effective quantum yieldof photosystem II (yield) decreased during the water withholding process. Acacia cofusa is treated as drought resistant plants due to lower water moisture of the yield critical point. The photosynthetic gas exchange rates were greatly influenced by the light intensity in the field. The transpiration rate increased with light intensity, leaf temperature; however, it was little influenced by vapour pressure deficit. Based on multiple regression analysis, the transpiration rates could be estimated by the meteorological factors measured in the field. The pH values of different cover plots are lower than those of the nakedegarea. The organic matter contents of cover plots under the four plant groups are between 1. 6 ~ 1. 9 %, which are higher than those of the naked area. Especially, The organic matter content of the soil under Rhus semialata groups is the highest. The contents of sand under plant groups are higher than those of nakedarea, while the content of silt decreased. Whether the change of texture are influenced by covering vegetation or by vegetation engineering needs to be further studied. 摘 要 高雄縣旗山鎮古亭坑之泥岩地區﹐其氣候乾濕季節分明﹐旱季長達五個月 ﹐且地質結構 不良﹐致植物難以生長。本研究於該地區經植物生態調查 後﹐選取牧地狼尾草﹑山鹽菁﹑相思樹及腺葉澤蘭等四種植物﹐測定惡地 環境下各種植物之生理季節變化﹐分析其與各項因子之相關性﹐並於同化 箱中進行光合成氣體交換特性對不同光度﹑溫度之反應性研究。另分析各 植物群落立地土層之理化性質及土層含水量﹐以探討植物群落與邊坡之關 係﹐進而了解植 物於泥岩之適應性。茲將結果摘錄如下﹕ 由野外試驗調查得知﹐雨季 時以腺葉澤蘭﹑相思樹之蒸散率較大 (13. 06 mmolm- 2 s- 1 ﹑ 11. 48 mmolm- 2 s- 1) ﹐致泥岩風化層中(5 ~ 15 cm) 之水分較低﹐而牧地狼尾草生長區之蒸散 率較小(8. 48 mmolm- 2 s- 1) 風化層中之水分最高(15. 43 %) 。旱季時(11 月 29 日) ﹐山鹽菁﹑腺葉澤蘭兩種植物之立地土層仍保持 12 %之含水量﹐而相思 樹群落之立地土層含水量為最低為 8. 63 %。而旱季時﹐用水效率均較雨季 時高﹐約為其 160 %以上﹔顯示此四種植物均具對泥岩惡地環境之適應性反 應。若以植物生長活力之觀點﹐則以牧地狼尾草﹑相思樹在旱季時之影響 較小﹐其光合成能力仍維持雨季之 80 %左右﹐顯二種植物於泥岩惡劣環境 中之適合性良好。 四種供試植物之光-光合成曲線均具有典型之雙曲線反應﹐但其中山鹽菁 ﹑相思樹兩種植物之光飽和點較高。對葉片溫度之反應性而言﹐高溫或低 溫對山鹽菁之影響較小﹐屬於廣適溫性植物。牧地狼尾草﹑山鹽菁則較能 適應高溫(38 OC) 環境﹔但各植物在 40 OC即有生理障礙出現﹐各淨光合成 率均大幅下降。用水效率均隨葉溫增加而逐漸降低﹐顯示當溫度升高時﹐ 植物的用水效率越低﹐ 38 OC之測值僅為 30 OC時之 56 ~ 69 %﹐但其中以牧地 狼尾草之用水效率受高溫之影響較小(69 %) 。植物於斷水環境下進行螢光 測定反應時發現﹐相思樹於土壤水分 9. 72 %時﹐方產生測值變化之情形﹐ 顯示其忍受乾旱能力較強。而山鹽菁﹑牧地狼尾草耐 旱力次之﹐腺 葉澤蘭最差。 在三個主要氣象因子中(光度﹐葉溫﹐蒸氣壓差) ﹐以光度對光合成率之影 響較大﹐為野外環境因子中影響最大者。蒸散率與葉溫﹑光度呈有顯著正 相關﹐與蒸氣壓差則不明顯﹐依複迴歸之分析﹐可得野外蒸散率之估算式 。 裸露坡面經植生覆蓋後﹐各植物生長區表層土之pH值﹐都呈現下降之趨勢 ﹐其中腺葉澤 蘭生長區降值最大﹔各植生區之有機植含量有比裸露地增 多之趨勢﹐其有機質含量約介於 1. 6 ~ 1. 9 %之間﹐其中又以山鹽菁生長區有 機質含量較高。各植生區之砂土顆粒含量均較裸露地為高﹐而坋土顆粒含 量則有明顯降低之現象﹐黏土顆粒之變化則不甚明顯。此種質地之變化情 形是否為植被生長之影響﹐或植生工程之因素﹐尚待進一步研究...|$|R

40|$|Rhizospheric {{microbial}} composition {{plays an}} important role in plant growth and nutrient metabolism. Under the effect of root exudates, soil in rhizosphere is different from bulk soil in its microbial composition and functions from bulk soil. Effect of root exudates on microbial communities had been investigated by various researchers, still leaving a gap in study of effect on functions related to soil. One such important soil function is proteolysis. Proteases and peptidases are important enzymes that bring about N mineralization and in turn N uptake to facilitate plant growth and development. Understanding of the relationship between soil microbial communities expressing protease activity and nitrogen in the rhizosphere is still a challenge, due to the difficulties of sampling the rhizosphere microenvironment. This study investigated the interplay of plant nitrogen utilizing efficiency with N mineralization brought about by proteolysis with special focus on bacterial extracellular soil proteases. We studied changes in the biochemical activity and microbial community structure in the rhizosphere of the inbred maize (Zea mais L.) lines Lo 5 and T 250 characterized by high and low Nitrogen utilizing <b>effeciencies</b> (NUE) using rhizobox experiments. Plants were regularly regularly monitored for the inorganic N (NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N) concentration in the rhizosphere by ion selective electrodes (ISE). At the stage of N depletion soil was sampled from rhizosphere and bulk compartments. Cellular biomass was estimated as a measure of ATP and protease activity was assayed as a measure on caseinate hydrolysis. Soil DNA was extracted and was used for molecular studies. Two bacterial genes coding for alkaline proteases (apr) and neutral protease (npr) were selected for studies. Bacterial gene abundance was measured using qPCR. To study diversity of these genes, amplicons were sequenced by Illumina high-throughput technology. Plant L 05 with higher NUE, had shown a significant difference in the rhizospheric and bulk cellular biomass, whereas plant T 250 with lower NUE showed no significant differences in the biomass content in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Proteolytic soil potential of plant L 05 was found to be higher than that of T 250. Furthermore abundance of genes apr and npr and their diversities, as indicated by qPCR and sequencing results respectively were favored by the higher NUE of L 05 maize line. Analyses of several million apr and npr amplicons revealed a high diversity of proteases genes in soil and rhizosphere, with many sequences that are still unknown according to current sequences database information...|$|R
