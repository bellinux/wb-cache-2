2500|$|The {{left hand}} determines the {{sounding}} {{length of the}} string, and thus the pitch of the string, by [...] "stopping" [...] it (pressing it) against the fingerboard with the fingertips, producing different pitches. As the violin has no frets to stop the strings, as is usual with the guitar, the player must know exactly where to place the fingers on the strings to play with good intonation (tuning). Beginning violinists play open strings and the lowest position, nearest to the nut. Students often start with relatively easy keys, such as A Major and G major. Students are taught scales and simple melodies. Through practice of scales and arpeggios and ear training, the violinist's left hand eventually [...] "finds" [...] the notes intuitively by muscle memory. The player must correct the intonation by ear. After determining that a fingered note is too sharp, the player must subtly make the note flatter by making an alteration of the finger angle (or {{in the case of}} being significantly sharp, moving the finger to a flatter, and thus correct, pitch). If the player determines that a fingered note is too flat, the pitch is raised by altering the <b>finger</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{good example}} of seam bowling {{technique}} are the fast bowlers Courtney Walsh & Curtly Ambrose. [...] Close-up camera work of the following descriptions can be viewed for example at:. [...] Both Walsh & Ambrose used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand. [...] However, significantly, their choice of <b>finger</b> <b>position</b> causes the ball to exhibit precession (similar to a gyroscope), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o'clock & 7 o'clock position (if viewed {{from the bottom of}} the seam). [...] This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between outswing & inswing seam positions through the air). [...] Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate). [...] However, when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 5 o'clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batsman), when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 7 o'clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batsman). [...] It can be seen that only rarely would the ball be at the purely 6 o'clock position to continue completely straight after pitching. [...] This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the pitch surface.|$|E

Following Goldenberg (1999), we propose that difficulties with body part orientation may underlie problems in meaningless gesture imitation...|$|R

40|$|This three-part {{appendix}} {{contains the}} results of experiments measuring the effectiveness of different categories of fusion: multi-modal (finger and face), multi-instance (multiple <b>finger</b> <b>positions),</b> multi-matcher, and multi-sample (multiple enrollments). Appendix B. 1 : Score-Level Fusion of Face and Multiple Fingerprints This is {{an analysis of the}} effectiveness of multi-modal (finger and face) and multi-instance (multiple <b>finger</b> <b>positions)</b> score-level fusion, focusing {{on the extent to which}} different biometric modalities and instances are independent, and the effect of that independence on the accuracy of fusion. It includes detailed analyses of the effects of fusing scores from varying combinations of fingers, and the effect of fusing face and fingerprint scores. This paper provides large-scale empirical evidence that score-level fusion using multiple <b>finger</b> <b>positions</b> is highly effective, as is fusion of fingers and face: fusing two fingerprints or one fingerprint and face generally resulted in a 50 - 90 % reduction in false reject rate (FRR) relative to the stronger of the two inputs at a constant false accept rate (FAR). Appendix B. 2 : Score-Level Fusion of Multiple Matchers This is an analysis of the effectiveness of score-level matcher fusion, in which multiple matchers produced scores from comparisons of the same pairs of images.
