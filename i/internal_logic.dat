Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the <b>internal</b> <b>logic</b> of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E

25|$|By {{locating}} {{the conditions of}} rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the <b>internal</b> <b>logic</b> {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.|$|E

McCarthy believed the concept ensured the film was [...] "amusing and plausible" [...] for its first half, but that the second half was full of illogical story developments and missed opportunities. Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter said that the opening established the premise well, but that the film came undone when it began to alternate between comedy and tragedy, and introduced a backstory for Hancock that did not make sense. He said it rewrote its own <b>internal</b> <b>logic</b> in order to pander to its audience. Stephen Hunter in The Washington Post said it had begun with promise, but that the change in tone partway through was so abrupt that the film did not recover. Jim Schembri of The Age called the change in direction [...] "an absolute killer story twist", and David Denby of The New Yorker said it lifted the film {{to a new level}} by supplementing the jokes with sexual tension and emotional power.|$|E

Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman {{in a lot of different}} ways.

After this, he decided on the core of the game's story, and created a flowchart based on it, which became the [...] "bone structure of the story". According to Uchikoshi, it did not matter that the setups of the games were far-fetched, as long as their <b>internal</b> <b>logic</b> worked; he said {{that as long as the}} story is interesting and immersive, implausible situations feel plausible to the player. On the other hand, he felt that if he had specifically tried to make it more plausible, by forcing explanations that justify the situations, the story would become boring and the implausible would look even more implausible. Instead, he chose to rely on players' imagination, saying that players can make things seem plausible in ways he had not even imagined himself. One thing he did to make the stories more believable was adding concepts such as SchrÃ¶dinger's cat, which he felt added flavor and kept players wondering whether a particular concept could be the main idea of the game; he felt that when players wonder that, it makes the story feel more real, as they create the game world in their minds.|$|E
