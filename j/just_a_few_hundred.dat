5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern North Pacific Ocean on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about 230miles (370km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. Early on June 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as 60mph (95km/h) <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> feet above the surface, towards {{the east side of the}} system.|$|E

Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh.

40|$|Abstract—Nanotechnology is {{enabling}} {{the development of}} sensing devices <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of nanometers in size, which are able to measure new types {{of events in the}} nanoscale by exploiting the properties of novel nanomaterials. Wireless communication among these nanosensors will boost the range of applications of nanotechnology in the biomedical, environmental and military fields, amongst others. Within the different alternatives for communication in the nanoscale, recent advancements in nanomaterials point to the Terahertz band (0. 1 - 10. 0 THz) as the frequency range of operation of future electronic nanodevices. This still unlicensed band can theoretically support very large transmission bit-rates in the short range, i. e., for distances below one meter. More importantly, the Terahertz band also enables very simple communication mechanisms suited to the very limited capabilities of nanosensors. In this paper, a new communication paradigm called TS-OOK (Time Spread On-Off Keying) for Electromagnetic Wireless Nanosensor Networks (WNSNs) is presented. This new technique is based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses by following an onoff keying modulation spread in time. The performance of this scheme is assessed in terms of information capacity for the singleuser case as well as aggregated network capacity for the multiuser case. The results show that by exploiting the peculiarities of the Terahertz band, this scheme provides a very simple but robust communication technique for WNSNs. Moreover, it is shown that, due to the peculiar behavior of the noise in the Terahertz band, the single-user capacity and the aggregated network capacity can exceed those of the AWGN channel classical wireless networks, when the appropriate channel codes are used...|$|R
