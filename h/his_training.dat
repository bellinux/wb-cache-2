5000|$|Sam, however, {{rides on}} ahead of Bugs and boards another {{locomotive}} to hit Bugs' green-painted 4-4-0 American type steam engine with a tender (#791). Thinking {{this will make}} Bugs stop, Sam calls out to Bugs to stop <b>his</b> <b>train</b> because he's got {{one of his own}} (a tender-less 4-2-0 red locomotive, #99). Bugs, instead, calls out to Sam to stop <b>his</b> <b>train.</b> Both openly state that neither will stop their train unless the other stops his first. Thinking Bugs wants to play dirty, Sam tells Bugs they'll see who stops their train first when they crash and advances the regulator in his locomotive. Bugs accepts this duel and advances the regulator of the engine in <b>his</b> <b>train.</b> As both trains rush towards each other head on, Sam keeps a stern face and Bugs remains calm. Almost to collision, Sam considers blowing his locomotive's whistle, but instead ducks down to wait for the crash. Bugs, however, extends the [...] "legs" [...] on the cars of <b>his</b> <b>train</b> so that Sam's passes harmlessly underneath. Just as Sam gets up and wonders why there was no crash, he spots a sign reading [...] "End of Line" [...] and <b>his</b> <b>train</b> falls off an unfinished trestle bridge and into a lake below.|$|R
