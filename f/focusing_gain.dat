40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new focusing technique for localization of wideband signals. Relaxing the unitary as-sumption for the focusing matrices, we formulate the least-square (LS) and the total least-square (TLS) coherent signal-subspace methods. The TLS is {{an alternative to the}} conventional LS and uses the fact that the errors can exist both in the focusing location matrix {{as well as in the}} estimated location matrix at a given frequency bin. To prevent the focusing loss, we use a class of focusing matrices that are constant under multiplication by their Hermitian transpose. The class of unitary matrices comports with this property. We then develop a new focusing technique based on a modification to the TLS (MTLS). It is shown that the computational complexity of the new technique is significantly lower than that for the rotational signal-subspace method (RSS). The <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> of the new technique is also larger than the <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> of the RSS algorithm. The simulation study shows that, compared with the RSS, the new algorithm has a smaller resolution signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). I...|$|E

An alternative calibration target is a point scatterer and we show theoretically and experimentally that this waveform is the double time differential of the flat-plate response.

40|$|International audienceReceive Antenna Shift Keying (RASK) is a Spatial Modulation (SM) {{transmission}} {{scheme that}} {{has recently been}} under study because of its low detection complexity {{and its ability to}} increase the spectral efficiency when combined with classical IQ modulation schemes. The idea is that the transmitter uses a focusing technique to target one of the receive antennas. The transmitted information is coded depending on the index of the receive antenna that have been targeted. Note that in this case, the sent signal does not contain any information, that's why RASK can be combined with any classical IQ modulation. Different focusing techniques could be used to target a receive antenna. In this study, the Time Reversal preprocessing technique is used at the transmitter side. In this paper, theoretical performance of the Bit Error Rate and of the <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> are established for the RASK scheme in a MIMO Line-of-Sight configuration with two receive antennas.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) imaging methods based on backscatter coefficient (BSC) estimates is to obtain system-independent structural information about samples. In the current study, three BSC estimation methods were compared and evaluated using the same backscattered pressure datasets {{in order to assess}} their consistency. BSC estimates were obtained from two phantoms with embedded glass spheres and compared to theoretical BSCs calculated using size distributions estimated using optical microscopy. Effective scatterer diameter and concentration estimates of the glass spheres were also obtained from the estimated BSCs. One estimation method needed to be compensated by more than an order of magnitude in amplitude in order to produce BSCs comparable to the other two methods. All calibration methods introduced different frequency-dependent effects, which could have noticeable effects on the bias of QUS estimates derived from experimental BSCs. Although in most cases the experimental QUS estimates obtained with all three methods were observed to differ by less than 10 %, larger differences are expected depending on both the pressure <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> of the transducer (proportional to the ratio of the square of the aperture radius to the product of the wavelength and focal length) and ka range used in the estimation...|$|E
40|$|The higher {{performance}} of relaxor-based piezocrystals compared with piezoceramics is now well established, notably including improved gain-bandwidth product, and these materials {{have been adopted}} widely for biomedical ultrasound imaging. However, their use in other applications, for example {{as a source of}} focused ultrasound for targeted drug delivery, is hindered in several ways. One of the issues, which we consider here, is in shaping the material into the spherical geometries used widely in focused ultrasound. Unlike isotropic unpoled piezoceramics that can be shaped into a monolithic bowl then poled through the thickness, the anisotropic structure of piezocrystals make it impossible to machine the bulk crystalline material into a bowl without sacrificing performance. Instead, we report a novel faceted array, inspired by the geodesic dome structure in architecture, which utilizes flat piezocrystal material and maximizes fill factor. Aided by 3 D printing, a prototype with f# ≈ 1. 2, containing 96 individually addressable elements was manufactured using 1 - 3 connectivity PMN-PT piezocrystal - epoxy composite. The fabrication process is presented and the array was connected to a 32 -channel controller to shape and steer the beam for preliminary performance demonstration. At an operating frequency of 1 MHz, a <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> around 30 was achieved and the side lobe intensities were all at levels below - 12 dB compared to main beam.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Biomedical Engineering. Advisor: Emad Ebbini. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 100 pages. Focused ultrasound (FUS) {{has been proposed}} {{for a variety of}} minimally invasive therapeutic applications, including tumor ablation, neuromodulation, targeted drug delivery and blood brain barrier opening. To date, FUS beams have been primarily monitored through MR and ultrasound diagnostic imaging modalities. The recent introduction of real-time dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) systems offers a new paradigm for the guidance of therapeutic focused ultrasound. The DMUA approach allows for inherent registration between the therapeutic and imaging coordinate systems. In this thesis we investigated the use of ultrasound-based thermography to assess FUS-tissue interactions. Specifically, we focused on two aspects of image-guided therapy: 1) monitoring and localization of FUS-tissue interactions, and 2) tissue damage assessment. Towards this end, we presented first experimental results of ultrasound-guided transcranial FUS in a rat brain, both ex vivo and in vivo. DMUA imaging was used to monitor and localize FUS-tissue thermal interactions in real-time. The transcranial echo data allowed for a reliable estimation of temperature change in brain tissue, which had never been done before using ultrasound image guidance. Despite some measurable distortion and loss in <b>focusing</b> <b>gain,</b> transcranial FUS beams at 3. 2 MHz were localized axially and laterally. This confirms the results obtained using DMUA-based transcranial ultrasound thermography. A high degree of focusing with the DMUA was then successfully leveraged to perform localized tissue damage assessment in both ex vivo and in vivo. The experimental results presented in this thesis demonstrate some of the unique aspects of image guidance using DMUAs, especially when FUS is subject to significant distortions as in transcranial applications...|$|E

40|$|Shock wave therapy (SWT) {{refers to}} the use of focused shock waves for {{treatment}} of musculoskeletal indications including plantar fascitis and dystrophic mineralization of tendons and joint capsules. Measurements were made of a SWT device that uses a ballistic source. The ballistic source consists of a handpiece within which compressed air (1 - 4 bar) is used to fire a projectile that strikes a metal applicator placed on the skin. The projectile generates stress waves in the applicator that transmit as pressure waves into tissue. The acoustic fields from two applicators were measured: one applicator was 15 mm in diameter and the surface slightly convex and the second was 12 mm in diameter the surface was concave. Measurements were made in a water tank and both applicators generated a similar pressure pulse consisting of a rectangular positive phase (4 micros duration and up to 8 MPa peak pressure) followed by a predominantly negative tail (duration of 20 micros and peak negative pressure of - 6 MPa), with many oscillations. The rise times of the waveforms were around 1 micros and were shown to be too long for the pulses to be considered shock waves. Measurements of the field indicated that region of high pressure was restricted to the near-field (20 - 40 mm) of the source and was consistent with the Rayleigh distance. The measured acoustic field did not display focusing supported by calculations, which demonstrated that the radius of curvature of the concave surface was too large to effect a <b>focusing</b> <b>gain.</b> Other SWT devices use electrohydraulic, electromagnetic and piezoelectric sources that do result in focused shock waves. This difference in the acoustic fields means there is potentially a significant mechanistic difference between a ballistic source and other SWT devices...|$|E
30|$|In that perspective, time {{reversal}} (TR) recently {{appeared as}} a strong candidate for MISO transmissions because it relies on a simple preprocessing technique {{for any number of}} transmit antennas and involves very simple receivers even considering frequency-selective channels. This technique is different from SVD, MRT, or EGT because of the way of weighting the precoding factors over the frequency dimension as it is further detailed in the paper. Moreover, TR benefits from spatial and temporal focusing properties as firstly demonstrated in the ultrasound and underwater acoustics[7] and more recently experimented in wireless communications[8 – 11]. Pioneer works of Paulraj et al. have namely shown that the richer the scattering environment, the better the time and focusing gains[12]. In UWB systems for instance, TR is suitable as a simple and efficient prefiltering technique for pulse amplitude modulation[13 – 15] since it is realized over large frequency bandwidths. For systems addressing narrower bandwidths and hereby playing with less rich propagation conditions, the so-called rate back-off or oversampling strategies can be used to compensate for some <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> degradation[16, 17]. An interesting alternative rather consists in getting the environment richness back from frequency to space by increasing the number of transmit antennas[12]. However, for practical system design where the frequency bandwidth and the size of antenna arrays are limited, imperfect time focusing is likely to be encountered, preventing from a sufficient mitigation of the channel time dispersions. Multicarrier systems such as OFDM are commonly used to deal with time-dispersive channels and can be combined with TR to accommodate any residual intersymbol interference (ISI). The combination of TR and OFDM has recently been studied in[18] and[19] and has been proven to allow designing of simple and efficient MISO-OFDM systems. The fact that TR can be considered as a particular precoding technique of OFDM signals makes it necessary and interesting to be compared with the conventional state-of-the-art MISO-OFDM precoding systems previously mentioned.|$|E
40|$|High-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} {{is a form}} {{of therapeutic}} ultrasound which uses high amplitude acoustic waves to heat and ablate tissue. HIFU employs acoustic amplitudes that are high enough that nonlinear propagation effects are important {{in the evolution of the}} sound field. A common model for HIFU beams is the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov (KZK) equation which accounts for nonlinearity, diffraction, and absorption. The KZK equation models diffraction using the parabolic or paraxial approximation. Many HIFU sources have an aperture diameter similar to the focal length and the paraxial approximation may not be appropriate. Here, results obtained using the “Texas code,” a time-domain numerical solution to the KZK equation, were used to assess when the KZK equation can be employed. In a linear water case comparison with the O’Neil solution, the KZK equation accurately predicts the pressure field in the focal region. The KZK equation was also compared to simulations of the exact fluid dynamics equations (no paraxial approximation). The exact equations were solved using the Fourier-Continuation (FC) method to approximate derivatives in the equations. Results have been obtained for a focused HIFU source in tissue. For a low <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> transducer (focal length 50 λ and radius 10 λ), the KZK and FC models showed excellent agreement, however, as the source radius was increased to 30 λ, discrepancies started to appear. Modeling was extended to the case of tissue with the appropriate power law using a relaxation model. The relaxation model resulted in a higher peak pressure and a shift in the location of the peak pressure, highlighting the importance of employing the correct attenuation model. Simulations from the code that were compared to experimental data in water showed good agreement through the focal plane.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Electrical/Computer Engineering. Advisor: Emad S. Ebbini. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 126 pages, appendix A. Image-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) {{is becoming increasingly}} accepted {{as a form of}} noninvasive ablative therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer, uterine fibroids and other tissue abnormalities. In principle, HIFU beams can be focused within small volumes which results in forming precise lesions within the target volume (e. g. tumor, atherosclerotic plaque) while sparing the intervening tissue. With this precision, HIFU offers the promise of noninvasive tumor therapy. The goal of this thesis is to develop an image-guidance mode with an interactive image-based computational modeling of tissue response to HIFU. This model could be used in treatment planning and post-treatment retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome(s). Within the context of treatment planning, the challenge of using HIFU to target tumors in organs partially obscured by the rib cage are addressed. Ribs distort HIFU beams in a manner that reduces the <b>focusing</b> <b>gain</b> at the target (tumor) and could cause a treatment-limiting collateral damage. We present a refocusing algorithms to efficiently steer higher power towards the target while limiting power deposition on the ribs, improving the safety and efficacy of tumor ablation. Our approach is based on an approximation of a non-convex to a convex optimization known as the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. An important advantage of the SDR method over previously proposed optimization methods is the explicit control of the sidelobes in the focal plane. A finite-difference time domain (FDTD) heterogeneous propagation model of a 1 -MHz concave phased array was used to model the acoustic propagation and temperature simulations in different tissues including ribs. The numerical methods developed for the refocusing problem are also used for retrospective analysis of targeting of atherosclerotic plaques using HIFU. Cases were simulated where seven adjacent HIFU shots ($~ 5000 W/cm^ 2, 2 $sec exposure time) were focused at the plaque tissue within the posterior wall of external femoral artery. After segmentation of the ultrasound image obtained for the treatment region in-vivo, we integrated this anatomical information into our simulation to account for different parameters that may be caused by these multi-region anatomical complexities. An FDTD heterogeneous model was used for both acoustic field and temperature computations. The acoustic field simulation considered a concave (40 -mm radius of curvature) 32 -element array operating at 3. 5 MHz. To account for the blood flow {{in the vicinity of the}} target (plaque), we have used a modified transient bioheat transfer equation (tBHTE) with a convective term. The results from the numerical simulation were in good agreement with the thermal lesions identified by histological examination of the treated tissues. Within the context of accounting for the blood flow in tBHTE, the estimation of the displacement of tissue and blood motion are addressed. A new multi-dimensional speckle tracking method (MDST) utilizing the Riesz transform with subsample accuracy in all dimensions is described. Field II simulation of flow data in a channel is generated to provide a validation of the accuracy of the method. In addition, the new MDST method is applied to imaging data from the carotid artery of a healthy human volunteers. The results obtained show that using Riesz transform produces more robust estimation of the true displacement compared to previously published results...|$|E
