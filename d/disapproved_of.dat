5|$|The Games {{took place}} on the Thursday and Friday of the week of Whitsun, {{normally}} between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century Puritans <b>disapproved</b> <b>of</b> such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly <b>disapproved</b> <b>of</b> any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.|$|E
