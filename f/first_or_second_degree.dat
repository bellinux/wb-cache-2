Mathematicians including Jean le Rond d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to implicit use of the Jordan curve theorem. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.|$|E

30|$|Locally {{weighted}} regression yi=g(xi) + εi, where i= 1,…, n index of observations, g is the regression function and εi are residual errors, provides an estimate g(x) of each regression surface at any value x in the d-dimensional {{space of the}} independent variables. Correlations between observations of the response variable yi and the vector with the observations d-tuples xi of d predictor variables are identified. Local regression provides an estimation of function g(x) near x=x 0 according to its value in a particular parametric class. This estimation could be achieved by adapting a regression surface to the data points within a neighborhood of the point x 0, which is bounded by a smoothing parameter: span. The span determines the percentage of data that are considered for each local fit and hence the smoothness of the estimated surface is influenced [27].

5000|$|The laws {{on sexual}} offenses were {{modified}} in Latvia in 2014, broadening {{the scope of}} the legislation. In Latvia, a person who commits an act of sexual intercourse by means of violence, threats, taking advantage of the state of helplessness of the victim, or by abuse of authority, is guilty of rape. (Section 159 of the Criminal Code). Rape and other sexual crimes are defined under Chapter XVI called [...] "Criminal Offences against Morals and Sexual Inviolability". In 2014, Section 48 called Aggravating Circumstances (which defines circumstances which constitute an aggravation to a crime) was modified, ensuring that marital rape is covered by legislation, by defining as an aggravating circumstance the fact that: [...] "(15) a criminal offence related to violence or threats of violence, or against morals and sexual inviolability, is committed against a person to whom the perpetrator is related in the <b>first</b> <b>or</b> the <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> of kinship, against the spouse or former spouse, or against a person with whom the perpetrator is or has been in unregistered marital relationship, or against a person with whom the perpetrator has a joint (single) household".

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} our study {{is to use a}} noninvasive tomographic imaging {{technique}} with high spatial resolution to characterize and monitor biological tissue responses associated with laser thermal injury. Methods: Optical doppler tomography (ODT) combines laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to obtain high resolution tomographic velocity and structural images of static and moving constituents in highly scattering biological tissues. A SurgiLase XJ 150 carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser using a continuous mode of 3  watts (W) was used to create <b>first,</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third <b>degree</b> burns on anesthetized Sprague–Dawley rats. Additional parameters for laser thermal injury were assessed as well. Results: The rationale for using ODT in the evaluation of laser thermal injury offers a means of constructing a high resolution tomographic image of the structure and perfusion of laser damaged skin. In the velocity images, the blood flow is coded at 1300  μm/s and 0 velocity, 1000  μm/s and 0 velocity, 700  μm/s and 0 velocity adjacent to the first, <b>second,</b> and third <b>degree</b> injuries, respectively. Conclusion: ODT produces exceptional spatial resolution while having a non-invasive way of measurement, therefore, ODT is an accurate measuring method for high-resolution fluid flow velocity and structural images for biological tissue with laser thermal injury...|$|R

[...] To determine the original cause of renal disease in the probands the medical records were reviewed. The information gathered was reviewed by a single clinical nephrologist who was blinded to {{the identity of the}} patient Diseases with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance accounted for ESRD in 8. 4 % of the cases, 4. 5 % being autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, 2. 5 % Alport's syndrome and the remaining 1. 4 % to other genetic diseases. This group of cases was excluded from the subsequent familial risk analysis. Glomerulonephritis was the renal diagnosis in 25 % of the probands, diabetes mellitus in 20 %, unknown in 14 %, other in 12 %, interstitial in 11 %, hypertensive sclerosis in 5 % and multiple causes in 4 %. [...] Primary outcomes were defined as a positive family history of renal failure associated with renal replacement therapy in a <b>first,</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third <b>degree</b> relative of a proband or control. In the group without a Mendelian pattern of inheritance, 28 % had a <b>first,</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third <b>degree</b> relative with renal failure associated with death or requiring dialysis versus 15 % of controls. 1. 2 % of first degree relatives of probands developed renal failure compared to 0. 4 % of first degree relatives of controls (OR= 3. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 7 - 5. 2). No difference was observed in risk for <b>second</b> <b>degree</b> relatives, but a highly significant increased risk was observed for third degree relatives of probands (OR= 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 3. 4). The highest rate of affected first degree relatives occurred in relatives of probands with hypertensive nephrosclerosis (2. 3 %), diabetes mellitus (1. 6 %) and interstitial disease (1. 6 %). [...] The second control group utilized was the provincial population. The proportion of relatives of probands registered with the Canadian Organ Replacement Registry (CORR) was compared to the rate of the general population. The provincial incidence of ESRD, registered with CORR, from 1981 - 1993 was 79 /million, excluding 8 % of patients with Mendelian inherited disease. The comparable rate of ESRD in first degree relatives of probands without Mendelian inherited renal disease was 297 /million almost four times the provincial rate. The comparable rate for first degree relatives of controls was 135 /million. [...] Conclusions: We conclude that not only is the contribution of Mendelian inherited disease to ESRD high, but there is also an increased risk of renal failure in first degree relatives of probands without Mendelian inherited renal disease in a Caucasian population...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} burn {{injury is}} a serious and mortal event. The most important threat to life is hypovolemic shock with complex pathophysiologic mechanisms. Burn depth is classified as <b>first,</b> <b>second,</b> <b>or</b> third <b>degree.</b> Local inflammatory response results a vasodilatation {{and an increase in}} vascular permeability. A burn injury is a three dimensional ischemic wound. Zone of coagulation is the zone with maximum damage. Zone of stasis consists of damaged but viable tissues, the tissue is salvageable. In zone of hyperemia tissue perfusion is increased. At the beginning, cardiac output falls and systemic vascular resistance increases; cardiac performance improves as hypovolemia is corrected with fluid resuscitation. While cardiac output increases systemic vascular resistance falls below normal values and a hypermetabolic state develops. Pulmonary vascular resistance increases immediately after thermal injury and this is more prolonged. To avoid secondary pulmonary complications, the smallest resuscitation volume of fluids that maintains adequate tissue perfusion should be given. Changes parallel to the cardiovascular response develop in other organ systems. The reasons of burn injury can be thermal, electrical, chemical or radiation. It is important to know the exact mechanism of burn injury because of different therapies for a specific cause. In this review information about burn depth, local and systemic responses to burn injury and major causes of burn injury are presented.

Diagnostic information was available on 51 (81 %) of the first degree relatives. Three of the families appeared to be examples of a new syndrome which, with variable expression, was inherited as a non-sex-linked autosomal dominant.

These families {{did not seem to be}} examples of the Holt-Oram syndrome, for the upper limbs were clinically and radiologically normal in the 19 members examined. The importance of recognizing this syndrome is the occurrence of progressive disease of the conducting tissue and the risk of sudden death.

40|$|Abstract Background A high {{prevalence}} of autoimmune disease (AD) {{has been documented}} in relatives of adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, data on familial inheritance patterns in pediatric SLE patients is scarce. Findings The charts of 69 patients with pediatric-onset SLE were reviewed retrospectively. The primary aim was to describe the prevalence and types of AD in relatives of children with SLE. The secondary aims were: 1) to compare severity of SLE in children with and without relatives affected by AD, and 2) to evaluate the impact of baseline demographics on severity of SLE in subjects. At diagnosis, 42 % of subjects had one <b>or</b> more <b>first,</b> <b>second,</b> <b>or</b> third <b>degree</b> relative(s) with AD; and 32 % of subjects had one <b>or</b> more <b>first</b> degree relative(s) with AD. The most common diseases in relatives of children with SLE were SLE (21 %) and thyroid disease (15 %). Subjects with no family history of AD {{were more likely to}} have severe SLE. SLE severity in subjects did not differ by gender. Children presenting with SLE at an earlier age were found to have more severe disease. Conclusions This study demonstrated a high {{prevalence of}} AD in families of children with SLE, although a family history of AD did not correlate with more severe SLE in subjects. Future larger studies are necessary to elucidate patterns of familial inheritance and baseline patient characteristics that may affect severity of disease in pediatric SLE. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—The last {{comprehensive}} {{epidemiological studies}} on familial sarcoidosis in the UK {{were more than}} 25 years ago, reporting another affected family member in 1. 7 % of index cases. A significant proportion of like-sex over unlike-sex pairs, an excess of mother-child over father-child associations, and a preponderance of monozygous over dizygous twins was noted. Another study reported ethnic heterogeneity in familial disease. This study was undertaken to identify the risk ratio (λS) for siblings of familial sarcoidosis in the UK, {{to determine if the}} previous epidemiological findings have persisted, and to reassess whether ethnic heterogeneity prevails in familial disease.  METHOD—Questionnaires were sent to 406 index patients.  RESULTS—Two hundred and sixty eight replies (66 %) were received. Twenty four of the original 406 index patients (5. 91 %) were found to have at least one other relative (<b>first,</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third <b>degree)</b> with biopsy proven sarcoidosis. A λS value of 36 - 73 was calculated indicating significant familial clustering of the disease. Ethnically the families comprised 62. 5 % Caucasian, 29. 2 % Afro-Caribbean, and 8. 3 % Asian. Mean age at diagnosis was 39. 8 years for women and 40. 9 years for men with a male to female ratio of 1 : 1. 7. This differed for the Asian families in which all the affected members were male. Three sets of female twins (two monozygous and one dizygous) were included. There was an equal distribution of like-sex (primarily female) and unlike-sex families as well as mother-child and father-child pairs. Pulmonary involvement was predominant irrespective of ethnicity, as was the need for corticosteroid treatment.  CONCLUSIONS—These results support the theory that a shared determinant (either genetic or environmental) is operating in familial sarcoidosis and suggest that this determinant is similar for all ethnic groups. ...|$|R
