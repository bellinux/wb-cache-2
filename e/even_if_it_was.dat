5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons.

When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former.

5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|Steps {{had also}} been taken to expand the pre-Federation network of coastal defences to provide {{protection}} against raids from Japanese or German warships prior to World War I. In 1912, these defences were manned by 14 companies of the Australian Garrison Artillery, each of which had a strength of over 100 men. Meanwhile, in September 1912 the government officially approved {{the formation of an}} Australian military air arm. In so doing Australia became the first of the Dominions, {{and one of the few}} nations outside of Europe, to begin to develop such a capability, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> initially only a modest one. The Central Flying School was established at Point Cook, Victoria in 1913. Flying training did not begin immediately, though, and it was not until 1914, that the first class of pilots were accepted. No. 1 Flight of the Australian Flying Corps was raised in the 3rd Military District on 14 July 1914.|$|E

5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not scheduled {{to appear in the}} film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1980s, India {{deployed}} {{a bureaucratic}} method to estimate forest coverage.
