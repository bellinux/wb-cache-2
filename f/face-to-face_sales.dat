5000|$|Task Review: Sterling {{created a}} {{pineapple}} and ginger chutney, yet their {{first version of}} the condiment {{was found to be}} inedible due to excessive use of chilli, leaving them unable to offer a taster for a high-end grocery store lined up by Lord Sugar, but secured another appointment with them and earned a large order as a result, with the team enjoying decent <b>face-to-face</b> <b>sales.</b> Meanwhile, Phoenix created a spicy Italian table sauce but only produced around 60% of their intended amount. Although they too enjoyed similar <b>face-to-face</b> <b>sales,</b> they sold very little to trade, which was hindered further by Michael turning down a potentially large order because the price was 4p per bottle lower than what he wanted. Overall, these issues and their insufficient production run, proved costly mistakes for Phoenix.|$|E

50|$|Task Review: Apollo {{opted for}} {{creating}} British flavours of crisps that the German retailers liked, and secured a large sale {{with a major}} hotel chain, with the team securing good <b>face-to-face</b> <b>sales</b> in the city, although while they got a large order from one retailer, they insisted on a trial run with their crisps. Meanwhile, Synergy focused on creating crisps with German flavours, but did not fare well with sales, as they wasted their time trying to sell to people who werent {{in a position to}} do so, and made fewer appointments to independent retailers. Although they received an order from a retailer for double the amount than Apollo received, the decision to reschedule their appointment with the major hotel chain made it worthless, and ultimately cost the team a chance at victory.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} job applicant body weight on employability ratings via the mediators of obesity and physical attractiveness stereotypes, organizational costs, and rational bias. The moderating effect of job type was also examined. A sample of 202 (75 % female) university students assessed a job applicant {{on the basis of}} a résumé which was accompanied by a photograph (overweight vs. average weight) and a position description (<b>face-to-face</b> vs. telephone <b>sales).</b> Results revealed that the overweight applicant was rated significantly higher on the obesity stereotype, significantly lower on the physical attractiveness stereotype, and as significantly less employable. Stereotypes failed to mediate between applicant weight and employability, and rational bias only was found to be a significant mediator. There was no significant interaction between applicant weight and job type when the mediators were controlled. Our findings in this study underscore the importance of examining multiple pathways from applicant weight to employment-related weight discrimination...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary and Recommendations The {{research}} {{this thesis}} {{is based on}} was done during 1995. As this is a considerable time ago plenty of changes will have taken place. This is not considered in this thesis, which must be read from that perspective. The US market for anti-icing/de-icing chemicals has a yearly demand of approximately 8, 500 US tons solids and 3, 330, 000 gallons liquid in 1994. The geographical locations of airports that are using large volumes are on the American east coast and around the Great Lakes. The largest single using airport is O'Hare in Chicago, IL. The easiest way to segment the anti-icing/de-icing chemicals is geographically. During the research I established that by far the main usage is taken place at the airports identified in the area described above. The buyers {{on the market for}} anti-icing/de-icing products are focused on low prices and reliable, fast deliveries. There is a trend for airports switching from urea and glycol to more environmental friendly anti-icing/de-icing chemicals, mostly to liquid potassium acetate-based ones. This trend is expected to continue for a long time as environment-friendly solutions gets more and more in the public eye. The most commonly used liquid anti-icing/de-icing chemicals are still glycol based. When O'Hare Airport switches to the potassium acetate-based liquid E 36 next year this will become the most commonly used anti-icing/de-icing che­mical. E 36 is sold and distributed by Ashland Chemicals. The manu­facturer of E 36 is Cryotech. When the O’Hare switch has taken place, Ashland will become the market leader in volume sold as well as revenue. Ashland's position {{does not appear to be}} strong enough to significantly block the market entry of AVI­FORM™L 50. Anti-icing/de-icing products are purchased through a formal bidding process, arranged through the airports Purchasing Department or the owners' (cities and sometimes states) Purchasing Department. The most influencial people in the buying centre for anti-icing/de-icing are end-users and the individual that set the specifications. Staff from Purchasing Departments are involved in the buying of anti-icing/de-icing che­micals as well and can in some cases have a large input in to which products are purchased. AVIFORM™L 50 must be sold <b>face-to-face</b> by <b>sales</b> representatives. It is important that Hydro Agri North America, Inc (HANA) immediately obtains product approval from the US authorities if they want to start selling AVIFORM™L 50 during the year 1996. The first bidding process starts in May and the last one in September. To be successful in the market place it is necessary to target the right segment. I recommend that HANA targets the segment with high volume using airports which are keen to use products that minimise the environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relevance}} of Harvey Sacks' work for contemporary organization studies. Sacks encourages analysts to tether their studies to real-time workplace activities; ordinary scenes of work are recorded, slowed down and made the central object of study. Something of Sacks' analytic mentality and style are illustrated through the analysis of two data extracts: an emergency 999 call and a <b>face-to-face</b> <b>sales</b> encounter. A distinctive way of doing organizational analysis is discussed that foregrounds knowledgeability and agency via the examination of sequence and method. Sacks {{raises the possibility that}} organization might be recoverable from the fine-grained detail of actual episodes. The idea that order, intelligibility and the constitution of social scenes might have a basis aside from the more general notion of discourse is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study, which investigates the sales {{negotiation}} strategies of Malaysian sales professionals. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide some insights into the methodology used to make sense of the strategies that are used. In particular, the discussion focuses on issues and challenges, which had emerged in the research process, and on my attempts at overcoming or resolving the methodological problems. A first-hand account of the ethnographic research process and experience is provided. The ethnographic journey is punctuated by constraints, blunders, unanticipated difficulties, problems and anxieties associated with participant observations of in-situ <b>face-to-face</b> <b>sales</b> negotiation and occasionally, serendipity. Through this sharing of the ‘ups-and downs’ in the research process, I hope that would-be ethnographers are alerted to some of the contingencies and problems that are prevalent in ethnographic-oriented research of this kind and thus, would be forewarned and better equipped to deal with such similar problems. ...|$|E

40|$|The October 2015 Food and Beverage Entrepreneurship Roundtable brought {{together}} over 30 {{food and beverage}} industry leaders, entrepreneurs, faculty, and students at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. Discussion topics covered entrepreneurship in the food and beverage industry, including development, intrapreneurship, operational efficiency, beverage product development, and technology. The roundtable began with the presentation of a five-point framework on food and beverage venue development. The first three phases focused on the launch of a venue, including how to define the guest experience; the creation of operational functionality by strategically planning out the design, flow, and efficiency of a defined space; and development capacity. The remaining two points of the framework focused on post-opening considerations, including operating systems and culture development. Participants discussed the importance of culture {{in the growth of}} a business. They suggested that intrapreneurship needs to be fostered in the culture of an organization and in an educational curriculum for those who are preparing to enter the industry. Participants also discussed the fine balance between setting expectations for an experience and subsequently being able to maintain this experience in a fast changing environment. In particular they considered what it means to say no to customers. A discussion on the beverage industry focused on how to distribute products in a crowded marketplace. One method to ensure that the product gets {{into the hands of the}} consumers is <b>face-to-face</b> <b>sales.</b> Finally, in the technology session, the group discussed technology adoption, specifically focusing on the point at which technology detracts from the guest experience, how to minimize operational risk from technology, and how to maximize consumers’ adoption rates...|$|E
