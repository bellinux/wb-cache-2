40|$|The major {{goals of}} this {{research}} were to design an windowless environmental controlled <b>geese</b> breeder <b>house</b> in which the average illumination was 30 lx, the average wind velocity was 2 m/s and efficiency of pad exceeded 70 % to meet the cooling requirement for <b>geese</b> <b>house.</b> The requirement of cooling effect was set as the temperature of air leaving pad being lower than 30 ℃ when ambient air temperature was 36. 5 ℃, and relative humidity was 46 %. That provided an environment for geese breeder to proceed reproduction regulation in hot climate of summer as well as investigate actual appliance effect of environmental controlled <b>geese</b> breeder <b>house.</b> The numbers of lamp and fan, the suitable ventilation rate, the area, height and thickness of pad and the volume of water-storage tank were determined bused on the design criterion by theoretical calculation. Prototype <b>geese</b> breeder <b>house</b> which were used to verify the design goals was built according to the design and experiment. For good egg production of geese breeder it was needed to breed in reproduction regulation plan, including illumination time and temperature control of inside <b>geese</b> <b>house.</b> For analysis of performance behavior of geese breeder, and economic benefits of environmental control <b>geese</b> breeder <b>house,</b> the factors of environment, quantity of production, death, fertilized egg, gooslincs hatched, expenditure, and sell out of gooslincs and price were measured and recorded. Experimental {{results showed that the}} average illumination of the tested house was 38. 42 ± 4. 97 lx, the average wind velocity was 2. 08 ± 0. 28 m/s, and the average efficiency of pad was 85. 33 ± 6. 43 %. In actual appliance, temperature of inside lower than that of outside when outside temperature was higher than 30 ℃, temperature of inside higher than that of outside when outside temperature was lower than 25 ℃ and the relative humidity in the <b>geese</b> <b>house</b> was maintained above 80 %. When ambient air temperature was reached 37. 2 ℃, cooling of pad can reduce temperature 7. 2 ℃, hence cooling efficiency was reached 74. 2 %. Therefore the temperature of air into <b>geese</b> <b>house</b> could be reduced effectively. As the performance of geese breeder laying rate reached above 5 % at May 25 th and lower than 10 % at December 10 th. The productive period was 200 days, the average laying rate was 33. 2 %, and the average laying quantity was 66. 3. Those performances were better than the average values of laying in Taiwan. The egg being fertilized was decreased with the increase of illumination time. The average fertility was 80 %. The results were in agreement with reproduction regulation by illumination control. Cost of each goose was 1790. 8 NTD, economical income was 3068 NTD, hence economical benefit was 1277. 2 NTD form begin to breed geese through reproduction regulation to stop provided feed in the environmental control <b>geese</b> <b>house.</b> The cost and reward was positive relation. Death of geese and cost of production could be reduced by improvement of breed management, then economic benefit could be increased by improvement egg production, egg fertilized and hatched. 本研究之主要目的為設計一密閉式環控種鵝舍，提供種鵝於夏季高溫之氣候條件下可進行產期調節之環境，並探討環控種鵝舍之實際應用效果。環控鵝舍之設計以舍內平均照度 30 lx，平均風速 2 m/s，水牆效率達到 70 %以上；降溫效果之要求為當舍外空氣溫度為 36. 5 ℃，相對濕度為 46 %時，經過水牆進入舍內空氣之溫度低於 30 ℃為設計目標。 首先依以上之設計要求進行燈數，通風量，風機數目，水牆面積，高度及厚度與儲水槽容積之理論計算與設計建造，檢驗是否達成設計目標。其次配合產期調節規劃進行實際飼養，控制舍內光照時間與溫度，促使種鵝產蛋。量測與記錄鵝舍內外環境因子、種鵝產蛋量、死亡數、受精蛋數、孵出雛鵝數、費用支出與出售雛鵝數目及價格等，以分析討論環控種鵝舍之實際應用效果及種鵝性能表現與經濟效益。 試驗結果顯示，設計建造之鵝舍內平均照度為 38. 42 ± 4. 97 lx；平均風速為 2. 08 ± 0. 28 m/s；水牆平均效率為 85. 33 ± 6. 43 %。在實際應用上，舍外溫度高於 30 ℃時，舍內溫度低於舍外，而於舍外溫度低於 25 ℃時，舍內溫度高於舍外，且舍內相對濕度皆維持在 80 %以上。當舍外高溫達 37. 2 ℃，水牆降溫達 7. 2 ℃，降溫效率達 74. 2 %，可有效降低進入鵝舍內之空氣溫度。種鵝之性能方面，種鵝產蛋率自 5 月 25 日達 5 %以上，配合強迫休產，迄當年 12 月 10 日低於 10 %，產蛋期達 200 天，平均產蛋率為 33. 2 %，平均產蛋數 66. 3 個，均優於臺灣一般種鵝之平均產蛋性能；種蛋受精率隨光照時間增加而降低，平均受精率為 80. 0 %；本鵝舍配合光照控制可達產期調節之效果。環控鵝舍由入鵝開始，經產期調節至停料休產，每隻鵝的生產成本為 1790. 8 元，經濟收益為 3068 元，經濟效益為正 1277. 2 元，投資與報酬為正相關，並可藉由改善飼養管理，減少鵝隻死亡，降低生產成本，並改善產蛋數、種蛋受精率與孵化率，提高經濟效益。謝誌 摘要 [...] Ⅰ ABSTRACT [...] - Ⅲ 目錄 [...] Ⅴ 圖目錄 [...] Ⅷ 表目錄 [...] Ⅹ 第一章 前言 [...] - 1 1 - 1 研究動機 [...] 1 1 - 2 研究目的 [...] 3 第二章 文獻探討 [...] - 4 2 - 1 鵝的習性與特性 [...] 4 2 - 2 產期調節 [...] 5 2 - 3 光的性質 [...] 6 2 - 4 光照時間對鵝之影響 [...] 9 2 - 5 絕緣材料 [...] 10 2 - 6 畜禽舍降溫方式 [...] 11 2 - 6 - 1 自然通風 [...] 11 2 - 6 - 2 強制通風 [...] 11 2 - 6 - 3 蒸發冷卻 [...] 12 2 - 7 水牆降溫效率之其它影響因子 [...] 15 2 - 8 成本與利潤 [...] 17 第三章 材料與方法 [...] - 19 3 - 1 試驗地點 [...] 19 3 - 2 環控種鵝舍參數設定與理論計算 [...] 19 3 - 3 環境控制 [...] 37 3 - 4 產期調節規劃 [...] 41 3 - 5 數值量測 [...] 42 3 - 5 - 1 試車量測 [...] 42 3 - 5 - 2 環控量測 [...] 45 3 - 6 儀器設備 [...] 47 3 - 7 資料分析 [...] 49 3 - 7 - 1 試車量測資料分析 [...] 49 3 - 7 - 2 環控量測資料分析 [...] 51 3 - 8 種鵝性能分析 [...] 54 3 - 9 經濟效益分析 [...] 55 第四章 結果與討論 [...] - 65 4 - 1 環控種鵝舍設計規劃之驗証 [...] 65 4 - 2 實際飼養之環控效果 [...] 76 4 - 3 種鵝性能表現 [...] 94 4 - 4 經濟效益 [...] 97 第五章 結論與建議 [...] - 106 第六章 參考文獻 [...] - 110 附 錄 [...] 11...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate management factors that might influence the shedding of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O 157 by beef cows in Scotland, where there is a particularly high rate of human infection. Thirty-two herds were visited at least monthly over approximately 1 year for collection of fresh faecal pat samples and information on management factors. The faecal pat samples were tested for VTEC O 157 by established culture and immunomagnetic separation methods. Questionnaires were completed at the monthly visits to record management factors. Data were analysed using both univariate and multi-factor (GLMM) analysis. Changes in the number of cows in a group, dogs, wild <b>geese,</b> <b>housing,</b> and the feeding of draff (distillers' grains) were statistically significant as risk factors. The event of calving appeared to reduce the likelihood of shedding. Any effects of weaning or turnout were not statistically significant. It appears that the rate of shedding of VTEC O 157 is influenced by several factors but possibly {{the most important of these}} are the circumstances of animals being housed, or, when outside, the presence of wild geese...|$|R

Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} different hatching regimes of goose eggs on their reproductive traits {{and the effect of}} prebiotics and probiotics on productivity and meat quality of goslings. Objectives: Evaluation the relationship between egg incubation properties and different incubation regimes; Development of goslings at egg incubation under different temperature and ventilation regimes; Effect of prebiotics, probiotics and alfalfa on growth rate and health of goslings; Effect of prebiotics and probiotics on the dressing percentage and chemical composition of goose meat. Methods. Prior to every incubation, the following physical traits of eggs were investigated: egg weight, albumen weight, yolk weight, shell strength, shell weight, shell thickness. Feeding trial lasted for up to nine weeks. Goslings were allotted into three groups of 33 goslings each that were housed in a <b>goose</b> <b>house.</b> The compound feed for Trial group 1 was supplemented with Biomin® IMBO from Day 1 to nine weeks.

Results and Conclusions. Such incubation regime resulted in 56 % higher hatching rate in comparison with the standard regime. Feeding alfalfa had no significant effect weight gains of goslings, yet the consumption of compound per kg gain decreased by 34. 93 % and the cost price of goose meat production by 0. 9 LTL/kg. Supplementation of the feeds with Enteroccocus faecium Biomin® IMBO resulted in by 3. 65 % higher dressing percentage and by 0. 4 (P 0. 05) higher contents of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids respectively.
