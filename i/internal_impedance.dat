50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering characteristics like current or {{voltage can be}} measured by devices named ammeter, voltmeter, multimeter, etc. The ammeter is used in series with the load. So the same current flows through the load and the ammeter. The voltmeter is used in parallel with the load. So the voltage between the two terminals of the load {{is equal to the}} voltage between the two terminals of the voltmeter. Ideally the measuring device should not affect the circuit parameters i.e., the <b>internal</b> <b>impedance</b> of the ammeter should be zero (no voltage drop over the ammeter) and the <b>internal</b> <b>impedance</b> of the voltmeter should be infinite (no current through the voltmeter). However, in actual case, ammeters have a low but non zero impedance and voltmeters have a high but not infinite <b>internal</b> <b>impedance.</b> Thus the measured parameters are somewhat altered during the measurements.|$|E
