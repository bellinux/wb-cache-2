50|$|In 2004, the {{electronics}} side was improved greatly with the introductions of Electronic Throttle Control, electronically controlled transmissions, and transient engine and transmission controls. In addition, computing power was vastly increased. A solenoid {{control valve assembly}} integrated into the engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>roller</b> lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders https://web.archive.org/web/20061029082032/http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fuel/engine.html. Unlike the first generation system, {{only half of the}} cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As anti-foaming agents in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals. Similarly engine oil viscosity and cleanliness is a factor. Use of the incorrect oil type, i.e. SAE 20W40 instead of SAE 20W50, or the failure to change engine oil at factory recommended intervals can also significantly impair system performance.|$|R

The jump flow is characterised by some substantial air bubble entrainment, spray and splashing. In the present study, the free-surface fluctuations and air-water {{properties of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> jump <b>roller</b> were investigated physically for relatively small Froude numbers (2. 4 < Fr- 1 < 5. 1) and relatively large Reynolds numbers (6. 6 x 10 (4) < Re < 1. 3 x 10 (5)). The shape of the mean free surface profile was well defined, and the time-averaged free-surface elevation corresponded to the upper free-surface, with the quantitative values being close to the equivalent clear-water depth. The turbulent fluctuation profiles exhibited a maximum {{in the first part}} of the <b>hydraulic</b> jump <b>roller.</b> The free-surface fluctuations presented some characteristic frequencies between 1. 4 and 4 Hz. Some simultaneous free-surface measurements at a series of two closely located points yielded the free-surface length and time scales of free-surface fluctuations in terms of both longitudinal and transverse directions. The length scale data seemed to depend upon the inflow Froude number, while the time scale data showed no definite trend.

5000|$|Limited engine speeds or RPM: OHV engines {{have more}} {{valvetrain}} moving parts, thus more valvetrain inertia and mass, {{as a result}} they suffer more easily from valve [...] "float", and may exhibit a tendency for the pushrods, if improperly designed, to flex or snap at high engine speeds. Therefore, OHV engine designs cannot revolve ("rev") at engine speeds as high as OHC [...] Modern OHV engines are usually limited to about 6,000 to 8,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) in production cars, and 9,000 rpm to 10,500 rpm in racing applications. In contrast, many modern DOHC engines may have rev limits from 6,000 rpm to 9,000 rpm in road car engines, and in excess of 20,000 rpm (though now limited to 15,000 rpm) in current Formula One engines using pneumatic valve springs. High-revving pushrod engines are normally solid (mechanical) lifter designs, flat and roller. In 1969, Chevrolet offered a Corvette and a Camaro model with a solid lifter cam pushrod V8 (the ZL-1) that could rev to 8,000 rpm.

50|$|The kiln {{is usually}} turned {{by means of}} a single Girth Gear {{surrounding}} a cooler part of the kiln tube, but sometimes it is turned by driven rollers. The gear is connected through a gear train to a variable-speed electric motor. This must have high starting torque in order to start the kiln with a large eccentric load. A 6 x 60 m kiln requires around 800 kW to turn at 3 rpm. The speed of material flow through the kiln is proportional to rotation speed, and so a variable speed drive is needed in order to control this. When driving through <b>rollers,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> drives may be used. These have the advantage of developing extremely high torque. In many processes, it is dangerous to allow a hot kiln to stand still if the drive power fails. Temperature differences between {{the top and bottom of}} the kiln may cause the kiln to warp, and refractory is damaged. It is therefore normal to provide an auxiliary drive for use during power cuts. This may be a small electric motor with an independent power supply, or a diesel engine.

40|$|The {{compressive}} breakage principle {{utilized in}} a High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) {{is a highly}} energy efficient way of reducing the particle size of rock material, minerals and ores. However, {{there are a number}} of operational issues known related to the HPGRs. Due to the high forces and pressure levels acting upon the roller surface the wear rate is commonly severe contributing to a substantial part of the operational cost. It is also commonly difficult to achieve continuous optimal performance due to e. g. variations in feed material. Hence, there is a strong incentive to be able to model and simulate the internal behaviour in order to generate a deeper understanding, improve operation, solve problems and aid development of analytical models. In an HPGR both rolls rotates with a fixed speed. If a frequency drive is installed the speed is possible to change and control. The roll pressure is applied by fixing one of the rollers to the main frame and keeping the other roll in a floating condition with hydraulic actuators applying a force. This force is controlled by the start pressure level in the nitrogen accumulators acting on the <b>hydraulic</b> actuators. <b>Roller</b> position and the mechanical and hydraulic dynamic properties of the machine is complex since the response during crushing is both dependent on the hydraulic-/mechanical operational set points as well as the feed material response.

The breakage model is calibrated by conducting laboratory single particle breakage tests. The hydro-pneumatic system and dynamics are modelled using MSC Easy 5 via a spring-dashpot system coupled to the DEM software which calculates a dynamic response in each simulation loop.

40|$|Hydraulic jump is {{a rapidly}} varied flow {{phenomenon}} that the flow changes suddenly from supercritical to subcritical. Hydraulic jumps are frequently observed to exist in natural river channels, streams, coastal water, and man-made water conveyance systems. Because of a sudden transition of flow regime, hydraulic jumps result in complex flow structures, strong turbulence, and air entrainment. Accordingly, they are two-phase flow, with air being the gas phase and water being the liquid phase. Consequences of the occurrence of hydraulic jumps include: unwanted fluctuations in the water surface with unstable waves and rollers, undesirable erosion of channel sidewalls and channel bottom, and reduced efficiency for water conveyance systems. Thus, {{it is important to}} study various aspects of the phenomenon. So far, knowledge of the phenomenon is incomplete. The main objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the complex flow structures and distributions of air entrainment in a hydraulic jump. Previously, both experimental and computational studies of the phenomenon have typically suffered a scale problem. The dimensions of the setup being used were unrealistically too small. In this research, we took the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach, and simulated hydraulic jumps at relatively large and practical dimensions. This would help reduce artificial scale effects on the results. On the basis of Reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations, CFD simulations of hydraulic jumps were performed for four different cases in terms of the approach flow Froude number Fr 1, ranging from 3. 1 to 5. 1. The Reynolds number is high (between 577662 and 950347), which ensures turbulent flow conditions. The CFD model channel is discretized into 2, 131, 200 cells. The mesh has nearly uniform structures, with fine spatial resolutions of 2. 5 mm. The volume of fluid method provides tracking of the free surface. The standard k-ε turbulence model provides turbulence closure. For each of the simulation cases, we carried out analyses of time-averaged air volume fraction, time-averaged velocity, time- and depth-averaged (or double averaged) air volume fraction at a series of locations {{along the length of the}} model channel (Note that the terms air volume fraction and void fraction are used interchangeably in this thesis). We compared the CFD predictions of air volume fraction with available laboratory measurements. It is important to note that these measurements were made from laboratory experiments that corresponded to essentially the same values of Fr as this CFD study, but used a channel of smaller dimensions, in comparison to the CFD model channel. The CFD results of time-averaged air volume fraction are reasonable, when compared to the experimental data, except for the simulation case with Fr 1 = 3. 8. For all the four simulation cases, the predicted variations in air volume fraction show a trend in consistency with the experimental results. For the three simulation cases (with Fr 1 = 3. 1, 3. 8 and 4. 4), the time-averaged air volume fraction in the hydraulic jumps is larger at higher Reynolds number. However, for the simulation case with Fr 1 = 5. 1, it is smaller at higher Reynolds number. This implies that the amount of air being entrained into a hydraulic jump depends on not only Fr 1 but also the depth of the approach flow. In future studies of the hydraulic jump phenomenon, one should consider using approach flow of realistically large dimensions at various values of Fr 1, for realistic predictions of air entrainment in <b>hydraulic</b> jump <b>rollers...</b>|$|R
