5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

5|$|Both popes {{sent their}} legates {{to the catholic}} kingdoms {{in order to secure}} their recognition. At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I {{declared}} himself in favour of Victor IV, and the episcopate of the Empire followed him, with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von Hilpolstein-Biburg and his suffragans. King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. The rest of Europe, namely France, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer, recognized Alexander III as true Pope, even if <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers.

5|$|Bound for Glory is {{considered}} by TNA to be their equivalent to the National Football League's Super Bowl or rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania event. As such, TNA used an extensive marketing campaign that involved several wrestlers dressing up as gangsters from the 1920s and 1930s era of Chicago to promote the show {{since it is the}} biggest event the company holds annually. Samoa Joe and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) participated <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> promotional video shoots. This was the first Bound for Glory event to use roman numerals in the title. TNA created a section on their company website to promote Bound for Glory IV. TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Karen Angle, Joe, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, and Gail Kim. The official theme for the show was Tarantula by The Smashing Pumpkins. A contest was held to win upgraded ringside seats, free merchandise, and meet several TNA performers at Bound for Glory IV by wearing a Halloween costume to the event, with a drawing being held {{prior to the start of}} the telecast.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, the Texas Railroad Commission, {{which had}} been given {{regulatory}} control of the Texas oil industry, managed to stabilize American oil production and eliminate most of the wild price swings that were common during the earlier years of the boom. Many small towns, such as Wortham, which had become boomtowns during the 1920s saw their booms end in the late 1920s and early 1930s as their local economies collapsed, resulting from their dependence on relatively limited petroleum reservoirs. As production peaked <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> smaller fields and the Great Depression lowered demand, investors fled. In the major refining and manufacturing centers such as Beaumont, Houston, and Dallas, the boom continued to varying degrees {{until the end of}} World War II. By the end of the war, the economies of the major urban areas of the state had matured. Though Texas continued to prosper and grow, the extreme growth patterns and dramatic socioeconomic changes of the earlier years largely subsided as the cities settled into more sustainable patterns of growth. Localized booms in West Texas and other areas, however, continued to transform some small communities during the post-war period.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Constantine {{worked for}} the Ministry of Labour and National Service as a Welfare Officer {{responsible}} for West Indians employed in English factories. In 1943, {{the manager of a}} London hotel refused to accommodate Constantine and his family on the grounds of their race; Constantine successfully sued the hotel company. Commentators recognise the case as a milestone in British Racial Equality. Constantine qualified as a barrister in 1954, while also establishing himself as a journalist and broadcaster. He returned to Trinidad in 1954, entered politics and became {{a founding member of the}} People's National Movement, subsequently entering the Trinidad government as minister of communications. From 1961 to 1964, he served as Trinidad's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and, controversially, became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination, including the Bristol Bus Boycott. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC. Failing health reduced his effectiveness <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> roles, and he faced criticism for becoming a part of the British Establishment. He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971, aged 69.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants <b>in</b> psoriasis. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved <b>in</b> psoriasis. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the {{short amount of time}} elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|Swedish is {{the sole}} {{official}} national language of Sweden, and one of two in Finland (alongside Finnish). As of 2006, {{it was the first}} or sole native language of 7.5 to 8 million Swedish residents. In 2007 around 5.5% (c. 290,000) of the population of Finland were native speakers of Swedish, though the percentage has been declining steadily since Finland became part of Russia after the Finnish War 1808–1809. The Finland Swedish minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western Finland. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> areas, Swedish is the predominant language; in 19 municipalities, 16 of which are located in Åland, Swedish {{is the sole}} official language.

5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy, which {{involves the use of}} coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.|$|E
5|$|Natives {{incorporated}} the natural {{features of the}} ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting {{the course of the}} Connecticut River where it suddenly swings east in Middletown, Connecticut, after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating beaver who lived in a great lake that existed in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the Sleeping Giant, part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial Lake Hitchcock, extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear–sized beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, that lived at that time. Many features of the Metacomet Ridge region still bear names with Native American origins: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.|$|E

5|$|The brief {{peace in}} Europe allowed Napoleon {{to focus on}} the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of {{political}} autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.|$|E
