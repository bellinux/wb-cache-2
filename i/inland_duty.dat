60|$|There is an Englishman[186] of no long {{standing}} among us, {{but in an}} employment of great trust, power, and profit. This excellent person did lately publish, at his own expense, a pamphlet printed in England by authority, to justify the bill for a general excise or <b>inland</b> <b>duty,</b> in order to introduce that blessed scheme among us. What a tender care must such an English patriot for Ireland have of our interest, if he should condescend to sit in our Parliament! I will bridle my indignation. However, methinks I long to see that mortal, who would with pleasure blow us all up at a blast: but he duly receives his thousand pounds a year; makes his progresses like a king; is received in pomp at every town and village where he travels,[187] and shines in the English newspapers.|$|E

5000|$|His or Her Majesty's Excise <b>duties</b> are <b>inland</b> <b>duties</b> levied on {{articles}} at {{the time}} of their manufacture, such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco, but duties have also been levied on salt, paper and windows. A Board of Excise was established by the Long Parliament, and Excise Duties first levied, in 1643 under the [...] "Excise Ordinance" [...] (Ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of moneys by way of charge or impost upon several commodities).|$|R
50|$|Far more revolutionary in {{its effects}} was the {{introduction}} of the excise or <b>inland</b> <b>duties</b> on goods, a step which Elizabeth, James I and Charles I had hesitated to take. Beginning (1643) with duties on ale, beer and spirits, it was soon extended to meat, salt and various textiles. Meat and domestic salt were relieved in 1647, and the taxation became definitely established under the administration of commissioners appointed for the purpose. Powers to allow collection by farmers were granted, a bid for both excise and customs amounting to £1,100,000 in 1657. Confiscations of church and royalist lands, feudal charges and special collections helped to make up the total of £83,000,000 raised during the nineteen years of the revolution.|$|R
50|$|He {{probably}} {{received a}} very good education for his time, because by the mid-1730s, Bacon lived in Dublin {{and worked in the}} royal customs service. He had previously managed vessels in the coal trade between Whitehaven and Dublin. In 1737, Bacon published his first book, A Compleat System of the Revenue of Ireland, in its Branches of Import, Export, and <b>Inland</b> <b>Duties,</b> Containing I. An Abridgement of English and Irish Statutes Relating to the Revenue of Ireland II. The Former and Additional Book of Rates Inwards and Outwards, etc. III. A View of the Duties which Compose the Revenue of Ireland, etc. IV. The Method of Making Entries, etc. This earned an invitation for him to become a free citizen of Dublin, with associated privileges.|$|R

5000|$|Two broad {{categories}} of taxes exist {{at the national}} level: customs <b>duties</b> and <b>inland</b> taxes.

25|$|Key Ming taxes {{included}} the land tax (21million taels), the service levy (direct requisitioning of labour services and goods from civilians, valued at about 10 million taels), and the {{revenue from the}} Ming salt monopoly (2million taels). Other miscellaneous sources of revenue {{included the}} <b>inland</b> customs <b>duty</b> (343,729taels), sale of rank (500,000taels), licensing fees for monks (200,000 taels), and fines (300,000taels) and others, which all added up to about 4million taels. The overall Ming tax rate was very low, at around 3 to 4%. However, {{by the end of}} the dynasty, this situation had changed dramatically. Zhang Juzheng instituted the one whip reform, in which the arbitrary service levy was merged into the land tax. The Ming government's salt monopoly was undermined by private sellers, and had collapsed completely by the 15th century; government officials estimated that three-quarters of salt produced was being sold privately.|$|R

5|$|The 4th Brigade {{suffered}} 65killed and 136wounded on top {{of rising}} casualties from disease {{and was replaced by}} the 20th Brigade at this point. The 26th Brigade took over flank protection <b>duties</b> <b>inland.</b> The advance then rolled quickly as Japanese morale broke and organised resistance diminished. Large gains were made against only limited resistance, which often amounted to minor skirmishes against small groups of Japanese. Hubika fell on 22 December with no opposition, and Wandokai two days later. Blucher Point was reached on 28 December, where the 2/13th Infantry Battalion regained contact with the retreating Japanese and fought a sharp contact. Elsewhere, that same day, US forces landed further west at Saidor.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1863 Ayers was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} three South Australian representatives at the inter-colonial conference on uniform tariffs and <b>inland</b> customs <b>duties.</b> He also represented the colony at several other conferences from 1864 to 1877. On 4 July 1863 Ayers became minister without portfolio in the first Dutton cabinet. This ministry resigned just 11 days later however, as council demanded that it should have an executive minister to represent the government and Dutton refused. Ayers formed his first ministry as Premier and Chief Secretary on 15 July 1863. [...] The house was much divided and it was almost impossible to get business done. Ayers reconstructed his ministry on 22 July 1864 but was defeated, and resigned on 4 August 1864. The Blyth ministry which was then formed included Ayers as chief secretary, but did not survive a general election and resigned on 22 March 1865. When Dutton formed his second ministry Ayers had his old position as chief secretary, and still retaining that office, formed his third administration on 20 September 1865 which lasted just over a month. In spite of dissolutions it was found very difficult to get a workable house. There were 18 ministries tween July 1863 and July 1873. Ayers became the premier again from May 1867 to September 1868, October to November 1868, 27 January 1872 to March 1872, and with an entirely new team of ministers, from March 1872 to July 1873. He held the position of chief secretary in the Colton ministry from June 1876 to October 1877, his last term of office.|$|R
5000|$|Trinity House {{operates}} {{a number of}} small boats, mostly functioning as ship's tenders to the vessels in the section above. The historic right of Trinity House to escort the Sovereign when travelling by ship in territorial waters is still exercised on ceremonial occasions. On the River Thames and <b>inland</b> waterways the <b>duty</b> is carried out by the vessel Trinity House No 1 Boat. The name is in practice a designation of any boat assigned to this duty, rather than the name of a specific vessel, and at present a tender of THV Galatea is used for such ceremonial duties. However, for the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012, this boat had the name [...] "T.H. No 1 Boat" [...] painted onto the bow (left and right sides) whilst carrying the Master (HRH the Princess Royal) in the jubilee flotilla. On 8 November 2014, Trinity House entered a float into the annual Lord Mayor's Show in the City of London, consisting of a heavy low-loader lorry, with the Trinity House No 1 Boat mounted on the low-loader trailer as an exhibit.|$|R
50|$|During the 1830s and 1840s, the British and French {{governments were}} {{at odds with}} Rosas' {{leadership}} of the United Provinces, modern-day Argentina, and his economic policies of protecting the local industries with high tariffs. This had led to two naval blockades, a French one in 1838, and an Anglo-French one in 1845. By the 1840s, the advent ofsteam-powered sailing meant that merchant ships could easily sail up rivers {{that had previously been}} impassable; as a result British and French vessels had been sailing past Buenos Aires and trading directly <b>inland,</b> avoiding customs <b>duties</b> in the process. The Rosas government tried to stop this practice by declaring the Argentine rivers unnavigable by foreign countries, barring access to Paraguayan ports in the process. The British and French governments responded by intervening up the Paraná river in 1845 with a joint fleet of steam frigates, partially armoured and armed with rapid-fire guns and Congreve rockets. The result was a battle between an Argentinian fort that attempted to block the river and the European ships; the Anglo-French fleet had the best of the fight, but suffered considerable damage. The defence was enough to produce a political compromise in which France and Britain recognised the right of Buenos Aires to administer its own territories and rivers.|$|R
