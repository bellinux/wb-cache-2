40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two novel texture-based {{techniques}} to visualize uncertainty in time-dependent 2 D flow fields. Both methods use semi-Lagrangian texture advection to show flow direction by streaklines and convey uncertainty by blurring these streaklines. The first approach applies a cross advection {{perpendicular to the}} flow direction. The second method employs isotropic diffusion that can be implemented by Gaussian filtering. Both methods are derived from a generic filtering process that is incorporated into the traditional texture advection pipeline. Our visualization methods allow for a continuous change of the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> representation by adapting the density of particle injection. All methods can be mapped to efficient GPU implementations. Therefore, the user can interactively control all important characteristics of the system like particle density, error influence, or dye injection to create meaningful illustrations of the underlying uncertainty. Even though there are many sources of uncertainties, we focus on uncertainty that occurs during data acquisition. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods for the example of real-world fluid flow data measured with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Furthermore, we compare these techniques with an adapted multifrequency noise approach...|$|E

We consider two types of the geometric pattern of flow obstacle between which regular pattern {{turns out to be}} more effective. It is observed that, implementing structured flow obstacles of radii greater than 10 % of channel height and charge density ratio (charge <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> obstacle surface to that of channel wall) {{greater than or equal to}} 9 renders significant enhancement of power generation efficiency. On the other hand, it is effective to operate at a charge density ratio~ 1 for obstacles radii less than or equal to 10 % of channel height. An effective normalized pitch length of magnitude 0. 6 or above has to be maintained in order to obtain optimum energy conversion efficiency. We found that implementation of charged flow obstacle causes a significant enhancement of energy conversion efficiency (~ 18 % with regular pattern) comparing to planar slit channel (~ 4 %) without considering wall hydrodynamic slip and steric effects. Introducing finite ionic size and wall hydrodynamic slip effect, pertinent to flows in narrow confinement, leads to further enhancement in electrokinetic energy conversion efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft noise {{has come}} under severe {{scrutiny}} due to growing number of airports and airline operations. The noise generated by high lift devices is now comparable to the turbofan engines due to increasing bypass ratios. A Gurney flap is a suitable starting point to study trailing edge flap aeroacoustics due to additional lift characteristics and a simple geometry. The thesis aims in using Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry to understand the dynamics of flow as well as identifying structures responsible for the tonal noise in a Gurney flap. TR-PIV was used to obtain, at a high spatial and temporal resolution, the flow dynamics associated with a Gurney flap at low Mach and high Reynolds number. A part of the thesis focussed on validating the two modes of shedding as an additional lift increment mechanism in a Gurney flap {{in case of a}} fully developed turbulent boundary layer. Flow statistics showed an upstream recirculation region, upper and lower separating shear layers and a main recirculation region whose size varied with Gurney flap size and angle of attack downstream of the flap. The instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields showed the flapping motion of the von Karman wake and corresponding vortex roll-up and shedding process. The power spectral <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuations as well as the acoustic spectra, however, did not indicate any second mode of shedding. The Strouhal numbers of the vortex shedding for various Gurney flaps were close to that of a bluff body in a flow. Stereoscopic PIV measurements showed the periodic vortex shedding to be highly correlated in the spanwise direction (correlation length of 4 cm). The large spanwise correlation length indicates the use of serrations can be useful in breaking-down such coherent structures. The tonal peaks were clearly audible and correspond to the vortex shedding frequency. Causality correlation between pressure fluctuations generated in the far-eld and the near-field fluctuations indicate a high correlation with unsteady vertical velocity in the wake (associated with unsteady lift). It was found that the dynamics in the upstream recirculation region (cavity) was not responsible in the production of noise. Further, the results indicate the location of the actual source of noise to be the flap. The high values of correlation further downstream are due to the presence of an upstream source (the flap) and are not sources of sound themselves. Thus, TR-PIV in a way clears the ambiguity expressed by other researchers in the past in interpreting the high values of correlation to be sources of sound.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of visual-motion {{information}} sampled through optical flow for the task of indoor obstacle avoidance on autonomous mobile robots. The methods focus on the practical use of optical flow and visual motion information in performing the obstacle avoidance task in real indoor environments. The methods serve to identify visual-motion properties that must be used in synergy with visual-spatial properties toward {{the goal of a}} complete robust visual-only obstacle avoidance system, as is evidently seen within nature. A review of vision-based obstacle avoidance techniques shows that early research mainly focused on visual-spatial techniques, which heavily rely on various assumptions of their environments to function successfully. On the other hand, more current research that looks toward {{the use of}} visual-motion information (sampled through optical flow) tends to focus on using optical flow in a subsidiary manner, and does not completely take advantage of the information encoded within an optical flow field. In the light of the current research limitations, this thesis describes two different approaches and evaluates their use of optical flow to perform the obstacle avoidance task. The first approach begins with the construction of a conventional range map using optical flow that stems from the structure-from-motion domain and the theory that optical flow encodes 3 D environmental information under certain conditions. The second approach investigates optical flow in a causal mechanistic manner using machine learning of motor responses directly from optical flow - motivated from physical and behavioural evidence observed in biological creatures. Specifically, the second approach is designed with three main objectives in mind: 1) to investigate whether optical flow can be learnt for obstacle avoidance; 2) to create a system capable of repeatable obstacle avoidance performance in real-life environments; and 3) to analyse the system to determine what optical flow properties are actually being used for the motor control task. The range-map reconstruction results have demonstrated some good distance estimations {{through the use of a}} feature-based optical flow algorithm. However, the number of flow points were too sparse to provide adequate obstacle detection. Results froma differential-based optical flow algorithm helped to increase the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> points, but highlighted the high sensitivity of the optical flow field to the rotational errors and outliers that plague the majority of frames under real-life robot situations. Final results demonstrated that current optical flow algorithms are ill-suited to estimate obstacle distances consistently, as range-estimation techniques require an extremely accurate optical flow field with adequate density and coverage for success. This is a difficult problem within the optical flow estimation domain itself. In the machine learning approach, an initial study to examine whether optical flow can be machine learnt for obstacle avoidance and control in a simple environment was successful. However,there were certain problems. Several critical issues which arise with the use of a machine learning approach were highlighted. These included sample set completeness, sample set biases, and control system instability. Consequently, an extended neural network was proposed that had several improvements made to overcome the initial problems. Designing an automated system for gathering training data helped to eliminate most of the sample set problems. Key changes in the neural network architecture, optical flow filters, and navigation technique vastly improved the control system stability. As a result, the extended neural network system was able to successfully perform multiple obstacle avoidance loops in both familiar and unfamiliar real-life environments without collisions. The lap times of the machine learning approach were comparable to those of the laser-based navigation technique. The the machine learning approach was 13 % slower in the familiar and 25 % slower in the unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, through analysis of the neural network approach, flow magnitudes were revealed to be learnt for range information in an absolute manner, while flow directions were used to detect the focus of expansion (FOE) in order to predict critical collision situations and improve control stability. In addition, the precision of the flow fields was highlighted as an important requirement, as opposed to the high accuracy of flow vectors. For robot control purposes, image-processing techniques such as region finding and object boundary detection were employed to detect changes between optical flow vectors in the image space...|$|E
