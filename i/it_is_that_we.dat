25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus {{we can say that}} the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} Tucker goes free upholds {{a common theme}} in Homicide: Life on the Street – that life is not always fair, and that criminals {{sometimes}} get away with their crimes, a conviction that often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives. Fontana deliberately wrote the script {{so that it would}} remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not. He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson, but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl. Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three-dimensional character in Tucker, and said, [...] "Fontana's genius is that we are never quite certain as to what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have on our hands." [...] Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end, and Pembleton has the opposite experience. Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process. The interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas, including the presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession.|$|E

Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E

2500|$|Cradle of Filth's {{particular}} genre {{has provoked}} {{a great deal}} of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have openly cited first wave black metal acts such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said [...] "I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that [...] "few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days." [...] In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, former guitarist Paul Allender said, [...] "We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn't sound anything like that.

2500|$|Devotions are prayers or pious {{exercises}} used {{to demonstrate}} reverence {{for a particular}} aspect of God or the person of Jesus, or for a particular saint. Catholic devotions have various forms, ranging from formalized prayers such as novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such as Eucharistic adoration, the veneration of the saints, and even horticultural practices such as maintaining a Mary garden. Common examples of Catholic devotions include the Rosary, the Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and the veneration of various saints, etc. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a Directory of devotions and pious practices. The Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of joy, of sorrow and the glory of Jesus and Mary.Sister Lucia dos Santos said:"The Most Holy Virgin in these last times {{in which we live}} has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Rosary {{to such an extent that}} there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families...that cannot be solved by the Rosary.

2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god(s), a view associated with the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche.

2500|$|The New Scientist article collates {{the reviews}} of Andy Coghlan {{and those of}} his 20-year-old {{daughter}} Phoebe and his 13-year-old son Callum.

[...] saying [...] "The book provides a golden opportunity for Dawkins to ask whether we can evolve to treat one another more civilly. Alas, he doesn't seize it."

Too few of us wake up each day and reflect on how amazing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not only alive, but aware of being alive." [...] Phoebe liked the book, she writes [...] "I was unable to put the book down. I found myself enjoying learning exciting new facts and having old ones reinforced. It was definitely no repeat of the classroom scenario... Perhaps the book's greatest asset is that it manages to bring science to life. The vibrant illustrations reinforce this, as do the fun font styles... His style is colloquial, creating a relaxed, lighter tone."
