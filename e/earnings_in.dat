Hence, our findings indicate that gender gap has the most significant impact on <b>earnings</b> inequality <b>in</b> Taiwan.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study shows}} that firms collectively incur a cost for {{managing}} earnings and analyst expectations to meet earnings forecasts. We compare the coefficient in the regression of abnormal stock returns on earnings surprise (the earnings response coefficient [ERC]) across ranges of earnings surprises. The ERC for <b>earnings</b> surprises <b>in</b> the range [0, 1 �] is significantly lower than ERCs for <b>earnings</b> surprises <b>in</b> adjacent ranges for firm-quarters in the early and mid 2000 s, but not {{for those in the}} 1990 s. The results are robust to controlling for the sign of estimated discretionary accruals and the trajectory of analyst earnings forecasts. We further find that investors are right to be skeptical about <b>earnings</b> surprises <b>in</b> the range [0, 1 �]. The relation of future earnings surprise with current earnings surprise is more negative for current <b>earnings</b> surprises <b>in</b> that range than for those in any other range. Evidence also suggests analysts react negatively to <b>earnings</b> surprises <b>in</b> that range. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the West German <b>earnings</b> distribution <b>in</b> the 1980 's is analysed {{on the basis of}} both the German Socio-Economic Panel and micro-data from the Employment Register of the Federal Labour Office. We find that <b>earnings</b> inequality <b>in</b> Germany has increased very little in the 1980 's, if at all.

Our decomposition analysis based on estimated earnings functions reveals that the relative stability of the German <b>earnings</b> distribution <b>in</b> the 1980 's has not resulted from large compensating changes in the composition of the labour force on the one hand, and changes in the returns to human capital on the other. While both of these components have changed little in the observation period, the former rather than the latter component has contributed to the small increase <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> inequality observed <b>in</b> the register data. If anything, the earnings differential between skilled and unskilled workers has become smaller during the 1980 's, while within-inequality has contributed very little to changes in inequality.
