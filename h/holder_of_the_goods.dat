40|$|We {{model the}} {{commonly}} used marketing practices of offering discounts to either repeat buyers (trade-ins) or new buyers (introductory offers) of a quasi-durable good. We analyze these practices {{in terms of}} their potential for intertemporal and third-degree price discrimination. In our two-period model, the monopolist sets a first-period price that segments the second-period market optimally into <b>holders</b> and nonholders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> In <b>the</b> second period, different prices are quoted to the two market segments. We present three versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model with varying assumptions on consumers' rationality. ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{abstract}} title transfer seemingly {{contradicts the}} usual common sense interpretation of commercial transactions, it is undisputed among the German legal community. <b>The</b> main advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract system {{is its ability}} to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction however complicated this transaction may be. A good example is retention of title. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price by installments, the system faces two conflicting interests: the buyer wants to have <b>the</b> purchased <b>goods</b> immediately, whereas <b>the</b> seller wants to secure full payment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purchase price. Under abstract title transfer, the BGB has a simple answer to that: the purchase contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last installment. Since the obligations and <b>the</b> actual conveyance <b>of</b> title are in two different contracts, it is quite simple to secure both parties' interests. The seller retains title up to the last payment, and the buyer is merely <b>the</b> <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purchased <b>goods.</b> If he fails to pay in full the seller may reclaim his property just like any other owner.|$|R
