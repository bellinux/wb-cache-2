The neutral plane elevation shifts lower down the pile shaft as the distance of pile tip above the bearing stratum decreases. Under the application of axial load, the dragload generated by excessive soil settlement decreases and is eventually eliminated. The amount of axial load for complete NSF elimination {{does not seem to}} be significantly affected by the presence of sacrificing piles, but it does increase with end-bearing stiffness of the pile.

Fixing the piles on the support layer increases the dynamic rigidity of the soil–pile–slab system especially for the ratios s/d[*]=[*] 2 and 10 (Figs.  6 and 8). For the three s/d ratios, the dynamic rigidity of the anchored piles is greater than the ones of the rested piles.

40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>piles</b> in {{soft soil}} {{deposits}} primarily mobilize their bearing capacity {{by means of}} shaft resistance. The {{upper part of the}} pile triggers a downward traction on the pile shaft whilst the lower part mobilizes the shaft friction in the soil required for the pile bearing capacity. The transition between these two modes of shaft friction is often defined as the neutral-plane. This plane, which is not at a constant level, assists in predictions of the (long-term) settlements of a pile in such a soil. <b>Floating</b> <b>piles</b> primarily occur in areas where stiffer clay layers are overlain by softer clay layers, e. g. on the west-coast of Sweden or in the Kaspian Sea. In the past the response of <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> is extensively described using the neutral plane approach. This approach requires a reliable prediction of the soil settlements, which in turn are affected by the pile installation effects in the soil. Additional experimental evidence on the soil behaviour during, directly after installation and in the long-term is required if advanced numerical methods are considered and current analytical design methods to be improved. A novel approach to retrieve this experimental data on immediate and long-term pile installation effects in the geotechnical centrifuge is developed. An axisymmetric experimental test setup allows for measurement of full-field displacement as well as pore pressures during and after installation. This setup uses an instrumented wall with 40 pore pressure transducers. Additionally, an image sequence taken with a machine vision camera is used to extract the soil displacements by application of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Due to natural low contrast of the kaolin clay used for the experiments a novel method for the application of contrasting speckle material on a clay sample is developed. This method applies the contrast material {{on the surface of the}} slurry without the need of removing the transparent window of the strongbox. Therefore tracking of the material displacements during the consolidation stage and subsequent loading stages using imaging methods is facilitated. The results of the experiments are generally in agreement with the framework reported in literature and indicate that pile installation effects, such as generation of excess pore pressure and change of the hydraulic conductivity in the soil due to remoulding, have an influence on the development on the neutral plane and therefore the prediction of the response of <b>floating</b> <b>piles.</b> Additionally, the results can be used to benchmark numerical calculations with advanced constitituve models.

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{located within}} consolidating ground are commonly subjected to negative skin friction (NSF) and failures of pile foundations related to dragload (compressive force) and downdrag (pile settlement) {{have been reported}} in literature. In addition, they are normally subjected to axial load and NSF simultaneously. A field study was carried out to investigate load transfer behavior of piles in end-bearing and floating 2 -pile groups in consolidating ground. Moreover, load transfer mechanisms of piles subjected to NSF was investigated in detail by centrifuge tests and axis-symmetric and three-dimensional numerical analyses to achieve three objectives: to investigate response of a single pile subjected to NSF with different pile tip locations with respect to end-bearing stratum, to study behavior of floating piles subjected to NSF with and without shielding by sacrificing piles, and, to study effects of axial load on load transfer mechanism along a single <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> and shielded center pile within a group of sacrificing piles experiencing locked-in NSF. Based on field monitoring, downdrag developed on floating piles is 70 % more than that on end-bearing piles and neutral plane (NP) is located deeper with stiffer end-bearing layer. Measured maximum β values ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 for piles located inside the end-bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> groups. Based on centrifuge tests results, the maximum dragload developed at a single end-bearing pile is 60 % more than that at a single <b>floating</b> <b>pile,</b> whereas downdrag developed on single <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> is 200 % greater than that on a single end-bearing pile. Both centrifuge and field monitoring results show larger downdrag obtained for <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> than that of end-bearing pile. From centrifuge modeling results, the measured maximum β value at a single end-bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> was similar and slightly smaller than 0. 3. On the other hand, smaller β values of 0. 1 and 0. 2 were mobilized at the shielded center piles for pile spacings of 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, respectively, where D is center pile diameter. Consistent results of β values are obtained between centrifuge modeling and fielding monitoring. The use of a constant β value to estimate dragload on piles will not be realistic as a single β value cannot take into account of the reduction of dragload at the lower part of a pile. Based on centrifuge tests results, NP of a single <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> was located at around 0. 75 L, where L is embedded pile length into clay stratum. This is consistent with the results as obtained by theoretical solutions, which ranged from 0. 63 - 0. 80 L. The location of NP of shielded center piles {{does not appear to be}} significantly affected by the presence of sacrificing piles. The measured maximum dragload of the center pile in the group at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing was only 53 % and 75 % of the measured maximum dragload of an isolated single pile, respectively. Correspondingly, the measured downdrag of the center pile was reduced to about 57 % and 80 % of that of the isolated single pile. Deduced ultimate pile capacity of shielded center pile is smaller than that of a single pile. The closer the pile spacing inside the groups, the larger is the reduction in dragload, downdrag as well as ultimate pile capacity of the center pile. This can be explained by numerical simulations of centrifuge modeling. Sacrificing piles "hang-up" the soil between the piles in the group and thus, the vertical and horizontal effective stress in the soil acting on the center pile are reduced. At the same time, smaller confining pressure at the pile tip of a center pile located inside the group causes the smaller soil stiffness and shear strength of soil, so as the ultimate pile capacity of the shielded center pile...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} regional development has led engineers to find safe ways {{to construct the}} infrastructure of transportation on soft soils. Soft soil {{is not able to}} sustain external loads without having large deformations. The geotechnical properties of soft soil which is known for its low bearing capacity, high water content, high compressibility and long term settlement as well. In pavement engineering, either highway or runway as an infrastructure, a pavement encompasses three important parts namely traffic load, pavement and subgrade. Traffic load generated from tire pressure of vehicle and/or airplane wheels are usually around 550 kPa even more {{on the surface of the}} pavement. Pavement generally comprises granular materials with unbounded or bounded materials located between traffic load and subgrade, distributing the load to surface of subgrade. One of the promising soil improvement techniques is a piled embankment. When geosynthetics layer is unrolled over piles, it is known as geosynthetics supported piled embankment. Particularly in deep soft soil, when piles do not reach a hard stratum due to large thickness of the soft soil, the construction is an embankment on <b>floating</b> <b>piles.</b> Furthermore, because of different stiffness between piles and subsoil, soil arching effect would be developed there. By using Finite Element analysis, some findings resulted from experimental works and several field tests around the world as field case studies are verified. Some important findings are as follows: the stress concentration ratio is not a single value, but it would be changed depending on the height of embankment, consolidation process of subsoil, surcharge of traffic load, and tensile modulus of geosynthetics as well. Ratio height of embankment to clear piles spacing (h/s) around 1. 4 can be used as a critical value to distinguish between low embankment and high embankment. When geosynthetics is applied to reinforce a pavement/embankment, the vertical distance of geosynthetics layers and number of geosynthetics layers depend on the quality of pavement material. The lower layer of geosynthetics withstands a tensile stress higher than upper layer. Primary reinforcements for geosynthetics in piled embankments are located at span between piles with maximum strains at zones of adjacent piles. Traffic load that passes through on the surface of the pavement can reduce the soil arching, but it can be restored during the off peak hours. Settlements of embankments on <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> can accurately be modelled using the consolidation calculation type, whereas the end-bearing piles may be used the plastic calculation type. Longer piles can be effectively applied to reduce a creep.

30|$|Use of {{granular}} piles, GP, in weak soils (e.g., soft {{clay and}} loose sand) {{is now a}} well known ground improvement technique. In case of loose granular soil, the provision of granular pile enhances the bearing capacity of foundation and reduces its total and differential settlements. However, in case of soft cohesive soil, it has an additional advantage of providing a drainage path, which increases the rate of consolidation. Granular piles may be fully penetrated and resting on strong soil layer (i.e., end bearing granular piles, EBGP) or partially penetrated (i.e., <b>floating</b> granular <b>piles,</b> FGP).

40|$|Simple {{methods of}} {{analysis}} are developed for computing the dynamic steady-state axial response of <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> groups embedded in homogeneous and non-homogeneous soil deposits. Physically-motivated approximations are introduced {{to account for the}} interaction between two individual piles. It is found that such an interaction arises chiefly from the 'interference' of wave fields originating along each pile shaft and spreading outward. For homogeneous deposits the wave fronts originating at an individual pile are cylindrical and the interaction is essentially independent of pile flexibility and slenderness. For non-homogeneous deposits the wave fronts are non-cylindrical and ray-theory approximations are invoked to derive pile flexibility-dependent interaction functions. Results are presented for the dynamic stiffness and damping of several pile groups, as well as for distribution of the applied load among individual piles. For deposits with modulus proportional to depth, the agreement with the few rigorous solutions available is encouraging. A comprehensive parameter study focuses on the effects of soil inhomogeneity and pile-group configuration. It is demonstrated that the 'dynamic group efficiency' may far exceed unity at certain frequencies. Increasing soil inhomogeneity tends to reduce the respective resonant peaks and lead to smoother interaction functions, in qualitative agreement with field evidence...|$|E

40|$|Large structures, such as {{offshore}} platforms, {{wind turbine}} foundations, wide buildings, bridges, and railway granular embankments, are often supported by pile foundations. These structures are usually subjected to large cyclic loads (in axial, lateral, and torsional modes) arising from actions of waves, ship impacts, or moving trains. Significant torsional cyclic forces {{can be transferred}} to the foundation piles due to the eccentricity of the lateral loads. In the past, several theoretical and experimental investigations were carried out on piles under axial and lateral cyclic loads; however, study of the influence of torsional cyclic loads on pile foundations is rather limited. This paper presents a novel numerical model based on the boundary element approach to analyze the response of a single, vertical, <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> subjected to torsional cyclic load. The nonlinear stress-strain response of soil is incorporated, and the pile material was idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic. The effect of progressive degradation of soil strength and stiffness under cyclic stress reversal is incorporated in the numerical method. Apart from predicting the degradation of torsional pile-soil interactive performance, the profiles for shear stress and angle of twist are also captured by the proposed solution. Validation of the model indicates the suitability and accuracy of the proposed solutions. The frequency, amplitude, and number of cycles play significant roles in torsional cyclic response of piles. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies on single piles under torsional cyclic loading, and important conclusions are drawn from there...|$|E
40|$|Torsional loads on pile {{foundations}} are induced {{by the action of}} eccentric horizontal forces on the supporting structures. Such loading not only initiates twisting at the pile head but also reduces its axial capacity significantly with increased settlement of the foundation. Several theoretical and experimental investigations have already been carried out on piles under torsional load, as evidenced by the available literature on the subject, although contributions on the influence of combined torsional and axial loads on {{pile foundations}} are rather limited. This paper presents a novel numerical model (boundary-element method) to analyze the response of a single vertical <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> subjected to simultaneous torsional and axial loads. The nonlinear stress-strain response of soil has been incorporated in the model by means of the hyperbolic model, whereas the pile material has been idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic. The effect of progressive pile-soil slippage at the interface is considered. Apart from predicting the load-displacement response and incremental angle of twist of piles under combined torsional and axial loading, the shear-stress profiles and the effect of vertical loads on the torsional capacity of the piles are some of the salient features captured by the proposed model. Validation of the proposed model by means of a comparison with existing models and experimental data indicates the suitability and accuracy of the solutions developed. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies on piles in clay, sand, and layered soil, and important conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|Behaviour of the pile-soil {{interface}} {{is important}} to correctly predict the response of <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> in terms of displacement and lateral friction. Regarding energy piles, which couple the structural roles of deep foundations with the principle of shallow geothermal energy, the response of pile-soil interfaces is influenced by seasonal and daily cyclic thermal variations. Accordingly, {{the goal of this}} paper is to experimentally investigate the response of the pile-soil interface at different temperatures. This experimental campaign aims to analyse (i) the cyclic mobilization of the shear strength of the soil-pile interface that is induced by thermal deformation of the pile and (ii) the direct influence of temperature variations on the soil and soil-pile interface behaviour. In this study, a direct shear device was developed and calibrated for nonisothermal soil-structure interface testing. It appears that the sand-concrete interface was affected by cyclic degradation but not affected directly by temperature. Conversely, the response of the clay-concrete interface changed at different temperatures, showing an increase of strength with increasing temperature, presumably due to the effects of temperature on clay deformation...|$|R
40|$|The pile {{load testing}} methods could be broadly {{classified}} into three categories: static, rapid and dynamic {{depending on the}} rate of loading. In this paper, the rapid load testing method {{referred to as the}} Statnamic test is discussed. The commonly used analysis method of the statnamic testing referred to as the Unloading Point (UP) method is used successfully for the <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> but validity of some of the assumptions of the unloading point method to end bearing bored piles is questionable. Due to this problem, other analytical methods such as: Modified Unloading Point (MUP) method, Segmental Unloading Point (SUP) method and other signal matching techniques are introduced by some researches. Therefore, the validity of the unloading point method to rock socketed end bearing bored piles in Sri Lanka is investigated in this paper. This investigation is carried out using the commonly used wave number. Furthermore, the wave equation method, commonly used numerical procedure to model dynamic behavior of piles, is used by the author to investigate the validity of the assumptions associated with the unloading point method to rock socketed end bearing bored piles...|$|R
