This results in a number of industrial residues with high contents of these phytochemicals. With the aim of supporting the development of profitable industrial procedures for γ-oryzanol and tocopherol recovery, the contents of these phytochemicals in all the residues produced during RBO refining were evaluated. The samples included residues from the degumming, soap precipitation, bleaching earth filtering, dewaxing and deodorisation distillation steps. The highest phytochemical concentrations were found in the precipitated soap for γ-oryzanol (14. 2 mgg− 1, representing 95. 3 % of total γ-oryzanol in crude RBO), and in the deodorisation distillate for tocopherols (576 mg 100 g− 1, representing 6. 7 % of total tocopherols in crude RBO).
