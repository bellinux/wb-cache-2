5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. At last, the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as {{he was telling the truth}} and plunges into the sky.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Lullaby, Streator is the reader's only narrator. True to his {{journalist}} occupation, he is {{detailed in}} many of his descriptions of the events going on around him. At the same time, Streator tends to be philosophical and cynical about {{the world around him}} and the people he meets, probably because of the tragedies that have haunted him for many years. In regards to the actual sequence and happenings of events, he seems to be a reliable narrator. But often his philosophical asides seem to overshadow his duty as a balanced narrator. At times, it is frustrating not knowing the true motives of Helen, Mona, or Oyster and, by the end, it is apparent that Streator could not always be trusted. But the nature of the story insists that we only get one perspective; one man retelling the past that has resulted in the present. Streator himself knows the issues with how <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> the story, but in his recognition of the potential problems of a first person perspective, he becomes a more reliable narrator.|$|E

500|$|The title Wildlife is not {{derived from}} lyrics from the album, but from themes that connect the songs. Dreyer regards {{wildlife}} as [...] "an all-encompassing word to sum everything up", {{and he has}} said that [...] "we all witness tragedy and change. It's the summation of our existence." [...] On the inside of the album cover the words [...] "To – for everything" [...] are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out. It has been speculated by some that the word is the name 'Helen'. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt when asked about the dedication replied [...] "That’s Jordan’s story to tell, and not mine. [...] It does have significance to a story <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling.</b> You will probably hear {{a little bit more about}} that in future work, Jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} Wenger's arrival in October 1996 that Arsenal reemerged as a serious league competitor. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything." [...] His observation irked Ferguson, who replied: [...] "He has no experience of English football. He has come here from Japan, and now <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> everyone how to organise our football. Unless you have been in the situation and had the experience then he should keep his mouth shut, firmly shut." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{surviving}} a bite {{from the}} Infected, Ellie is tasked to Joel to be escorted to the Fireflies. Initially annoyed by Joel's surliness, Ellie starts {{to feel a}} strong attachment to him. After experiencing a traumatizing encounter in the Winter, in which Ellie is nearly raped and murdered by a band of cannibals, she becomes withdrawn and introverted. When Joel finally gets her to the Fireflies, it is discovered {{that she has a}} mutant strain of the Cordyceps fungus growing on her brain, which may be used to create a vaccine; in order to extract the fungi, an operation on Ellie's brain is required, that will likely kill her. While she is being prepared for surgery, Joel makes his way to the operating room and carries her to safety. When Ellie awakens from unconsciousness, Joel lies by telling her that the Fireflies found many other subjects, and had stopped looking for a cure. Ellie later confronts him about it, demanding to know the truth. When he reassures her that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> the truth, she replies with [...] "Okay".|$|E

However, upon learning {{that he intends to}} leave her with his brother Tommy and return to Boston, she runs away. She later confronts him demanding that he not abandon her. This strengthens the bond between them, and they continue their journey. After experiencing a traumatizing encounter in the Winter, where Ellie is nearly raped and murdered by a band of cannibals and their leader David, she becomes withdrawn and introverted. When Joel finally gets her to the Fireflies, it is discovered that Ellie requires an operation to remove the mutant strain of the Cordyceps fungus growing on her brain, which may be used to create a vaccine; the operation will likely kill her. While she is being prepared for surgery, Joel kills Marlene and the Fireflies, makes his way to the operating room, and carries Ellie to safety. Because she was unconscious during the battle, Ellie is unaware of what has transpired. As they leave the hospital, Joel lies about the events, telling her that the Fireflies had found many other subjects, and had stopped looking for a cure. When Ellie later confronts him about it, describing her survivor's guilt and demanding to know the truth, Joel reassures her that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> the truth; she replies [...] "Okay".|$|E
500|$|Brian, {{walking in}} drunk, notices that Stewie has resumed {{watching}} Jolly Farm Revue, after previously swearing off {{the show in}} [...] "Road to Europe". Remembering a story {{he had seen in}} the local newspaper, Brian tells Stewie about upcoming auditions for an American version of the show. Jumping at the opportunity, the two show up to the auditions, but quickly learn {{that there is only one}} female role remaining. Determined to win a spot on the show, Stewie decides to cross-dress as a woman, naming his new identity [...] "Karina Smirnoff". Beginning his audition, he starts by telling a completely fabricated story. Convincing the producers that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> a true tale, he wins the role. The next morning, on the first day of filming, Stewie as Karina introduces himself to the rest of the cast, and quickly falls in love with a female co-star named Julie. Another co-star, Randall, objects to the new role that Karina was cast to play, and takes Julie away from him to prevent their friendship. As they continue shooting, however, the two develop a friendly relationship, eventually deciding to hold a sleepover, where they become even closer. The next day, Julie professes her love for Karina by wishing that she was actually a boy, causing Stewie, as Karina, to come on to her. Julie insists that she is not a lesbian, so Stewie decides to unveil his true identity to the entire cast during a live taping of the show. Shocked that Karina was actually a boy, Julie's mother refuses to let her speak to him, with Stewie left to regret his decision to come out as a cross-dresser, and decides to go get ice cream with Brian, as he can no longer wear that dress.|$|E

When Gabriel tries to inquire for more information, the Farseer shows surprise at his ignorance, commenting that the Inquisitor [...] "keeps them on a short leash". Macha implies that Toth knows more than <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>telling,</b> and advises Gabriel and Isador to ask him, before telling the Blood Ravens where to find the entrenched Chaos forces, stating that, thanks to the Space Marines, the Eldar are too weak to confront them.|$|E
