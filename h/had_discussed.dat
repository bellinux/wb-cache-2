5|$|Adams {{considered}} {{writing a}} third radio series {{to be based}} on his novel Life, the Universe and Everything in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining Hitchhiker's Guide novels So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless. These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> {{the possibilities of}} humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, {{he did not see}} space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1954.|$|E
40|$|We <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> the {{classical}} {{failure of the}} fuse system, the dielectric breakdown and the quantum breakdown in the Anderson insulators. We <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> how the extreme value statistics and the resulting Gumbel distribution arises in breakdown and failure processes, especially when the disorder concentration is low. At high concentration of disorder near the percolation threshold, we <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> how the cross-over might take place from extreme value to percolation statistics. We <b>have</b> <b>discussed</b> the system size dependence that arises at {{the distribution of the}} failure current at low disordered regime. Finally, the extension of Zener breakdown phenomenon for band insulators to the disordered-induced Anderson insulators <b>has</b> been <b>discussed.</b> Comment: An updated version will be published in "Quantum & Semiclassical Percolation & Breakdown in Disordered Solids".

5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> it with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Morison was {{interested}} {{in the history of the}} 15th century Italian printing, and <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> the topic with his correspondent, the printer Giovanni Mardersteig, in correspondence with whom he wrote a series of letters discussing Bembo's development. He also discussed the project in his letters with the Poet Laureate Robert Bridges, who had some interest in printing. For the project Morison bought a copy of De Aetna which he then sold to Monotype as a model.|$|E
5|$|On May 15, 2012, Czech website hokej.cz {{reported}} that Hašek <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> playing for Piráti Chomutov after their promotion to the Czech Extraliga.

5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command <b>had</b> <b>discussed.</b> Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Siva is Nagarjuna's 17th film as an actor. Varma {{found him}} the only actor who could {{understand}} his perspective. Nagarjuna and Varma <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> astronomy and realised that they shared similar sensibilities. That, and Varma's passion for and dedication to films, prompted Nagarjuna {{to work with}} him. Amala, who worked with Nagarjuna in Prema Yuddham (1990), {{was chosen as the}} female lead. Siva was the first film in her career where the script was explained shot by shot. When Varma approached Rohini to dub Amala's portions, she agreed to dub for Amala only after watching about three reels of footage.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Republican convention, Taft and Roosevelt <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> which cabinet {{officers}} would stay on. Taft kept only Agriculture Secretary James Wilson and Postmaster General George von Lengerke Meyer (who was {{shifted to the}} Navy Department). Others appointed to the Taft cabinet included Philander Knox, who had served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Attorney General, as the new Secretary of State, and Franklin MacVeagh as Treasury Secretary.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, which was completed at the London School of Economics, and builds upon subjects he <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> in previous publications, including his first book. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found a middle ground between traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Urban responded favourably, perhaps {{hoping to}} heal the Great Schism of forty years earlier, and to reunite the Church under papal primacy by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need. Alexios and Urban had {{previously}} been in close contact in 1089 and after, and <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> openly {{the prospect of the}} (re)union of the Christian church. There were signs of considerable co-operation between Rome and Constantinople in the years immediately before the crusade.|$|E
5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} a life sentence, did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E

5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals {{were well aware of}} the threat that Tung posed; they <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of the}} air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace.

5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|In week six, on Day 39, Big Brother told Siavash and Dogface that, {{because they}} <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> {{nominations}} {{earlier in the}} week, they would face eviction if they uttered a single profanity before 3 p.m. They both failed and therefore faced the public vote, along with Karly and Noirin who received the most nominations. The shopping task consisted of nine separate challenges from previous editions of Big Brother, in which housemates had to compete against former contestants (see the week seven shopping task section). The housemates failed to pass the required number of challenges and therefore failed the overall task. On Day 44, five new housemates, Kenneth, Bea, David, Hira and Tom entered the House and Karly became the seventh person to be evicted with 50.4% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers <b>had</b> <b>discussed</b> their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E
