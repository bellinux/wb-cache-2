40|$|The NTS-II Laser Retroreflector {{consists}} of a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>tray</b> onto which are mounted 44 fused silica cube corners with a 50 -millimeter hexagonal entrance pupil and single infrared cube. A thermal shield with a highly reflective outer surface and a black inner surface was incorporated to shroud the assembly protecting it from extreme high temperature exposure thus reducing cube corner thermal distortions to a minimum. A dummy retroreflector, utilizing simulated aluminum cube corners was fabricated and vibration tested to qualification levels to substantiate {{the integrity of the}} tray and cube mounting clips. This dummy was further used in the spacecraft spin balance test. The flight Laser Retroreflector was tested to the flight level vibration spectrum to verify that the unit will survive its expected vibration environment. During this test several GFE cube corners exhibited slight crazing at the clip support mounting holes. These cubes were reworked and retested and proved to be satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of firing positions on the bonding strength of metal ceramic restorations. For this purpose a series of six SCHWICKERATH discs was prepared on the <b>honeycomb</b> firing <b>tray</b> {{and a series of}} six SCHWICKERATH discs on the ceramic firing tray in three different ceramic furnaces (Vacumat® 300, Programat® P 90, Vario Press® 300). The series was labelled according to position (rear, right, front, left, middle) : rear series, right series, front series, left series, middle 1 series, middle 2 series. A series, therefore, consisted of six test specimens whereby each of them underwent the separate firing processes in the same firing positions. This was achieved by appropriately labelling the test specimens so that any confusion was eliminated. In addition, two series in position middle 1 in the furnace Programat® P 90 were prepared which, unlike all the other series, were not fired according to the manufacturer‘s instructions, but fired with + 20 °C or - 20 °C respectively, from all of the firings according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. The bond strength was tested using the SCHWICKERATH-test which is defined in DIN EN ISO 9693 [DIN, 2000] and is established as a suitable method of determining the bond strength in the German speaking world [DÖRFLER et al., 1995]. All of the tested shear bond strength values, including those that deviated from the firing temperatures in the manufacturer‘s instructions were, without exception, above the minimum specification of 25 MPa. Most of the series did not vary significantly. The significant variations could not be explained by the different firing positions. The cause was rather more to do with practice in manufacturing test specimens and associated greater shear bond strength, along with the concomitant decrease in standard deviation. Each time a comparison of the furnaces revealed a significant variation only in furnace Programat® P 90 with the ceramic tray, as described above. In summary, it can be asserted that the firing position in the furnace had no influence on the bonding strength. Similarly, the type of firing tray or furnace used had no effect on the bond strength. The visual impact on the aesthetic appearance was also assessed along with the bond strength. This showed that the firing conditions which differed from the manufacturer‘s instructions had an effect on the gloss characteristics of the ceramic. Series + 20 °C showed a more pronounced gloss characteristic of the ceramic, series 20 °C less gloss characteristic with a duller appearance, than the series fired according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The test specimens fired according to the manufacturer‘s instructions for the various firing positions, furnaces and firing trays showed no visual variations. Prior to the clinical application of known furnace fired metal ceramic restorations, the influence of the firing position on the bonding of the ceramic should be investigated. Furthermore, the influence of the firing position on the metal ceramic bonding under varying temperature conditions and after storage in a corrosive solution should be ascertained before clinical use can be recommended...|$|R
