5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on <b>headroom,</b> which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with <b>headroom</b> of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|In {{a couple}} of Lexus firsts, the {{fifth-generation}} LS is the first Lexus sedan to feature a six-sided window design, while the flush-surface windows integrate smoothly with the pillars. In the companyâ€™s efforts to reconcile two conflicting goals, sufficient <b>headroom</b> with a low roofline, the new LS employs an available outer-slide-type panoramic moonroof instead of the conventional, internally retracting item.|$|E
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is <b>headroom.</b> <b>Headroom</b> can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process. Closure notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the <b>headroom</b> limitations {{on the line and}} the closure was quietly dropped.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient <b>headroom</b> for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{refectory}} (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted <b>headroom</b> due to its raised floor.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} <b>headroom,</b> high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} an {{animated}} talk show host was not entirely new. Hand-drawn animation was used to bring Space Ghost {{to life in the}} 1994 talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast. An earlier similar gimmick was used in the British talk and music video show The Max Talking <b>Headroom</b> Show, featuring Max <b>Headroom.</b> Max, however, was not computer-generated but was realised by a clever mixture of prosthetic costuming and video effects, and was also able to interact with his guests.|$|E
25|$|The Toronado's UPP {{enabled the}} {{interior}} {{to have a}} completely flat floor, but interior space (primarily rear seat <b>headroom)</b> was somewhat restricted by the fastback styling.|$|E
25|$|The {{vessel was}} built using old, {{traditional}} techniques, {{and it was}} made {{as close to the}} original as possible. One small change was that the <b>headroom</b> of the deck was increased by 10cm, since today's seamen are taller than their ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Though {{small in}} terms of {{accommodation}} in comparison with modern boats with wider beams and greater <b>headroom,</b> the compact cabin of the Contessa resulted from the low, narrow-beamed design that emphasized rough weather handling and seaworthiness {{at the expense of}} cabin space.|$|E
25|$|The Delta 9 as {{described}} in Flight was expected to carry 36 passengers in two side wing cabins for a gross weight of 38,000lb on three 1,000hp engines. The cabins were expected {{to have at least}} a 6-foot <b>headroom</b> but lacked side windows.|$|E
25|$|In the interior, the rear-seat and {{headliner}} are redesigned to {{add more}} rear legroom and <b>headroom,</b> improving comfort, additional sound insulation is added and the cupholders are larger. A rear camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system now comes with the Navi system. Furthermore, the gauge cluster is refreshed.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Portillo made a {{documentary}} {{as part of}} the BBC <b>Headroom</b> campaign, which explored mental health issues. Portillo's documentary Michael Portillo: Death of a School Friend explores how the suicide of Portillo's classmate Gary Findon affected Findon's parents, brother, music teachers, schoolteachers, classmates, and Portillo himself. The programme was originally broadcast on 7 November 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} reused the Thames Tunnel, {{built by}} Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel between 1825 and 1843 for horse-drawn carriages. The tunnel, with generous <b>headroom</b> and two carriageways separated by arches, connected Wapping {{on the north}} bank of the Thames with Rotherhithe on the south bank. A triumph of civil engineering, it was a commercial failure and by the 1860s it had become an unpleasant and disreputable place.|$|E
25|$|Production of the Mark G {{began in}} August 1961 and {{initially}} the Bond 250 G Minicar {{was the only}} version available. The new style roof offered several inches more <b>headroom</b> and incorporated a backward-slanted rear window of the type popularised in the UK by the Ford Anglia. This was initially mirrored by nominal fibreglass tailfins inserted into the aluminium rear wings before the wings became entirely made from fibreglass.|$|E
25|$|ANA {{surveyed}} 800 {{passengers who}} flew the 787 from Tokyo to Frankfurt: expectations were surpassed for 90% of passengers; features that met or exceeded expectations included air quality and cabin pressure (90% of passengers), cabin ambiance (92% of passengers), higher cabin humidity levels (80% of passengers), <b>headroom</b> (40% of passengers) {{and the larger}} windows (90% of passengers). 25% said they would {{go out of their}} way to again fly on the 787.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{designed}} the fourth generation {{with much more}} conservative styling in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, the car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, increasing trunk space by another two cubic feet. The roof was also given a more upright stance to increase <b>headroom,</b> which can be evidenced by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between {{the tops of the}} doors and the top of the roof.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} is a paneled door {{set in a}} plain wooden surround. It opens into a central hall with a stone wall {{on the north side}} and a partition wall and enclosed staircase to the basement and attic on the south. The floors are timber; the ceilings have exposed beams which have in some instances been shaved and planed to create <b>headroom.</b> There is a large living room to the north, and two smaller rooms to the south.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 {{model was}} {{extensively}} redone and downsized, like the Delta 88. The new models, at around 4000 pounds curb weight, were over 800 pounds lighter, but <b>headroom</b> and rear seat legroom were increased compared to equivalent 1976 models. The 455CID engine {{was replaced by}} the smaller 403CID V8. The Oldsmobile 350 V8 was now the standard engine. The Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 139,423. A four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop coupe were available.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Ford {{launched}} the fourth-generation Ford Taurus {{to replace the}} third generation. Although the doors and mechanical parts were carried over, this generation was designed with a more conservative design in hopes of increasing its appeal to customers. This new shape contained a more upright trunk and rear roof panel, of which increased <b>headroom</b> and trunk space substantially. This generation also contained a redesigned interior that sported a more conservative look, while retaining many features offered in the third generation.|$|E
25|$|The AOA {{apparently}} {{looked at}} two options, using {{two of the}} s' 34 MW S6W reactors, and halving {{one of the two}} 550 MW(th) A4W reactors used in s. The first option would not even match Zumwalt for power, while the second option probably would not fit into the Zumwalt hull. On the other hand, it would give plenty of <b>headroom</b> for future weapon systems such as directed-energy weapons and railguns, hence the proposal for the BMD ship of a larger hull with nuclear propulsion.|$|E
25|$|A {{cut-away}} static replica (see photo above) {{was built}} in 1935 and displayed for many years next to the original at London's Science Museum, and in 1979 a further, working replica Rocket was built by Locomotion Enterprises in the Springwell workshops at the Bowes Railway for the 150th anniversary celebrations. It has a shorter chimney than the original to clear the bridge at Rainhill: the trackbed is deeper than in the 19th century, giving less <b>headroom.</b> Both of these replicas are now based at the National Railway Museum, York.|$|E
25|$|Although the '77 Buick LeSabre was {{considerably}} smaller on the outside, <b>headroom,</b> rear seat legroom and trunk space were {{increased over the}} much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built V6 and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.|$|E
25|$|The Concord {{also came}} with {{numerous}} standard comfort and upscale features, gaining an inch (25.4mm) of rear seat <b>headroom,</b> {{as well as}} two additional inches (50.8mm) of rear passenger legroom. An advantage of using the aging and heavy Hornet design was its body stiffness and safety performance. Crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) showed the probability of injury in a struck vehicle to range from a low of nine percent for the four-door AMC Concord to a high of 97 percent for the two-door Nissan Sentra.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans to}} make the final part of the river navigable again, {{as part of a}} scheme to create a {{non-tidal}} route from King's Lynn to the Great Ouse, which included a marina at Boal Quay and a sea lock near the final sluice. It would have been part of a much larger regeneration project for the south of the town, and the river would have been linked to the Great Ouse Flood Relief Channel, which currently terminates at a sluice a little to the south of the A47 road. Various routes for the connecting link were considered, but the preferred route was to utilise the flood diversion channel, constructed in 2001. This would have been enlarged, and the two bridges, located on Thiefgate Lane and the bank of the Flood Relief Channel, would have been rebuilt to provide more <b>headroom.</b> However, the non-tidal link was eventually abandoned, as there were concerns over environmental issues, the channel was thought to be too narrow to accommodate boats travelling in opposite directions, and some of the bridges would not have provided sufficient <b>headroom.</b> The scheme was modified to include a lock {{from the end of the}} flood relief channel back into the Ouse, with the sea lock and marina being retained. These plans have since been deferred, due to the change in the financial situation and the collapse of land values.|$|E
25|$|The Sabre was {{a hybrid}} vehicle, with the turret from a Fox Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle on a FV101 Scorpion hull and {{armed with the}} same 30mm RARDEN cannon as the Scimitar. One hundred and thirty-six of these hybrid {{vehicles}} were brought into service in 1995, after some modifications {{were made to the}} turret. These modifications included; redesigning the smoke grenade dischargers, replacing the standard machine gun with a L94A1 chain gun and domed hatches to improve <b>headroom</b> for the commander and gunner. They were assigned to the reconnaissance platoons of armoured and mechanised infantry battalions before being withdrawn from service in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the steering wheel {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that rear <b>headroom</b> was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls on the steering wheel cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the early}} TG freight and {{passenger}} cars were built by Dickey, Neill and Company at the Beverley Street Foundry, Toronto. The Company was a substantial investor in the TG The first passenger cars were notable in having a compound curved roof with a high centre section giving extra <b>headroom</b> over the centre gangway; an arrangement often seen on horse-drawn streetcars of the period. Some later freight cars were built by the James Crossen Works, of Cobourg. Four larger and more luxurious passenger cars were obtained in 1874 from Jackson and Sharp of Wilmington, Delaware.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{using the}} river today {{consists}} of private cruisers making {{the journey to}} Jesus Lock, with the section above Baits Bite lock regularly in use by the University rowing clubs, both for practice and for races. Motorised craft can navigate along the Backs in winter, but <b>headroom</b> is severely restricted. The Conservators of the River Cam now have {{an office in the}} former lock-keepers cottage at Baits Bite, while the house at Clayhithe is now the residence of the foreman of the Conservators. The Conservators are still responsible for the river above Bottisham lock, while the lower river has been managed by the Environment Agency since its creation in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Shure is {{credited}} with several industry firsts. In 1948, the company introduced the 900MG, the first phonograph cartridge capable of playing both long-playing and 78 rpm records, and in 1954, Shure's M12 Dynetic Phono Reproducer tonearm and cartridge set established an industry standard with a tracking force of only one gram. The M1 Studio Dynetic Cartridge introduced the principle of a moving magnet within a stationary coil, an engineering concept that dominated cartridge design for nearly 25 years due to its higher output, lower noise, and greater <b>headroom.</b> The Shure M3D, introduced in 1958, was the first ever stereo moving magnet cartridge, with 20dB of stereo separation at 20kHz.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the roof}} of the Froghall tunnel has always been {{extremely}} low, the 2003 restoration included lowering the water level in the pound after dredging, and thus the <b>headroom</b> in the tunnel was improved to 5ft (1.52m) with a beam of 6ft 8ins (2.03m). Unfortunately the new moorings just past the tunnel remain relatively little used, as many modern boats are still too high to pass through the tunnel. A height profile gauge is located at the exit of Flintmill Lock 17 to indicate if a boat has sufficient clearance to pass through the tunnel. The low height restriction would similarly affect proposals to reopen stretches of the Uttoxeter Canal to boating.|$|E
25|$|Bombardier's Board of Directors {{authorized}} {{marketing the}} aircraft on 15 March 2005, seeking firm commitments from potential customers, suppliers and government partners prior to program launch. The C110 was planned to weigh 133,200lb (60,420kg) at MTOW {{and have a}} length of 114.7ft (35 m), while the C130 should be 125.3ft (38.2 m) long and have a 146,000lb (66,226kg) MTOW. It would have 3-by-2 standard seating and 4-abreast business class, 7ft (2.1 m) stand-up <b>headroom,</b> fly-by-wire and side stick controls. 20 percent of the aircraft weight would be in composite materials for the center and rear fuselages, tail cone, empennage and wings. First flight was planned for 2008 and entry into service in 2010.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 15 November 1999 a new train entered service, made up {{of seven}} (later eight) British Rail Mark 2 cars and the second former Southerner modular 11kW power and baggage van, with 90kW {{generator}} and larger luggage space made up from the middle and expanded non-handbrake end compartments. The new cars are about three metres longer than the older cars and more spacious inside, with more <b>headroom,</b> full air-conditioning, 60 seats per car (28 in the servery car), and twin power sockets {{at the foot of}} each pair of seats. Seating arrangement is both alcove and airline-style, using their British Rail InterCity 72 seats. Since October 2016, fire suppressed DFB class locomotives have been assigned to the service.|$|E
25|$|When {{the third}} {{generation}} Taurus debuted, it was hurt by criticism of its design, which was formed from oval derived design elements. The design was very controversial, and it strongly limited {{the appeal of the}} car. As a result, for the fourth generation Taurus, Ford designed it with a more subdued, angular design, as part of Ford's New Edge styling, in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, this car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, which greatly increased trunk space. The roof was also raised into a more upright stance to increase <b>headroom,</b> which can be seen by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} {{remaining}} complaints with the Merlin-powered aircraft was a poor rearward view. The canopy structure, which was the same as the Allison-engined Mustangs, was made up of flat, framed panels; the pilot gained access, or exited the cockpit by lowering the port side panel and raising the top panel to the right. The canopy could not be opened in flight and tall pilots especially, were hampered by limited <b>headroom.</b> In order to at least partially improve the view from the Mustang, the British had field-modified some Mustangs with clear, sliding canopies called Malcolm hoods (designed by Robert Malcolm), and whose design had also been adopted by the U.S. Navy's own F4U-1D version of the Corsair in April 1944.|$|E
