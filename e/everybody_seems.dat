25|$|Father Flood informs Eilis that Rose {{has died}} {{suddenly}} of an undisclosed illness. After a trans-Atlantic phone call reveals {{her mother is}} struggling to cope, Eilis returns home for a visit. Tony insists that they must get married first without telling family or friends. In Ireland, <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to be conspiring to keep Eilis from leaving. Her best friend is getting married a week after her scheduled return journey, and her mother has already accepted the invitation on her behalf. She fills in part-time at her late sister's old bookkeeping job, {{which leads to the}} possibility of a full-time job. She goes on dates with an eligible and well-off bachelor. Eilis starts to feel that she now has a future in Ireland that did not exist when she left and stops opening the letters she receives from Tony.|$|E
500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] had an {{accompanying}} music video, {{made up of}} clips from the film, with the lyrics often matching the images. Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions, a company that pioneered in movie tie-in music videos during the 1980s, created this video from edited footage of the movie, directed by Susan Seidelman. This was done because there were five Madonna videos already on power rotation on MTV, and Warner Bros. {{did not want the}} audience to be saturated with any new video. Hence, they decided to use the shots from the film and made a music video. During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna commented: [...] "'Into the Groove' is another song I feel retarded singing, but <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to like it." ...|$|E
500|$|Flanagan {{promoted}} the Marngrook theory {{in his novel}} The Call (1996), an historical imagining into Wills' life, and argued in an essay addressed to Wills {{that he must have}} known Aboriginal games as it was in his nature to play: [...] "There's two things about you <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to have agreed on—you'd drink with anyone and you'd play with anyone." [...] He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendent of Horace Wills (Tom's brother), who said a family story had been passed down about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy. Family historian T. S. Wills Cooke disputed that such a story existed, calling the Marngrook link [...] "a bridge too far" [...] and a politically correct attempt to rewrite hsitory. Despite a lack of hard evidence in its favour, the theory is often presented as factual. In Moyston, the self-proclaimed birthplace of Australian football, stands an AFL-endorsed monument, unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills' childhood in the area playing Marngrook.|$|E

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. <b>Everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to know a little bit about everything and that's how we process information now. This just reflects that." ...|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower had {{supported}} nuclear testing after World War II. In 1947, he rejected arguments by Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's chief physician, concerning the detrimental {{health effects of}} atmospheric testing, agreeing instead with James Bryant Conant, a chemist and participant in the Manhattan Project, who was skeptical of Warren's then-theoretical claims. Warren's arguments were lent credence {{in the scientific community}} and public by the Castle Bravo test of 1954. Eisenhower, as president, first explicitly expressed interest in a comprehensive test ban that year, arguing before the National Security Council, [...] "We could put [...] on the spot if we accepted a moratorium... <b>Everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to think that we're skunks, saber-rattlers and warmongers. We ought not miss any chance to make clear our peaceful objectives." [...] Then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had responded skeptically to the limited arms-control suggestion of Nehru, whose proposal for a test ban was discarded by the National Security Council for being [...] "not practical." [...] Harold Stassen, Eisenhower's special assistant for disarmament, argued that the US should prioritize a test ban as a first step towards comprehensive arms control, conditional on the Soviet Union accepting on-site inspections, over full disarmament. Stassen's suggestion was dismissed by others in the administration over fears that the Soviet Union would be able to conduct secret tests. On the advice of Dulles, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Lewis Strauss, and Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, Eisenhower rejected the idea of considering a test ban outside general disarmament efforts. During the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections, Eisenhower fended off challenger Adlai Stevenson, who ran in large part on support for a test ban.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps the sourest review {{came from}} Ron Rosenbaum. Writing in the New York Observer, Rosenbaum called Modern Times, [...] "a wildly overhyped disappointment... The new album is {{possibly}} the worst since Self Portrait, with songs that rarely {{rise above the}} level of Dylan's low point—and <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> afraid to say so." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, Savage {{was living}} in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a manager at a local video store that {{specialized}} in independent film titles. He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of The Onion, who {{announced that he was}} moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled The Stranger. Savage [...] "made the offhand comment that forever altered [...] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate 'em, but <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to read 'em'." [...] Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job.|$|E

60|$|They {{drew the}} house form-rooms, {{accounting}} for every {{junior and senior}} against whom they had suspicions; investigated, at Beetle's suggestion, the lavatories and box-rooms, but without result. <b>Everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to be present save Clewer.|$|R
60|$|This {{brought an}} {{atmosphere}} of constraint through the house, which Flora de Barral coming down somewhat later than usual could not help noticing in her own way. <b>Everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to stare so stupidly somehow; she feared a dull day.|$|R
60|$|All the {{witnesses}} made written {{record of the}} immense historical birth--the first justification {{of a line of}} movable type by machinery--and also set down the hour and the minute.

60|$|His {{voice had}} been growing hoarser, {{and there was an}} uncomfortable silence when he stopped. This was not what the men had expected, and <b>everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to feel that there was {{something}} wrong. Then Ingleby looked at Leger with a little bitter smile.|$|R
60|$|So the {{questions}} ran {{on and the}} boys had to answer as best they could. <b>Everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to be glad to learn that they had escaped from the fury of the sudden hailstorm--that is, everybody but Dudd Flockley and his new crony, Andy Yates.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{definite}} {{was said}} in her hearing about the engagement, but <b>everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to understand.

6000|$|... "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> {{happy to}} be your guest," [...] she replied, parrying, as was her custom, with a slight kind smile, and a low, sweet, unembarrassed voice, any {{personal}} allusion from Lothair of unusual energy or ardor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, dear mother," [...] said Will, commencing {{the fifth}} slice of toast, under {{pressure}} (having eaten the fourth with difficulty), [...] "you {{have not yet}} told me about this wonderful estate which <b>everybody</b> <b>seems</b> to know of except myself." ...|$|E
60|$|The dinner began quietly {{enough with}} the cowboys divided between embarrassment and {{voracious}} appetites that they evidently feared to indulge. Wine, however, loosened their tongues, and when Stillwell got up to make the speech <b>everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to expect of him they greeted him with a roar.|$|R
60|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be out}} of doors. The hollow dark {{countryside}} re-echoed like a shell with {{shouts and}} calls and excited voices.

60|$|Young Aben Hassen the Fool {{had never}} seen so much money as now belonged to him. It {{seemed to him that}} {{there was nothing in the}} world he could not enjoy. He found friends by the dozens and scores, and <b>everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> to be very fond of him.|$|R

60|$|He {{was wearing}} Mr. Butteridge's Alpine cap, {{and his little}} {{shoulders}} were in Mr. Butteridge's fur-lined overcoat, and he had responded to Mr. Butteridge's name.

60|$|Ursula's heart sank. <b>Everybody</b> <b>seemed</b> so cocksure and so bossy. How was {{she going}} to get on with such jolty, jerky, bossy people?
