25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a <b>drive-in</b> <b>bank.</b> Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had {{said he would do}} anything to get custody of his grandson, but that the only way that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E

Even with the ranger presentations eliminated, lines of visitors were long on peak-visitation days and the wait could be hours.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Pneumatic Capsule Pipeline (PCP) systems are being increasingly used for freight transportation in selected industries like mining, tunneling and also in hospitals, <b>drive-in</b> <b>banks,</b> postal centers and airports. The widespread use of large PCP systems is achieved with the use of Tubular Linear Induction Motors (TLIM). TLIMs provide a non-intrusive system for the propulsion of the capsules inside the pipes. The need for an efficient and user-interactive design procedure for a TLIM pump to be used in PCP systems has fueled this research project. A user-interactive procedure was developed to design a highly detailed and efficient TLIM which generates the required electromagnetic thrust to propel capsules at the specified rated speed over long distances. Systems based on this design were recorded to be operating at about 75 % efficiency which indicated a 7. 5 % increase in the efficiency as compared to previous designs. Future applications of such systems could involve high- speed, quiet and environmentally friendly freight and passenger transportation systems...|$|R
