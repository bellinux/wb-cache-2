5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation <b>Desert</b> <b>Storm,</b> and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation <b>Desert</b> <b>Storm</b> these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
