5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a table <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|In 1741, the 2nd Marquis of Annandale left Craigiehall to his nephew, Charles Hope-Weir (1710–1791), {{second son}} of Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. Hope-Weir {{travelled}} to Europe on the grand tour in 1754-55, taking {{with him the}} young architect Robert Adam, and was inspired to improve the Craigiehall policies on his return. A walled forecourt and the formal gardens <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> were removed. He also planted numerous trees across the estate, laid out avenues, and had several garden buildings constructed. A lake was excavated, and a new bridge over the River Almond was constructed to link the neighbouring estate of Lennie, which Hope-Weir had bought in 1750.|$|E
5|$|In the grounds, {{the only}} certain {{survivor}} from the medieval period {{is the small}} crenellated drum tower. Its original purpose is unknown. It adjoins a substantial wall that may also have origins in the 13th century. The other garden walls have unknown dates of origin but mostly pre-date around 1730, when the stables were built. All of the other buildings, including the lodge at the South entrance (1851) are Georgian or Victorian.

5|$|Rififis heist {{scene was}} based on an actual {{burglary}} that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> Un-American Activities Committee.

5|$|This came on {{the heels}} of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, {{including}} David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> Un-American Activities Committee, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer. Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in Colorado. Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1969.|$|E

Veronica calls Mac to help her break into the WiFi before she sees Pete <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The ATF searches Norris's vehicle and finds fertilizer and a rifle, despite Veronica's convictions {{that he is not}} the perpetrator. However, Veronica recognizes them as being the same ones Ben was loading into his car earlier. Veronica calls Pete, and she tells him that she knows he falsely implicated Norris (with the help of the ATF agent) because of terrible bullying in junior high. Meg tells Veronica that Duncan has disappeared after removing $10,000 from the bank. The story involving Norris is published in the newspaper, and, although it leads to all charges against Norris being dropped, it also results in the new journalism teacher's (Joey Lauren Adams) termination.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man {{a few days before the}} murder.|$|E

5|$|The German missionary Plebot set up {{the first}} tile factory at Mangalore in 1860. It was called the Basel Mission tile factory. Mangalorean Catholics learnt the {{technique}} of preparing Mangalore tiles. The Albuquerque tile factory, the first Indian Mangalore tile factory, was started in South Canara by Pascal Albuquerque at Panemangalore in 1868. Since then, Mangalorean Catholics have been actively involved in manufacturing the tiles. The Alvares tile factory was established in Mangalore by Simon Alvares, a Mangalorean Catholic from Bombay, in 1878. In 1991–1992, out of twelve Mangalore tile manufacturing factories in Mangalore, six were owned by Christians. These tiles, prepared from hard clay, were in great demand throughout India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, and were even shipped to East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India, and still define Mangalore's skyline and characterise its urban setting. Urban and rural housing follows the traditional variety of laterite brick structures with Mangalore tile roofing on steeply sloped roofs. Inside the house, a spacious hall is present while a large verandah is present <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The traditional houses tend to have spacious porticos, red cement or terracotta floors, and have fruit trees outside the house. The old Catholic houses of South Canara bear traces of Portuguese influence. The tall windows, pointed roofs, and verandahs {{are some of the}} Portuguese influenced architectural features of the century-old houses.|$|E
5|$|The Moscow militsiya {{sealed off}} {{downtown}} Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded {{by the police}} and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who stood <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of the Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets.|$|E
