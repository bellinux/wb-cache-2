25|$|Timothy Kailing, in a 2008 Journal of Energy Security article, {{pointed out}} the {{difficulty}} of increasing production in mature petroleum regions, even with vastly increased investment in exploration and production. By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort, he claimed that very little increase of production {{could be attributed to}} increased drilling. This was due to a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort: As drilling effort increased, the energy obtained per active <b>drill</b> <b>rig</b> was reduced according to a severely diminishing power law. This analysis suggested that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to lead to significantly increased oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region like the United States.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAt present, in {{our country}} the main deep <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> are rotary disk <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> spindle-type <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> and full {{hydraulic}} motor head drive <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> and most of foreign <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> equipment are full hydraulic motor head drive <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs.</b> These rigs have many disadvantages; they cannot meet the demand of deep drilling. As the major breakthroughs {{were made in the}} development of high power permanent magnet frequency conversion motor, it is possible to develop the permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> so the efficiency of drilling can be improved. In this paper, the difficulties of deep drilling and existing problems of deep <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> are analyzed, and direct drive permanent magnet motor top-driving <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> and its parameters and characteristics are introduced.
