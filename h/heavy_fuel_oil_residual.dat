40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{modelling}} study of the rich combustion of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in a reactor packed with an inert porous medium.

Also, equilibrium calculations were performed for the experimental conditions of the study. The experimental and simulation results show that <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> is a potential fuel to produce hydrogen. It is concluded that notable characteristics of the process can be observed by simulation: the presence of an axial maximum in the production of H- 2, and positive effects of the equivalence ratio and filtration velocity increase and heat losses reduction on the fuel conversion to H- 2.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} an attempt to go further in the {{comprehension}} of the effects of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> {{in the context of an}} accidental oil spill at sea. It focuses on the link between morphological and functional impacts of realistic doses of the dissolved fraction of a <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> on fish gills. Juvenile turbot, Scophthalmus maximus were exposed to the dissolved fraction of a <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> for 5 days and then placed 30 days in clean sea water for recovery. During the contamination period, the concentration of the 16 US EPA priority poly-aromatic hydrocarbons showed small variations around a mean value of 321. 0 ± 9. 1 ng l⁻¹ (mean ± SEM). The contamination induced a 64 % increase in hepatic cytochrome P 450 1 A (Western blot analysis). Osmolality, [Na⁺] and [Cl⁻] rapidly and significantly increased (by 14, 23 and 28 % respectively) and slowly decreased to normal levels during the recovery period. At the same time, branchial histology showed decreases in the number of mucocytes (by 30 %) and of chloride cells (by 95 %) in the interlamellar epithelium. Therefore, it is suggested that the osmotic imbalance observed after the 5 days of exposure to the dissolved fraction of the <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> is the consequence of the structural alteration of the gills i. e, the strong reduction of ionocyte numbers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{accidental}} spills in European {{coastal areas}} {{have resulted in}} the release of different toxic compounds into the marine environment, such as <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> type no. 6 in the "Erika" and "Prestige" oil spills and the highly toxic styrene after the loss of the "Ievoli Sun". There is a clear need to develop tools that might allow assessing the biological impact of these accidental spills on aquatic organisms. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the short-term effects and recovery after exposure of juvenile fish (Scophthalmus maximus) to <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> no. 6 and styrene by using a battery of molecular, cell and tissue level biomarkers. Turbots were exposed to styrene for 7 days and to the diluted soluble fraction of the oil (10 %) for 14 days, and then allowed to recover in clean seawater for the same time periods. cyp 1 a 1 transcript was overexpressed in turbots after 3 and 14 days of exposure to <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas ahr transcription was not modulated after <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and styrene exposure. pparα transcription level was significantly up-regulated after 3 days of treatment with styrene. Liver activity of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) was significantly induced after 14 days of oil exposure, but it was not affected by styrene. Hepatocyte lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) was significantly reduced after exposure to both treatments, indicating that the tested compounds significantly impaired fish health. Both AOX and LMS values returned to control levels after the recovery period. No differences in gamete development were observed between fuel- or styrene- exposed fish and control fish, and vitellogenin plasma levels were low, suggesting no xenoestrogenic effects of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> or styrene. While styrene did not cause any increase in the prevalence of liver histopathological alterations, prevalence of extensive cell vacuolization increased after exposure to <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> for 14 days.
