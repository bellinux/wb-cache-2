5|$|Above Hadar are {{affluent}} neighborhoods {{such as the}} Carmel Tzarfati (French Carmel), Merkaz HaCarmel, Romema, Ahuzat Ha'Carmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, Vardiya, Ramat Golda, Ramat Alon and Hod Ha'Carmel (Denya). While {{there are}} general <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods. Another of the Carmel neighborhoods is Kababir, home to the National Headquarters of Israel's Ahmadiyya Muslim Community; located near Merkaz HaCarmel and overlooking the coast.|$|E
5|$|The 298 LT vz. 35 {{tanks were}} {{assigned}} to the armoured regiments belonging to the four Mobile (Rychlá) <b>Divisions</b> <b>between</b> 1936—39. Each regiment was supposed to detach three-tank platoons to support the infantry divisions and border areas in times of crisis. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been {{on opposite sides of}} the recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> the courts to remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it {{eventually}} led to its dissolution.|$|E

Two rifts existed, one about the military contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E

5|$|Within the Narcisseae, Narcissus (western Mediterranean) diverged from Sternbergia (Eurasia) {{some time}} in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma, with a best {{estimate}} of 23.6 Ma. Later the genus divided into the two subgenera (Hermione and Narcissus) between 27.4–16.1 Ma (21.4 Ma). The <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> the sections of Hermione then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma.|$|E

5|$|Although greatly {{obstructed}} by Ranavalona's policies, French and British {{political interests}} in Madagascar remained undiminished. <b>Divisions</b> <b>between</b> traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E

5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. <b>Divisions</b> <b>between</b> patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|Greeley, in his paper, {{initially}} {{supported the}} Whig program. As <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> Clay and President Tyler became apparent, {{he supported the}} Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of The New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.|$|E

Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed <b>divisions</b> <b>between</b> the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

While the pacifist faction carried damage control and held two toy give always for Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico, Ojeda was removed from the political branch on June 4, 1985, due to these conflicts, being only left in charge of his unit. Besides the boldness of the action, the EPB strategists were also unsatisfied when Ramírez failed to account for food expenses in his report.|$|E

5|$|The Itzas' {{continued}} resistance {{had become}} a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.

In particular, the congress stressed support for the Cuban revolution and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.|$|E

By the late 14th century the Ottoman Turks had started their conquest of Bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains.|$|E
