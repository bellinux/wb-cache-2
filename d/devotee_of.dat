He is also {{considered to be the}} composer of the Hanuman Chalisa, a popular devotional hymn dedicated to Hanuman ji,the divine <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> lord Rama.|$|E
5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{dating from}} St-Calais' {{time is the}} confraternity {{relationship}} between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais {{appears to have been}} confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais {{appears to have been a}} <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.|$|E
5|$|Barring a few {{exceptions}} where Trijata is cast as Ravana's agent, she is generally portrayed as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her adversity. On numerous occasions, she offers solace to Sita and brings news from the outside world; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide. After Rama's victory and Ravana's death, Trijata is richly rewarded by Sita and Rama. While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Rama, Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama's monkey general Hanuman, whom she bears a son. She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain; both in India.|$|E

The Buddhist goddesses Vajravārāhī and Marichi {{are believed to}} have their origins from the Hindu goddess Varahi.|$|R
25|$|Vaishnavism (Vaishnava dharma) {{is one of}} {{the major}} traditions within Hinduism along with Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. It is also called Vishnuism, its {{followers}} are called Vaishnavas, and it considers Vishnu as the Supreme Lord.

5|$|Jagadguru Rambhadracharya {{was born}} to Pandit Rajdev Mishra and Shachidevi Mishra in a Saryupareen Brahmin family of the Vasishtha Gotra (lineage of the sage Vasishtha) in Shandikhurd village in the Jaunpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India. He was born on Makara Sankranti day, 14 January 1950. Born to mother Shachidevi and father Pandit Rajdev Mishra, he was named Giridhar by his great aunt, a {{paternal}} cousin of his paternal grandfather, Pandit Suryabali Mishra. The great aunt was a <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Mirabai, a female saint of the Bhakti era in medieval India, who used the name Giridhar to address the god Krishna in her compositions.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, Sita replaces Maya Sita {{temporarily}} {{before the}} Agni Pariksha. The Ramayana narrates that the monkey-god Hanuman, a <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Rama, {{was sent by}} Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeds in discovering her whereabouts in Lanka; where she meets with him. Sundd's Sri Sankat Mochan Hanuman Charit Manas (1998), a devotional text attributed to Tulsidas and devoted to Hanuman, uses the Maya Sita motif, but raises the question how Hanuman could interact with such devotion with a false Sita. Sita {{takes the place of}} Maya Sita in captivity temporarily to meet the great devotee.|$|E
5|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman, {{the king}} of Panchalankurichi, is a brave fighter and a <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> his family deity, Murugan of Thiruchendur.

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Chavundaraya II, a Shaiva Brahmin (Brahmin <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> the god Shiva) {{by faith}} and a protege of King Jayasimha II, wrote Lokopakara (c.1025) in the champu metre. It is the {{earliest}} available encyclopaedia in the Kannada language, written at {{times with a}} poetic touch. It comprises twelve chapters and has found popularity in later references as well. The work is on various topics such as daily life, astronomy, astrology and forecasting of events based on the Indian calendar (panchanga phala), sculpture, construction of buildings (vastu vichara) and reservoirs (udakargala), omens, divination of water, preparation of medicine from herbs and plants (vrikshayurveda), general medicine (vaidya), perfumery, cookery and toxicology (vishavaidya). Mentioned in this book is the popular South Indian dish Idli and its preparation by soaking Urad dal (black gram) in butter milk, grinding it to a fine paste, and mixing with spices and the clear water of curd.|$|E
5|$|Much {{the most}} {{prominent}} decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> the saint in the period: King CharlesV of France, Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. CharlesV was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' feast day, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to CharlesVI.|$|E

In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House {{and a member of the}} amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.|$|E
5|$|Ramram hoped his {{son would}} {{follow in his}} profession, but Ramprasad showed no {{interest}} in practical pursuits. As he grew up, his spiritual inclinations caused {{a great deal of}} anxiety to his parents. Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad more responsible, his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Kali {{and the author of the}} Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) and worship of Kali.|$|E
5|$|The author {{starts with}} Basavanna's birth and weaves episodes of other famous sharanas (devotees of Hindu god Shiva)—such as Allama Prabhu—into his life history. Basavanna is {{depicted}} as a saintly person, a great <b>devotee</b> <b>of</b> Shiva, an incarnation of Nandi, a man of miracles and one with a mission, sent to re-establish the Veerashaiva faith on earth. The work is arranged into eight aswasas (divisions) containing sixty-one sandhis (chapters) and 3,621 verses. The narration includes stories of devotees of Shiva who overcame their egos. Apart from a few variations, the writings of Bhima Kavi and his predecessors are complementary. Two lost works of Bhima Kavi are the Bhimakaviswara Ragale and the Bhringidandaka.|$|E

50|$|The {{customs of}} the pilgrims to Sabarimala {{are based on}} five worshipping methods; those of Shaivites, Shaktists and Vaishnavites. At first, there were three {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>devotees</b> - the <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Shakti who used meat to worship their deity, the <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Vishnu who followed strict penance and continence, and the <b>devotees</b> <b>of</b> Shiva who partly followed these two methods. Another name of Ayyappa is Sastha. All these can be seen merged into the beliefs of pilgrims to Sabarimala. The chain the pilgrims wear comes from the Rudraksha chain of the Shaivites. The strict fasting, penance and continence is {{taken out of the}} beliefs of the Vaishnavites. The offering of tobacco to Kaduthaswamy can be considered to be taken from the Shaktists.|$|R
