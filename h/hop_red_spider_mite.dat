40|$|Four aqueous plant {{extracts}} (APEs) of Acorus calamus (L), Xanthium strumarium (L), Polygonum hydropiper (L) and Clerodendron infortunatum (Gaertn) {{were evaluated}} under both laboratory and field conditions at 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 % (w/v) concentrations against tea <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> Oligonychus coffeae (Nietner). Also, {{the impact of}} APEs on survival and feeding of Stethorus gilvifrons, a potent coccinellid predator of <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> was studied. Parameters assessed were ovicidal activity and acaricidal activity in case of <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> and feeding activity and adult mortality for the coccinellid. Strong ovicidal action was observed with X. strumarium (87. 09 %) and A. calamus (70. 62 %) whereas least action in P. hydropiper (30. 86 %) and C. infortunatum (20. 58 %). All the APEs showed> 50 % mortality of <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> at higher concentrations (5 and 10 %) under laboratory conditions. Field evaluation of APEs recorded 46. 9 – 81. 8 % mite reduction at 5. 0 % and 64. 7 – 100. 0 % at 10. 0 % concentration. More acaricidal activity was noticed in C. infortunatum and X. strumarium under field condition. The APEs, even at higher concentration (10 %), caused no mortality to the adults of S. gilvifrons for 14 days, and no significant change in feeding after 24 h in comparison with untreated control.

A study was carried out to identify the tolerance of 15 cassava varieties/clones to <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and characterize the resistance to the pest in the dry land. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse and in farmers fields {{during the dry season}} of 2009. Each of the trial was arranged in a randomized block design with 15 cassava clones as treatments in three replications. The results showed that clones/varieties OMM 9076, Adira 1, M 4 -p, Malang 6, and Adira- 4 were tolerant to the <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> At a condition of severe pest infestation, none of clones/varieties was tolerant to the pest. Differences in tolerance appeared only on the length of incubation time until appearance of the pest symptoms.

Clone CMM 03094 - 12 had the highest leaf numbers per plant, while clone M 4 -p, variety Adira 1, and clone OMM 9076 had leaf water content more than 70 %.

40|$|Mites {{are serious}} pests of tea known {{since the early}} days in all the tea growing area countries. They damage the green tissues and affect photosynthesis, causing {{reduction}} in yield. In the present study, varied severity of damage caused by Red Spider Mite (Oligonychus coffeae, Nietner) was observed in different tea growing sub areas of Barak Valley, south Assam. The pest population was found to be seasonally variable and dependent on the prevailing agroclimatic conditions (viz. temperature, rainfall etc.). Some of the clonal tea varieties were highly susceptible to <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> some were moderate and others were fairly resistant. Amongst the inorganic pesticides, a mixture of Ethion & Sulfex controlled the pest reasonably well. Of the organic pesticides, the neem-based products showed good control of the pest. A mixture of a neem based product (viz. Neemox) and Ethion gave an excellent control of the mite. Prophylactic sprays with organic and inorganic chemicals during the winter months (December - February) helped to considerably reduce the carried-over population of <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> and consequently reduced the degree of infestation in the subsequent years.

40|$|The Servo agro spray oil (petroleum based {{horticulture}} oil) {{was evaluated}} {{in the laboratory}} against tea <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> Oligonychus coffeae to determine its effect on adult mortality, viability of eggs, oviposition deterrence and repellent properties. The same was also evaluated {{in the field to}} determine its effect on mite population. Direct spray method was used in the laboratory at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 %. Mortality of O. coffeae was both concentration and time dependent. Deposition of eggs by adult mites on treated leaf surfaces decreased significantly and the viability of eggs was also significantly reduced. In addition, different concentrations of the Servo agro spray also exhibited repellent properties against adult mites. In the field Servo agro spray oil significantly reduced the mite population and its bio-efficacy was comparable to that of the synthetic pesticide (propargite 57 EC). No phytotoxic effect was observed when tea bushes were sprayed with different doses of Servo agro spray. Tea samples were taint free.

The number of prey consumed and eggs laid were evaluated daily for ten consecutive days, starting at the oviposition. Oviposition of S. tridens {{was positively correlated with}} prey consumption and lower threshold prey consumption for S. tridens laying eggs was 16. 3 mites per day. The instantaneous rate of attack (ca. discovery area) and the handling time were 0. 0062 h- 1 and 0. 83 h, and 0. 00254 h- 1 and 0. 78 h, respectively, for predators at the 1 st- and 10 th-oviposition day. The predator exhibited a type II functional response at 1 st- and 10 th-oviposition day with a maximum consumption per predator of 33 T. evansi nymphs per day at the highest prey density. The ladybird beetle S. tridens is often collected associated with <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> colonies on solanaceous wild plants and the results suggest the potential of this ladybird beetle to control T. evansi in tomatoes crops.
