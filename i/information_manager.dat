Yet women issues are all the people’s issues. As <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> become immune to information development on issues that concern women, they help deduct from world peace. Women issues especially in Africa need to be addressed seriously, whether on rape of young children especially the girl child, female genital mutilation, the recruitment of boy soldiers, poverty, the HIV / AIDS scourge that has destroyed the family, environment degradation, or education for women.
