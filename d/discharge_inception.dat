This means that the electric field generated by charges on a sharp conductive point is much stronger than the field generated by the same charge residing on a large smooth spherical conductive shell. When this electric field strength exceeds {{what is known as}} the corona <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> voltage (CIV) gradient, it ionizes the air about the tip, and a small faint purple jet of plasma can be seen in the dark on the conductive tip. Ionization of the nearby air molecules result in generation of ionized air molecules having the same polarity as that of the charged tip. Subsequently, the tip repels the like-charged ion cloud, and the ion cloud immediately expands due to the repulsion between the ions themselves. This repulsion of ions creates an electric [...] "wind" [...] that emanates from the tip, which is usually accompanied by a hissing noise due to the change in air pressure at the tip. An opposite force acts on the tip that may recoil if not tight to ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Composite {{insulation}} materials may have small gaseous voids {{caused by the}} manufacture process and/or by mechanical stress. The time de-lay of partial <b>discharge</b> (PD) <b>inception</b> after voltage application in such small voids depends on various parameters including the gaseous volume, and it is subjected to considerable scatter. Average values for this time delay are reported in literature. How-ever, the strong scatter implies a certain probability for the first PD, {{which has not been}} explicitly cal-culated so far. Therefore the probability of the in-ception of the first PD is calculated in this paper as a function of time and of AC (50 Hz) and DC field strength with the geometry as parameter. At first only one single cylindrical void is considered. Fur-ther the calculation is extended to a large number of statistically distributed voids. It is shown that for sufficiently high field values the kind of voltage and the considered pressure range have a minor influence on the PD inception compared to its scatter whereas the geometry of the voids is more important.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} discharge {{properties of}} N 2 and CO 2 -based gas mixtures including a perfluorocarbon (PFC) gas such as CF 4, C 3 F 8 and c-C 4 F 8 under non-uniform field. The mixture ratio between a base gas of N 2 or CO 2 and the additive PFC gas was fixed as 9 : 1; namely, 90 %N 2 / 10 %PFC or 90 %CO 2 / 10 %PFC gas mixture. The PFC gases have even smaller {{global warming potential}} (GWP) than SF 6 gas and have good insulation properties as SF 6 gas. Thus, PFC gas mixture {{is expected to be}} a SF 6 substitute without highly pressurizing the gas over the conventional pressure of 0. 5 to 0. 6 MPa. In this study, in order to compare the partial <b>discharge</b> (PD) <b>inception</b> voltage VPD and breakdown voltage VB properties between N 2 and CO 2 -based gas mixtures, as well as between the additive gas of PFC and SF 6 gas, we investigated these properties of the gas mixtures with a needle to plane electrode under ac high voltage application.

As a result, it was found that VPD and VB characteristics of N 2 and CO 2 -based gas mixtures differed considerably, especially the gas pressure dependence of VB (so-called the N shape characteristics). VB characteristics of N 2 -based gas mixture including c-C 4 F 8 proved to be excellent within the test conditions over the wide gas pressure region, showing the maximum breakdown voltage. In terms of VPD properties, CO 2 -based gas mixture had an advantage over N 2 -based gas mixture due to higher VPD.

40|$|The {{streamer}} is {{the main}} process in an air gap <b>discharge,</b> and the <b>inception</b> characteristics of streamers have been widely applied in engineering. Streamer inception characteristics under DC voltage have been studied by many researchers, but the inception characteristics under impulse voltage, and particularly under lightning impulse voltage with a high voltage rise rate have rarely been studied. A measurement system based on integrated optoelectronic technology has been proposed in this paper, and the streamer inception characteristics in a 1 -m-long rod-plane air gap that was energized by a positive lightning impulse voltage have been researched. We have also measured the streamer inception electric field using electrodes with different radii of curvature and different voltage rise rates. As a result, a modified empirical criterion for the streamer inception electric field that considers the voltage rise rate has been proposed, and the wide applicability of this criterion has been proved. Based on the streamer inception time-lag obtained, we determined that the field distribution obeys a Rayleigh distribution, which explains the change law of the streamer inception time-lag.

The average breakdown strengths ranged from 135 to 220 MV/m, and were close to the breakdown strengths for the other materials already tested. Analysis of the partial <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> voltages {{for all of the}} materials tested so far shows that the major determinant of partial <b>discharge</b> <b>inception</b> is the breakdown voltage of the helium layer in series with the film.

The partial discharge sensitivity was the same as used for the unencapsulated film experiments. The breakdown strength with encapsulation was slightly higher than without. The temperature was varied from 4. 2 to 300 $sup 0 $K, but no influence on the breakdown strength was observed.

The advantageous thermal and molecular properties make it suitable as an insulating gas, however, it is a strong green house gas. With the present climate challenges, one of the measures of reducing emission of climate gases is to phase out the use of SF$_ 6 $-insulated medium voltage switchgears. An environmentally friendly alternative is air, which has a lower withstand voltage than SF$_ 6 $. For backwards compatibility, the primary manufacturers in this development is optimization (to compensate for lower withstand) of current designs without increasing the dimensions.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of high voltage engineering, electrical and thermal stresses increase {{due to an}} ongoing decrease of product dimensions. In particular, the electrical industry is interested in applying nanofluids in transformers {{to be able to}} decrease transformer size and weight. The requirement for nanofluids is to enhance the electrical insulation as well as the thermal conductivity of transformer oil. The focus of this thesis is to investigate how to improve the dielectric strength and thermal conductivity of mineral oil by introducing a low concentration of nanoparticles as well as to understand the possible mechanism behind the property changes. Stable dispersed nanoparticles are vital for the investigation of the properties of nanofluids. However, it can be a challenge to maintain the nano-meter size of nanoparticles due to the attractive force between nanoparticles, which can lead to the formation of agglomerations which eventually settle out of suspension. In this thesis, good and stable dispersed nanoparticles in mineral oil have been achieved by magnetic stirring and ultrasonic vibration at a relatively low concentration. The two types of nanofillers which were used to achieve stable dispersed nanofluids are silica and fullerene nanoparticles. The results of AC breakdown test results on nanofluids with up to 0. 02 wt. % silica and nanofluids with up to 0. 1 wt. % fullerene showed that both types of nanofluids exhibited enhanced breakdown strength compared with mineral oil. The enhancement increases with an increase of mass fraction. The effect is more significant at higher moisture content. The enhancement of the AC breakdown voltage due to silica nanoparticles is larger than for fullerene nanoparticles. Since silica is an insulating material and fullerene is a semi conductive material, the phenomena can't be explained by the theory of conductive nanoparticles acting as electron traps. Besides, moisture content {{plays an important role in}} the breakdown behaviour of mineral oil. So one possible explanation behind the enhanced AC breakdown voltage of silica nanofluids is that moisture is adsorbed on the surface of silica nanoparticles. However, fullerene is hydrophobic, therefore moisture adsorption can't be the reason for the enhanced breakdown strength of fullerene nanofluids. Partial discharge (PD) measurements gave more detailed information on the pre-breakdown phenomenon of dielectric nanofluids by recording the <b>discharge</b> pulse shape, <b>inception</b> voltage, total <b>discharge</b> magnitude and single discharge pulse amplitude. The PD results of mineral oil, 0. 01 wt. % silica and fullerene nanofluids showed that silica nanoparticles increase the inception voltage, and decrease both the total discharge magnitude and the pulse amplitude of mineral oil significantly. The effect due to fullerene nanoparticles is similar but less than the effect of silica nanoparticles. The possible explanation of this phenomenon is that organic acid is adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. The increased inception voltage and decreased PD discharge magnitudes of silica and fullerene nanofluids can be due to the decreased acidity in the nanofluids. The larger effect of silica nanoparticles on the dielectric strength of mineral oil compared with fullerene nanoparticles can be a result of the combination of acid and moisture adsorption on the surface of the nanoparticles. The effect of silica and fullerene nanoparticles up to 0. 1 % mass fraction on the thermal conductivity and viscosity of mineral oil is negligible. This is mainly due to the low concentration and limitation of stability of nanofluids. The stability and possible harmful effects of nanoparticles on health and environment are also discussed in this thesis. Finally, it was concluded that the dielectric strength of mineral oil is improved by adding a low concentration of nanoparticles. The possible explanation for this achievement and recommendations for further research are also described. Electrical Power EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
