5|$|In November 2004, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{went missing}} while in France, {{prompting}} an international police investigation. His remains {{were found at}} the bottom of a remote ravine in the foothills of the French Alps five months after his death. Investigations revealed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> by his brother-in-law during an argument regarding a divorce from his wife, Jamila M'Barek, both of whom were convicted of his murder.|$|E
5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{reviewing}} the O'Dell case, Veronica notices that the TV station the dean {{was watching the}} night <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> had moved its programming back an hour, meaning their estimated time of death was wrong.

5|$|Ælfwald of East Anglia died in 749 after ruling for thirty-six years. During Ælfwald's rule, {{his kingdom}} enjoyed {{sustained}} growth and stability, albeit under the senior {{authority of the}} Mercian king Æthelbald, who ruled his kingdom from 716 until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> by his own men in 757. Ælfwald {{was the last of}} the Wuffingas dynasty, who had ruled East Anglia since the 6th century. A pedigree in the Anglian collection that lists Ælfwald and his descendants, includes many earlier Wuffingas kings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 49 BC, the {{hardened}} legions of Caesar crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar {{turned his attention to}} the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> by Jo.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{contacts}} with the imperials, Euphemius was now willing to serve as their guide, evidently hoping that the Muslims, humbled by their failure and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to serve his purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, attacked Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered.</b> It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Edward the Martyr (Old English: Eadweard; 18 March 978) was King of England from 975 until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> in 978. Edward was {{the eldest}} son of King Edgar the Peaceful but was not his father's {{acknowledged}} heir. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his much younger half-brother Æthelred the Unready, recognized as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 520, Vitalian was {{appointed}} ordinary consul for the year, sharing {{the office with}} Rusticius. Nevertheless, the former rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527–565). Thus, in July {{of the same year}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> inside the Great Palace along with his secretary Paulus and his domesticus (aide) Celerianus. According to John of Nikiou, he was killed because he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers, however, put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession.|$|E

5|$|Prior to filming, Peirce {{researched}} the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case. She immersed {{herself in the}} information available about the murder, including trial transcripts. She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel's home. Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two weeks before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered,</b> was 19 {{years old at the}} time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's friends. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted arsonist, was incorporated into Boys Don't Cry.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{gained control}} of Indiana, the entire region {{was in the middle}} of Pontiac's Rebellion. During the next year, British {{officials}} negotiated with the various tribes, splitting them from their alliance with Pontiac. Eventually, Pontiac lost most of his allies, forcing him to make peace with the British on July 25, 1766. As a concession to Pontiac, Great Britain issued a proclamation that the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be reserved for Native Americans. Despite the treaty, Pontiac was still considered a threat to British interests, but after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> on April 20, 1769, the region saw several years of peace.|$|E
5|$|Charles III of Naples {{landed in}} Dalmatia in September 1385. Sigismund of Luxemburg invaded Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), forcing {{the queen mother}} to give Mary in {{marriage}} to him in October. However, they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda. After Mary renounced the throne, Charles was crowned king on 31December 1385, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> at the instigation of Mary's mother in February 1386. Mary was restored, but the murdered king's supporters captured her and her mother on 25July. Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387, but Mary was released on 4June 1387. Mary officially remained the co-ruler with Sigismund, who had meanwhile been crowned king, but her influence on the government was minimal. She and her premature son died after her horse threw her during a hunting trip.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his great}} authority, Bardas's {{control over his}} nephew was not absolute: after he managed {{to persuade him to}} dismiss his old chamberlain (parakoimomenos), Damian, Michael {{appointed}} to the post not one of Bardas's own protégés, but his favourite companion, the ruthlessly ambitious Basil the Macedonian. Bardas's own position was further weakened in early 866, when Michael learned that Eudokia Ingerina was pregnant with the future Leo VI: hitherto Bardas stood to succeed to the throne if anything should happen to the emperor, but now Michael had a direct heir. Instead of divorcing his wife and marrying his long-time mistress, however, Michael married off Ingerina to Basil instead, who divorced his own wife first. In spring of the same year, Bardas began assembling a large-scale expedition against the Saracen stronghold of Crete. Accompanied by Michael, Basil and the court, Bardas made for Miletus, where the army was assembling. There, on 21 April 866, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> by Basil, ostensibly for plotting against the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric's successor, Æthelwold's brother Anna, who was {{renowned for}} his devout Christianity and the saintliness of his children, proved {{ineffective}} in preventing East Anglia from being invaded by the Mercians. Following a Mercian attack in 651 on the monastery at Cnobheresburg, Anna was exiled by Penda, possibly {{to the kingdom}} of the Magonsæte. After his return, East Anglia was attacked again by Penda, Anna's forces were defeated and he was killed. During the reign of his successor, Æthelhere (another brother of Æthelwold), East Anglia was eclipsed by Mercia. In 655, after the Battle of the Winwæd, near Leeds, in which Æthelhere was slain fighting beside Penda, a new political situation arose. Penda's son Peada, who had ruled the Mercian province of the Middle Angles as a Christian king from 653, now succeeded Penda as king of Mercia, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered</b> a year later. Peada's death dealt a severe blow to Mercian aspirations of dominion over the other kingdoms of England.|$|E
5|$|When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD, {{his estate}} and {{the titles of}} the principate were left to Caligula and Tiberius's own grandson, Gemellus, who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still {{conjecture}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>murdered.</b> Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect, Macro, smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to {{the joy of the}} Roman people, while Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian. Seneca the Elder and Philo, who both wrote during Tiberius's reign, as well as Josephus record Tiberius as dying a natural death. Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius's will nullified with regard to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius's wishes.|$|E
