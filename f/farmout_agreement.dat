5000|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, a <b>farmout</b> <b>{{agreement}}</b> is {{an agreement}} entered into by the owner of one or more mineral leases, called the [...] "farmor", and another company who wishes to obtain a percentage of ownership of that lease or leases in exchange for providing services, called the [...] "farmee." [...] The typical services described in farmout agreements is the drilling of one or more oil and/or gas wells.

50|$|In May 2010, Crescent Petroleum and the Russian government-owned oil company, Rosneft {{signed a}} Strategic Cooperation Agreement to jointly develop {{material}} {{oil and gas}} opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa region. The following month, the two companies signed a <b>Farmout</b> <b>agreement</b> under Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, both companies would jointly develop the Sharjah Onshore Concession, with Rosneft holding a 49% stake as participating interest. The two companies agreed to invest USD 60 million in initial exploration activities which includes the drilling of two oil wells to a depth of 4500 m. The project aimed to benefit from existing infrastructure in Sharjah to produce condensates and natural gas liquids that could be consumed domestically and exported internationally. The agreement also included a budget for the development of local infrastructure while preserving the region's natural ecosystems and terrain. Since 2014, two wells have been drilled.|$|E
