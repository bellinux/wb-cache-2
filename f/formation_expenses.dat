At first, {{attention is paid to}} legal and administrative steps of company foundation, the whole process is divided into several primary phases. After that follows the detailed analysis of <b>formation</b> <b>expenses</b> and the first accounting period. A fiscal year is also mentioned. The largest part of this thesis is dedicated to accounting and tax aspects of capital contributions. Here are described some important issues arising from the current wording of the relevant legislation. The final section deals with the beginning of bookkeeping and as a part of this chapter the important issues of argumentativeness of accounting, choice of accounting policies, internal guidelines and a chart of accounts are solved. Some of these questions have not yet been discussed in professional literature at all, or very little, therefore their solution is the main contribution of this work...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{financial}} accounting, there is gradual harmonization across states, which stems primarily from international operations of entrepreneurs and European integration. In 2015, it was implemented through {{an amendment to}} the Accounting Act to the Cz ech legislation, financial accounting new European Union legislation, which will take effect from 2016 on accounting in Czech companies. The amendment of the decrees was the further modification of Czech legislation. The paper is focused on entrepreneurs, so the attention is paid primarily by the Decree no. 500 / 2002 Coll. This paper deals with current issues and aims to identify major changes in the financial accounting in the Czech Republic, which will be applied since 2016. In the paper are identified sig nificant changes as the distribution of entities into four levels, the improvement of the term the fair value, the categorization of consolidation groups, the return of the single - entry bookkeeping, making the final accounts more accurate and others. Parti al aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the impact of selected changes of financial accounting to the results of selected ratios of financial analysis because these indicators are based on the accounting data. Given the tendencies of the harmonization of the ac counting standards at the international level was made the further analysis of the compatibility of selected changes to the international accounting standards. The analysis was made on the evaluation of the own inventory, the billing of the changes of the inventory and activation, the cancellation of extraordinary profit and loss account, the abolition of <b>formation</b> <b>expenses</b> in the balance and on the adjustment of the definition of reserves. In all cases of the researched changes was not detected the inconsi stency between the czech legislative amendments and the international accounting standards...|$|E
40|$|They are run hard {{economic}} times and rapid {{changes in the}} technological environment. We are currently experiencing an information revolution without realizing it and without knowing fully the technology that surrounds us, and neither do their really powerful. These new changes that are happening made ourselves constantly update knowledge related to new technologies. The needs of people are growing and depend on {{the age of the}} information internet browsing. Today, many people do daily activities in relation to this environment, and we have many services associated with computers and phones. One of the most important human needs that exist in the world is taking care of our planet. That’s the reason why is detected the need to drastically reduce paper consumption due to high global deforestation which is under way. Companies have realized that printing paper invoices not stop, contributes to deforestation, which is why, since different countries are treating this issue very closely and are forcing companies to make bigger efforts in this regard. Companies do not just get global benefits such as reducing paper; they are also reducing their costs to avoid the process entails getting bills for different customers, suppliers, employees, companies and public administration. Regarding the needs and trend of bills in recent years, was born the idea of a web platform administration called Facturoteca electronic invoices. This platform aims to make a link between individuals and companies and even among small businesses, SMEs and large companies. The problem that exists is that the bills are given to products or services purchased, so there is the need to receive, manage and pay these bills. Facturoteca it aims to be a company to centralize bills to facilitate all the tasks of storage, control, analysis and management of all types of bills. This tool would allow huge savings of time for people who contracted this service and at the same time, through various ancillary services, would help analyse what is paid and why is paid to keep all documentation in an orderly manner, to have access to this from different places, hear about deals and other consumption. Opt for the SME sector and individuals for the numerous advantages: the technology is affordable, the market is large and barriers to entry are low. This combination of elements makes the technology services sector very attractive to SMEs. This could be seen as a countermeasure, due to is so an attractive sector, the risk of new competitors is constantly widening. But to enter the sector is necessary to know the secrets that make it up: what is the need for customer service look like, how to use technology, how to solve the problems of information systems, etc. In this view the future company takes an edge over competitors in the future, as currently there is competition, but works with fully electronic invoices still only large enterprises, forgetting the individuals. It is based on the idea, the knowledge needed to start the technique, but not enough. Today, due to the increasing competitiveness and greater knowledge, and therefore, higher customer requirements, forcing companies to look for solutions unlikely increasingly attractive and of course the best price. One problem for all new business is where to look for and find the first customer. Therefore it is important to clearly define and structure a plan that will enable communication and advertising company unveiled the fastest way possible. The communication plan begins to transmit company values implied by the corporate image and finding the best way to advertise in the media available. The human potential makes birth and grow the company. These are the people that make possible the development of the activity, and choosing the right group to participate in the project can make the difference between success and failure. Finally, the above would be meaningless if it was not backed by a financial study that made possible the development of the professional activity. The first thing to consider is the legal form of the company and once chosen, you can already do a calculation of the initial investment required: <b>formation</b> <b>expenses,</b> initial publicity, cost of software, etc. Facturoteca is intended as a small business based on a web platform, which thanks to the ability of the promoter, planned human potential, communication and good economic forecasts, has emerged as a company intended to achieve success in their professional activity and have a steady growth...|$|E

In such circumstances, there is an increase of the role of business transactions audit related to the <b>formation</b> of <b>expenses</b> for protection and rational use of natural resources in order to express an independent opinion on their reliability, appropriateness, legality, efficiency in all material aspects in accordance with the requirements of users. The lack of comprehensive methodology and tools for practical audit of costs and its results during the formation of environmental measures in the workplace remains as an unresolved issue. To solve this problem the author has investigated the methods of forming environmental costs of an enterprise in areas of environmental activities in terms of their consideration as the object of audit. The system of tasks for auditing transactions forming environmental costs is formulated. The objects of the audit of environmental costs are identified; their essence is revealed and the approach to the mechanism of their formation is considered.

40|$|The bZip {{transcription}} factor MafB is expressed {{specifically in the}} myeloid lineage of the hematopoietic system and is up-regulated successively during myeloid differentiation from multipotent progenitors to macrophages. Here we report that this induction reflects an essential role of MafB in early myeloid and monocytic differentiation. We observed that the expression of MafB in transformed chicken hematopoietic precursors dramatically increases the proportion of myeloid colony <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of multipotent progenitor-type colonies. In addition, the overexpression of MafB in transformed myeloblasts stimulates the rapid formation of macrophages, as judged by morphology, surface marker expression and functional criteria. MafB-induced macrophages exhibit typical levels of phagocytic activity and nitric oxide release after activation by lipopolysaccharide. By contrast, overexpression of the myeloid {{transcription factor}} PU. 1 in these cells does not induce macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, a dominant-negative allele of MafB inhibits both myeloid colony formation and the differentiation of myeloblasts into macrophages. Taken together, our results indicate that MafB induction is a specific and essential determinant of the monocytic program in hematopoietic cells...|$|R

Cytochrome b alters the ratio of ellipticine metabolites formed by isolated reconstituted CYP 1 A 1 and 1 A 2, favoring formation of 12 -hydroxy- and 13 -hydroxyellipticine metabolites implicated in ellipticine-DNA adduct <b>formation,</b> at the <b>expense</b> of 9 -hydroxy- and 7 -hydroxyellipticine that are detoxication products. Cytochrome b enhances the production of 12 -hydroxy and 13 -hydroxyellipticine. The change in metabolite ratio results in an increased formation of covalent ellipticine-DNA adducts, one of the DNA-damaging mechanisms of ellipticine antitumor action. This finding explains previous apparent discrepancies found with isolated enzymes and, where CYP 1 A enzymatic activation correlated with ellipticine-DNA-adduct levels while isolated CYP 1 A 1 or 1 A 2 in reconstituted systems were much less effective than CYP 3 A 4. The effect of cytochrome b might be even more pronounced, since, as we show here, ellipticine increases levels of cytochrome b in rat liver.

Insights into the signals potentially involved in neural crest cell fate decisions in vivo have been gained by cell culture experiments that have allowed the identification of instructive growth factors promoting either proliferation of multipotent neural crest cells or acquisition of specific fates. For instance, members of the TGFβ factor family induce neurogenesis and smooth muscle cell <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of other fates in culture. In vivo, conditional ablation of various TGFβ signaling components resulted in malformations of non-neural derivatives of the neural crest, but {{it is unclear whether}} these phenotypes involved aberrant fate decisions.

To address these issues, we conditionally deleted Smad 4 in the neural crest, thus inactivating all canonical TGFβ factor signaling. Surprisingly, neural crest cell fates were not affected in these mutants, with the exception of sensory neurogenesis in trigeminal ganglia. Rather, Smad 4 regulates survival of smooth muscle and proliferation of autonomic and ENS neuronal progenitor cells. Thus, Smad signaling plays multiple, lineage-specific roles in vivo, many of which are elicited only after neural crest cell fate decision...|$|R
40|$|In vertebrates, myeloid cells {{comprise}} polymorphonuclear and mononuclear lineages {{that arise}} from 2 successive waves of development: a transitory primitive wave giving rise to limited myeloid cells during embryonic stage and a definitive wave capable of producing myeloid cells throughout the fetal and adult life. One key unresolved question is what factors dictate polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear lineage fates during myelopoiesis. Here we show that during zebrafish embryogenesis interferon regulatory factor- 8 (irf 8) is expressed specifically in macrophages but not neutrophils. Suppression of Irf 8 function in zebrafish causes a depletion of macrophages and an enhanced output of neutrophils but {{does not affect the}} overall number, proliferation, and survival of primitive myeloid cells. These data indicate that the skewed myeloid lineage development in Irf 8 knockdown embryos results from a cell-fate switching. Such a conclusion is further supported by the observation showing that overexpression of Irf 8 promotes macrophage <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of neutrophil development. Genetic epistasis analysis reveals that Irf 8 acts downstream of Pu. 1 but is insufficient to promote macrophage development in the absence of Pu. 1.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{vertebrate}} gastrulation, a ventral to dorsal gradient of {{bone morphogenetic protein}} (Bmp) activity establishes cell fates. Concomitantly, convergent extension movements narrow germ layers mediolaterally while lengthening them anteroposteriorly. Here, {{by measuring}} movements of cell populations in vivo, we reveal the presence of three domains of convergent extension movements in zebrafish gastrula. Ventrally, convergence and extension movements are absent. Lateral cell populations converge and extend at increasing speed until they reach the dorsal domain where convergence speed slows but extension remains strong. Using dorsalized and ventralized mutants, we demonstrate that these domains are specified by the Bmp activity gradient. In vivo cell morphology and behavior analyses indicated that low levels of Bmp activity might promote extension with little convergence by allowing mediolateral cell elongation and dorsally biased intercalation. Further, single cell movement analyses revealed that the high ventral levels of Bmp activity promote epibolic migration of cells into the tailbud, increasing tail <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of head and trunk. We show that high Bmp activity limits convergence and extension by negatively regulating expression of the wnt 11 (silberblick) and wnt 5 a (pipetail) genes, which are required for convergent extension but not cell fate specification. Therefore, during vertebrate gastrulation, a single gradient of Bmp activity, which specifies cell fates, also regulates the morphogenetic process of convergent extension...|$|R

However, they have originally been folded by the "Laramian" compressional event (Late Cretaceous/Early Paleocene), {{while they were still}} in their root zone more than 50 km to the N-NE. Postdating the Santonian, the emersion of the Cretaceous tectorogen induced karst <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of Berriasian to Santonian limestone sequences. Karst cavities of this paleokarst 1 (lapiaz and canyons) were subsequently coated with a fine, red or black, Microcodium-bearing, continental silt, and infilled with marine chaotic breccias. Following a new episode of emersion then erosion, the original paleokarst 1 was cross-cut by newly formed cavities of the paleokarst 2, filled with Lutetian-Bartonian marine breccias. Both types of marine breccias (Paleocene then Eocene in age) are now relatively well dated by means of planktonic foraminifera (Globigerinacea) occurring within the argillaceous-sandy matrix, and for the older ones, within the argillaceous-sandy or carbonate, finely laminated, interbedded hemipelagites, that mark the top of marine sequences tens of centimetres thick.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{molecular}} basis of cardiomyocyte development {{is critical for}} understanding the pathogenesis of pre- and post-natal cardiac disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression that {{play an important role}} in many developmental processes. Here, we show that the miR- 99 a/let- 7 c cluster, mapping on human chromosome 21, is involved in the control of cardiomyogenesis by altering epigenetic factors. By perturbing miRNA expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that let- 7 c promotes cardiomyogenesis by upregulating genes involved in mesoderm specification (T/Bra and Nodal) and cardiac differentiation (Mesp 1, Nkx 2. 5 and Tbx 5). The action of let- 7 c is restricted to the early phase of mesoderm <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of endoderm and its late activation redirects cells toward other mesodermal derivatives. The Polycomb complex group protein Ezh 2 is a direct target of let- 7 c, which promotes cardiac differentiation by modifying the H 3 K 27 me 3 marks from the promoters of crucial cardiac transcription factors (Nkx 2. 5, Mef 2 c, Tbx 5). In contrast, miR- 99 a represses cardiac differentiation via the nucleosome-remodeling factor Smarca 5, attenuating the Nodal/Smad 2 signaling. We demonstrated that the identified targets are underexpressed in human Down syndrome fetal heart specimens. By perturbing the expression levels of these miRNAs in embryonic stem cells, we were able to demonstrate that these miRNAs control lineage- and stage-specific transcription factors, working in concert with chromatin modifiers to direct cardiomyogenesis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment of dilutional {{coagulopathy}} by transfusing {{fresh frozen}} plasma (FFP) remains sub-optimal. We hypothesized that partial replacement of transfused FFP by fibrinogen concentrate results in improved coagulant activity and haemostasis. This was tested in a controlled clinical intervention trial with patients experiencing massive bleeding during major surgery. METHODS: Patients undergoing major elective surgery were treated according to current protocols. When transfusion with FFP was required, patients were randomized as follows: group A received 4 units FFP and group B received 2 units FFP plus 2 g fibrinogen concentrate. Blood samples were taken {{before and after the}} intervention. Analysts were blinded to the treatment type. RESULTS: Group A (B) consisted of 21 (22) patients, in 16 (17) of whom bleeding stopped after intervention. Plasma fibrinogen increased significantly more in group B (0. 57 g/l) than in group A (0. 05 g/l). However, levels of prothrombin and factors VIII, IX and X increased more in group A than in group B. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) of whole blood and plasma revealed improved fibrin clot formation in group B but not in group A. Thrombin generation [calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) ] in plasma increased more in group A. Principal parameters determining whole-blood thromboelastometry were the fibrinogen level and platelet count. In vitro addition of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrate to pre-intervention samples restored both ROTEM and CAT parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Partial replacement of transfused FFP by fibrinogen increases fibrin clot <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of less improved thrombin generation.

Mineralogical and textural changes are interpreted considering local marked disequilibria {{in a system that}} resembles a small-scale high-T metamorphic process (e. g., contact aureoles in pyrometamorphism). In such conditions, rapid heating induces significant overstepping in mineral reaction, preventing stable phase formation and favoring metastable ones. High-T transformations in non-carbonate materials include microcline structure collapse and/or partial transformation into sanidine; and mullite plus sanidine <b>formation</b> at the <b>expenses</b> of muscovite and/or illite at T � 800 °C. Mullite forms by muscovite-out topotactic replacement, following the orientation of mica crystals: i. e., former (001) muscovite are ^ to (001) mullite. This reaction is favored by minimization of free energy during phase transition. Partial melting followed by fingered structure development at the carbonate-silicate reaction interface enhanced high-T Ca (and Mg) silicates formation in carbonate-rich materials. Gehlenite, wollastonite, diopside, and anorthite form at carbonate-silicate interfaces by combined mass transport (viscous flow) and reaction-diffusion processes. These results may add {{to a better understanding of}} the complex high-T transformations of silicate phases in both natural (e. g., pyrometamorphism) and artificial (e. g., ceramic processing) systems. This information is important to elucidate technological achievements and raw material sources of ancient civilizations and, it can also be used to select appropriate clay composition and firing temperatures for new bricks used in cultural heritage conservation interventions...|$|R

Volcaniclastic rocks and small rhyolite bodies Ordovician in age underwent subsolidus alkali metasomatism locally overprinted by multiple stages of younger metamorphic and hydrothermal alterations. The observed variability in chemical compositions indicates that the most of acid volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks experienced potassic or sodium metasomatic alteration, the unaltered or Mg-metasomatised rocks occur less frequently. The dominating K-metasomatism is related mainly to the K-feldspar, partly also biotite and muscovite/sericite <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of matrix or original feldspar phenocrysts. The Na-metasomatism is connected with albite formation. The highest concentrations of alkalies (up to 13. 52 wt. % K 2 O and 7. 08 wt. % Na 2 O respectively) {{have been found in}} rocks originally represented by glassy dacites. The elements like Al, Ti and Zr remain immobile in alkaline metasomatic processes in contrast to Rb or metals. Based on the results from areas with analogical geological structure and evolution, especially the Bergslagen area in Sweden, we suppose that alkali metasomatism in the Gelnica Group is a product of hydrothermal system caused by the infiltration and circulation of sea water. The areas with K-, Na- or Mg-metasomatism represent different parts of the original hydrothermal system, where the K-metasomatism was probably its lower temperature section. This hydrothermal system probably mobilised some metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn) for the formation of stratiform sulfide and oxide mineralizations or served as the metal pre-concentrator for younger siderite-sulfide vein deposits...|$|R

Molecular-level evidence of loop formation is provided by strong fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between distinct chromophores placed at the C- and N-termini of labelled chains diluted in an excess of unlabelled chains.

Although the aggregation number of the leucine zipper domains is small (tetrameric, determined from multi-angle static light scattering of AC 10 diblock), the average center-to-center distance between aggregates is roughly 1. 5 times the average end-to-end distance of the C 10 domain in a 7 % w/v network. To avoid stretching the C 10 domain, the chains tend to form loops. Changes in pH or ionic strength that expand the polyelectrolyte midblock favor bridging, leading to greater G as long as leucine zipper endblocks do not dissociate. Understanding of the network structure provided successful design strategies to increase the rigidity of these hydrogels. In contrast to intuitive design concepts for rubber and gel materials, it was shown that increasing either the length or the charge density of the midblock increases rigidity, because fewer chains are wasted in loop formation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{primary event}} in the procoagulant {{response}} after vascular interventions is the tissue factor (TF) f–factor VIIa complex formation, which occurs when TF is exposed to the circulating blood by the inflicted trauma. Human recombinant active site-inhibited coagulation factor VIIa (FFR-rFVIIa) binds well to TF but cannot initiate blood coagulation, and should thereby block thrombus formation. This hypothesis was tested with a rat model of arterial thrombosis. Methods: In a blinded randomized study, the antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of FFR-rFVIIa and heparin were evaluated in a rat model of mechanical deep arterial injury. In one arm of the study, FFR-rFVIIa (0. 2 mg in 150 μL) or vehicle alone was applied topically {{at the site of}} vascular injury. In the other arm, FFR-rFVIIa (4 mg/kg), heparin (1 mg/kg), or vehicle alone was injected intravenously. Results: FFR-rFVIIa produced a powerful antithrombotic effect after both topical and intravenous administrations (P =. 02 and P =. 005, respectively) without increasing the surgical bleeding. Heparin prevented thrombosis equally well as FFR-rFVIIa (P =. 0007), but doubled the surgical bleeding compared with FFR-rFVIIa (P =. 03) and controls (P =. 008). In the topical study, the antithrombotic effect was achieved without altering parameters of plasma anticoagulation (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) or producing detectable levels of FFR-rFVIIa in plasma. Conclusion: In this model FFR-rFVIIa effectively inhibits thrombus <b>formation</b> without the <b>expense</b> of increased surgical bleeding, which indicates the potential of FFR-rFVIIa as an effective and safe strategy for prevention of thrombosis in reconstructive vascular surgery and various forms of percutaneous revascularization.

40|$|A petrologic {{investigation}} of the Onondaga Formation in New Jersey has never been conducted, although similar studies {{have taken place in}} the surrounding states of New York and Pennsylvania. Thirteen sample sites from the formation in New Jersey were analyzed using thin section point counting, insoluble residue analysis, X-ray Diffraction, and Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray microanalysis. These methods gave insight into the lithology, mineralogy, diagenesis, and depositional environment of the Onondaga Formation. Five main lithofacies were identified. These are two limestones including siliceous mudstones and siliceous mudstones with nodular chert, and three siliceous mudrocks including calcareous mudrocks, calcareous mudrocks with nodular chert, and cherty calcareous mudrocks. The mineralogy of these five lithofacies is roughly consistent amongst the sites. Carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite), silica, alkali feldspars, and phyllosilicates are the main mineralogical groups with silica being by far the most abundant. Albite was the main alkali feldspar identified and illite, chlorite, and minor kaolinite, were the three main phyllosilicates. Carbonate mud and terrigenous sediments forming the Onondaga Formation were deposited in a carbonate ramp environment. After deposition, these sediments underwent burial and compaction, cementation, dissolution of fossils, chert nodule growth and dolomite <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of the carbonate mud, further burial and compaction in the form of fractures, stylolites, and pressure seams, and finally healing of these fractures by sparite. The source of silica for chert nodule growth consisted of sponge spicules, dissolution of terrigenous sediment, influx of silica rich fluids from meteoric waters, and minor volcanic ash dissolution. These sediments were formed close to their source of origin during the incipient Acadian Orogeny. The small amount of clay minerals present, with respect to silica, in the samples points to not much weathering of the newly formed mountains during sediment accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{symptoms}} of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have been postulated {{to result from}} impaired executive functioning and excessive habit <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of goal-directed control and have been objectively demonstrated using neuropsychological tests in such patients. This study tests whether there is functional hypoactivation as well as dysconnectivity of discrete frontostriatal pathways during goal-directed planning in OCD patients and in their unaffected first-degree relatives. Methods: Twenty-one comorbidity free OCD patients, 19 clinically asymptomatic first-degree relatives of these patients, and 20 control participants were tested on a functional magnetic resonance optimized version of the Tower of London task. Group differences in brain activation during goal-directed planning were measured together with associated frontostriatal functional connectivity. Results: OCD patients and their clinically asymptomatic relatives manifested hypoactivation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during goal-directed planning, coupled with reduced functional connectivity between this cortical region and the basal ganglia (putamen). Conclusions: Hypoactivation of cortical regions associated with goal-directed planning, and associated frontostriatal dysconnectivity, represent a candidate endophenotype for OCD. These findings accord with abnormalities in neural networks supporting the balance between goal-directed and habitual behavior, with implications for recent neuropsychological theories of OCD and the major neurobiological model for this disorder.

40|$|AbstractDuring retinal development, photoreceptors and bipolar cells {{express the}} {{transcription}} factor Otx 2. Blimp 1 is transiently expressed in Otx 2 + cells. Blimp 1 deletion results in excess bipolar cell <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of photoreceptors. In principle, Blimp 1 could be expressed only in Otx 2 + {{cells that are}} committed to photoreceptor fate. Alternatively, Blimp 1 could be expressed broadly in Otx 2 + cells and silenced to allow bipolar cell development. To distinguish between these alternatives, we followed the fate of Blimp 1 expressing cells using Blimp 1 -Cre mice and Lox-Stop-Lox reporter strains. We observed that Blimp 1 + cells gave rise to all photoreceptors, but also to one third of bipolar cells, consistent with the latter alternative: that Blimp 1 inhibits bipolar competence in Otx 2 + cells and must be silenced to allow bipolar cell generation. To further test this hypothesis, we looked for transitioning rod photoreceptors in Blimp 1 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice carrying the NRL-GFP transgene, which specifically labels rods. Control animals lacked NRL-GFP+ bipolar cells. In contrast, {{about half of the}} precociously generated bipolar cells in Blimp 1 CKO mice co-expressed GFP, suggesting that rods become re-specified as bipolar cells. Birthdating analyses in control and Blimp 1 CKO mice showed that bipolar cells were birthdated as early as E 13. 5 in Blimp 1 CKO mice, five days before this cell type was generated in the wild-type retina. Taken together, our data suggest that early Otx 2 + cells upregulate photoreceptor and bipolar genes, existing in a bistable state. Blimp 1 likely forms a cross-repressive network with pro-bipolar factors such that the winner of this interaction stabilizes the photoreceptor or bipolar state, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} three {{different}} physicochemical parameters on pHtriggered gelation and aggregation of bovine pancreatic trypsin changes and structural and functional changes in these changes in alcohol-water mixtures were studied. Methods: Trypsin gelation times were studied using inverted tube method. Trypsin stability was studied using trypsin enzyme assay. Protein secondary structural changes were monitored using FTIR spectroscopy. Gel and aggregate macrostructures and morphologies were viewed using Scanning Electron Microscopy. Results: The solution phase was observed {{in the absence of}} both NaOH and CaCl 2. The gel phase was observed {{in the absence of the}} either. The aggregate phase was observed in the presence of the both agents all depending on trypsin concentrations used. Trypsin stability studies showed that there were a nearly 53 and 32 % specific activity losses after the gelation and aggregation processes. According to FTIR studies β–sheet structure in 1637 cm- 1 band disappeared in trypsin gel and trypsin aggregates. Increases in α–helix structure in 1651 cm- 1 in trypsin gel and aggregates were observed. Iodoacetamide delayed the gelation and prevented the aggregation indicating the importance of intermolecular disulfides in the both processes. Conclusion: Trypsin gelation was caused by the denaturation of the protein three dimensional structures. The gel and aggregate formation indicates a secondary structural change towards α–helix structure <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of β–sheet structure and formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds.

40|$|In {{natural environments}} most {{bacteria}} live in multicellular structures called biofilms. These cell aggregates are enclosed in a self-produced polymeric extracellular matrix, which protects the cells, provides mechanical stability and mediates cellular cohesion and adhesion to surfaces. Although important advances {{were made in}} the identification of the genetic and extracellular factors required for biofilm formation, the mechanisms leading to biofilm matrix assembly and the roles of extracellular proteins in these processes are still poorly understood. The symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum requires the synthesis of the acidic exopolysaccharide and the PrsDE secretion system to develop a mature biofilm. PrsDE is responsible for the secretion of the Rap family of proteins that share one or two Ra/CHDL (cadherin-like-) domains. RapA 2 is a calcium-dependent lectin with a cadherin-like β sheet structure that specifically recognizes the exopolysaccharide, either as capsule (CPS) or in its released form (EPS). In this study, using gain and loss of function approaches combined with phenotypic and microscopic studies we demonstrated that RapA lectins are involved in biofilm matrix development and cellular cohesion. While the absence of any RapA protein increased the compactness of bacterial aggregates, high levels of RapA 1 expanded distances between cells and favored the production of a dense matrix network. Whereas endogenous RapA(s) are predominantly located at one bacterial pole, we found that under overproduction conditions, RapA 1 surrounded the cell {{in a way that was}} reminiscent of the capsule. Accordingly, polysaccharide analyses showed that the RapA lectins promote CPS <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of lower EPS production. Besides, polysaccharide analysis suggests that RapA modulates the EPS size profile. Collectively, these results show that the interaction of RapA lectins with the polysaccharide is involved in rhizobial biofilm matrix assembly and remodeling...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} {{chlorophyll}} a fluorescence, {{measured with a}} pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer, and of the pigment composition of leaves, suggest a specific role of zeaxanthin, a carotenoid formed in the xanthophyll cycle, in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus against the adverse effects of excessive light. This conclusion {{is based on the}} following findings: (a) exposure of leaves of Populus balsamifera, Hedera helix, and Monstera deliciosa to excess excitation energy (high light, air; weak light, 2 % O 2, 0 % CO 2) led to massive formation of zeaxanthin and a decrease in violaxanthin. Over a wide range of conditions, there was a linear relationship between either variable, Fv, or maximum fluorescence, Fm, and the zeaxanthin content of leaves. (b) When exposed to photoinhibitory light levels in air, shade leaves of H. helix had a higher capacity for zeaxanthin <b>formation,</b> at the <b>expense</b> of β-carotene, than shade leaves of M. deliciosa. Changes in fluorescence characteristics suggested that, in H. helix, the predominant response to high light was an increase in the rate of nonradiative energy dissipation, whereas, in M. deliciosa, photoinhibitory damage to photosystem II reaction centers was the prevailing effect. (c) Exposure of a sun leaf of P. balsamifera to increasing photon flux densities in 2 % O 2 and 0 % CO 2 resulted initially in increasing levels of zeaxanthin (matched by decreases in violaxanthin) and was accompanied by fluorescence changes indicative of increased nonradiative energy dissipation. Above the light level at which no further increase in zeaxanthin content was observed, fluorescence characteristics indicated photoinhibitory damage. (d) A linear relationship was obtained between the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence, Fv/Fm, determined with the modulated fluorescence technique at room temperature, and the photon yield of O 2 evolution, similar to previous findings (O Björkman, B Demmig 1987 Planta 170 : 489 - 504) on chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics at 77 K and the photon yield of photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{shear band}} {{formation}} at glass beads {{embedded in a}} polycarbonate matrix subjected to a uniaxial tension has been investigated by microscopic in situ observation. The degree of interfacial adhesion was varied by different glass surface treatments. To gain insight into the three-dimensional stress field requirement for shear band formation, the distri-butions of several elastic failure criteria around an isolated adhering glass sphere in a polycarbonate matrix have been computed {{with the aid of}} finite element analysis. It was found that the mechanism for shear band formation is fundamentally different for adhering and non-adhering glass beads. In the case of excellent interracial adhesion, the shear bands form near the surface of the bead in regions of maximum principal shear stress and of maximum distortion strain energy. In the case of poor interracial adhesion, shear band formation is preceded by dewetting along the interface between bead and matrix. 1. I ntroduct ion Shear deformation in glassy polymers takes place by co-operative movement of molecular segments without loss of intermolecular cohesion. Many details concerning shear deformation and shear yielding are given in a number of reviews [1, 2, 3]. Shear processes may be diffuse or localized into shear microbands. As pointed out by Bowden et al. [4, 5], the tendency towards shear band <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of diffuse shear defor-mation increases with the size of the strain inhomogeneities. Thus in a glassy polymer such as polycarbonate (PC), which at room temperature under tensile conditions deforms by diffuse shearing [6], shear bands can be generated by incorporation of artificial stress concentrating heterogeneities. In the present study small glass beads are used for this purpose. The mechanism for shear band formation at the glass beads is investigated by microscopic in situ observation i the course of a tensile test. From previous investi-gations [7, 8, 9] it is known that the degree of interracial adhesion has a pronounced effect on the mechanism for craze formation in polystyrene-glass bead composites. Therefore special attentio...|$|R
40|$|Intrusive {{thoughts}} and compulsive urges to perform stereotyped behaviours are typical symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Emerging evidence suggests a cognitive bias towards habit <b>formation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of goal-directed performance in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In this study, we test this hypothesis using a novel individualized ecologically valid symptom provocation design: a live provocation functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} paradigm with synchronous video-recording of behavioural avoidance responses. By pairing symptom provocation with online avoidance responses on a trial-by-trial basis, we sought to investigate the neural mechanisms leading to the compulsive avoidance response. In keeping with the model of habit formation in obsessive-compulsive disorder, we hypothesized that this disorder would be associated with lower activity in regions implicated in goal-directed behaviours and higher activity in regions implicated in habitual behaviours. Fifteen patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and 15 healthy control volunteers participated in this {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study. Online stimuli were individually tailored to achieve effective symptom provocation at neutral, intermediate and strong intensity levels. During the symptom provocation block, the participant could choose to reject or terminate the provoking stimuli resulting in cessation of the symptom provocation. We thus separately analysed the neural correlates of symptom provocation, the urge to avoid, rejection and relief. Strongly symptom-provoking conditions evoked a dichotomous pattern of deactivation/activation in patients, which was not observed either in control conditions or in healthy subjects: a deactivation of caudate-prefrontal circuits accompanied by hyperactivation of subthalamic nucleus/putaminal regions. This finding suggests a dissociation between regions engaged in goal-directed and habitual behaviours. The putaminal hyperactivity during patients' symptom provocation preceded subsequent deactivation during avoidance and relief events, indicating a pivotal role of putamen in regulation of behaviour and habit formation in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Effective connectivity analysis identified the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex as the main structure in this circuitry involved in the modulation of compulsivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder. These findings suggest an imbalance in circuitry underlying habitual and goal-directed action control, which may represent a fundamental mechanism underlying compulsivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results complement current models of symptom generation in obsessive-compulsive disorder and may enable the development of future therapeutic approaches that aim to alleviate this imbalance...|$|R
