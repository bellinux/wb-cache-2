The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} 2003–04 edition as holders of the cup. The team were undefeated in 14 cup ties since their 2–1 loss to Liverpool in the 2001 FA Cup Final, and aimed {{to win the}} {{competition}} for a third season in succession, something last achieved by Blackburn Rovers from 1884 to 1886. Henry believed Arsenal's good cup form showed they were [...] "interested" [...] in the competition and hoped their success would continue. The FA Cup was not high in Wenger's priority list – [...] "The [...] and the Champions League are more important," [...] but he clarified this never meant Arsenal intended to neglect the competition: [...] "You win what you can and go as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can." ...|$|E

500|$|Universal {{appealed the}} verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Nintendo and Universal argued the appeals case on May 23, 1984. As {{evidence}} of consumer confusion, Universal presented {{the results of}} a telephone survey of 150 managers and owners of arcades, bowling alleys, and pizza restaurants who owned or leased Donkey Kong machines. To the question [...] "To the best of your knowledge, was the Donkey Kong game made with the approval or under the authority of the people who produce the King Kong movies?", 18% of those surveyed answered in the affirmative. However, to the question [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know, who makes Donkey Kong?", no one named Universal. Universal argued that this was enough evidence to show that consumers were confused about the distinction between the two names.|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway.

2500|$|In {{his next}} start on April 16, Holy Bull was the odds on {{favorite}} in the Blue Grass Stakes. He went to the early lead and set a moderate pace, then responded to a brief challenge by pulling away under a hand ride. The win earned Holy Bull a Beyer of 113. After the race, Smith was confident in the colt's ability to go an extra furlong in the upcoming Kentucky Derby. [...] "He would have gone around again today," [...] he said. [...] "I think he'll go as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> want him. I'm {{not going to say}} no one can ever beat him, but when he runs his race, they've got to have their running shoes on.

2500|$|Colonel Hinkle rode to {{the church}} leaders in Far West and {{informed}} them of the offered terms.

Smith and the other leaders rode with Hinkle back to the Missouri militia encampment. [...] The militia promptly arrested Smith and the other leaders. [...] Smith believed that Hinkle had betrayed him, but Hinkle maintained his innocence and claimed that he was following Smith's orders. [...] To William Wines Phelps, a fellow Latter-day Saint and witness to the events, Hinkle wrote: [...] "When the facts were laid before Joseph, did he not say, 'I will go'; and did not the others go with him, and that, too, voluntarily, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> and I were concerned?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Hughes was {{a skilled}} Australian rules footballer {{as a junior}} and was invited {{to play with the}} Claremont Football Club in the West Australian National Football League. He played two seasons at Claremont—1973 and 1974—alternating between the under-21 and the reserve teams, but did not manage to make the senior team. The Claremont coach, Verdun Howell, {{described}} Hughes as having [...] "Great ball skills, brilliant hand-eye coordination and a very, very reliable kickAnd he showed courage. He went full throttle at the ball and didn't look for a second option." [...] Howell told Hughes one evening at practice, [...] "I believe you could go as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> want in football." [...] Hughes played at full forward for the under-21 team and mainly in the centre in the reserves. His brief football career was interrupted by injury—he broke his neck falling off a desk at teachers college—and eventually he advised Howell that he was [...] "very much looking towards cricket" [...] in future.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari records {{a number}} of raids against the Byzantine Empire under the period A.H. 49 (9/2/669 - 28/1/670). Though Abu Ayyub was by then an old man, that did not deter him from enlisting. Shortly after {{engaging}} in battle, it is recorded that he fell ill and had to withdraw. Someone asked, [...] "Do you need anything, Abu Ayyub?" [...] To which Abu Ayyub replied, [...] "Convey my salaams (Islamic greeting and farewell) to the Muslim armies and tell them, [...] "Abu Ayyub urges you to penetrate deep into enemy territory, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can go; and that you should carry him with you, and that you should bury him under your feet at the walls of Constantinople."

2500|$|... "On {{the fourth}} day of August we reached the north bank of the Republican River and went into camp. At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that I took him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
