5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of <b>essential</b> <b>information</b> in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on {{ichthyosaur}} anatomy, William Conybeare named {{and described the}} genus Plesiosaurus (near lizard), called so {{because he thought it}} more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been. The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning's next major discovery, providing <b>essential</b> <b>information</b> about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey <b>essential</b> <b>information</b> to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E

25|$|In chemistry, a hypercycle is an {{abstract}} model of organization of self-replicating molecules connected in a cyclic, autocatalytic manner. It {{was introduced in}} an ordinary differential equation (ODE) form by the Nobel Prize winner Manfred Eigen in 1971 and subsequently further extended in collaboration with Peter Schuster. It was proposed {{as a solution to}} the error threshold problem encountered during modelling of replicative molecules that hypothetically existed on the primordial Earth (see: abiogenesis). As such, it explained how life on Earth could have begun using only relatively short genetic sequences, which in theory were too short to store all <b>essential</b> <b>information.</b> The hypercycle is a special case of the replicator equation. The most important properties of hypercycles are autocatalytic growth competition between cycles, once-for-ever selective behaviour, utilization of small selective advantage, rapid evolvability, increased information capacity, and selection against parasitic branches.|$|E

Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings.

These pragmatic directions provide children with <b>essential</b> <b>information</b> about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words.
