40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with micromechanics of Schneebeli material specimens composed of wooden roller stacks. Several laboratory tests are carried out to analyse the material behaviour under complex loading conditions, involving loading–unloading cycles and principal axes rotations. In order to characterize micromechanical deformation features and structure evolution, a series of pictures is taken during loading. Pictures are then digitized using a stereo device, obtaining the position of each roller. Starting from these data a number of computer programs, conceived for the purpose, allow us to measure micromechanical variables and to analyse their evolution. In the following, after the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> employed in this research, macromechanical results are analysed to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} laboratory model. Then, local variables are introduced and the use of continuum mechanics to describe granular materials behaviour is discussed.

40|$|The DAFNE Beam Test Facility (BTF) {{provides}} electron and positron beams in a {{wide range}} of intensity, from single particle up to 1010 particles per pulse, and energy, from a few tens of MeV up to 800 MeV. The pulse time width can be 1 or 10 ns long, and the maximum repetition rate is 50 Hz. The large range of operation of the facility requires the implementation of different beam profile and multiplicity monitors. In the single particle operation mode, and up to a few 103 particles/pulse, the beam spot profile and position are measured by a x-y scintillating fiber system with millimetric resolution and multi-anode PMT readout. From a few tens up to 106 - 7 particles per pulse, a silicon chamber made of two 9. 5 x 9. 5 cm 2 wide 400 um thick silicon strip detectors organized in a x-y configuration with a pitch of 121 um has been developed. Once calibrated, the system can be used also as an intensity monitor.

40|$|Sphagnum-dominated peatlands {{are major}} carbon pools and sinks, but these {{functions}} {{are threatened by}} climate change. There is, therefore, a need to better understand how microclimatic changes (soil temperature, soil moisture and water table depth) are affecting their functioning. Experimental studies on Sphagnum peatlands conducted under precisely controlled (e. g. mesocosm) conditions are relatively rare, especially those aiming to understand {{the system as a}} whole. Furthermore, mesocosm designs are generally described only briefly in the literature. In this article we provide a comprehensive account of a mesocosm experiment designed to study the response of Sphagnum peatlands to water table manipulation. We describe our experimental setup (3 water levels × 3 amplitudes of water table fluctuation × 5 replicates); and explain how we built the mesocosms, the issues we faced and the solutions we chose to solve them.

40|$|Power Quality (PQ) {{has gained}} a lot of {{importance}} in the last decade. Several solutions to power quality problems have been proposed and developed. With the advent of solid state technology and power electronics in the power system protection devices, faster switching is achievable. In order to control and minimize the power quality problems which occur in extremely short times of less than 100 ms, the need arises for a selection of devices that can switch faster than today. Also, the economic losses {{that occur in the}} network due to the power quality problems increase the incentive to transform the existing devices into faster and e fficient devices. This transformation can be seen as valuable from both a technical and economical point of view to the distribution networks today where a large number of customers are connected. However, in order to interpret the value these fast switching devices render to the distribution network a prior study is required. This thesis presents a picture of the devices that can be suitable for fast switching in today’s distribution network, and how to determine their value to the distribution network. Further it summarizes the research work related to this field. The <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> and technical aspects is presented first. A literature review of proposed devices is given. The technical aspects of power quality and its problems is described. An approach to estimate the value of the fast switching devices is detailed from different literature. The study shows that fast switching devices can be worthy to invest in when seen from a distribution network’s perspective provided that different technical aspects are taken into account...|$|E
30|$|Resilience is one {{important}} requirement for modern electrical power systems. This comes to {{hand with the}} ever increasing penetration of decentralized renewable energy sources. Consequently, new and flexible control and protection strategies are required {{to adapt to the}} uncertainties that renewable energies might introduce in the current electrical power systems (Buechner et al. 2014). Nowadays, {{the current state of the}} devices deployed within substations are used for limited and predefined functionalities, thus a flexible architecture with re-usable hardware is at the moment not realized (Jansen et al. 2005; Winter et al. 2010). With this in mind, re-configurable control and protection devices will play an important role in an increased resilient and reliable management of modern electrical power systems. For this reason, in the project i-Protect (Buescher et al. 2014), such architecture is proposed and the overall concept is outlined. The main contribution has been the development of several protection functions and its deployment to off-the-shelf hardware to achieve a certain degree of modularity and flexibility as presented in (Kleemann et al. 2011; Kleemann and Rehtanz 2011). Taking this into account, the project i-Automate has been extending the aforementioned concept with the use of a data model for the description of the configuration of the hardware in use (for both control and protection functions). The used data model is based on the Substation Configuration description Language (IEC 61850 SCL) but extended to not only include information about a particular substation but a complete <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> deployed across the electrical power system. However, in this research paper the main focus is the data distribution concept that enables not only the configuration of the intelligent devices but also the reliable communication among the distributed components.|$|E
40|$|Measurements on {{entangled}} quantum systems necessarily yield {{outcomes that}} are intrinsically unpredictable if they violate a Bell inequality. This property {{can be used}} to generate certified randomness in a device-independent way, i. e. without making detailed assumptions about the internal working of the quantum devices used to generate the random numbers. Furthermore these numbers are also private; i. e. they appear random not only to the user but also to any adversary that might possess a perfect <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices.</b> Since this process requires a small initial random seed to sample the behavior of the quantum devices and to extract uniform randomness from the raw outputs of the devices, one usually speaks of device-independent randomness expansion. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold. First, we point out that in most real, practical situations, where the concept of device independence is used as a protection against unintentional flaws or failures of the quantum apparatuses, it is sufficient to show that the generated string is random with respect to an adversary that holds only classical side information; i. e. proving randomness against quantum side information is not necessary. Furthermore, the initial random seed does not need to be private with respect to the adversary, provided that it is generated in a way that is independent from the measured systems. The devices, however, will generate cryptographically secure randomness that cannot be predicted by the adversary, and thus one can, given access to free public randomness, talk about private randomness generation. The theoretical tools to quantify the generated randomness according to these criteria were already introduced in S. Pironio, but the final results were improperly formulated. The second aim of this paper is to correct this inaccurate formulation and therefore lay out a precise theoretical framework for practical device-independent randomness generation. © 2013 American Physical Society.
