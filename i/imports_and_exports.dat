5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|After pacifying central Vietnam, Duyệt was reappointed {{to be the}} viceroy of {{southern}} Vietnam and Cambodia in 1820 by Emperor Minh Mạng, Gia Long's successor. The emperor further enhanced Duyệt's powers by allowing him the power to oversee all foreign trade coming into his area, and collect taxes in Cambodia and on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> at his discretion. This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development. The southern area had only been populated by ethnic Vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration, clearing and development of land was rapid.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports,</b> but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E

5|$|Néstor Kirchner became {{president}} in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E
5|$|State {{revenues}} were also raised by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> at harbors.

Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports existed from at least the reign of AmyntasIII, and Callistratus of Aphidnae (d.c.350BC) aided PerdiccasIII in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Port Darlington had become {{overwhelmed}} by the volume of <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which had been laid out by William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees {{was replaced by a}} cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the formal opening of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842. The S provided most of the finance, and the dock was absorbed by the company in 1849.|$|E

40|$|Protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> into <b>and</b> out of {{the cell}} nucleus {{requires}} a signal in the protein to be transported. Furthermore, several factors are involved {{in recognition of the}} signal, delivery of the protein to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and its subsequent translocation across the NPC. We have biochemically analyzed the mechanism of nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> using all recombinant factors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using solution binding assays, GTP hydrolysis and exchange assays, as well as surface plasmon resonance we have identified various interactions between different components of the transport machinery. We propose a model for the mechanism for nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> <b>export.</b> Both nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> share certain features, i. e. docking of the transport cargo at the NPC via a karyopherin, release of the cargol karyopherin complex, and subsequent recycling of the transport factors for another round of function. However, although the proteins of the general transport machinery involved are the same for nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> <b>export,</b> some transport factors play different roles in <b>import</b> <b>and</b> in <b>export...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to mining, the crown and central authorities also raised revenues by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> at harbors. The king {{was capable of}} exploiting the mines, groves, agricultural lands, and forests belonging to the Macedonian state, although these were often leased as assets or given as grants {{to members of the}} nobility such as the hetairoi and philoi. Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports began since at least the reign of Amyntas III of Macedon, while the Oikonomika by Pseudo-Aristotle explains how Callistratus of Aphidnae (d. c. 350 BC) aided Perdiccas III in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.|$|E
5|$|The primary goods {{exported}} {{during the}} Anuradhapura period are gemstones, spices, pearls and elephants, while ceramic ware, silks, perfumes and wines were imported from other countries. Foreign merchants, mainly Arabs, often acted as middlemen in these <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports.</b> Luxury cloth was also imported from Eastern India and China. A stone inscription in Anuradhapura {{implies that the}} market or bazaar was an important functionality in the city. Trade was limited in villages since they were mostly self-sufficient, but essential commodities such as salt and metal had to be obtained from outside. The country's position in the Indian Ocean and its natural bays made it a centre of international trade transit. Ports such as Mahatittha (Mannar) and Gokanna (Trincomalee) were used as trading ports during the Anuradhapura Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} the Godesburg and its {{subsequent}} destruction were a mere taste {{of things to}} come. It {{was the first of}} many sieges in the Cologne War, and the castle's fall eventually led to the fall not just of Bonn, but of several other principal towns and cities in the Electorate of Cologne: Hülchrath, Neuss and Werl. Several smaller fortified towns such as Gelsenkirchen, Unkel and Brühl were also either heavily damaged or destroyed before, during and after the siege. In addition to damage to the towns and cities, Ernst's supporters managed to restrict <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> to and from the Electorate, not only crippling Gebhard's financial resources but resulting in economic hardship for the inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports.</b> The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports.</b> In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
5|$|The port of Rijeka is {{the largest}} port in Croatia, {{handling}} the largest portion of the country's <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> <b>exports.</b> In 2008, 2418 ships docked at Rijeka itself, 872 at Bršica, 818 at Bakar, and 268 at Omišalj—a total of 4376. In 2010, the Port of Rijeka transported 10.2million tonnes of cargo, a 9% drop from 2009. However the figure represents a 69% increase of dry cargo transport volume compared to 2002. The 2010 figure includes 5.6million tonnes of liquid cargo, 2.3million tonnes of general cargo, 2.0million tonnes of bulk cargo and 254,000 tonnes of timber. The container terminal recorded a substantial growth of business in past years. 137,048 TEUs were transported through the port in 2010, marking a 5% rise in turnover compared to 2009 and a ninefold increase over 2002. The Port of Rijeka also serves passenger and ferry lines operated by Jadrolinija to the nearby islands of Cres, Mali Lošinj, Susak, Ilovik, Unije, Rab and Pag, {{as well as to}} Adriatic ports further south, such as Split and Dubrovnik. The line to Split and Dubrovnik also serves the islands of Hvar, Korčula and Mljet. The passenger terminal serves approximately 200,000 passengers each year. As of August 2011, there are three concessionaires operating in the Port of Rijeka: Luka Rijeka d.d., Jadranska vrata d.d. and JANAF.|$|E
