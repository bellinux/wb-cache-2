At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module.

5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the <b>docking</b> <b>ring</b> from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E

5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a <b>docking</b> <b>ring</b> to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E

25|$|The last {{problem to}} be solved was how to {{separate}} the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's <b>docking</b> <b>ring,</b> but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed {{to solve the problem}} within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.|$|E

40|$|Recent discoveries {{suggest a}} role for the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) in peroxisome formation. Following the intra-ER sorting of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) to a site called the pre-peroxisomal ER (pER), the PMPs bud into pre-peroxisomal vesicles (ppVs). The de novo model of peroxisome biogenesis involves the budding of ppVs from the pER and their subsequent fusion to generate import-competent peroxisomes. Although some of the important PMP cargos in the de novo pathway have been identified, their role and the mechanistic details of their actions remain unclear. In this study we investigate the trafficking and subcellular localization of <b>docking</b> and <b>RING</b> subcomplex PMPs, Pex 17 and Pex 12, respectively, in Pichia pastoris. By performing subcellular fractionation procedures and fluorescence microscopy imaging of endogenously expressed Pex 17 -GFP, we demonstrate an exclusive ER origin of Pex 17 -GFP during the de novo pathway. Additionally, we show the co-packaging of Pex 12 with the docking subcomplex vesicles, in a Pex 3 - and Pex 19 -dependent manner. To further investigate the role of Pex 3 in de novo peroxisome biogenesis, we have created and characterized several Pex 3 mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis is revealing the essential role of Pex 3 domains in peroxisome biogenesis, although further analysis is required to uncover the mechanistic details of this complex process...|$|R

40|$|Pex 5 p is {{a mobile}} {{receptor}} for peroxisomal targeting signal type I-containing proteins that cycles between the cytoplasm and the peroxisome. Here {{we show that}} Pex 5 p is a stable protein that is monoubiquitinated in wild type cells. By making use of mutants defective in vacuolar or proteasomal degradation we demonstrate that monoubiquitinated Pex 5 p is not a breakdown intermediate of either system. Monoubiquitinated Pex 5 p is localized to peroxisomes, and ubiquitination requires the presence of functional <b>docking</b> and <b>RING</b> finger complexes, which {{suggests that it is}} a late event in peroxisomal matrix protein import. In pex 1, pex 4, pex 6, pex 15, and pex 22 mutants, all of which are blocked in the terminal steps of peroxisomal matrix protein import, polyubiquitinated forms of Pex 5 p accumulate, ubiquitination being dependent on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc 4 p. However, Ubc 4 p is not required for Pex 5 p ubiquitination in wild type cells, and cells lacking Ubc 4 p are not affected in peroxisome biogenesis. These results indicate that Pex 5 p monoubiquitination in wild type cells serves to regulate rather than to degrade Pex 5 p, which is supported by the observed stability of Pex 5 p. We propose that Pex 5 p monoubiquitination in wild type cells is required for the recycling of Pex 5 p from the peroxisome, whereas Ubc 4 p-mediated polyubiquitination of Pex 5 p in mutants blocked in the terminal steps of peroxisomal matrix protein import may function as a disposal mechanism for Pex 5 p when it gets stuck in the import pathwa...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPex 7 p, the peroxisome-targeting signal type 2 (PTS 2) receptor, {{transports}} PTS 2 proteins to peroxisomes {{from the}} cytosol. We here established a cell-free Pex 7 p translocation system. In assays using post-nuclear supernatant fractions each from wild-type CHO-K 1 and pex 7 ZPG 207 cells, 35 S-labeled Pex 7 p was imported into peroxisomes. 35 S-Pex 7 p import was also evident using rat liver peroxisomes. 35 S-Pex 7 p was not imported into peroxisomal remnants from a pex 5 ZPG 231 defective in PTS 2 import and pex 2 Z 65. When {{the import of}} 35 S-Pex 5 pL was inhibited with an excess amount of recombinant Pex 5 pS, 35 S-Pex 7 p import was concomitantly abrogated, suggesting that Pex 5 pL was a transporter for Pex 7 p, unlike a yeast cochaperone, Pex 18 p. 35 S-Pex 7 p as well as 35 S-Pex 5 p was imported in an ATP-independent manner, whilst the import of PTS 1 and PTS 2 cargo-proteins was ATP-dependent. Thereby, ATP-independent import of Pex 7 p implicated that Pex 5 p export requiring ATP hydrolysis is not a limiting step for its cargo recruitment to peroxisomes. PTS 1 protein import was indeed insensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, whereas Pex 5 p export was N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive. Taken together, the cargo-protein translocation through peroxisomal membrane more likely involves another ATP-requiring step {{in addition to the}} Pex 5 p export. Moreover, upon concurrent import into peroxisomes, 35 S-Pex 5 pL and 35 S-Pex 7 p were detected at mutually distinct ratios in the immunoprecipitates each of the import machinery peroxins including Pex 14 p, Pex 13 p, and Pex 2 p, hence suggesting that Pex 7 p as well as Pex 5 p translocated from the initial <b>docking</b> complex to <b>RING</b> complex on peroxisomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this age}} of {{increasing}} awareness of animal welfare, the demand for scientific methods to quantify the welfare of animals maintained under different conditions and exposed to different husbandry procedures has also increased. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the acute distress involved in the procedures of tail docking and disbudding of Friesian dairy calves. Different methods of tail <b>docking</b> (rubber <b>ring</b> and <b>docking</b> iron) and disbudding (scoop and cautery), with or without the use of a local anaesthetic, have been assessed using changes in plasma cortisol concentration and some behavioural observation as indices of distress. The practical objectives were to provide advice on choice of method and on the benefits or otherwise of using local anaesthetic to alleviate the pain associated with these procedures. The innervation at the docking site of the bovine tail and the efficiency of two methods of local anaesthetic administration (epidural and ring block) in desensitising the tail were assessed. Epidural local anaesthetic was found to totally desensitise the entire tail whereas a ring block adminstration of local anaesthetic around the docking site only effectively desensitised an area immediately adjacent to the site of ring block administration. Hence, to ensure total loss of sensation in the tail, an epidural administration of the local anaesthetic was used in the tail docking experiments. Tail docking, with or without a local anaesthetic, most three to four month old Friesian dairy calves was found to be no more distressing than control handling and blood sampling using both plasma Cortisol concentration and behavioural indices of distress. However, there was a degree of between-animal variation in response - a small proportion of calves which received some treatments that were not expected to cause distress showed signs of mild distress. The reasons for these responses are unknown. Disbudding six to eight week old Friesian dairy calves with a scoop caused a marked distress response which lasted for about five and a half hours, whereas the alternative method, the cauterising iron, was only slightly more distressing than control handling and blood sampling during the first one hour after disbudding. Although administration of a local anaesthetic before scoop disbudding produced a marked reduction in plasma cortisol concentration during the first two hours after treatment there was little or no reduction in overall distress, as judged by plasma cortisol responses. However, prior administration of a local anaesthetic to calves disbudded by cautery effected a slight reduction in the distress response, decreasing it to near control levels. The practical advice on method for these husbandry practices would be for tail docking, continued use of the rubber <b>ring</b> if tail <b>docking</b> is deemed necessary at all, and for disbudding, cautery alone or with local anaesthetic, if practically viable, would be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) {{also known}} as prion {{diseases}} are a family of invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders which affect a range of mammalian species. As yet no effective therapy exists {{for the prevention of}} either infection or disease progression. It is clear that effective therapeutics for the prion diseases is urgently needed. The central cause of pathogenesis in TSEs is the conversion of normal protease-sensitive prion protein (Prpc) into its abnormal protease-resistant isoform (PrPSC). This project aims to identify compounds that bind to human Prpc (huPrpc) and stabilize it against this conversion. Using GOLD docking studies followed by biological screening pyridine- 3, 5 dicarbonitriles were identified as lead compounds. Two types of compound libraries were generated using different approaches. Initially, a library of 384 compounds based on the lead compound was generated through derivatisation at 2, 4 and 6 positions of the central pyridine <b>ring.</b> <b>Docking</b> and evaluation using GOLD scores revealed that most of these analogues were predicted to interact better with huPrpc than the parent lead. But there are limitations for many of the targets in this library in terms of synthetic accessibility and hence a reaction based library was generated taking into account the availability of the reactants. A virtual reaction based library of 1, 050 compounds of pyridine - 3, 5 -dicarbonitriles was constructed. Docking and evaluation using GOLD scores assisted the initial selection of compounds for synthesis. This selection was augmented with further compounds to increase structural diversity. A total of 46 compounds were synthesized via a one-pot three-component coupling reaction. The mechanism of the three-component coupling reaction was investigated, and it was discovered that chemical oxidation is required for the last step, formation of the pyridine ring (aromatization). All the compounds synthesized were evaluated by in vitro screening using SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) technique to measure their affinity towards different forms of prion protein. These compounds were also screened against 5 MB cell lines for their ability to prevent the formation of abnormal prion protein (PrPSC). A set of 19 compounds was identified as binders to one or more forms of prion prote~n. Another set of 8 compounds was active on cell lines at JlM concentrations. No discernable correlation could be found between binding of pyridine. dicarbonitrile analogues to huPrpc and activity in the 5 MB cell line assay. The most active compounds 46 and 47 inhibit the formation of Prpsc in 5 MB cell lines with an ECso of 1 l!M and 1. 5 l!M respectively. Structural modification studies were carried out on best three binders (43, 49 and 60) and also on compound 47, {{which is one of the}} most active compounds in 5 MB cell lines. Various analogues of these lead compounds were synthesised and the screening results revealed that the best two compounds 43 d and 47 c showed significant binding affinity towards huPrp c and also showed cell line activity displaying ECso values of 14 l!M and 28 l!M respectively. HQSAR was also carried out to investigate the potential relationship between activity/affinity and structure relating to the holograms, fragment size and fragment distinction parameters. Within the range of compounds tested, no discernible correlation between structure and binding affinity/activity was observed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
