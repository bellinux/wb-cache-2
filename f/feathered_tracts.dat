40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} whether feather retention force (FRF) in 6 -wk-old commercial broilers was in-fluenced {{by the presence}} or absence of cutaneous innervation, nerve trunks for the pectoral and sternal <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> were severed unilaterally (left side) in Trial 1. In Trial 2, the sternal subcutaneous nerve trunk was severed either unilaterally (left or right side) or bilater-ally. Four days postdenervation, FRF was determined bilaterally either antemortem (immediately prior to stunning) or 2 min after stunning and bleeding (post-mortem). In Trial 1, the pectoral <b>feather</b> <b>tract</b> ante- and postmortem FRF values did not differ significantly for innervated or denervated tracts. In this trial, the sternal <b>feather</b> <b>tract</b> ante- and postmortem FRF values were 13 % higher (44 g) for the denervated (left side) than for the innervated (right side) treatments. Partitioning this difference into the effects of sample side or innervation could not be attained because only the left side was denervated (left-denervation or right-innervated) in Trial 1. In Trial 2, both the left and right sternal <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> were represented in equal numbers for the innervated and denervated treatments, and there were no significant differences in FRF related to innervation, left and right side, or ante- and postmortem sample times. The presence or absence of cutaneous nerve innervation does not appear to influence FRF ante- or postmortem. This finding indicates that treatments disabling the central nervous system antemortem may lower FRF indirectly by altering cutaneous metabolism and therefore have been consistently unsuccessful in substantially altering postmortem FRF...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT One {{quart of}} water and 200 BTU's of energy are used for {{scalding}} each broiler carcass in the feather removal process. Microwave energy reduces energy use and eliminates water use in the scalding process. Five broilers were scalded in hot water and tested to {{determine the amount of}} force necessary to remove individual feathers. A standard of 3. 5 N was accepted as the maximum force required to pull a feather. A total of 193 birds were treated using a Gerling-Moore microwave unit. All of the <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> of each bird were tested for feather release and any tissue damage observed. A statistical discriminant analysis completed on the data revealed that satisfactory feather release can be achieved, with the variable being based upon the bird's weight, the power expended, and the exposure time on either of the extremities or torso <b>feather</b> <b>tracts.</b> The use of microwave energy is feasible to replace water scalding, eliminating the polluted water by-product of scalding and saving 68 BTU's of energy for each bird processed.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} pea comb (P) and naked neck (Na) genes on apteria width were {{examined}} on 1020 chicks. Either Na or P resulted in significantly (P< 0. 001) increased sternal and lateral pelvic apteria width.

Poultry Science 56 : 1683 - 1685, 1977 Naked neck and pea comb are morphological traits caused by the incompletely dominant genes Na and P, respectively. The naked neck mutation results in {{a reduction in the}} pterylae or <b>feather</b> <b>tracts,</b> particularly the head tract, as well as the elimination of down and semiplumes from the apteria (Hutt, 1949). The P gene causes the characteristic pea comb and is associated with breast ridge, a slight ridge of thickened skin running lengthwise along the keel bone (Munro and Kosin, 1940; Crawford, 1961). This study was designed to study the effects of the P and Na genes on certain <b>feather</b> <b>tracts.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS The population used in this study was segregating for the P and Na genes and had been maintained as a closed population for approxi-mately 10 years.

40|$|Monitoring mercury (Hg) {{exposure}} in avian populations {{is critical to}} understanding {{the effects of this}} neurotoxin. Avian Hg exposure is commonly evaluated by measuring Hg concentrations in internal tissues, blood, and feathers. Feathers are a popular sampling matrix due to ease of sampling and limited stress to birds. However, it remains unclear if feather Hg is representative of the Hg load in the body, which is more relevant to toxicological evaluations. Furthermore, it is unclear which feathers should be sampled, given that Hg sequestration patterns across <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> are poorly understood. To better understand these patterns, we tested variation in Hg concentration across five <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> (crown, left breast, belly, back, left flank) in 37 salvaged songbird specimens in the Thrush (N= 22) and Sparrow (N= 15) families. We then compared feather Hg concentrations to those of internal tissues in the same birds, to test the relationship between feather and body Hg load. Our results indicate no statistical difference in Hg concentrations across <b>feather</b> <b>tracts,</b> but a high degree of intra-individual variability. Results also suggest a high correlation between liver and muscle Hg concentrations, but weak Hg correlations between internal tissues and feathers. Based on these results, we concluded that feathers from any of the five tracts would yield similar estimates of Hg exposure, however we recommend using a composite of various body feathers. Hg sequestration into feathers may be influenced by factors such as species and feather size, although further research into the effects of these factors is needed. Weak relationships between feather Hg and internal tissue Hg suggest that feather sampling may not be reliable for monitoring fine-scale trends of Hg {{exposure in}} songbirds. However, we show a stronger Hg correlation among internal tissues and another keratinaceous structure â€“ toe nails which, unlike feathers, grow continuously.

Interestingly, the quality of primary and tail feathers (estimated from the mass of the feather in relation to its size) were positively correlated within individuals. However, migratory individuals had higher-quality primary feathers than sedentary individuals, given the quality of their tail feathers.

40|$|AbstractReciprocal epithelio-mesenchymal {{interactions}} between the prospective epidermis and the underlying dermis are the major driving forces {{in the development of}} skin appendages. Feather development is initiated by a still unknown signal from the dermis in feather-forming skin. The morphological response of the ectoderm to this signal is the formation of an epidermal placode, which signals back to the mesenchyme to induce dermal condensations. Together, epidermal and dermal components constitute the outgrowing feather bud. The bHLH transcription factor cDermo- 1 is expressed in developing dermis and is the earliest known marker of prospective <b>feather</b> <b>tracts.</b> To test its function during feather development, we forced cDermo- 1 expression in embryonic chicken dermis using a retroviral expression vector. In featherless (apteric) regions, cDermo- 1 misexpression induced dense, thickened dermis normally observed in feathered skin (pterylae), and leads to the development of regularly spaced and normally shaped ectopic feather buds. In pterylae, cDermo- 1 misexpression enhanced feather growth. In hindlimb skin, according to the local skin identity, misexpression of cDermo- 1 induced ectopic scale formation. Thus, we show that forced cDermo- 1 expression in developing dermis is sufficient to launch the developmental program leading to skin appendage formation. We propose a role of cDermo- 1 at the initial stages of feather induction upstream of FGF 10...|$|R

The birds used in these experiments were scaleless fowl {{that had not been}} selected for commercial characteristics and commercial broilers. All birds were grown and processed under conventional conditions. Samples of back skin were taken before and after cooking to determine tensile strength. Cooking losses and organoleptic data on overall preference, flavor, texture, color, moistness, and tenderness were obtained. The back skin of the scaleless birds had significantly greater tensile strength than that of the normal broilers. In addition, the cooked thigh muscle (biceps femoris) of the scaleless had greater shear strength. The scaleless also had less cooking loss, which may be explained {{on the basis of the}} smaller size and lack of <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> in these birds. Panelists could differentiate between the two types of cooked product and expressed a preference for the more "chicken-like " broiler. This preference was most evident with the thigh samples and may have been due to the color and shear strength differences between the two types of birds.

40|$|Postbreeding {{ecology of}} the redhead duck (Aythya americana) was studied on Lake Winnipegosis from 1974 - 1977. Daily energy expenditure, {{including}} energy for activities and molt, showed little seasonal variation. Expenditures for molt were reduced by temporally staggering molt in different <b>feather</b> <b>tracts.</b> Redheads conserved energy through behavioral adaptations and by compensating higher demands with reduced expenditure elsewhere. Plant material comprised 92 and 98 % of the dry aggregate weight of food consumed by males and females. Drought in 1977 influenced distribution of redheads through its' effect on submergent vegetation. Body molt of pennaceous <b>feathers</b> in <b>tracts</b> II, III, and IV exhibited a bimodal pattern indicative of basic and alternate feather generations in males. Tracts I and VI molted irregularly, and tract V molted once coinciding with the single down molt. Prebasic molt was advanced in most tracts with the earlier termination of breeding during drought, whereas the prealternate molt was unaffected. Little annual variation in timing of wing molt in males occurred, suggesting that this molt was under photoperiodic control. Upper-wing coverts were molted gradually to provide protection to the exposed wing. Digestive organ size in males fluctuated seasonally in response to diet quality, quantity, and innately with predictable events. Changes in the gastro-intestinal tract {{at the beginning of}} molt were related to enhanced protein uptake. The concept of a labile protein reserve was applicable to seasonal variability in the size of proteinaceous tissues. Greater food intake correlated with higher tissue weights, whereas lower intake and increased protein demand caused a reduction in tissues. Skeletal muscles contributed most to the reserve. Reserves were drawn on throughout the flightless period to meet protein requirements. Lipids were stored in the abdominal cavity, on mesenteries of the small intestine, and in the subcutaneous depot, which was also the largest. Total fat content in males was lowest during breeding and averaged 8 to 9 % of body weight at the onset of wing molt. Total fat varied inversely with body water content, and independently of fat-free carcass weight. Foraging time explained 81 % of the variation in seasonal lipid levels...|$|R

The consensus tree was almost fully resolved, and about 50 % of its groups were relatively well supported. Because the only outgroup that could be used provided a poor root, two possible rootings of the ingroup subtree were considered; in both cases, only one of the two traditional subfamilies (the steppe tinamous) was recovered, and the other (the forest tinamous) appeared as paraphyletic. The results of the present analysis are compared with those from an osteological data set, using a strict supertree technique.

In experiment 1, sixteen SCWL and eight RIR hens were assigned to one of four diets calculated to contain 1. 57, 2. 39, 4. 04, and 4. 90 mg of total riboflavin per kg of feed using a completely randomized block design. The hens were 44 weeks of age at the onset of the experiment and were maintained on these diets for 18 weeks. They were artificially inseminated weekly using semen from SCWL males, and records of egg production, fertility, hatchability, and clubbed down production were maintained. Embryos from these matings were examined macroscopically at 16 days of incubation for down abnormalities. The <b>feather</b> <b>tracts</b> of abnormal embryos were examined macroscopically and selected abnormal down plumules were subjected to scanning electron microscopy. Dietary levels of riboflavin significantly (P . 05) on hatchability or clubbed down production; however, those hens receiving 11. 5 mg total pantothenic acid had a lower mean fertility (P<. 05). From these studies it has been determined that riboflavin and pantothenic acid deficiencies are not the primary cause of clubbed down in the chick embryo. The observance of clubbed down in the control and treatment birds indicates that the cause is not related to deficiencies in these vitamins...|$|R
40|$|Stable-hydrogen isotope ratios (deuterium:protium; Î´D) in {{feathers}} enable {{researchers to}} evaluate patterns of avian movement and {{to estimate the}} source areas of migratory birds. However, variation in feather Î´D remains inadequately described, thus confounding inferences of avian movement and origin. We assessed variation within a feather and among feathers within and between tracts in three species of immature raptors. Within contour feathers, measurements of Î´D increased from a distal section to an adjacent, proximal section; the magnitude of Î´D increase varied with raptor species. Furthermore, contour and flight feathers differed systematically in their Î´D content. Two explanations for intrafeather and intraindividual variation warrant further investigation: (1) hydrogen isotope fractionation associated with feather growth rate, and (2) the incorporation of temporal variation in environmental Î´D into growing feathers. We consider these explanations for raptors and passerines, which seemingly differ in the incorporation of deuterium into feathers. Additionally, corresponding sections of multiple contour feathers exhibited better measurement repeatability than multiple sections within a contour feather; the variability of multiple Î´D measurements within a <b>feather</b> <b>tract</b> (geometric SD: Â± 3. 5 %) suggests that biological effects on the repeatability of Î´D measurements from concurrently grown feather material are difficult to distinguish from analytical effects. In most cases, intrafeather and intraindividual variation can be minimized by informed sample selection decisions, but both sources of variation must be considered when stable-hydrogen isotopes are used to infer the geographic origins of migrants, ascertain migratory connectivity, and facilitate avian conservation decisions...|$|R
