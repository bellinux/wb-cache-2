5000|$|Four {{values that}} {{represent}} clot formation {{are determined by}} this test: the reaction time (R value), the K value, the angle and the maximum amplitude (MA). The R value represents the time until the first evidence of a clot is detected. The K value is the time {{from the end of}} R until the clot reaches 20mm and this represents the speed of clot formation. The angle is the tangent of the curve made as the K is reached and offers similar information to K. The MA is a reflection of clot strength. A mathematical formula determined by the manufacturer can be used to determine a Coagulation Index (CI) (or overall assessment of coagulability) which takes into account the relative contribution of each of these 4 values into 1 equation.The <b>G-value</b> is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the clot strength using dynes/sec as its units. There are some studies which suggest that an elevated <b>G-value</b> is associated with a hypercoagulable state and therefore increases the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. However, there are no studies dosing of prophylactic heparin products based on the <b>G-value.</b> TEG also measures clot lysis which is reported as both the estimated percent lysis (EPL) and the percentage of clot which has actually lysed after 30 minutes (LY 30,%). Although a normal EPL can be as high as 15% and a normal LY 30 can be has high as 8%, some studies in the trauma population suggest that a LY30 greater than 3% is associated with risk of hemorrhage.|$|E

50|$|The {{accumulated}} dose is {{found by the}} additive dose method and by an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry. This when a sample is put into an external magnetic field and irradiated with certain dosages of microwaves that changes the energy level of the magnetic centers (changes the spin rotation) either to the same or opposite of the surrounding magnetic field. The change in magnetic properties only happens at specific energy levels and for certain microwave frequencies, there are specific magnetic strengths that cause these changes to occur (resonance). Positioning an ESR line in a spectrum corresponds to the proportion (<b>g-value)</b> of the microwave frequency to magnetic field strength used in the spectrometry.

5000|$|Frémy's salt, {{discovered}} in 1845 by Edmond Frémy (1814-1894), is a chemical compound {{and a strong}} oxidizing agent. The formal name is disodium nitrosodisulfonate or Na2NO(SO3)2, but the expression [...] "Frémy's salt" [...] refers equally well to potassium nitrosodisulfonate, also known as potassium peroxylamine disulfonate.

NDS, a product of disassociation of Frémy’s salt, is commonly used to examine the mechanism of oxidation and hydroxylation. Frémy’s salt is a commercially accessible dimer of NDS, it is also a relatively stable source of water-soluble nitroxyl radical that is used as an electronic spin resonance (ESR) standard for <b>g-value</b> determination and radical quantization it is also mainly used in oxidation reactions.

Thus, due to the inability to eliminate the effects of physical adsorption and precipitation of metals ion in the <b>G-value</b> equation, its values are far from reality in mentioned condition. Therefore, the <b>G-value</b> content is not recommended for comparing the efficiency of the irradiation in basic solution or under radiocatalysis condition.|$|E

The calculations also made no allowances for decreases of the <b>G-value</b> over time due to matrix depletion phenomena that have been observed by many experimenters.
