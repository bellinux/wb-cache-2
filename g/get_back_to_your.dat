40|$|This {{letter is}} {{pursuant}} to the commitment I made to you on July 26, 2011, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> you regarding <b>your</b> question {{of the problem of}} hydrogen generation during loss-of-coolant accidents in light water reactors and whether any alternative fuel cladding materials might be available to mitigate or eliminate the problem. The matter required quite a bit of research and the issue has a long and tangled history. But the gist of it is as follows (a list of references is provided {{at the end of this}} letter) : • Zircaloy was chosen because of its excellent properties in a number of respects, including low neutron absorption (important for maintaining the chain reaction economically), heat transfer properties, and other mechanical properties needed in a material that would be made in to ten- or twelve-foot long thin tubes containing nuclear fuel. The hydrogen generation vulnerability has long been recognized – at least since the 1970 s – well before the 1979 Three Mile Island accident during which there was a contained hydrogen explosion. Notably, Earl Gulbransen, one of the most eminent authorities on the properties of metals and alloys in nuclear power reactor environments, expressed concern in 1975 that there was no back-up to zircaloy in case it proved unsuitable. He pointed to possible embrittlement of zircaloy during operation and to hydrogen evolution due to zirconium-steam reactions during loss of coolant accidents as principal issues. ...|$|R
