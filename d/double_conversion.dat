5000|$|The Eaton BladeUPS is a modular {{three-phase}} UPS system {{consisting of}} individual 6U 12 kW UPS units {{which can be}} paralleled together to create up to a 60 kW N+1 redundant UPS. A feature of the BladeUPS is that the 6U cabinet houses both the UPS electronics and batteries; other modular systems house them separately. [...] The high power density and 6U form factor of the BladeUPS are targeted at the growing power demands of IT servers and equipment, especially blade servers.The BladeUPS does not fall into a defined category for UPS type {{as it is a}} hybrid of a line interactive and online architecture, which Eaton calls <b>Double</b> <b>Conversion</b> on Demand. [...] During normal operation the BladeUPS operates as a line interactive UPS allowing it to be energy efficient. When power conditions fluctuate outside preset standards, the unit switches into online mode (also known as <b>double</b> <b>conversion).</b> Software upgrades by Eaton have allowed BladeUPS owners to defeat this hybrid architecture and force the unit to operate entirely in online (<b>double</b> <b>conversion)</b> mode.|$|E

50|$|An {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} {{can be used to}} switch off of mains power if there is a transient (temporary) condition on the line. However, cheaper UPS units create poor-quality power themselves, akin to imposing a higher-frequency and lower-amplitude square wave atop the sine wave. High-quality UPS units utilize a <b>double</b> <b>conversion</b> topology which breaks down incoming AC power into DC, charges the batteries, then remanufactures an AC sine wave. This remanufactured sine wave is of higher quality than the original AC power feed.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid (<b>double</b> <b>conversion</b> on demand) UPS {{operates}} as an off-line/standby UPS when power conditions are {{within a certain}} preset window. This allows the UPS to achieve very high efficiency ratings. When the power conditions fluctuate outside of the predefined windows, the UPS switches to online/double-conversion operation. In double-conversion mode the UPS can adjust for voltage variations without having to use battery power, can filter out line noise and control frequency. Examples of this hybrid/double conversion on demand UPS design are the HP R8000, HP R12000, HP RP12000/3 and the Eaton BladeUPS.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 There {{is a new}} {{possibility}} of generating deep ultraviolet laser radiation from a solid-state source. With recent advances in material development, a new nonlinear optical crystal provides a greater damage threshold than current materials making higher conversion efficiencies possible. This thesis examines the {{possibility of}} using this crystal to generate deep ultraviolet wavelengths. The best-estimated Sellmeier equations for this new crystal predict that direct <b>doubling</b> <b>conversion</b> using a 404 nm source is not possible. Observation of a 202 nm signal when the crystal is placed in front of a 404 nm source verifies the inaccuracy of the estimated Sellmeier equations. Additional verification of Sellmeier equations inaccuracy is provided when generation of 235 nm signal is found at an angle of 11 degrees less than the model prediction. Possible electro-optic Q-switching is examined. Electro-optic modulation measurements show a very small refractive index change. When angle tuning, a greater depth of modulation is noted, however, full extinction of the beam could not be achieved. To improve efficiency, intra-cavity resonant doubling is investigated.
