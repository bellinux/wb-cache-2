25|$|Fifth, {{the holders}} of a {{floating}} charge holders must be paid. Like a <b>fixed</b> <b>charge,</b> a floating charge {{can be created}} by a contract with a company before insolvency. Like with a <b>fixed</b> <b>charge,</b> this is usually done {{in return for a}} loan from a bank. But unlike a <b>fixed</b> <b>charge,</b> a floating charge need not refer to a specific asset of the company. It can cover the entire business, including a fluctuating body of assets that is traded with day today, or assets that a company will receive in future. The preferential categories were created by statute to prevent secured creditors taking all assets away. This reflected the view that the power of freedom of contract should be limited to protect employees, small businesses or consumers who have unequal bargaining power. After funds are taken away to pay all preferential groups and the holder of a floating charge, the remaining money due to unsecured creditors. In 2001 recovery rates were found to be 53% of one's debt for secured lenders, 35% for preferential creditors but only 7% for unsecured creditors on average. Seventh comes any money due for interest on debts proven in the winding up process. In eighth place is money due to company members under a share redemption contract. Ninth are debts due to members who hold preferential rights. And tenth, ordinary shareholders, have the right to residual assets.|$|E

The junction termination extension (JTE) {{can also be}} formed without ion implantation in SiC bipolar junction transistor (BJT) using a well-controlled etching into the epitaxial base layer. The <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> at the SiC/SiO 2 interface modify the effective dose of the JTEs, leakage current, and breakdown voltage. In this paper the influence of <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> (positive and negative) and also interface trap density at the SiC/SiO 2 interface on the breakdown voltage in 4. 5 kV 4 H-SiC non-ion implanted BJT have been simulated. SiO 2 as a surface passivation layer including interface traps and <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> has been considered in the analysis. Simulation result shows that the <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> influence the breakdown voltage significantly more than the interface traps. It also shows that the positive <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> reduce the breakdown voltage more than the negative <b>fixed</b> <b>charges.</b> The combination of interface traps and <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> must be considered when optimizing the breakdown voltage.

The count of the ions in these buffers is sampled throughout the simulation and an ion is injected whenever a deficit is observed. The initial velocity of the injected particle is decided according to Maxwellian distribution. It should be noted that the ions can leave the system only by exiting through the two Dirichlet boundary planes and an ion is not removed artificially from these buffer regions. The reflections from the Neumann boundary planes are treated as elastic reflections.|$|E

40|$|Presents {{information}} {{and analysis of}} the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market. Executive summary: This report presents {{information and}} analysis of the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market (NEM). The paper is the first of four papers focused on network tariffs from the perspective of households. Key findings include: 	A range of network tariff structures are used throughout the NEM. Inclining block rate tariffs (with small price increments) and two-part tariffs are common. 	The most expensive network tariff in Australia is almost four times higher than the least expensive. 	The average network charge to households in Victoria is about a third of that elsewhere in the NEM 	The gap between least expensive and most expensive network tariff has doubled over the last seven years. 	Network service providers in Queensland have the highest charges and also the greater proportion of their <b>charge</b> is <b>fixed.</b> The Queensland distributors and Ausnet Services in Victoria have increased their <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> significantly recently. In the 2015 / 16 year (not covered in this report Citipower and Powercor have both increased their <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> significantly). 	Network service providers are typically increasing <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> more quickly than variable charges. 	The international comparison shows that network tariffs in Britain are generally much lower than anywhere in Australia. The average network charge in Denmark and New Zealand is roughly comparable to those in Victoria, the lowest network cost jurisdiction in the NEM. 	The proportion of revenue recovered from <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> charged to most consumers in the NEM is higher than that in Britain, Denmark and New Zealand. Some distributors in Victoria have relatively smaller <b>fixed</b> <b>charges,</b> while those in Queensland and Essential Energy in New South Wales have <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> that are much higher than those found elsewhere. In NZ, network tariffs with higher <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> apply to households with high levels of consumption (> 9 MWh per year) ...|$|R

25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E

2500|$|Businesses, and {{the banks}} who had {{previously}} enjoyed uncompromised priority for their security, increasingly looked for ways to circumvent {{the effect of the}} insolvency legislation's scheme of priorities. A floating charge, in order for its value to be ascertained, must have [...] "crystallised" [...] into a <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> on some particular date, usually set by agreement. Before the date of crystallisation (given the charge merely [...] "floats" [...] over no particular property) there is the possibility that a company could both charge out property to creditors with priority, or that other creditors could set-off claims against property subject to the (uncrystallised) floating charge. Furthermore, other security interests (such as a contractual lien) will take priority to a crystallised floating charge if it arises before in time. But after crystallisation, assets received by the company can be caught by the charge. One way for companies to gain priority with floating charges originally was to stipulate in the charge agreement that the charge would convert from [...] "floating" [...] to [...] "fixed" [...] automatically on some event before the date of insolvency. According to the default rules at common law, floating charges impliedly crystallise when a receiver is appointed, if a business ceases or is sold, if a company is would up, or if {{under the terms of the}} debenture provision is made for crystallisation on reasonable notice from the charge holder. However an automatic crystallisation clause would mean that at the time of insolvency - when preferential creditors' claims are determined - there would be no floating charge above which preferential creditors could be elevated. The courts held that it was legitimate for security agreements to have this effect. In Re Brightlife Ltd Brightlife Ltd had contracted with its bank, Norandex, to allow a floating charge to be converted to a <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> on notice, and this was done one week before a voluntary winding up resolution. Against the argument that public policy should restrict the events allowing for crystallisation, Hoffmann J held that in his view it was not [...] "open to the courts to restrict the contractual freedom of parties to a floating charge on such grounds." [...] Parliament, however, intervened to state in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251 that if a charge was created as a floating charge, it would deem to remain a floating charge at the point of insolvency, regardless of whether it had crystallised.|$|E
2500|$|While both {{need to be}} registered, the {{distinction}} between a fixed and a floating charge matters greatly because floating charges are subordinated by the Insolvency Act 1986 to insolvency practitioners' expenses under section 176ZA, preferential creditors (employees' wages up to £800 per person, pension contributions and the EU coal and steel levies) under section 175 and Schedule 6 and unsecured creditors' claims up {{to a maximum of}} £600,000 under section 176A. The floating charge was invented as a form of security in the late nineteenth century, as a concept which would apply to the whole of the assets of an undertaking. The leading company law case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, exemplified that a floating charge holder (even if it was the director and almost sole shareholder of the company) could enforce their priority ahead of all other persons. As Lord MacNaghten said, [...] "Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is." [...] Parliament responded with the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897, which created a new category of preferential creditors - at the time, employees and the tax authorities - who would be able to collect their debts after <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> holders, but before floating charge holders. In interpreting the scope of a floating charge the leading case was Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd where a receiver contended an instrument was void because it had not been registered. Romer LJ agreed, and held that the hallmarks of a floating charge were that (1) assets were charged present and future and (2) change in the ordinary course of business, and most importantly (3) until a step is taken by the charge holder [...] "the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way". A floating charge is not, technically speaking, a true security until a date of its [...] "crystallisation", when it metaphorically descends and [...] "fixes" [...] onto the assets in a business' possession at that time.|$|E
