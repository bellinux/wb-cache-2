50|$|The first {{commercial}} digital <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> device was the IBM 350 which shipped in 1956 {{as a part}} of the IBM 305 RAMAC computing system. The random-access, low-density <b>storage</b> of <b>disks</b> was developed to complement the already used sequential-access, high-density storage provided by tape drives using magnetic tape. Vigorous innovation in <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> technology, coupled with less vigorous innovation in tape storage, has reduced the difference in acquisition cost per terabyte between <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> and tape storage; however, the total cost of ownership of data on disk including power and management remains larger than that of tape.|$|R

To minimize the downtime caused by migrating large <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> data and keep data integrity and consistency, we propose a three-phase migration (TPM) algorithm. To facilitate the migration back to initial source machine, we use an incremental migration (IM) algorithm {{to reduce the amount}} of the data to be migrated. Block-bitmap is used to track all the write accesses to the local <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> during the migration. Synchronization of the local <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> in the migration is performed according to the block-bitmap. Experiments show that our algorithms work well even when I/Ointensive workloads are running in the migrated VM. The downtime of the migration is around 100 milliseconds, close to shared-storage migration. Total migration time is greatly reduced using IM. The block-bitmap based synchronization mechanism is simple and effective. Performance overhead of recording all the writes on migrated VM is very low. I...|$|R
