5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san. Gay {{believed he had}} <b>insufficient</b> forces to secure and hold it and that the North Koreans had <b>insufficient</b> ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire. However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} the {{evidence}} was <b>insufficient</b> to support his conviction. Reviewing the evidence, the Court rejected this argument.|$|E
5|$|Hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, {{characterized}} by alterations {{in the blood}} calcium levels and bone metabolism, are states of surplus or <b>insufficient</b> parathyroid function,.|$|E
5|$|Inadequate {{financing}} {{options for}} renewable energy projects, including <b>insufficient</b> access to affordable financing for project developers, entrepreneurs and consumers.|$|E
5|$|Mapping the <b>insufficient</b> veins, flux direction, shunts, and perforators.|$|E
5|$|Not {{all events}} awarded silver and bronze medals due to <b>insufficient</b> competitors.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} many {{alternative}} treatments used for the common cold, there is <b>insufficient</b> scientific {{evidence to support the}} use of most. As of 2014 there is <b>insufficient</b> evidence to recommend for or against honey. As of 2015 there is tentative evidence to support nasal irrigation.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found <b>insufficient</b> {{evidence to support}} an association between induced or spontaneous abortion and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{systematic}} review examined antioxidant medications, such as allopurinol and acetylcysteine, as add on treatment for schizophrenia. Evidence was <b>insufficient</b> to determine benefits {{and there was}} potential for adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|A diet low {{in simple}} sugars is {{recommended}} {{as a method}} of improving acne. As of 2014, evidence is <b>insufficient</b> to recommend milk restriction for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scoring systems exist {{to help with}} diagnosis; however, their use is {{controversial}} due to <b>insufficient</b> accuracy. The modified Centor criteria are a set of five criteria; the total score indicates {{the probability of a}} streptococcal infection.|$|E
5|$|After {{a conference}} with leading counsel and the police, a {{decision}} was taken, in agreement with all parties, that there was <b>insufficient</b> evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.|$|E
5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to <b>insufficient</b> blood supply.|$|E
5|$|As the {{existing}} supply of M2A3 gun shields was <b>insufficient</b> to meet {{requirements for the}} production of the M3, the Ordnance Department developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. The new design was designated as the M3A1 Gun Motor Carriage.|$|E
5|$|Associativity {{refers to}} the {{observation}} that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is <b>insufficient</b> for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.|$|E
5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is <b>insufficient</b> evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), used by {{the ancient}} Maya peoples as animal fodder, and as an {{alternative}} food when yield of other crops was <b>insufficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall <b>insufficient</b> training and preparation.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury Heritage Museum houses many {{exhibits}} - {{including the}} Rupert Bear Museum. The Herne Bay Times {{has reported that}} the Heritage at Risk Register includes 19 listed buildings in Canterbury which need urgent repair but for which the council has <b>insufficient</b> funds.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the nature}} of memorial, the {{surrounding}} hills are a popular summer hiking and winter sledding and skiing location. Although Germany supplies annual funding for memorial maintenance, it is <b>insufficient</b> to fund regular police patrols and surveillance. The memorial and gravestones have been vandalised several times, each time attracting media attention.|$|E
5|$|Diving bells are {{required}} to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. The cylinders are mounted externally as there is <b>insufficient</b> space inside. They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations, and may be considered diving cylinders.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang åŒ ) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided <b>insufficient</b> information on the various technologies they described.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the Army's evaluation, Radioplane, as a private venture, conducted an improvement program for the RP-77D, fitting the aircraft with a larger wing, along with other modifications that improved {{the performance of the}} drone. However these improvements were <b>insufficient</b> to produce a renewed interest from the Army.|$|E
5|$|Horner {{differentiated}} the {{two species}} by details of the crest. He interpreted P. blackfeetensis as having a steeper, taller face than P. maximus, with the crest migrating backward toward the eyes during growth. More recent studies have regarded the differences as <b>insufficient</b> to support two species.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{just five}} bird species were {{confirmed}} in the watershed, while for fish, benthic invertebrates, and certain insects {{there were no}} confirmed observations, {{in part due to}} <b>insufficient</b> site coverage.|$|E
5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{held that}} {{conspiracy}} {{to wage war}} on the United States was not treason. Further, Bollman held that the evidence against both Bollman and Swartwout was <b>insufficient</b> to justify pre-trial detention.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an <b>insufficient</b> number of red blood cells and an <b>insufficient</b> amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
5|$|Michel Glautier {{argues that}} {{conscience}} {{is one of}} the instincts and drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these drives or in whom they are <b>insufficient</b> cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.|$|E
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that it was unfair due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were <b>insufficient</b> grounds to justify an appeal.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days before}} the election, a Parliamentary {{committee}} set up to consider Zuma's response to Madonsela's final Nkandla report was referred to the next Parliament to be formed after the election, citing <b>insufficient</b> time available before the 7 May election date.|$|E
5|$|O: This {{is not an}} {{official}} nomination. After nominations were announced, information came to light that showed that A Place in the World (1992) was wholly produced in Argentina, and had <b>insufficient</b> Uruguayan artistic control. The film was declared ineligible and removed from the final ballot.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1845, two {{passenger}} trains collided due {{to one of}} them having <b>insufficient</b> brakes and passing a signal at danger. Some passengers sustained slight injuries.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become <b>insufficient,</b> {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of <b>insufficient</b> perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include <b>insufficient</b> and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the ParanÃ¡ maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{has also}} been used for honors or to signify elite status, when more {{commonly}} used metals such as silver, gold or platinum were deemed <b>insufficient.</b> In 1979 the Guinness Book of World Records gave Paul McCartney a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.|$|E
5|$|That night Governor Carroll {{requested}} {{federal assistance}} from President Rutherford B. Hayes, {{convinced that the}} state forces were <b>insufficient.</b> Hayes ordered General William Barry, commander at Fort McHenry, to hold all available forces in readiness.|$|E
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle <b>insufficient</b> flotation to wade through water and the horsepower of the engine was <b>insufficient</b> to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored Recovery Vehicle in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became too expensive, and so was never put on the production line. The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine Exploder. However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.|$|E
