5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume {{to offset the}} low profit margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 <b>Deutschmark</b> without battery, tachometer, or centre stand. Passenger accommodation was an optional extra, as was a spare wheel. Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E
5|$|Slayer {{returned}} as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. During the sold out European leg of this tour tickets fetched up to 1,000 <b>Deutschmark</b> ($680 USD) {{on the black}} market. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak, the tour was extended to the US beginning in May 1991, with Megadeth, Anthrax and opening act Alice in Chains. The band released a double live album, Decade of Aggression in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. The compilation debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|The Munich Specimen (BSP 1999 I 50, {{formerly}} known as the Solenhofer-Aktien-Verein Specimen) was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the Paläontologisches Museum München in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million <b>Deutschmark.</b> What was initially believed to be a bony sternum turned out {{to be part of the}} coracoid, but a cartilaginous sternum may have been present.

5|$|The Tagora was priced {{to overlap}} with {{high-end}} Peugeot 505 and low-end Citroën CX models, while slotting in beneath the Peugeot 604. Its pricing was also {{comparable to the}} Renault 20/30 and Ford Granada. The Tagora was in the 20,000–30,000 <b>Deutschmark</b> bracket in Germany. During the first fifteen months of the car's existence, in 1980/81, a mere 16,169 Tagoras were produced which was only one quarter of Chrysler's initial projections. Sales proved insufficient even for this production level, and volumes plummeted by more than 80 percent in 1982. In 1983 the sales figures prompted PSA to cancel the model altogether. By the time the Tagora was discontinued, only about 20,000 had been built; by comparison, over 116,000 Peugeot 505s and 74,000 Citroën CXs were made in 1981 alone.|$|E

2500|$|After Thatcher's Bruges {{speech in}} September 1988 and her {{increasing}} hostility to a European currency {{in the last}} years of her premiership, Powell made many speeches publicly supporting her attitude to Europe. When Heath attacked Thatcher's speech in May 1989 Powell called him [...] "the old virtuoso of the U-turn". When inflation crept up that year, he condemned the Chancellor Nigel Lawson's policy of printing money so sterling would shadow the German <b>deutschmark</b> and said that it was for the UK to join the European Monetary System.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, {{the city}} council of Halstenbek decided to spend 5 million <b>Deutschmarks</b> on the {{construction}} of a new sports hall on a property on Feldstraße formerly occupied by a tree nursery. In 1993, the council approved the design submitted by architects Poitiers & Partner from Hamburg. Architect André Poitiers' design featured an underground field under an oval glass dome, with locker rooms and equipment rooms also located below the ground and around the field. During the planning, the estimated cost already rose to more than 12 million <b>Deutschmarks.</b> Construction finally began in September 1995. In 1996, the estimated total cost was 15.6 million <b>Deutschmarks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{first stage}} of {{redevelopment}} was completed in 1957 {{at a cost of}} c. 400 million <b>Deutschmarks,</b> giving a capacity of c.600,000 tons steel pa. Facilities included three open hearth steelmaking furnaces, a hot rolling mill for coil and sheets, and a tinplate plant. In 1960 the board at Klockner authorised a second phase (200 million <b>Deutschmarks)</b> to increase capacity to 1 million tons. In 1960 the ultimate aim was to develop the site as a full steel mill with a production capacity of 4 to 5 million tons steel pa. By the 1960s the workforce had risen to 6,000, manly of the new workers were immigrants, predominately from Turkey. Second and third blast furnaces were complete in the mid-1960s and early-1970s respectively; Linz-Donawitz process steelmaking converters were added in 1968 at a cost of 92 million <b>Deutschmarks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The initial {{experience}} of the EMS was disappointing. It had been expected that the Irish Pound would appreciate in value against Sterling, and hence reduce inflation in Ireland, but in practice Sterling appreciated considerably in value thanks to {{its status as a}} petrocurrency and to the tight monetary policies of the new British government of Margaret Thatcher. By late 1980 the Irish Pound had fallen in value to less than 80 British pence, and Irish inflation was higher than British. Economic policy in Ireland was inconsistent with a [...] "hard currency" [...] policy, and the Irish Pound also failed to hold its value against the central rate of the <b>Deutschmark,</b> although it did appreciate in value against some of the other EMS currencies.|$|E
2500|$|Coinage became redundant. The 1993 dinar had {{the largest}} {{denomination}} out of all incarnations of Yugoslavian currency: the banknote, featuring Jovan Jovanović Zmaj had a face value of 500 billion (...) dinara (right). Wages became worthless; if paid in cash, workers had to rush out and spend their wages before they lost their value overnight. Many businesses started to pay wages in goods instead, and a simple barter system developed. Businesses with good connections to politicians could still get access to hard currency. Some shops, instead of rewriting their prices several times a day, started pricing goods in [...] "bods" [...] (points), often equivalent to hard currency such as one <b>Deutschmark.</b> The winter of 1993 was particularly hard for pensioners; if a monthly pension was spent immediately, it was still barely enough to buy three litres of milk. Many people relied on connections {{to friends and family}} abroad (who could provide hard currency) or in the countryside (who could grow food).|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1930s, {{prices and}} wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. [...] That meant {{that people had}} {{accumulated}} large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy {{and more than half}} of all transactions were taking place unofficially. [...] The reform replaced the old money with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of one new per ten old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. [...] Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. [...] The result was the prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. [...] The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the United States, which primarily was used for investment. [...] In addition, the Marshall plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices, and take account of the wider market. [...] Marshall plan funding overcame bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. [...] Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for higher prices. While the availability of consumers goods is seen as a giant success story by most historians of the present, the perception at the time was a different one: prices were so high that average people could not afford to shop, especially since prices were free-ranging but wages still fixed by law. [...] Therefore, in the summer of 1948 a giant wave of strikes and demonstrations swept over West Germany, leading to an incident in Stuttgart where strikers were met by US tanks ("Stuttgarter Vorfälle"). Only after the wage-freeze was abandoned, <b>Deutschmark</b> and free-ranging prices were accepted by the population.|$|E

[...] Individual income tax rates, in particular, fell dramatically. Previously the tax rate on any income over 6,000 <b>Deutschmark</b> had been 95 percent. After tax reform, this 95 percent rate applied only to annual incomes above 250,000 <b>Deutschmark.</b> For the West German with an annual income of about 2,400 <b>Deutschmark</b> in 1950, the marginal tax rate fell from 85 percent to 18 percent.|$|E
