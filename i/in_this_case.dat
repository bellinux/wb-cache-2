50|$|The first {{participant}} in the debate was Tomislav Nikolić, the president of Serbia. He criticized the work of ICTY emphasizing {{that it did not}} contribute but hindered the reconciliation in former Yugoslavia. He reminded that, although there is no significant ethnic disproportion among the number of casualties in the Yugoslav wars, the ICTY sentenced Serbs to 1,150 years in prison while members of other ethnic groups are sentenced to 55 totally for crimes against Serbs. Vitaly Churkin, the ambassador of Russia to the UN, also criticized the work of the ICTY, especially acquittals of Gotovina and Ramush Haradinaj. He emphasized that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>cases</b> the justice has not been satisfied because <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>cases</b> nobody was convicted for evident crimes.|$|R

5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (<b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (<b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E
