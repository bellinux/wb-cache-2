40|$|BACKGROUND: Nursing home-acquired {{pneumonia}} (NHAP) is {{the leading}} cause of death among long-term care patients and the second most common cause of transfers to acute care facilities. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence, microbiology, and outcomes for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and NHAP. METHODS: A secondary anal-ysis of 5, 160 patients from the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Organization database was per-formed. World regions were defined as the United States and Canada (<b>I),</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>America</b> (II), and Europe (III). RESULTS: From a total of 5, 160 hospitalized patients with CAP, NHAP was iden-tified in 287 (5. 6 %) patients. Mean age was 80 y. NHAP distribution by region was 6 % in region I, 3 % in region II, and 7 % in region III. Subjects with NHAP had higher frequencies of neurological disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and renal failure than did subjects with CAP (P <. 001). ICU admission was required in 32 (12 %) subjects. Etiology was defined in 68 (23 %) subjects with NHAP and 1, 300 (27 %) with CAP. The most common pathogens identified in NHAP included Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 %), Staphylococcus species (31 %), and Pseudomonas aerugi-nosa (7 %). Presentation of NHAP more frequently included pleural effusions (34 % vs 21 %, P<. 001) and multilobar involvement (31 % vs 24 %, P<. 001). Thirty-day hospital mortality was statistically greater among subjects with NHAP than among those with CAP (42 % vs 18 %, P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide, only a very small proportion of hospitalized patients with CAP present with NHAP; the poor outcomes for these patients may be due primarily to a higher number of comorbidities compared with patients without NHAP. Key words: pneumonia; respiratory infec-tions; clinical epidemiology; quality of life; nursing homes. [Respir Care 2014; 59 (7) : 1078 – 1085. © 2014 Daedalus Enterprises...|$|E
40|$|In May 2016, at the thirty-sixth {{session of}} the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), held in Mexico City, the Commission’s member States adopted {{resolution}} 700 (XXXVI), the Mexico Resolution, which established the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development as a regional mechanism to follow up and review {{the implementation of the}} 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its means of implementation, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The Economic and Social Council subsequently endorsed the establishment of the Forum in its resolution 2016 / 12. The regional response to this new challenge, the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development is State-led and open to the Latin American and Caribbean countries. It is convened under the auspices of ECLAC and is guided by the principles established for all follow-up and review processes by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly. It involves States, the private sector and civil society, as well as subsidiary bodies of ECLAC, development banks, other United Nations agencies and regional integration blocs. The Forum seeks to provide useful opportunities for peer learning, including through voluntary reviews, the sharing of best practices and discussion of shared targets. This report represents a contribution to the efforts by the region’s governments and the multiple stakeholders to implement, follow up and evaluate policies and strategies for the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are aware that no single document can encompass the complexity and variety of the challenges this involves. Accordingly, this report confines itself to three spheres: a diagnostic of progress made thus far and the challenges ahead; a description of national institutional mechanisms existing in the region for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda 2030; and an analysis of the challenges and opportunities involved in building and measuring Sustainable Development Goal indicators.

Observa-se no estudo a relevância do diálogo sobre a arte em sua identidade especificamente latino-americana (não europeia e nem americana), ocorrido nesta Bienal, e dentro dos quadros da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo. A tese apresenta quatro capítulos, além da introdução e das considerações finais. Os capítulos trazem informações sobre: (1) a Fundação Bienal de São Paulo e as Bienais Internacionais e Nacionais; (2) a organização da I Bienal Latino-Americana, o papel e a expectativa da crítica de arte; (3) o Simpósio, a apresentação de algumas teses, a perspectiva dos artistas; (4) a visão crítica de Aracy Amaral, os procedimentos relacionados a uma possível II Bienal Latino-Americana, as comissões estabelecidas pelos críticos de arte; e em especial, fazemos um comparativo da I Bienal Latino-Americana com a 30 º Bienal de São Paulo, e as atuais 54 º Bienal de Veneza e a Documenta 13, com uma complementação das Bienais do Mercosul e VentoSul. Recuperaram-se documentos inéditos, tendo-se uma preocupação de reconstruir historicamente o processo de organização desta Bienal, e extrair, dos diálogos registrados em textos, as ideias e estratégias pensadas pelo diretor artístico (curador), e pelos críticos envolvidos no Conselho de Arte e Cultura, e no Simpósio sobre o conceito de arte latino-americana. Evidencia-se o papel da crítica de arte. Trata-se igualmente, a questão da I Bienal Latino-Americana em permanecer parcialmente incógnita, por tantas décadas, nos estudos sobre a arte no Brasil. Na análise empreendida, discorre-se sobre a cena política e artística das décadas 1970 e 1980, sempre que este contexto é {{relevante}} para entender a ideia de uma mostra latino-americana de grande porte, a organização desta exposição e os seus desdobramentos críticos e culturais no debate sobre América Latina e Caribe. Uma atenção especial é dada, ao papel da arte no processo de integração desta região do continente americano, e seu possível legado para a contemporaneidade. Initially, {{this work}} presents a {{research on the}} <b>I</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>America</b> Biennial of 1978 and its Symposium. Secondly, the event brought subsidies to critical thinking about Contemporary Latin America continent. We have noted {{the relevance of the}} dialogue about art in its specifically Latin American identity (neither American nor European) occurred in this biennial, and within the frames of the São Paulo Biennial Foundation. Moreover, the thesis is presented in four chapters, besides the introduction and final considerations. The chapters bring information about: (1) São Paulo Biennial Foundation, including the view of the international editions plus the fourth national ones; (2) its organization of the first Latin America Biennial, its position and expectations of the art criticism; (3) the Symposium, the presentation of some thesis, and its artists belief; (4) the thought of the art critics of this period, especially the critical view of Aracy Amaral, the procedures related to a possible II Latin America Biennial, the commissions of art critics; in particular, the comparison of the I Latin American Biennial with the 30 th São Paulo Biennial, and similarities with the 54 th Venice Biennial and Documenta 13, plus, the Biennial of MERCOSUR and VentoSul. We recovered some unpublished documents and were concerned to reconstruct historically the process of organizing this biennial in study. Ideas and strategies designed by the artistic director (curator) about the concept of L̈atin American art and also by the art critics involved in the Art and Culture Council {{as well as in the}} Symposium were extracted from the documents. We have also investigated the issue of the Biennial being partially unknown for so many decades, especially in studies about art in Brazil. All in all, in the undertaken study, the artistic and political scene of the 1970 and 1980 s were considered whenever it is a relevant context to understand the idea of a large Latin American exhibition, its organization and its critical and cultural branches for the debate on Latin America and Caribbean. A special attention is given to the role of art in the process of integration of this region of the American continent...|$|E
