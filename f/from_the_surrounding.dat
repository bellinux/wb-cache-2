J Neurophysiol 88 : 2547 – 2556, 2002; 10. 1152 /jn. 00693. 2001. The responsiveness of neurons in V 1 is modulated by stimuli placed outside their classical receptive fields. This nonclassical surround provides input from a larger portion of the visual scene than originally thought, permitting integration of information at early levels in the visual processing stream. Signals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> have been reported variously to be suppressive and facilitatory, selective and unselective. We tested the specificity of influences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> by studying <b>the</b> interactions between drifting sinusoidal gratings carefully confined to conservatively defined center and surround regions. We found that <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> influence was always suppressive when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> grating was at the neuron’s preferred orientation. Suppression tended to be stronger when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> grating also moved in the neuron’s preferred direction, rather than it...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of color contrast on luminance discrimination. Observers were required to indicate the more intense of two stimuli presented briefly in a surround. In some conditions the two stimuli were the same chromaticity as <b>the</b> <b>surround,</b> while in other conditions the stimuli differed in chromaticity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround.</b> <b>The</b> luminance of the fixed test stimulus was varied in different conditions over a range <b>from</b> below <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> level to above <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> level. Difference thresholds were proportional to the luminance difference between test and surround over much of the range. However, difference thresholds were higher at low luminance contrasts when the chromatic contrast between the stimuli and <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> was high. Results also indicate that the effects of chromatic contrast may be mediated by local contrast mechanisms, but that the relationship between threshold and luminance contrast is not mediated entirely by these local contrast mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished {{more than they}} had in the previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E

Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.|$|E

Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid.
