50|$|An {{optical flow}} sensor is a vision sensor capable of {{measuring}} optical flow or visual motion and outputting a measurement based on optical flow. Various configurations of optical flow sensors exist. One configuration {{is an image}} sensor chip connected to a processor programmed to run an optical flow algorithm. Another configuration uses a vision chip, which is an integrated circuit having both the image sensor and the processor on the same die, allowing for a compact implementation. An {{example of this is}} a generic optical mouse sensor used in an optical mouse. In some cases the processing circuitry may be implemented using analog or mixed-signal circuits to enable fast optical <b>flow</b> <b>computation</b> using minimal current consumption. One area of contemporary research is the use of neuromorphic engineering techniques to implement circuits that respond to optical flow, and thus may be appropriate for use in an optical flow sensor. Such circuits may draw inspiration from biological neural circuitry that similarly responds to optical flow.|$|E
