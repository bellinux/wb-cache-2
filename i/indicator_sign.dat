40|$|Assessing {{unconsciousness}} in livestock {{at different}} stages of the slaughter process is a legal requirement according to EU legislation. The assessment can be based on absence of readily observable indicators (behavioural <b>indicators,</b> physical <b>signs</b> and reflexes) or, under experimental conditions, by recording and subsequent assessment of brain activity as presented in an electroencephalogram (EEG). There is no consensus, however, to what extent different behavioural <b>indicators,</b> physical <b>signs</b> and reflexes accurately reflect unconsciousness. The aim of this thesis was to study the relationships between these readily observable indicators and EEG activity to provide information on 1. the exact point in time at which animals lose consciousness when subjected to different stunning and slaughter methods and 2. the validity of behavioural <b>indicators,</b> physical <b>signs</b> and reflexes used to assess unconsciousness at slaughter under commercial conditions. The results showed a large variation in time to loss of consciousness, based on EEG activity, both between stunning and slaughter procedures and amongst animals. Captive bolt stunned calves lost consciousness instantly following the stun. Loss of consciousness in pigs during CO 2 stunning varied from 21 to 61 s after start of the exposure. An increased CO 2 concentration decreased the time to loss of consciousness. Times to loss of consciousness in sheep slaughtered without stunning varied from 6 to 24 s. In cattle slaughtered without stunning, times to loss of consciousness varied from 14 s up to over two minutes. Following captive bolt stunning in calves, absence of reflexes indicated unconsciousness. When consciousness was lost gradually (e. g. CO 2 stunning and non-stunned slaughter) none of the readily observable indicators could identify the exact point in time at which animals lost consciousness. Absence of rhythmic breathing, corneal reflex- and eyelid reflex were valid indicators of unconsciousness following CO 2 stunning and non-stunned slaughter, but these indicators were quite conservative as they were initially absent long after EEG activity indicated unconsciousness. When presence of these indicators would require (re) stunning, many animals will have to be (re) stunned. The results also showed that under full commercial conditions, stunning effectiveness must be closely monitored by slaughter plant employees, since risks for stun failures are higher under commercial conditions compared to experimental conditions...|$|R

To simplify the circuit structure of the proposed hybrid converter, switches of two converters are integrated with the switch integration technique. With this approach, the proposed hybrid converter has several merits, which are less component counts, lighter weight, smaller size, and higher conversion efficiency. Finally, a prototype of LED driving system under output voltage of 10 [*]V and output power of 20 [*]W has been implemented to verify its feasibility.

This research is a cross-sectional descriptive study that describes the congruency opinions between 91 patients /nurses about the reasons for patients’ fear related to coronary angiography in two affiliated hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The tools which were used included: questionnaire for study and recognition of patient and nurses demographic characteristics, a check list containing thirty probable reasons for patients’ fear which were filled out by patients and nurses, and a scale for analysis of the reasons for fear which were filled out by patients, descriptive statistics <b>indicators,</b> <b>sign</b> test, and t-test were applied in order to analyze the data, by SPSS software. The results showed that patients’ and nurses’ ideas about the reasons for fear before angiography are similar in two cases and only in one case after the operation. Among the thirty probable reasons which were mentioned for patients’ fear, seventeen cases caused less fear after angiography and two cases caused more fear after that. In the comparison between the intensity of fear caused by other reasons no insignificant result was observed. The comparison of intensity of fear showed that the intensity of patients’ fear after angiography is less than before (p= 0. 005). According to these cases it may be concluded that because of the different reasons for patients’ fear concerning angiography, nurses need {{to pay more attention to}} patients’ fear.

40|$|Important {{economic}} {{and human resources}} are currently devoted to the construction and experimentation of new indicators of human well-being and of environmental sustainability. However the ontological nature of socio-political indicators and the reasons why they are progressively invading the public sphere are left generally unexplored. This article tries to {{shed some light on}} these questions with the help of concepts and propositions borrowed from the writings of two outstanding representatives of the pragmatic movement in philosophy: Peirce and Dewey. First, taking as illustration Lorenzetti’s frescoes of the “Allegory of the Good and Bad Government ” in Siena, and drawing on Peirce’s semiotics we analyze political <b>indicators</b> as <b>signs</b> that circulate between the governments and the public. We then mobilize Dewey’s theory of the public and of social inquiry to account for the increasing importance of indicators in contemporary policy-making. Bringing together these two pieces, we discuss the importance of cognitive structures called “frames ” in the interpretation of <b>indicators</b> as public <b>signs</b> {{and the fact that they}} are most often than not different for the three categories of actors involved in addressing social problems: the political leaders, the experts, and the public. We conclude on the importance of organizing debates between these three partners as early as possible in the social inquiry process in order to avoid mismatches between their respective ways of framing the problems...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{concept of}} Minimal Brain Dysfunctions (MBD), i. e. minor psycho-organic symptoms, has gained {{considerable}} scientific interest in earlier years. In clinical practice there are regularly patients {{who do not}} fulfil the criteria for ADHD but still show distinct psycho-organic symptoms. On the other hand, patients with ADHD almost regularly do not only show the core criteria of ADHD but also additional signs of a psycho-organic syndrome. Furthermore do epidemiological data suggest that in a non-selected population of patients with mental disorders about 10 % should show some indicators for minimal brain dysfunction. In this study we assessed <b>indicator</b> <b>signs</b> for a MBD in a non-selected population of patients with psychological problems in order to study their frequency and interrelations. Methods: 1346 consecutive inpatients of a department for behavioral medicine filled in the MBD self rating questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 20 items, which cover symptoms characteristic for a psycho-organic syndrome. The items are rated as 0 (not present) or 1 (present). In this paper we report data on the {{factor analysis of the}} scale. Results: The average score has been 7, 6 (s. d. 4, 1, range 0 - 20), with a normal distribution of scores. Three factors had an Eigenwert > 1, explaining 38, 8 % of variance: a) „disorders of affect regulation“, b) „impairment of memory and orientation“, and c) „disorders of drive and autonomic instability“. Conclusions: The data suggest, that psycho-organic impairment is not a dichotomous but dimensional phenomenon, as can be expected for theoretical reasons. The factors of the MBD scale reflect the classical tri-dimensional structure of psycho-organic brain syndromes. For the understanding of mental disorders in general and ADHD in particular, the MBD concept should gain new attention...|$|R
40|$|Dams that {{comprise}} broadly and widely graded glacial materials, such as moraines, {{have been found}} to be susceptible to internal erosion, perhaps more than dams of other soil types. Internal erosion washes out fine-grained particles from the filling material; the erosion occurs within the material itself or at an interface to another dam zone, depending on the mode of initiation. Whether or not internal erosion proceeds depend on the adequacy of the filter material. If internal erosion is allowed, it may manifest itself as sinkholes on the crest, increased leakage and muddy seepage once it surfaces, which here is called surfacing internal erosion (i. e. internal erosion in the excessive erosion or continuation phase). In spite of significant developments since the 1980 s in the field of internal erosion assessment, the validity of methods developed by others on broadly graded materials are still less clear because most available criteria are based on tests of narrowly graded granular soils. This thesis specifically addresses dams that are composed of broadly graded glacial soils and investigates typical <b>indicators,</b> <b>signs</b> and behaviors of internal erosion prone dams. Based on a review of 90 + existing moraine core dams, which are located mainly in Scandinavia as well as North America and Australia/New Zealand, this thesis will show that not only the filter’s coarseness needs to be reviewed when assessing the potential for internal erosion to surface (i. e., erosion in the excessive or continuing phase); in addition, the grading stability of the filter and the core material as well as non-homogeneities that are caused by filter segregation need to be studied. Cross-referencing between these aspects improves the assessment of potential for internal erosion in dams of broadly graded soils and furthermore it provides aid-to-judgment. QC 2010071...|$|R

The null hypothesis of the exogeneity test is largely not rejected for all indicators, 38 suggesting that both estimators are consistent but OLS is more efficient than 2 SLS. We therefore focus on the former: for one pp increase in early non-employment, the probability to be salaried employed and overall employed decrease by 0.17 % and 0.12 %, respectively.

Our research intends to detect specific <b>indicators</b> and predictive <b>signs</b> of violent and aggressive behaviours. In order to this, scientific literature shows that the most reliable <b>indicators</b> and predictive <b>signs</b> are linked to structural personality features (e. g. defensive strategies, impulse control). Methods. This cross sectional study compares a group of 26 male adolescents with Conduct Disorder (F 91. 8), a group of 29 male patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (F 60. 31) and a group of 33 male prisoners with Antisocial Personality Disorder (F 60. 2).

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to the detection and extraction of text in road sign panels. Text strings, <b>indicators</b> and <b>signs</b> extraction is efficiently performed so OCR algorithms can recognize different characters that may be present on the traffic plane. In a first step, basic color segmentation and shape classification is done {{for the purpose of}} detecting possible rectangular planes. Every detected plane is extracted from the original image and then reoriented. Chrominance and luminance histogram analysis and adaptive segmentation is carried out, and connected components labeling and position clustering is finally done for the arrangement of the different characters on the panel. Special emphasis has been placed on the adaptive segmentation. Experimental results have showed that following steps strongly depends on correct separation between the background and foreground objects of the panel. Moreover, OCR systems are highly sensitive to noise, and we have put special attention into it in order that the OCR system could be able to recognize characters properly.
