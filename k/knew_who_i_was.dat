25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
500|$|During his monologue, host Rock joked, [...] "Clint Eastwood's a star, OK? Tobey Maguire's {{just a boy}} in tights," [...] He also added, [...] "You want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Then I got angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films come out at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E

500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Walking {{home from}} school just before her tenth birthday, she was {{reportedly}} gang raped by five men. According to Satana, her attackers were never prosecuted, and it was rumored that the judge had been paid off. She tells how this prompted her to learn martial arts, such as aikido and karate. Over the next 15 years, she tracked down each rapist and exacted revenge. [...] "I made a vow to myself that I would someday, somehow get even with all of them," [...] she said years later. [...] "They never <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> until I told them." [...] Around this time, she formed a gang, [...] "the Angeles", with Italian, Jewish, and Polish girls from her neighborhood. In an interview with Psychotronic Video, [...] she said, [...] "We had leather motorcycle jackets, jeans and boots...and we kicked butt." [...] Because of frequent delinquency, she was sent to reform school. When she was 13, her parents arranged her marriage to 17-year-old John Satana in Hernando, Mississippi, which lasted nine months.|$|E

5000|$|When Casper Christensen {{was first}} {{appointed}} postmaster and bishop, a postal inspector found him {{working in the}} field and tried to make him understand that he wanted to inspect his postal records. Finally in desperation he said, [...] "You don't seem to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a postal inspector." [...] Brother Casper indignantly replied, [...] "And YOU don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I'm the Bishop on the Creek!"

60|$|There {{was not a}} quiver of {{expression}} in her cold acknowledgment of my declaration. Nevertheless, at that moment I received an inspiration. I was perfectly sure that she <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and what I had come for.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's nigh ready," [...] {{answered}} the girl, gazing {{at him with}} wonder in her eyes. [...] "Don't you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> granduncle? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Norah Brewster from Witham." ...|$|R

60|$|I didn't {{try to make}} {{conversation}} with Captain Giles, whom I had not seen more than twice in my life.

6000|$|... "Cheer up," [...] said Tommy. [...] "No harm done. That butler's an {{old friend}} of mine--I bet he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> though he didn't let on. It's not their game to show suspicion. That's why we've found it fairly plain sailing. They don't want to {{discourage}} me altogether. On the other hand, they don't want to make it too easy. I'm a pawn in their game, Albert, that's what I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily, the fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that promising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who's blundered in just at the right moment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of--of--I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking of, and it doesn't {{make any difference}} anyway; somebody idolized him, I recollect {{it as if it}} were yesterday; and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Julien," [...] she asked, [...] "I beg {{of you to}} tell me this. If you do not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{why have}} you {{mentioned}} Herr Freudenberg's name to me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Brice {{bit his lip}} {{and walked}} on silently, at which she cast a sidelong glance under her widely spaced heavy lashes and said demurely, [...] "I thought last night it was mighty good for you {{to stand up for}} your frien' Yuba Bill, and then, after ye <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> to let the folks see you kinder cottoned to me too. Not in the style o' that land-grabber Heckshill, nor that peart {{newspaper}} man, neither. Of course I gave them as good as they sent," [...] she went on, with a little laugh, but Brice could see that her sensitive lip in profile had the tremulous and resentful curve of one who was accustomed to slight and annoyance. Was it possible that this reckless, self-contained girl felt her position keenly? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven {{knows how}} I've kept clear," [...] he declared, [...] "but there isn't a thing against me. I sailed {{close to the}} wind in Mexico. I'd have fought for them against America if they'd really meant business, but they didn't. I {{was too late for}} the Boer War or I'd have been in that for a certainty. I went through South America, but the little {{fighting}} I did there doesn't amount to anything. After I came back to the States I ran some close shaves, I admit, but I kept clear of the law. Then I got in with some Germans at Washington. They <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and they knew very well how I felt about England. I did a few things for them--nothing risky. They were keeping me for something big. That came along, as you know. They offered me the job of bringing these things to England, and I took it on." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{look and}} manner unmistakably betrayed that he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> {{and that he}} wanted to irritate me into quarrelling with him. His reply was insolent enough to have {{answered}} the purpose, if I had been less determined to control myself. As it was, I met him with the most resolute politeness, apologised for my involuntary intrusion (which he called a [...] "trespass,") and left the grounds. It was exactly as I suspected. The recognition of me when I left Mr. Kyrle's office had been evidently communicated to Sir Percival Glyde, and the man in black had been sent to the Park in anticipation of my making inquiries at the house or in the neighbourhood. If I had given him the least chance of lodging any sort of legal complaint against me, the interference of the local magistrate would no doubt have been turned to account as a clog on my proceedings, and a means of separating me from Marian and Laura for some days at least.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon {{they will}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> by that," [...] he said, {{and he was}} right, for Sam told the girls that the fourth man was Captain Blossom beyond a doubt.|$|R

6000|$|I {{tried to}} soothe her. [...] "Why do I frighten you? You <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Can you doubt my {{interest}} in you, after <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> the means of saving your life?" ...|$|R
