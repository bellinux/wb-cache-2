25|$|However, it is {{also clear}} from the law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Since their debut, Kent had {{recorded}} {{a large number}} of b-sides, usually exceptional in quality. [...] Since most of these singles had long gone out of print, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get these legally, so in 2000, Kent released the 2CD B-side collection B-sidor 95–00 (B-Sides 95–00). It featured 21 b-sides, re-recorded versions of two of these and two totally new songs. [...] One of them, [...] "Chans" [...] (Chance), was also released as a single.

Disillusioned with the car's unreliability, Ford pulled out of the project, with Michael Kranefuss {{going so far as to}} say that [...] "it was the worst project I've ever been involved in." [...] Even if the Mustang GTP had been reliable, the car had questionable aerodynamics, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> drive when the fuel loads were low. Zakspeed would replace the car with the Ford Mustang Probe for 1985, while Roush would eventually resurface in 1987, with the Ford Mustang Maxum GTP.|$|E
2500|$|Ethan Mordden writes, [...] "It was {{a flawed}} voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident {{defiance}} becoming {{aspects of the}} canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing." [...] Giulini believes, [...] "If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, {{it is impossible to}} imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas." [...] He recalls that during Callas's performances of La traviata, [...] "reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself." [...] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.|$|E

2500|$|In {{promoting}} the album, frontman and lead vocalist Stephan Jenkins recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring {{to it as}} [...] "too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun". He also commented {{that it had been}} more collaborative than their prior album; bassist Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while drummer Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album. However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from Elektra Records, and isolation between members, stating: [...] "We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. I did my best to, to produce that record and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> do. Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{chapter of}} SBVT's Unfit for Command {{questioned}} Kerry's statements {{that he was}} in Cambodia during the war. [...] Kerry did not claim to have been sent on a covert mission to Cambodia on Christmas Eve, 1968. [...] Rather, he believed at the time he had crossed the border while on a patrol near the border, during which the boats were ambushed and later came under friendly fire from South Vietnamese soldiers. [...] None of Kerry's crewmates confirmed being sent to Cambodia. One of Kerry's crewmen, SBVT member Steven Gardner, asserted that it was physically impossible to cross the Cambodian border, as it was blocked and patrolled by PBRs (a type of patrol boat); however, Kerry's boat was evidently patrolling with PBRs during the mission in question. [...] Some crewmembers have, moreover, stated that they may at some point have entered Cambodia without knowing it. [...] James Wasser, who was on PCF-44 on that December mission, while saying that he believed they were [...] "very, very close" [...] to Cambodia, did not recall actually crossing over; he also stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> tell their exact position in the border area. Kerry's own journal entry on this, written the night of the mission, does not specifically say they entered Cambodia. However, it does state that PCF-44 was somewhere [...] "toward Cambodia" [...] to provide cover for two smaller patrol boats, and in sarcasm, that he considered messaging Christmas greetings to his commanders [...] "from the most inland Market Time unit" [...] and that a court martial for the incident [...] "would make sense" [...] In addition, George [...] Elliott noted in Kerry's fitness report that he had been in an ambush during the 24-hour Christmas truce, which began on Christmas Eve.|$|E
