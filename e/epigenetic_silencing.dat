5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing.</b> The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> gene <b>silencing</b> of tumor {{suppressor}} genes is {{a common}} event in cancer initiation and progression. Genes that are silenced epigenetically undergo both structural changes in the chromatin, including alterations in histone modifications and compaction of nucleosomes, {{and changes in the}} DNA methylation levels. However, there is no evidential consensus on the process that initiates <b>epigenetic</b> gene <b>silencing.</b> Oncogenic transformation by K-Ras can result in downstream <b>epigenetic</b> gene <b>silencing</b> and this approach was used to investigate the temporospatial sequence of events. Here, I describe the establishment of a stable colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line conditionally expressing oncogenic Kirsten (K) -Ras that induces downstream <b>epigenetic</b> gene <b>silencing.</b> The cell line was sequentially transduced to combine a transactivator with a transgene that induces an oncogenic K-Ras. The transactivator conditionally activates the expression of oncogenic K-Ras-G 12 V when cultured in the presence of doxycycline. This inducible, Tet-On, cell line is the system that will allow the changes in chromatin structure and DNA methylation to be studied during controlled periods so structural changes can be observed from beginning to end in the process of gene silencing...|$|R

25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process. This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause nucleosome remodeling. Nucleosome remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing</b> of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} is a zinc-accumulating, citrate-producing organ. The protein ZIP1 {{is responsible}} for the active transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of the zinc's important roles is to change the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. This allows prostate cancer cells to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the transporter protein ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene SLC39A1. The cause of the <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing</b> is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits NF-κB pathways, is anti-proliferative and induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without the active transporter, ZIP1.|$|E

5000|$|Since cell {{immortality}} is an obligate {{feature of}} the cancer cell and MORT was discovered as a target of <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing</b> at the boundary where finite lifespan human cells transition from mortal to immortal, MORT’s epigenetic inactivation may create a cellular state permissive to cell immortalization and suggests a possible tumor suppressive mechanism of MORT’s action. If this prediction is true, then <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing</b> of MORT should be an early identifiable lesion during human carcinogenesis and predicted to occur in premalignant lesions where cells have acquired pathologic immortality on their route to malignant transformation. Indeed, recent work has shown that MORT is epigenetically silenced in both DCIS, a premalignant lesion of invasive breast cancer, and colonic adenomas, a premalignant lesion of colon adenocarcinoma. [...] Furthermore <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing</b> of MORT is associated with luminal, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, overexpression of the oncogene CCND1, and GATA3 mutations, but is negatively correlated with p53 mutations [...] In summary, aberrant DNA hypermethylation-mediated <b>epigenetic</b> <b>silencing</b> of MORT occurs early during human carcinogenesis probably {{at the time when}} a mortal cell pathologically transitions to an immortal cell.|$|E

Moreover, the practical uses of HDAC inhibitors in cancer therapy, as well as their synergistic effects with other therapeutic strategies are yet to be evaluated.

40|$|Abstract Background Silencing of transgenes in mice is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} typically associated with short multi-copy transgenes. We have investigated the regulation of the highly inducible human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor gene (Csf 2) in transgenic mice. Results In {{the absence of any}} previous history of transcriptional activation, this transgene was expressed in T lineage cells at the correct inducible level in all lines of mice tested. In contrast, the transgene was silenced in a specific subset of lines in T cells that had encountered a previous episode of activation. Transgene silencing appeared to be both transcription-dependent and mediated by <b>epigenetic</b> mechanisms. <b>Silencing</b> was accompanied by loss of DNase I hypersensitive sites and inability to recruit RNA polymerase II upon stimulation. This pattern of silencing was reflected by increased methylation and decreased acetylation of histone H 3 K 9 in the transgene. We found that silenced lines were specifically associated with a single pair of tail-to-tail inverted repeated copies of the transgene embedded within a multi-copy array. Conclusions Our study suggests that <b>epigenetic</b> transgene <b>silencing</b> can result from convergent transcription of inverted repeats which can lead to silencing of an entire multi-copy transgene array. This mechanism may account for a significant proportion of the reported cases of transgene inactivation in mice. </p...|$|R
