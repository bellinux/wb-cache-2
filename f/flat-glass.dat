50|$|The {{contact copying}} process {{was used in}} the early days of {{photography}} and sunlight-exposed blueprints; it is still used in amateur photography, silkscreen printing, offset printing, and photochemical machining, such as the manufacture of Printed circuit boards. By the early 20th century, blueprinting (producing white lines) or diazo blue line printing used contact-rollers rather than <b>flat-glass</b> exposure.|$|E

Privacy film for <b>flat-glass</b> {{commercial and residential}} applications may be silvered, offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. It may also be frosted, rendering the window translucent but not transparent.

50|$|The Libbey-Owens-Ford Company (LOF) was a {{producer}} of flat glass for the automotive and building products industries both for original equipment manufacturers and for replacement use. The company's headquarters and main factories were located in Toledo, Ohio, with large float glass plants in Rossford, Ohio, Laurinburg, North Carolina, Ottawa, Illinois, Shreveport, Louisiana, and Lathrop, California. The company was formed by the merger of Libbey-Owens' <b>flat-glass</b> operation with the Edward Ford Plate Glass Company, both located in Toledo, in 1930.|$|E
5000|$|AGC Flat Glass Europe {{was one of}} {{the four}} <b>flat-glass</b> {{manufacturers}} involved in the 2007 price fixing scandal uncovered by the EU Competition Commission. The European Commission said that the firms had raised or stabilised prices in 2004 and 2005 through illicit contacts. Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner, said that the EU would [...] "not tolerate companies cheating consumers and business customers by fixing prices and depriving them of the benefits of the single market".|$|E
50|$|The Crown Supercoach Series II was {{introduced}} during 1989 during {{an effort to}} fit the Crown Supercoach with a methanol-fueled version of the Detroit Diesel 6V92. While the chassis accepted the V6 engine, it came at a cost, requiring significant modifications to the engine compartment to fit properly. However, Crown Coach saw this as the first opportunity to update the Supercoach school bus since it entered production in 1949. To minimize overall production costs, the body between the entry door and rear seats was common to the previous-generation Supercoach, which remained in production. The Series II was given a new driver's compartment (with an all-new instrument panel), new bodywork for the roof, rear compartment, and a <b>flat-glass</b> windshield.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 1 used a 1500 cc MGA or Riley 1.5 litre {{engine in}} a ladder chassis with Elva {{designed}} independent front suspension. The engine was set well {{back in the}} chassis to help weight distribution, which produced good handling but encroached on the cockpit making the car a little cramped. The chassis carried lightweight 2-seater open glassfibre bodywork. It was produced as a complete car for the US and European market and available in kit form for the UK market. After about 50 cars were made it was upgraded to the Mk II which was the same car but fitted with a proprietary curved glass windscreen, replacing the original <b>flat-glass</b> split type, and the larger 1600 cc MGA engine. Approximately 400 of the Mk I and II were made.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1941/42 model years, the 216cid inline 6 [...] "Blue Flame" [...] {{engine was}} the only one offered. It {{produced}} 85 horsepower at 3300 rpm. In 1947 output was bumped up to 90 horsepower. A Deluxe of this vintage could easily exceed 80 miles per hour without overdrive. The transmission was a manual synchromesh 3 speed, with vacuum assisted shift, in which the [...] "three-on-the-tree" [...] shifter was able to be moved between gears by the slightest pressure on the lever. Third gear was direct, meaning the input and output are equal speeds. Overdrive was a rare option. Connection to the third member rear-end was via an enclosed [...] "torque tube" [...] driveshaft. The brakes were hydraulic with all-wheel drums. The master cylinder was located beneath the driver. Shock absorbers were of the lever type. The windshield through 1952 was of a split, <b>flat-glass</b> type. The wipers were vacuum actuated. Chevrolet offered windshield washers on some years.|$|E

In 1951, the brakes got larger. The master cylinder was located below the floor connected on the frame rail, beneath the driver. Shock absorbers were of the lever type for the early years only.

50|$|Only one RU {{was fitted}} with a luxury-coach body however, this was ordered by Accrington and {{delivered}} to Hyndburn as its 38 (STC968M). This carried {{one of the three}} East Lancashire 'Lancastrian' coach bodies built, the only one to 10-metre length. It was an ungainly vehicle with a high ramped floor, carrying 39 Plaxton seats, all forward-facing, Large curved side screens were used on the four main-bays, of a type used on contemporary Mercedes-Benz and Neoplan coaches leading to a parabolic roof contour, but aft of the rear axle flat Willowbrook-pattern bus glazing was used, offside and nearside emergency doors were fitted. A wide two-leaf entry/exit door was fitted forward of the front axle to ensure grant-compliance, and the front was basically flat with a very large angled <b>flat-glass</b> windscreen surmounted by a peak reminiscent of a British Rail 'Western' diesel-hydraulic locomotive. Luggage was contained in underfloor wheelbase lockers as in contemporary Bristol RE coaches. It spent a quiet life, working peak hour extras and select coach hires. It seems an irony that two early Harrington Cavaliers were exclusively to transport the blind yet this coach, finished in navy blue with scarlet flashes, was able to assault the senses of the sighted for one of the longer operational lives of its type, actually outlasting the two similar bodies Widnes/Halton had on Leopards. Hyndburn 38 may have been an aesthetic disaster, but it was not: unlike most RU, a mechanical one (see later). The RU was intended as a municipal bus, and 42% went to Corporation bus fleets, NBC (the Crosville order) took 36%, and independents, mainly Lancashire United accounted for 20%. The other buses were the two demonstrators and three delivered to PTEs. The formation of the West Yorkshire PTE gave them an instant fleet of 24 with two on delivery, South Yorkshire PTE inherited 34 with the Doncaster and Rotherham Fleets, and upon purchasing Lancashire United on 1 January 1976 Greater Manchester Transport found its fleet of RU climbing from one to fifty-one. The strangest case of all was that of the original demonstrator which went to Green Bus Service of Rugeley from 1971 until 1974 when Midland Red took them over. Midland Red sold it to a dealer and it was purchased for the enlarged Lancaster operation. Thus out of the four sectors purchasing RU, this bus served in three of them and briefly gave NBC a second RU operator.|$|E
