50|$|Yam, a {{tropical}} crop in the genus Dioscorea, has {{as many as}} 600 species out of which six are economically important staple species. These are: Dioscorea rotundata (white <b>guinea</b> <b>yam),</b> Dioscorea alata (yellow yam), Dioscorea bulbifera (aerial yam), Dioscorea esculant (Chinese yam) and Dioscorea dumetorum (trifoliate yam). Out of these, Dioscorea rotundata (white yam) and Dioscorea alata (water yam) {{are the most common}} species in Nigeria. Yams are grown in the coastal region in rain forests, wood savanna and southern savanna habitats.|$|E
50|$|Yam {{is grown}} on free draining, sandy and fertile soil, after {{clearing}} the first fallow. Land is prepared {{in the form}} of mound or ridge or heap of 1 m height. The yams recommended for such soil conditions in Nigeria are white yam or white <b>guinea</b> <b>yam</b> (Discorea rotundata) and water yam or yellow yam (Discorea alata). Planting is done by seed yam or cut setts from ware tubers. One day before planting, the tubers have to be subjected to treatment with wood ash or a fungicide (thiabendazole) to prevent damage to the soils. The setts are planted at an interval of 15 - 20 cm with the cut face facing up. Mulching is essential during October-November with dry grass or plant debris weighed down with balls of mud. Dosage of fertilizer application, as essential, is decided after chemical analysis of the soil samples. Manual weeding by hoeing is done three or four times depending on the rate of weed growth. Two Stakes, each of 2 m height are used for staking the plants to vine over it; one for two plants with the other used for bracing with the adjacent stakes. Sorghum stovers are also used for this purpose in the savannah land. Pest and disease control is addressed by cultural control and chemical methods; the pests which affect the plant are nematodes such as root knot Meloidogyne spp. and yam nematode (Scutellonema bradys), and insects such as yam shoot beetle, yam tuber beetle and crickets. Weeding of the field is essential and maintaining a 2 - 3 m weed free border around the field is to be ensured. Disease resistant cultivars are normally recommended for use. Harvesting is done before the vines become dry and soil becomes dry and hard. Generally, a yield of 10-15 tonnes per ha for white yam and 16-25 tonnes for water yam are obtained by following prescribed management practices. The harvested yams are stored by tying them with ropes. They have a shelf life of about 5 months. Warehouses where they are stored should be made rodent proof with a metal base and wire netting. Rotten buds and sprouted buds should be removed.|$|E
40|$|Open Access Journal; Published online: 19 Sept 2017 Background Root and tuber {{crops are}} a major food source in {{tropical}} Africa. Among these crops are several species in the monocotyledonous genus Dioscorea collectively known as yam, a staple tuber crop that contributes enormously to the subsistence and socio-cultural lives of millions of people, principally in West and Central Africa. Yam cultivation is constrained by several factors, and yam {{can be considered a}} neglected “orphan” crop that would benefit from crop improvement efforts. However, the lack of genetic and genomic tools has impeded the improvement of this staple crop. Results To accelerate marker-assisted breeding of yam, we performed genome analysis of white <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea rotundata) and assembled a 594 -Mb genome, 76. 4 % of which was distributed among 21 linkage groups. In total, we predicted 26, 198 genes. Phylogenetic analyses with 2381 conserved genes revealed that Dioscorea is a unique lineage of monocotyledons distinct from the Poales (rice), Arecales (palm), and Zingiberales (banana). The entire Dioscorea genus is characterized by the occurrence of separate male and female plants (dioecy), a feature that has limited efficient yam breeding. To infer the genetics of sex determination, we performed whole-genome resequencing of bulked segregants (quantitative trait locus sequencing [QTL-seq]) in F 1 progeny segregating for male and female plants and identified a genomic region associated with female heterogametic (male[*]=[*]ZZ, female[*]=[*]ZW) sex determination. We further delineated the W locus and used it to develop a molecular marker for sex identification of <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> plants at the seedling stage. Conclusions <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> belongs to a unique and highly differentiated clade of monocotyledons. The genome analyses and sex-linked marker development performed in this study should greatly accelerate marker-assisted breeding of <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam.</b> In addition, our QTL-seq approach can be utilized in genetic studies of other outcrossing crops and organisms with highly heterozygous genomes. Genomic analysis of orphan crops such as yam promotes efforts to improve food security and the sustainability of tropical agriculture.

40|$|Yams (Dioscorea spp) are staple edible tuber food crop, {{a favored}} source of {{medicinal}} plants with socio-cultural value in West Africa, Asia, Far East, Oceania and the Caribbean regions. However, the knowledge {{on the extent}} of genetic diversity and relationship between the main cultivated Dioscorea species and wild relatives, molecular tools to support conventional taxonomic identification and genes responsible for key traits are limited. In the current project first we have evaluated the performance of candidate DNA barcode regions of flowering plants for distinguishing Dioscorea species. Important markers were identified that fulfill better the criteria for good DNA barcode regions in terms of PCR amplification, sequence quality and discriminatory power. The second research question demonstrated genetic relationship, variation in ploidy level, pattern of heterozygosity and allele sharing, contribution of wild relatives to cultivated species and confirmation on the previous and new suggestions in <b>guinea</b> <b>yams</b> taxonomy utilizing next generation sequencing based genotyping, GBS (genotyping by sequncing), combined with ploidy level and morphological data. The research project also explored morphological, ploidy and genetic variation across aerial tuber and non-aerial tuber producing D. alata accessions. The different patterns in terms of ploidy level, morphological traits and genetic variation revealed across D. alata accessions generally higlighted the importance of developing cultivars with aerial tubers in yam improvement programs as a contribution to solve the challenge with yam planting materials. The fourth research question aimed to analyze transcriptomes in relation to flowering and sex differentiation using high throughput Super-SAGE (Serial Anaysis of Gene Expression) technique and discovered several candidate genes. In addition the study explored variation in flower sex type and other morphological traits across D. rotundata genebank accessions.

40|$|<b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea cayenensis–D. rotundata complex) is an {{important}} tuber crop that highly contributes to food security and poverty alleviation in Benin. The {{knowledge and understanding of}} the extent of genetic variation of <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> germplasm is important for planning of the genetic conservation, and the utilisation of this resource. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the genetic diversity and relationships of 64 yam landraces whose dried chips are considered as resistant to insect attacks using 41 simple sequence repeat. Among these primers, 13 were found to be polymorphic, giving 113 polymorphic alleles. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 (Ym 50) to 13 (Ym 29), with an average of 8. 69. Unique allele was observed with some landraces (Singou and Tchakatchaka) and can be considered as unique gene and use in yam breeding program. The mean polymorphic information content values for all markers used was 0. 76 and ranged between 0. 58 and 0. 91 in loci YM 3 and YM 32 respectively. The genetic distance of yam landraces ranged from 0. 45 (Yasoubagarou) to 0. 04 (Assinapeira and Alahina), indicating that the yam germplasm has a high degree of genetic diversity supported by an averagely observed heterozygosity of 0. 78. Cluster analysis using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average grouped the 64 yam landraces into two distinct clusters. This tendency was also observed in the principal coordinate analysis. The analysis of molecular variance revealed that 96 % of the variation was found within the population and only 4 % between the populations. Genetic diversity and relationship assessments among the 64 yam landraces of Benin could provide useful information for efficient use of these materials, especially for genetic improvement.

For the majority (78. 94 %) of the constraints, the use of tolerant cultivars remains the most sustainable, economically profitable and environment preservative solution. Farmers ’ cultivar preference criteria identified are many (24 in total). Among them, high productivity, good quality of pounded yam, resistance to drought and adaptability to all types of soils are the most important.

The genetic diversity of about 70 cultivars of Dioscorea cayenensis/Dioscorea rotundata (<b>Guinea</b> <b>yam)</b> and about 20 cultivars of Dioscorea alata (water yam) was analysed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The amplified bands revealed high polymorphism.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of photoperiod on the duration from vine (shoot) emergence to flowering in white or <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea rotundata). The duration from vine emergence to flowering in two clonal varieties of yam (TDr 131 and TDr 99 - 9) was recorded at 10 different sowing dates/locations in Nigeria. Durations to flowering varied from 40 to > 88 days. Mean daily temperature and photoperiod between vine emergence and flowering varied from 25 to 27 degrees C and 13. 1 to 13. 4 h day(- 1), respectively. Both clones had similar responses to temperature, with base and optimum temperatures of 12 and 25 - 27 degrees C, respectively. Thermal durations to flowering were strongly related (r(2) > 0. 75 - 0. 83) to absolute photoperiod (h) at vine emergence as well as to rate of change of photoperiod (s day(- 1)) at vine emergence. The response to absolute photoperiod suggests that white yams are quantitative LDPs, flowering sooner in long than short days. Yams also flowered earlier when the rate of change of photoperiod was positive but small, or was negative. It is suggested that yams may use a combination of photoperiod and rate of change in order to fine tune flowering time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Abstract Patterns of genetic diversity within and between two cultivated guinea yams (Dioscorea rotundata and D. cayenensis) and five wild relatives (D. praehensilis, D. mangenotiana, D. abyssinica, D. togoensis and D. burkilliana) were investigated using next-generation sequencing (genotyping by sequencing, GBS). Additionally, the two cultivated species were assessed for intra-specific morphological and ploidy variation. In guinea yams, ploidy level is correlated with species identity. Using flow cytometry a single ploidy level was inferred across D. cayenensis (3 x, N = 21), D. praehensilis (2 x, N = 7), and D. mangenotiana (3 x, N = 5) accessions, whereas both diploid and triploid (or aneuploid) accessions were present in D. rotundata (N = 11 and N = 32, respectively). Multi-dimensional scaling and maximum parsimony analyses of 2, 215 SNPs revealed that wild <b>guinea</b> <b>yam</b> populations form discrete genetic groupings according to species. D. togoensis and D. burkilliana were most distant from the two cultivated yam species, whereas D. abyssinica, D. mangenotiana, and D. praehensilis were closest to cultivated yams. In contrast, cultivated species were genetically less clearly defined at the intra-specific level. While D. cayenensis formed a single genetic group, D. rotundata comprised three separate groups consisting of; (1) a set of diploid individuals genetically similar to D. praehensilis, (2) a set of diploid individuals genetically similar to D. cayenensis, and (3) a set of triploid individuals.

The proportion of flowering plants was low in both clones, averaging 0. 34 in clone TDr 131 and 0. 13 in clone TDr 99 - 9. Day of vine emergence had a significant and contrasting effect on the proportion of flowering plants and on flowering intensity in the two clones. In clone TDr 131, the proportion of flowering plants and flowering intensity declined with later vine emergence at all locations (r= 0. 43 - 0. 53, P< 0. 05), whereas in clone TDr 99 - 9 the proportion of flowering plants increased with later emergence (r= 0. 46, P< 0. 01). In clone TDr 131, this response was strongly associated with warmer temperatures (r= 0. 49 - 0. 50; P< 0. 05) and greater cumulative radiation (r= 0. 85 - 0. 93; P< 0. 001) between vine emergence and flowering, rather than photoperiod at vine emergence. This suggests that flowering behaviour in the male clone TDr 131 is strongly influenced by factors that affect growth rather than development. Clone TDr 99 - 9, on the other hand, exhibited no clear relations between flowering and growth or developmental factors, though the proportion of flowering plants and flowering intensity was greatest at planting dates close to the longest day and at temperatures of 25 - 26 degrees C. This might suggest that flowering behaviour in clone TDr 99 - 9 is controlled by photothermal responses...|$|E
40|$|Published online: 01 April 2009 White or <b>Guinea</b> <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea rotundata), {{grown for}} its {{underground}} tubers, {{is an important}} food in West Africa. Progress in yam breeding is constrained by variable flowering behaviour, making hybridization difficult. Yam clones may be dioecious, monoecious or hermaphrodite with variable sex ratios. The proportion of plants that flower and the flowering intensity also vary with season and location. The objective of the present work was to investigate whether variation in flowering behaviour was related to factors determining rate of development (photoperiod and temperature through sowing date, location and year) or growth (cumulative solar radiation and temperature). Sex ratios, the proportion of plants that had flower buds and open flowers, {{and the number of}} flowers or spikes was recorded in one male (TDr 131) and one female (TDr 99 - 9) clone of white yam grown in the field in Nigeria at three locations and at different sowing dates. Clone TDr 131 was uniformly male flowering, while clone TDr 99 - 9 exhibited a number of sex types with gynoecious, monoecious and trimonoecious plants observed. The proportion of flowering plants was low in both clones, averaging 0 · 34 in clone TDr 131 and 0 · 13 in clone TDr 99 - 9. Day of vine emergence had a significant and contrasting effect on the proportion of flowering plants and on flowering intensity in the two clones. In clone TDr 131, the proportion of flowering plants and flowering intensity declined with later vine emergence at all locations (r= 0 · 43 – 0 · 53; P< 0 · 05), whereas in clone TDr 99 - 9 the proportion of flowering plants increased with later emergence (r= 0 · 46, P< 0 · 01). In clone TDr 131, this response was strongly associated with warmer temperatures (r= 0 · 49 – 0 · 50; P< 0 · 05) and greater cumulative radiation (r= 0 · 85 – 0 · 93; P< 0 · 001) between vine emergence and flowering, rather than photoperiod at vine emergence.
