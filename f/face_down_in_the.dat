5|$|Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) {{gave birth}} to Fenmore prematurely, and {{he was forced to}} remain in the {{hospital}} for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Summers Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had cosmetic surgery to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that {{the cause of death was}} drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E

25|$|Quality {{life jackets}} always provide more {{buoyancy}} than {{offered by the}} buoyancy aids alone.

There are no headstones in the cemetery, two large concrete crosses laid <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass mark where the soldiers are buried. Although the graves are not individually marked, these are individual graves, not a mass grave, as can be seen on the CWGC cemetery plan. There is also a Cross of Sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of each round each player is dealt ten cards, with the two remaining cards (the so-called Skat) being put <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the table. Dealing follows this pattern: deal three cards each, then deal the Skat, then four cards each, then three cards again (“three–Skat–four–three”). In four-player rounds, the dealer does not receive any cards and skips actual play of the round. He or she may peek into the hand of one other player (if allowed to do so) but never into the Skat.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing a}} show in Norfolk, Virginia, on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to New York City for a March 24 {{appearance}} on NBC-TV's Perry Como Show. Shortly before sunrise on March 22, on Route 13 between Dover and Woodside, Delaware, Stuart Pinkham (also known as Richard Stuart and Poor Richard) assumed duties as driver. After hitting {{the back of a}} pickup truck, their car went into a ditch containing about a foot of water, and Perkins was left lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. Drummer Holland rolled Perkins over, saving him from drowning. He had sustained three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body in the crash. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year-old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel. Jay Perkins had a fractured neck and severe internal injuries; he never fully recovered and died in 1958.|$|E

Due to poor visibility {{as a result of}} heavy rain, the other members of her group had been unable to see her from where they were standing. There were two adults in the group. A member of the helicopter crew explained: [...] "There were two people waving their jackets and pointing into the river. Initially we thought 'Why are they not in the water helping?' what looked like a child <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. Seeing the fast-flowing river, and how dangerous it would have been for them, there was no alternative for them to wait for us to arrive." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 1977, Presley was {{scheduled}} to fly out of Memphis to begin another tour. That afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on his bathroom floor. According to her eyewitness account, [...] "Elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the toilet and then had fallen forward, in that fixed position, {{directly in front of}} it. [...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." [...] Joel Williamson writes: [...] "For some reason— perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels— he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. Alarmed, he stood up, dropped the book he was reading, stumbled forward, and fell <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal position. He struggled weakly and drooled on the rug. Unable to breathe, he died." [...] Attempts to revive him failed, and death was officially pronounced at 3:30p.m. at Baptist Memorial Hospital.|$|E

50|$|The Church {{believes}} that the sacraments must fulfill three requirements according to the Scripture. Firstly, {{they must have been}} performed by Jesus Christ himself as an example.

Lastly, they must be of the sacraments which Jesus Christ instructed the disciples to perform as well.

2500|$|According to legend, [...] "Lake Superior seldom {{gives up}} her dead". This {{is because of}} the unusually low {{temperature}} of the water, estimated at under [...] on average around 1970. Normally, bacteria feeding on a sunken decaying body will generate gas inside the body, causing it to float to the surface after a few days. However, Lake Superior's water is cold enough year-round to inhibit bacterial growth, and bodies tend to sink and never resurface. This is alluded to in Lightfoot's [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] ballad. Fitzgerald adventurer Joe MacInnis reported that, in July 1994, explorer Frederick Shannon's Expedition 94 to the wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald discovered and filmed a man's body near the port side of her pilothouse, not far from the open door, [...] "fully clothed, wearing an orange life jacket, and lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sediment." ...|$|E

In the case of three players, a single card is dealt <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the table to start the crib.
