40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} an {{invasive}} infaunal suspension-feeding bivalve, the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, on benthic inorganic carbon and nutrient fluxes was examined through in situ incubations. Measurements were performed {{in spring and}} summer on a tidal sandflat of the Rance estuary (south part of the Western English Channel) colonized by the Manila clam after its deliberate introduction in the 1990 's. Benthic inorganic carbon fluxes were measured using light and dark benthic chambers both at emersion and immersion. Benthic nutrient fluxes were measured using dark benthic chambers at immersion. Inorganic carbon (IC) and ammonium sediment release under darkness at immersion reached 5. 60 mmol m- 2 h- 1 and 441 μmol m- 2 h- 1 respectively for a clam density of 291 ind m- 2. The sediment IC-release under darkness was lower during emersion than during immersion, {{probably due to the}} reduced activity of infauna at low tide. Under ambient light, a sediment IC-uptake was systematically measured at emersion, indicating a net autotrophy under the condition of measurements (125 < surface PAR < 1670 μmol m- 2 s- 1), while either sediment IC-uptake or release was measured at immersion according to light variation (20 < underwater PAR < 990 μmol m- 2 s- 1). The highest gross <b>community</b> primary <b>production,</b> calculated from highest IC-fluxes at light (<b>i.</b> e. net <b>community</b> <b>production)</b> and highest IC-fluxes at dark (<b>i.</b> e. <b>community</b> respiration), was similar at emersion and immersion and reached 6. 2 mmolC m- 2 h- 1. These results suggest that the metabolic activity of the invasive Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum contributes to increase inorganic C and ammonium sediment release. These regenerated nutrients may support microphytobenthic production which appeared particularly high on this intertidal sand flat...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} ocean {{acidification}} {{on the balance}} between gross <b>community</b> <b>production</b> (GCP) and <b>community</b> respiration (CR) (<b>i.</b> e. net <b>community</b> <b>production,</b> NCP) of plankton communities was investigated in summer 2010 in Kongsfjorden, West of Svalbard. Surface water, which was characterized by low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll, was enclosed in 9 mesocosms and subjected to 8 p CO 2 levels (2 replicated controls and 7 enhanced p CO 2 treatments) for one month. Nutrients were added to all mesocosms on day 13 of the experiment, and thereafter increase of chlorophyll (index of phytoplankton biomass) was provoked in all mesocosms. No clear trend in response to increasing p CO 2 {{was found in the}} daily values of NCP, CR, and GCP. For further analysis, these parameters were cumulated for the following three periods: phase 1 : end of CO 2 manipulation until nutrient addition (t 4 to t 13); phase 2 : nutrient addition until the second chlorophyll minimum (t 14 to t 21); phase 3 : the second chlorophyll minimum until the end of this study (t 22 to t 28). Significant response was detected as a decrease of NCP with increasing p CO 2 during phase 3. CR was relatively stable throughout the experiment in all mesocosms. As a result, the cumulative GCP significantly decreased with increasing p CO 2 during phase 3. After the nutrient addition, the ratios of cumulative NCP to cumulative consumption of NO 3 and PO 4 showed significant decrease during phase 3 with increasing p CO 2. The results suggest that elevated p CO 2 influenced cumulative NCP and stoichiometric C and nutrient coupling of the plankton community in a high latitude fjord only for a limited period. However provided that there were some differences or weak correlations between NCP data based on different methods in the same experiment, this conclusion should be taken with caution...|$|R
