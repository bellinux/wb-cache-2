5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> at all times. Three days after the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure {{that at least two}} crew members—including at least one pilot—were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> during the entire duration of the flight. Several airlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series, Doctor Who, the flying vans that appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode [...] "Gridlock" [...] {{have the same}} flying capabilities as the DeLorean, including digital clocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> that resemble <b>the</b> time circuits.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a sesquiwing type of biplane with its fuselage frame manufactured from thin-walled steel tubing. The wings had spruce spars. The aircraft had two tandem open <b>cockpits</b> with <b>the</b> pilot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aft <b>cockpit</b> and two passengers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forward <b>cockpit.</b> Ailerons were {{installed on the}} upper wings only. Brakes were a standard installation.|$|R
5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing pilots under instruction to gain experience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of aircraft carrying passengers should be reviewed.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the jump seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E
5|$|The AJ-2 {{incorporated}} all of {{the changes}} made to the late model AJ-2P and 55 aircraft were ordered on 14 February 1951. The AJ-2 deleted the separate compartment for the third crewman, but retained the third seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> from the AJ-2P.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> {{this form}} <b>the</b> F.7/30 was {{completed}} in 1934. It was an elegant, if unconventional biplane. The gulled upper wing and the straight lower wing were connected by N struts and braced by wires. The landing gear was fixed, with main wheels covered by spats. From his high position the pilot had an excellent view forwards, upwards and to the sides, as <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> was ahead of the wing leading edge. Initially <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> was open, but in two stages this was converted into a fully enclosed <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> machine guns were installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit's</b> side walls, two on each side.|$|R

5|$|The TSB {{concluded}} {{that even if}} the crew had been aware {{of the nature of the}} problem immediately after detection of the initial odor, and had commenced an approach as rapidly as possible, the developing fire-related conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> would have made a safe landing at Halifax impossible.|$|E
5|$|A {{controller}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> {{allowed the}} visor to be retracted and the nose {{to be lowered}} to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|As {{would emerge}} in later {{testimony}} at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to confusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> {{during the final}} flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as pilot in command, and who was operating the engine and fuel controls as flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features an}} interplane strut, cabane strut and cable-braced biplane layout, a three-seat open cockpit, with two passengers accommodated in side-by-side configuration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front open <b>cockpit</b> and <b>the</b> pilot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit</b> with a windshield. The aircraft has fixed {{conventional landing gear}} and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} cockpit {{sections}} and engines {{are also on}} display. <b>In</b> particular <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> section of a Hawker Siddeley Trident and an Avro Vulcan are both open to visitors.|$|R
5|$|At {{that point}} in the investigation, the crash was {{generally}} {{believed to have been}} caused by faulty wiring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> after the entertainment system started to overheat. Certain groups issued Aviation Safety Recommendations. The TSB released its preliminary report on 30 August 2000 and the final report in 2003.|$|E
5|$|National Airlines' New York-Miami route {{was usually}} flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601. On January 5, 1960, the 707 {{aircraft}} scheduled {{to fly to}} Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> windshield. The windshield replacement procedure would take eight hours to perform, so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve.|$|E
5|$|The canopy hinges open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.|$|E
25|$|Olgay Özgür was {{the safety}} pilot of the flight, a {{graduate}} of a flight school in Ankara, who flew the MD 80 for World Focus Airlines before joining Turkish Airlines and passing the 737 type rating; he was sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit's</b> center jump seat. Murat Sezer, co-pilot under line training, was flying as co-pilot. The cabin crew consisted of Figen Eren, Perihan Özden, Ulvi Murat Eskin, and Yasemin Vural.|$|R

5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane {{would need to be}} refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in Hannover, Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> with the pistol to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant every five minutes. German authorities allowed the plane to depart after Demeke threatened to kill his hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E

5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} {{flight data recorder}} that recorded basic information about the aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations that took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Bond's stolen {{truck is}} intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking {{aircraft}} by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing {{the man to}} drop a live hand grenade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats {{in a sea of}} flames.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the small}} vessels managed to return to England: MLs 160, 307 and 443. They had reached the {{rendezvous}} and waited until 10:00 for the destroyers to appear. Having already been attacked once, they moved further out into the Atlantic to try and avoid the German Air Force, but a Junkers 88 appeared overhead at 07:30 and approached them at low level for a closer look. The ships opened fire and hit the Junkers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The plane went into the sea. The next aircraft to appear was a Blohm & Voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships, but left after being damaged by machine-gun fire. The surviving MLs eventually reached England unaided the following day.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{civilian}} ("commercial") open-cockpit biplanes of the era, Travel Airs were noted for {{their quality of}} construction, reliability, durability, speed, efficiency, payload and passenger capacity (two passengers in a small bench seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit,</b> plus pilot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear cockpit—versus most biplanes of the era, which could only accommodate a single passenger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit).</b> They were also noted for superior comfort and easy flying. These various distinguishing characteristics led Travel Air to outsell all rivals by 1929.|$|R
