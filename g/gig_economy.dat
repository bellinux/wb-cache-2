50|$|It is {{particularly}} important to distinguish employment in the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> from employment through zero-hour contracts. Employment in the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> entails receiving compensation for one key performance indicator, which, for example, is defined as parcels delivered or taxi lifts conducted. Another feature is that employees can opt to refuse taking an order. Although employers {{do not have to}} guarantee employment or employees can also refuse to take an order under a zero-hour contract, workers under such a contract are paid by the hour and not directly through business related indicators {{as in the case of}} the <b>gig</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{business}} model of companies {{situated in the}} <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> introduce a different employment concept compared to the traditional employment structures. While in tradition industries workers enjoy the benefits of unionisation, healthcare provision, and employee rights with regard to minimum wage, contract termination and working hours, employees within the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> are perceived as freelancers. These people do not receive pension benefits or other employee rights and benefits and are often not paid on an hourly basis. Moreover, their payment scheme {{is linked to the}} gigs they perform which could be deliveries, rentals or other services. However, recent legal rulings indicated that there is an emerging trend to classify full-time freelancers working for a single main employer of the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> as workers and to award them regular worker rights and protection. A popular example is the ruling against Uber in October 2016, which supported the claim of two Uber drivers to be classified as workers and to receive the related worker rights and benefits. However, Uber was granted the right to appeal this claim and a final ruling is expected to be drawn in September 2017.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{the work}} comes through an {{independent}} <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> source or a temp agency, when a temporary employee agrees to an assignment, they receive instructions {{pertaining to the}} job. The agency also provides information on correct work attire, work hours, wages, and whom to report to. If a temporary employee arrives at a job assignment and is asked to perform duties not described when they accepted the job, they may call an agency representative for clarification. If they choose not to continue on the assignment based on these discrepancies, they will most likely lose pay and may undermine chances at other job opportunities. However, some agencies guarantee an employee {{a certain number of}} hours pay if, once the temporary employee arrives, there is no work or the work isn't as described. Most agencies do not require an employee to continue work if the discrepancies are enough to make it difficult for the employee to actually do the work.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{definitions}} exist. [...] "The people who share" [...] {{is one of}} the broadest definitions, which encompasses the on-demand economy, the <b>gig</b> <b>economy,</b> social media, and a great deal else. Academic definitions tend to be narrower, limiting the sharing economy to only peer-to-peer transactions, and sometimes further limiting the definition to only peer to peer transactions that relate to the temporary exchange of physical goods. Another set of narrow definitions used by free culture activists, members of the co-operative movement and similar, excludes for-profit companies from the sharing economy, even if they facilitate just peer to peer transactions. Sometimes called the [...] "real" [...] or [...] "true" [...] sharing economy, organisations that operate within such definitions are mostly small and localist, run by volunteers on a cooperative basis, though sometimes also by governments and municipal authorities. They can include some organisations that operate without online transactions, such as bike kitchens. The [...] "true" [...] sharing economy does include some large internationally available web sites however, such as Freecycle.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Technological {{advancement}} and {{the proliferation}} of the smartphone have reshaped the commercial landscape, providing consumers new ways to access the retail marketplace. On-demand companies are one such innovation, and underpinning on-demand commerce is the <b>gig</b> <b>economy,</b> the collection of markets that match service providers to consumers of on-demand services on a gig (or job) basis. Flagship on-demand companies such as Uber (driver services) and Handy (home cleaners and household services) have garnered significant media attention both for their market success and recent legal challenges, particularly concerning the classification of gig workers. Broader questions about {{the pros and cons of}} the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> have emerged as on-demand markets grow and the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> expands into new sectors. By some accounts, workers’ willingness to participate in the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> provides evidence that gig work is a beneficial arrangement. Indeed, gig jobs may yield benefits relative to traditional employment in terms of the ease of finding employment and greater flexibility to choose jobs and hours. The <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> may facilitate bridge employment (e. g., temporary employment between career jobs or between full-time work and retirement) or provide opportunities to generate income when circumstances do not accommodate traditional full-time, full-year employment. At the same time, however, the potential lack of labor protections for gig workers and the precarious nature of gig work have been met with some concern. The nationwide reach of gig work and its potential to impact large groups of workers, and their livelihoods, have attracted the attention of some Members of Congress. These Members have raised questions about the size and composition of the gig workforce, the proper classification of gig workers (i. e., as employees or independent contractors), the potential for gig work to create work opportunities for unemployed or underemployed workers, and implications of gig work for worker protections and access to traditional employment-based benefits. In support of these policy considerations, this report provides an overview of the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> and identifies legal and policy questions relevant to its workforce...|$|E

40|$|The ‘gig economy’ {{has emerged}} rapidly {{as a form}} of service {{delivery}} that challenges existing business models, labour-management practices, and regulations. The ways in which platform companies transact with workers, in particular, has created a burgeoning public interest, but has yet to give rise to a corresponding academic literature. In this paper, we ask whether the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> deserves to be a subject of employment relations scholarship, given its current dimensions and likely future. We argue that academic analysis is needed, to better understand the power dynamics operating within the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> and how these are testing existing norms and institutions. We discuss two mains ways that employment relations researchers can expand their theoretical repertoires and, in doing so, improve the evidence on gig-based working arrangements. We begin to sketch the outlines of a systematic research agenda, by elaborating indicative questions that need addressing to advance understanding of ‘gig work relations’. We caution, however, that academic analysis of the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> should not be predicated on an expectation that it is the future of work. A number of economic, industrial and political factors threaten to slow or halt the gig economy’s growth. embarg...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} {{large numbers of}} workers are {{independent}} contractors not entitled to unionize or to the protections of employment law is a product of twentieth-century legal categories that are a poor fit for twenty-first century companies and labor markets. But it is an error to assume that the free market cultural ethos of worker entrepreneurialism in the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> is at odds with the basic framework and assumptions of labor and employment law. It is both feasible and normatively desirable to extend to <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> workers the protections of labor and employment law and, therefore, definitions of covered employees in these statutes should be read very broadly and exclusions for independent contractors should be narrow and cover only those workers who are really running their own business and working for multiple separate clients simultaneously. The experience of Hollywood writers described in this Article, which draws on legal history and in-depth interviews with thirty working TV writers today, shows that current law can easily accommodate bargaining by <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> workers. Entrepreneurial, short-term workers, including many who might in other circumstances be deemed independent contractors or supervisors, have bargained collectively for 80 years to the significant benefit of themselves and the industry in which they work...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> has become a {{significant}} part of the labor market. Consumers depend on the services provided by people performing gig work, particularly as on-demand services are increasingly desired. Another trend that has developed is the rise of fast casual restaurants due to their relatively inexpensive and quick service while simultaneously providing unique and interesting cuisine options. I examined if there was a relationship between the rise of these emerging sectors of the economy through looking at the performance of limited service eating place establishments using a panel data regression model at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level from 2006 to 2015. I concluded that there is a negative relationship between the number gig firms and the number limited service eating places and no relationship between the number gig firms and the annual payroll of limited service eating places. With opposite results from those hypothesized, I recommend ways to improve the research and propose alternative research questions to answer looking at the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> and the restaurant industry...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gig</b> <b>economy</b> {{platforms}} seem {{to provide}} extreme temporal flexibility to workers, giving them full control {{over how to}} spend each hour and minute of the day. What constraints do workers face when attempting to exercise this flexibility? We use 30 worker interviews and other data to compare three online piecework platforms with differing histories and worker demographics: Mechanical Turk, MobileWorks, and CloudFactory. We find that structural constraints (availability of work and degree of worker dependence on the work) as well as cultural-cognitive constraints (procrastination and presenteeism) limit worker control over scheduling in practice. The severity of these constraints varies significantly between platforms, the formally freest platform presenting the greatest structural and cultural-cognitive constraints. We also find that workers have developed informal practices, tools, and communities to address these constraints. We conclude that focusing on outcomes rather than control is a more fruitful way to assess flexible working arrangements...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} <b>gig</b> <b>economy,</b> the job {{performance}} is now influenced by the customer rating system. A new London’s Employment Tribunal judgment approaches the Uber London issue focusing also on customer feedback. Since drivers are qualified as workers, not self-employed, as the English Court ruled on, this article tooks a position about on-line feedback incidence on job relationship. Referring to customer’s opinion, the employer exercises control on services performed by each worker, whereas Italian Legal System bounds it, {{within the meaning of}} article 4 of Worker’s Statutory. On the other hand, the customer rating can be considered as a type of control on the business organization, in observance of limits established by the same article. Moreover, the paper’s purpose is to inquire about the feedback positive impact on workers: customer satisfaction could provide business bonus, or it could become an evidence against employer in a court case...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Human Resources (HR) {{departments}} have begun bracing for a labor environment characterized by temporary jobs, one dominated, for example, {{by the independent}} contractor. Accordingly, the workplace policy landscape is shifting {{to keep up with}} what has now come to be known in modern buzzword parlance as a “gig economy”. However, while it is certainly in a company’s best interest to make itself aware of workplace trends, it is ineffective for a company to always try to position itself at the forefront of these trends. Trends, after all, do not represent permanence; instead, they merely illustrate the direction in which something moves for an often-finite period. Preemptively building around the assumption that the regulatory landscape in which the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> rests will shift commensurately to better facilitate this trend could ultimately be a waste of company resources. Uber presents an ideal example of a company that has employed this strategy and will be examined to demonstrate how the economy is rules-based and companies should model internal processes after those rules, rather than after trending business models...|$|E
40|$|The {{algorithmic}} oversight, optimization {{and evaluation}} of worker performance is an increasing reality in many economic sectors. For those working within the growing economic sector known as the ‘gig’ or ‘on-demand’ economy, these algorithmic processes sit {{at the heart of}} their working day. Previous research drawing on interview and forum data (Kyung Lee et al., 2015; Rosenblat and Stark, 2016) has suggested an inequity of power between the operators of an algorithmic management system, and those working under it. This inequity arises through a lack of transparency around the rules that govern their work, and a lack of options for workers to influence those rules in response to the realities of their everyday work. This paper, based on a computer-aided content analysis of 28, 458 forum threads, argues that whilst <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> workers are governed by algorithmic systems, that same system facilitates resistance. By necessitating some form of user interaction and the provision of sufficient feedback, algorithmic management apps allow workers to collaboratively develop strategies of ‘rule discovery’ to continuously update their intuitions about the often hidden rules governing their everyday activity...|$|E
40|$|Digital work {{platforms}} are transforming {{labor markets}} around the world. Firms that own, manage and deploy these work platforms have reframed employer–worker relations by defining their core business as {{the provision of}} the technology that enables certain services to be provided rather than the provision of those services, and offering their workers independent contractor arrangements rather than employee contracts. This has significant consequences in terms of wages, jobs security and other working conditions. Digital work platforms also increase worker welfare by offering unparalleled flexibility in setting work hours and most permit a workday to be segmented, allowing {{certain parts of the}} population who otherwise {{would not be able to}} work (due to other commitments or constraints) to have some source of income. At the same time, they pose significant challenges in the labor market. Companies replace employees with contract workers to control costs but this may lead to lower pay, benefits, and job security. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a policy debate on how to best prepare workers for this new reality. This document describes three main concerns: the issue of worker misclassification in digital work platforms, the lack of social security systems for workers in the <b>gig</b> <b>economy</b> that are not considered employees, and the problems that the isolating nature of on-demand work presents with respect to worker organization and the right to collective bargaining.
