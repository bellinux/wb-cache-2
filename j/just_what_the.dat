25|$|The {{multiplicity}} of opinions {{made it difficult}} to determine <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Court had decided as to whether and when the President had authority to act without Congressional authorization.

500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> label was looking for, {{they believed that}} [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." ...|$|E
500|$|After refusing {{an offer}} {{to sing a song}} for A. R. Rahman's album Blue, Akhtar acted in, and {{produced}} his sister Zoya's directorial and written debut Luck By Chance, which had Hrithik Roshan and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead roles. He was cast in the film after being deemed as a [...] "perfect choice" [...] for it. The story of the film revolved around a struggling actor who arrives in Mumbai to become a film star. It was released on 30 January 2009. Though failing to do well at the box office and being declared a [...] "flop", the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times said: [...] "It is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc." [...] Rajeev Masand noted: [...] "Farhan Akhtar delivers a simple-enough likeable performance that is <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> film required— no showy flourishes, no loud outbursts, just a straight off spontaneous act that works like a dream." ...|$|E

500|$|Lombard {{was then}} {{recruited}} by the director Howard Hawks, a second cousin, to star in his screwball comedy film Twentieth Century [...] which proved a watershed in her career and made her a major star. Hawks had seen the actress inebriated at a party, where he found her to be [...] "hilarious and uninhibited and <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> part needed", and she was cast opposite John Barrymore. In Twentieth Century, Lombard played an actress who is pursued by her former mentor, a flamboyant Broadway impresario. Hawks and Barrymore were unimpressed with her work in rehearsals, finding that she was [...] "acting" [...] too hard and giving a stiff performance. The director encouraged Lombard to relax, be herself, and act on her instincts. She responded well to this tutoring, and reviews for the film commented on her unexpectedly [...] "fiery talent"—"a Lombard like no Lombard you've ever seen". The Los Angeles Times critic {{felt that she was}} [...] "entirely different" [...] from her formerly cool, [...] "calculated" [...] persona, adding, [...] "she vibrates with life and passion, abandon and diablerie".|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an interesting way and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E
500|$|The first {{official}} Fascio {{was founded on}} May 1 (Labour Day), 1891, in Catania by Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida. (An earlier Fascio {{was set up in}} Messina on March 18, 1889, but was dormant after its founder, Nicola Petrina, was arrested in July of that year and not released until 1892. Another reason why the first Fascio of Messina – formed after the example of the Fasci operai [...] constituted in Central and North Italy from 1871 – did not develop was that it brought together not individual workers but the workers' associations of the city, which retained their independence, their status and economic orientation.) Other leaders included Rosario Garibaldi Bosco in Palermo, Nicola Barbato in Piana dei Greci, Bernardino Verro in Corleone, and Lorenzo Panepinto in Santo Stefano Quisquina. While the ruling elite depicted the men of the Fasci as treasonous socialists, communists and anarchists seeking to overthrow the monarchy; in fact many were devout Catholics and monarchists. The movement sometimes had a messianic nature, characterised by statements such as [...] "Jesus was a true socialist and wanted <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Fasci were demanding." [...] Nicola Barbato was known as [...] "the workers' apostle." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Night Spots" [...] was a {{leftover}} from The Cars' first album, The Cars.

[...] This version remained unreleased until it appeared on <b>the</b> <b>Just</b> <b>What</b> I Needed: <b>The</b> Cars Anthology compilation album.|$|R

500|$|On September 27, 2012, Big Sean {{announced}} his second studio album {{with the title}} Hall of Fame: Memoirs of a Detroit Player, and then has announced a release date for December 2012. Sean explains why chose {{this to be the}} title, stating that [...] "its because it'll represent who he is". He then said that he feels [...] "like situations are really going to be relatable to people." [...] He then stated that he [...] "didn't want to just do another club song", and he didn't even wanted to follow these popular music standards. [...] "This is <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuck I want to do. Some people are going to like it. Some people are going to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel". He even indicated that the song [...] "Mula" [...] featuring French Montana (which also this track was included on the mixtape Detroit), could be featuring as the track for his deluxe edition.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} agreement, the Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections. Engraver Barber was {{asked for his}} view; he stated that Reith, who had attended the trial striking, had been given {{all the time and}} facilities he had asked for in testing the new pieces, and the mechanic had pronounced himself satisfied. [...] Hobbs Company agent C. U. Carpenter suggested that Reith had been intimidated by the preparations that had already gone into the issue of the modified nickel, [...] "and, instead of pointing out clearly <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> situation demanded, agreed to adapt our device to the coin more readily that [...] he was warranted in doing". [...] On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs and Reith. [...] On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. [...] MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14. When the Hobbs Company requested permission to bring a lawyer, Fraser announced he would be doing the same. The Hobbs Company sought letters of support from the business community, with little success; Fraser's efforts to secure support from artists for his position were more fruitful. [...] Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made. MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing, and issued a letter the following day.|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, [...] "Those cues also hold out {{the promise that}} the coming season will once again pivot {{the story on the}} workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> series needs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, [...] "It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0." [...] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: [...] " [...] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy." [...] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that [...] "she has come a long way." ...|$|E
