5|$|In 1912, the C {{submitted}} another bill {{to increase}} its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE)'s trains to run over the C's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. Tunnel enlargement works only restarted after World War I when an extension of time was granted in February 1919.

His election made him the Hall's youngest member ever elected, five months younger than Lou Gehrig upon his election in 1939, though because the 1972 induction ceremony was nearly <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> the election, Koufax's age at induction was slightly higher than Gehrig's, making Gehrig the youngest player ever inducted. On June 4 of that same year, Koufax's uniform number 32 was retired alongside those of Dodger greats Roy Campanella (39) and Jackie Robinson (42).|$|E

5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by {{one or a few}} adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> <b>after</b> birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

The action of November 1811 {{was the result of the}} British interception of a French military convoy traveling from Corfu to Trieste with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E

40|$|Spinal {{epidural}} abscesses are uncommon, {{but potentially}} devastating and often fatal. They {{can be found}} in normal patients, but they are more prevalent in immunocompromised patients, such as intravenous drug users, diabetics, chronic renal failure patients, pregnant women, and others.

Traditionally, treatment has comprised parenteral antibiotics and possible surgical intervention, such as decompression by pus drainage. We treated a long level (T 4 -L 1) epidural abscess in a diabetic patient who had to undergo emergent long level decompression and drainage due to complete paralysis of the lower extremities and progression of neurologic deficit toward the upper thoracic level. Although lower extremity paralysis has not improved, the patient has completely recovered from lower extremity anesthesia.
