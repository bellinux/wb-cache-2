40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{point out the}} {{differences}} {{in the structure of the}} product assortment of retailers who show their offers on the Web, with the aim of proving that the structure of the assortment may be a factor of marketing channel competitiveness that the consumers recognize and that makes them opt for a certain marketing channel. On the same basis we aim to compare the prices of representative product categories, in order to determine the impact of prices on marketing channel competitiveness, without taking other factors of channel competitiveness into consideration. Based on the conducted research, we can conclude that having a number of categories of products in the assortment presents a competitive advantage for the retailer in the traditional marketing channel since <b>retailers</b> with <b>electronic</b> sales have a more diverse assortment in their retail store than online.  Compared to “pure play” <b>electronic</b> <b>retailers,</b> the structure of assortment measured in number of categories of products that are on offer in e-stores is not significantly different between “pure play” and “bricks and clicks” <b>electronic</b> <b>retailers.</b> On the other hand, if we look at the price levels, there is a difference in prices of product categories on websites of “brick and click” retailers since prices in retail stores are higher than prices in the traditional retail store of the same retailer. However, offers on the website of “pure play” <b>electronic</b> <b>retailers</b> are higher compared to “brick and click” retailers...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the impact Omni channel has on the ware-house {{activities}} in a central warehouse for electronic retailers. In order to fulfill the purpose the following research questions are analyzed and answered; “What are the challenges in the warehouse activities in a central warehouse for an <b>electronic</b> <b>retailer</b> when Omni channel is utilized?” and “How can the challenges in the warehouse activities be managed in a central warehouse for an <b>electronic</b> <b>retailer</b> using Omni channel?” Methodology: The research method for this study is qualitative with an abductive approach. A single case study has been conducted based on interviews and observations. Furthermore, the literature review is based on scientific articles. The empirical findings from the case study have been a complement to the limited literature of warehouse activities connected to Omni channel. The analysis has required the authors to continuously match the empirical findings and literature in order to be able to fulfill the purpose. In order to analyze the answer the first research question an Ishikawa diagram is used. Furthermore, a tree diagram is used in order to analyze the answer for the second research question. Findings: There are various challenges identified in the warehouse activities in a central warehouse for electronic retailers using Omni channel. Furthermore, the authors identifies challenges that have an impact on the warehouse activities where Omni channel is the cause for creating the challenges. Lastly, the authors provide the reader with improvement factors in order to manage the challenges identified. Theoretical implications: The authors identify five theoretical implications for this study; large pallets, non-integrated WMS, a non-suitable picking equipment, a non-suitable layout, and packing. These challenges occur as an outcome of Omni channel and therefore can be seen as a theoretical contribution to the limited literature. Managerial implications: It is crucial for electronic retailers to identify the challenges in the warehouse activities and understand the underlying reason for why the challenges arise. Furthermore, improvement factors can be identified and implemented by an extended anal-ysis. However, modifications are required since there are various factors that can differ be-tween electronic retailers using Omni channel...|$|E
40|$|Resource depletion, {{population}} growth and environmental problems force companies to collect their end of life (EOL) products for reuse, recycle and refurbishment through reverse supply chain management (RSCM). Success in collecting the EOL products through RSCM depends on the customers’ participation intention. The objectives of this study are: (1) To examine the important factors influencing customers’ attitude to participate in RSCM; (2) To examine the important factors influencing customers’ subjective norm to participate in RSCM; (3) To examine the main factors influencing customers’ perceived behavioral control to participate in RSCM; (4) To examine the influence of attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on customers’ participation intention in RSCM. The Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (DTPB) has been chosen as the underpinning theory for this research. The research conducted employed the quantitative approach. Non-probability (convenience sampling) method {{was used to determine}} the sample and data was collected using questionnaires.

This is {{resulting in the}} loss of sales and cus-tomers. With the increasing need for quick response towards consumers‟ demands, the choice of operational strategies for retailers are becoming crucial and critical. Recognizing the advantages because of postponement strategies and the risks offered by full specula-tion strategies current study is designed to analyze the importance of postponement strat-egy, how it may relate to potential solutions. Purpose: We have discussed the increasingly important question of supply chain strate-gy for global operations. This study is done in retailer‟s perspective, to identify and de-scribe the use of"Postponement strategy for Swedish electronic retailing firms to attain flexibility in lo-gistic operations". Method: In this thesis we have adopted the case study approach. Elgiganten is the big-gest <b>electronic</b> <b>retailer</b> not only in Sweden but in the Nordic countries with the group of Elkjop. The data was collected with the help of open ended interviews from Managers of Elgiganten at Jonkoping and Torsvik. Results: Elgiganten is facing the problems of wastes in the form of lost inventory, high costs; they have the additional problems of lost sales and customers because of their spe-culative approach. Based on the findings postponement is suggested for few product cat-egories depending upon the needs and characteristics of those product categories. Our findings and analysis show that Postponement for retailers can bring a lot of benefits by making the whole supply chain flexible.. ...|$|E
