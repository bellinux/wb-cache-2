Concluiu que, provavelmente, apenas 48, 1 % das estufas da Grande Florianópolis estavam operando segundo as normas de tempo e temperatura preconizadas na {{literatura}} e pode constatar que houve falha de 22, 5 % na eficácia das 40 estufas da amostra testada. Abstract : The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dry heat dental offices in Florianópolis, S. C., Brazil. The work intended to discover the capacity dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> have <b>to</b> eradicate the spores of B. subtilis on biological indicators strips and also to compare temperatures during the sterilization cycles to the ones proposed in the literature. Moreover, it endeavored to assure that the built in thermometer and thermostat in the dry <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were reliable, and to analyze the influence how the materials were displayed in the sterilization chambers. As a complementing part, a survey was made in order to investigate who operates the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> in different dental clinics and their specialist field of work. The results indicated that, out of the samples tested, a rate fall of 22. 5 % was found in dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> effectiveness <b>to</b> destroy the spores of R subtilis. Moreover, from the final results, it is possible to infer that only 48. 1 % of the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> investigated actually used the parameters (time and temperatare) as proposed in the literature. From the observed samples, it was also shown that the built in thermometers and thermostat were not reliable. Furthermore, results suggested that there was temperature variation inside the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens,</b> therefore, it was found that the materials placed in the upper shelf received less heat. Finally, findings confirmed that dental assistants were responsible for managing the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> in 67. 5 % of the dental offices surveyed.

50|$|Several {{methods were}} {{applied in the}} {{preparation}} of locusts, prior to eating them.

Once dry, they would take up the locusts and break off their heads, wings and legs and discard them, eating only the thorax and abdomen. Another method was to stoke an earthenware stove and, when fully heated, to cast them while alive into the cavity of the stove. Once roasted, they were taken out and a brine solution was sprinkled over them, before spreading them out in the sun to dry, usually upon one’s rooftop.|$|R

5000|$|The {{device was}} {{originally}} a standard platinum laboratory crucible with a perforated base into which asbestos pulp was placed {{to form the}} filter mat. [...] The crucible was then <b>heated</b> in an <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> dry out until it attained constant weight. The use of these materials meant that after filtration, the crucible and its contents could be subjected to high temperature to dry the filtrate and possibly oxidize or ash it to minimum weight. However, {{because of the high}} cost of platinum, versions made of porcelain were introduced in 1882. Some Gooch crucibles, such as the one in the drawing, permit two layers of asbestos to be used, separated by a perforated porcelain plate. Other inorganic fibers, notably glass, have been used in place of asbestos. Gooch crucibles made of borosilicate glass with fritted glass bases are more common today. [...] Platinum may still be required for the most corrosive materials, and porcelain ones are used where ashing at high temperature is required, but the borosilicate glass ones are adequate for drying.|$|R

40|$|We have {{discovered}} a previously unidentified thermal explosion mode using the Los Alamos deflagration cylinder test (DFCT). The DFCT is a “pipe bomb”-style test similar to the detonation cylinder test (DTCT), which {{has been used for}} many years to calibrate detonation product equations of state. The shot is <b>heated</b> in an <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> a uniform test temperature. The pre-heated high explosive (HE) is triggered by a hot wire initiator on one end. The tube is back-illuminated by a bright light source, and its combustion-driven deformation and subsequent break-up are observed by a high-speed framing camera. Like the DTCT, the DFCT tube wall motion provides the primary diagnostic. A variety of reactive responses are possible, including quasi-steady deflagration and deflagration-to-detonation transition. This paper focuses on the behavior of the HMX-based explosive PBX 9501 at 155 C. Under this condition burning appeared to occur only at the HE/tube interface, causing the tube to peel away from the HE core. Peel-off propagated as a wave that traveled along the tube at ∼ 500 m/s. This failure mode resulted in vigorous case venting, but the response was otherwise benign. We derive a steady peel-off-wave model that reproduces the essential observed features for realistic PBX 9501 parameter values...|$|R
50|$|The {{atomic beam}} {{standard}} {{is a direct}} extension of the Stern-Gerlach atomic splitting experiment. The atoms of choice are <b>heated</b> in an <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> create gas, which is collimated into a beam. This beam, consisting of a mixture of atoms in two states, passes through a state-selector magnet A, where atoms of the wrong state are separated out from the beam. The remaining beam is exposed to an RF field {{at or near the}} transition frequency. The beam then passes through a space containing a static homogeneous magnetic field before it is again exposed to the RF field. The RF field and the C-field coil will flip the state of the atoms, with a probability depending on how close the microwave frequency is to the atomic transition frequency. After the second RF field exposure the atomic beam passes through a second state selector magnet B, where the atoms that did not change state (are still in the state selected by magnet A) are discarded. This way, the number of atoms which survive magnet B is related to the microwaves' ability to match the atomic transition frequency. After the second state selector, a mass-spectrometer using an ionizer detects the rate of atoms being received.|$|R
