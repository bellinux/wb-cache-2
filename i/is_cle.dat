40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} shown in ref. [1] that the {{mathematical}} expression for the Faraday induction law dt d # # does not follow from the Maxwell's equation G t B l d E #, (2) in particular, due to the inequality S S dt d S d dt B d # # # (3) for S=S(t), G=G(t) (here G is the closed line enclosing the area S, and l d is the element of the circuit G). In this connection the expression (1) was tested in [1] for its Lorentz-invariance. It has been found that the Faraday law is not invariant at least at a formal mathematical level, when e. m. f. is calculated through integration over a mathematical line in space. For integration over a conductor we have additionally {{to take into account the}} effect of rearrangement of the conduction electrons under a presence of external electromagnetic fields. The rearranged electrons create their own electric and magnetic fields, which can be negligible outside the conductor, but significant in its inner volume. It <b>is</b> <b>cle...</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} claims {{concerning}} clinical legal {{education in the}} Australian literature. The first, associated with CLE's 1970 s heritage, is the claim that <b>CLE</b> <b>is</b> about the study of injustice and the progressive practice of law. The second <b>is</b> that <b>CLE</b> <b>is</b> about skills training. The third <b>is</b> that <b>CLE</b> <b>is</b> about effecting personal value change in students through exposing them to the 'different side of society'. The recent documentary Street Practice (2004), as a representation of CLE in Australia, revealed the highly problematic nature of CLE as value change. It showed that emphasis on value change through 'ethical training through experience' presents CLE as another site for the hierarchy, manipulation and egotism long identified by critical accounts of legal culture. Furthermore, {{at the very moment}} when conservatism is on the rise in Australia, CLE - in talking and aiming for value change - seemingly has abandoned its progressive origins and joined in this lurch to the right.

These subsets are defined by clinical symptoms, average duration of symptoms and histological and serological findings, although, the three subtypes can have overlapping clinical features. CLE patients display well-defined skin lesions, often in sun-exposed areas. The disease often has a chronic and relapsing course that can be induced or aggravated by UV light.
