40|$|Abstract. Advancements in {{robotics}} {{have led}} to significant improvements in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. The use of these robotic systems have improved surgeon <b>dexterity,</b> reduced surgeon <b>fatigue,</b> and made remote surgical procedures possible. However, commercially available robotic surgical systems do not provide any haptic feedback to the surgeon. This paper describes our design of an automated laparoscopic grasper with tri-directional force measurement capability at the grasping jaws. The laparoscopic tool can measure grasping forces, as well as, lateral and longitudinal forces, such as those forces encountered in probing and poking of tissue. Initial testing of the prototype has shown its ability to accurately characterize artificial tissue samples of varying stiffness. ...|$|R
40|$|Past {{approaches}} to space suit glove evaluation have primarily been subjective. This report details efforts at the University of Maryland Space Systems Laboratory to use standardized dexterity tests and advanced biomechanics instrumentation to provide objective measures of glove performance. Ten subjects {{participated in the}} study. Tests were conducted barehanded, and wearing pressurized and unpressurized space suit gloves. Data on performance time, range of motion, <b>dexterity,</b> strength, <b>fatigue,</b> and comfort were collected. Range of motion data was measured using an experimental data glove that instrumented {{the movement of the}} joints of the right hand. The results indicated that performance time wearing pressurized gloves is not adequately estimated by performance wearing unpressurized gloves. Also, joint angle results indicated a decrease in the range of motion from the barehanded condition, but {{no significant difference between the}} gloved-hand conditions. Thus, range of motion is adequately estimated for the pressurized condition by examining range of motion wearing unpressurized gloves. Results of this research indicate that the use of standardized dexterity tests, with appropriate modifications to accommodate the restricted dexterity, provides a useful basis for evaluating space suit glove performance...|$|R

Recent research in the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center has focused on developing requirements for improvements {{in the design of}} the next generation of EVA glove. In the course of this research, it was decided to expand the scope of the testing to include a variety of commercially available athletic and consumer gloves to help provide a more recognizable comparison for investigators and designers to evaluate the current state of EVA glove mobility and strength.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} faced in Extravehicular Activity (EVA) glove development has been the absence of concise and reliable methods to measure the effects of EVA gloves on human-hand capabilities. NASA has sponsored a program to develop a standardized set of tests designed to assess EVA-gloved hand capabilities in six performance domains: Range of Motion, Strength, Tactile Perception, <b>Dexterity,</b> <b>Fatigue,</b> and Comfort. Based upon an assessment of general human-hand functioning and EVA task requirements, several tests within each performance domain were developed to provide a comprehensive evaluation. All tests were designed to be conducted in a glove box with the bare hand, an EVA glove without pressure, an EVA glove at operation pressure. Thus, the differential effect on performance of the glove with and without pressure was tested. Bare hand performance was used to 'calibrate' the effects. Ten subjects participated in the test setup as a repeated-measures experimental design. The paper will report {{the results of the}} test program...|$|E
40|$|Although {{patients}} with Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy (CIAP) report a slow deterioration of sensory and motor functions, {{the impact of}} this deterioration on daily functioning has not yet been investigated in detail. The first aim of this crosssectional study involving 56 {{patients with}} CIAP was, therefore, to assess patients' functioning with use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The second aim was to find determinants of walking ability, <b>dexterity,</b> and autonomy. <b>Fatigue</b> and limited walking ability were present in most patients and differed considerably. In regression models, age, muscle strength, and fatigue together explained 63 % of the variance in walking ability, which by itself explained almost 50 % of the variance in patients' autonomy indoors and outdoors (42 % and 49 %, respectively). Muscle strength and sensory function scores together explained 30 % of the variance in dexterity scores, which in turn explained only 13 % of the variance in autonomy indoors. The diminished autonomy of patients with CIAP might be improved by reducing fatigue, by means of training, and by improving walking ability...|$|R
40|$|In {{hands-on}} robotic surgery, {{the surgical}} tool {{is mounted on}} the end-effector of a robot and is directly manipulated by the surgeon. This simultaneously exploits the strengths of both humans and robots, such that the surgeon directly feels tool–tissue interactions and remains {{in control of the}} procedure, while taking advantage of the robot’s higher precision and accuracy. A crucial challenge in hands-on robotics for delicate manipulation tasks, such as surgery, is that the user must interact with the dynamics of the robot at the end-effector, which can reduce <b>dexterity</b> and increase <b>fatigue.</b> This paper presents a null-space-based optimization technique for simultaneously minimizing the mass and friction of the robot that is experienced by the surgeon. By defining a novel optimization technique for minimizing the projection of the joint friction onto the end-effector, and integrating this with our previous techniques for minimizing the belted mass/inertia as perceived by the hand, a significant reduction in dynamics felt by the user is achieved. Experimental analyses in both simulation and human user trials demonstrate that the presented method can reduce the user-experienced dynamic mass and friction by, on average, 44 % and 41 %, respectively. The results presented robustly demonstrate that optimizing a robots pose can result in a more natural tool motion, potentially allowing future surgical robots to operate with increased usability, improved surgical outcomes, and wider clinical uptake...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the bulk}} and {{stiffness}} of the astronauts' glove, so called Extravehicular Activity (EVA) glove, many problems occur during their missions outside the spacecraft i. e. <b>fatigue,</b> <b>dexterity</b> reduction, decrease of possible EVA hours, etc. [1, 2]. To {{solve these problems}} a hand exoskeleton which can be embedded inside the astronauts' glove has been proposed {{as a solution to}} help them to move their fingers more easily. In this work all the steps that were taken towards the design of a preliminary version of the hand exoskeleton are explained in detail. The paper starts with a brief survey on related literature, followed by an analysis of three main research subjects for the design and realization of the hand exoskeleton: sensors, actuators and structure. In particular, different kinds of sensors and actuators are evaluated and advantages and disadvantages of each one are investigated. Then the main reasons to choose a specific type of sensor or actuator are described in detail. Regarding the structure, different possible solutions converging towards an optimal design for this application have been evaluated. Moreover, the use of some springs in the structure to simulate the stiffness of the EVA glove is proposed {{in order to be able}} to test the device in a condition similar to its final application. A brief description about the kinematic modeling and simulation of the structure in order to find the optimum location of the transmission cables and their tension forces is explaine...|$|R
40|$|Hands-on {{robotic surgery}} {{is where the}} surgeon {{controls}} the tool's motion by applying forces and torques to the robot holding the tool, allowing the robot-environment interaction to be felt though the tool itself. To further improve results, shared control strategies are used to combine {{the strengths of the}} surgeon with those of the robot. One such strategy is active constraints, which prevent motion into regions deemed unsafe or unnecessary. While research in active constraints on rigid anatomy has been well-established, limited work on dynamic active constraints (DACs) for deformable soft tissue has been performed, particularly on strategies which handle multiple sensing modalities. In addition, attaching the tool to the robot imposes the end effector dynamics onto the surgeon, reducing <b>dexterity</b> and increasing <b>fatigue.</b> Current control policies on these systems only compensate for gravity, ignoring other dynamic effects. This thesis presents several research contributions to shared control in hands-on robotic surgery, which create a more natural motion for the surgeon and expand the usage of DACs to point clouds. A novel null-space based optimization technique has been developed which minimizes the end effector friction, mass, and inertia of redundant robots, creating a more natural motion, one which is closer to the feeling of the tool unattached to the robot. By operating in the null-space, the surgeon is left in full control of the procedure. A novel DACs approach has also been developed, which operates on point clouds. This allows its application to various sensing technologies, such as 3 D cameras or CT scans and, therefore, various surgeries. Experimental validation in point-to-point motion trials and a virtual reality ultrasound scenario demonstrate a reduction in work when maneuvering the tool and improvements in accuracy and speed when performing virtual ultrasound scans. Overall, the results suggest that these techniques could increase the ease of use for the surgeon and improve patient safety. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades the number of human space {{missions}} has increased significantly. In many of these missions, astronauts are sent to space in order to carry out some specific tasks like installation of different units or parts {{to the international space}} station and/or repair and maintenance of its different parts. In order to do these tasks, astronauts have to go outside of the spacecraft. All the activities that astronauts perform outside of the spacecraft are called Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). To do EVA, astronauts have to be protected from dangerous condition of space. Some outstanding elements that distinguish the space environment and make it dangerous are radiation, zero pressure and micrometeoroids. These elements are very harmful for human being and in order to protect human body from this harsh condition, astronauts have to wear a specific suit when they go out of the spacecraft to do EVA. Astronaut' space suit is designed to protect astronauts from this harsh environment. The thickness of a spacesuit is approximately 3 / 16 inches (4. 8 mm) and it is fabricated by sewing and cementing 11 layers of different materials. Moreover, some metal parts are used to join different parts of the suit together. In addition, the spacesuit has to be pressurized internally in order to compensate the vacuum of the space and keep astronaut alive. This heavy, thick and multilayer suit prevents astronauts moving their body easily. This is also true for the astronauts' gloves. Due to the bulk and stiffness of this glove, so called Extravehicular Activity (EVA) glove, many problems occur during their missions outside the spacecraft. Hand <b>fatigue,</b> <b>dexterity</b> reduction of the fingers and consequently decrease of possible EVA hours are some of these problems. Several solutions have already been proposed to solve the problem. One approach tries to decrease this stiffness by adopting a suit with Mechanical Counter Pressure (MCP) instead of gas (oxygen) pressure. Other solutions attempt to overcome the existing stiffness of the gloves by means of external devices such as hand exoskeletons which support human fingers during flexion. Here a comprehensive research regarding the second solution is performed. In other words, overcoming the stiffness of the astronauts EVA glove by means of an external device is investigated. Therefore, in the first chapter the problem is explained completely and in the second chapter the possible solutions are evaluated. State of the art in this field is also discussed in this chapter. The main stream of discussion starts in chapter three. Evaluation of the EVA glove effects on the hand performance is explained in this chapter followed by measuring the stiffness of the EVA glove in chapter four. Study of the kinematics of the finger joints is covered in chapter five. In chapter six, a test bed is designed and realized to simulate the stiffness of the EVA glove and finally design of two compatible structures for this application is explained in chapter seve...|$|R
