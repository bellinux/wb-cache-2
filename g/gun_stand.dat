25|$|Star Platinum's keen {{eyesight}} and a photo {{produced by}} Joseph's Hermit Purple Stand helps the three determine that Dio is somewhere in Egypt. Kakyoin, freed from Dio's control by Jotaro, joins the group. On a jetliner {{the group is}} ambushed by the insectile Stand Tower of Gray, forcing Kakyoin to prove his worth. Jean Pierre Polnareff, user of the swordsman Stand Silver Chariot, challenges Avdol in Hong Kong but is freed from Dio's control, joining them to avenge his late sister. The heroes take a ship to Singapore but are forced to battle the aquatic Stand Dark Blue Moon, controlled by an assassin who has murdered and impersonated the ship's captain Tennille, who sinks their ship. Accompanied by a stowaway girl, the group boards an abandoned freighter but discover that the entire ship is a Stand called Strength, controlled by an orangutan named Forever. Jotaro manages to defeat Forever soundly, causing the freighter to revert to a much smaller boat. Devo the Cursed uses his Stand, Ebony Devil, to accost Polnareff in Singapore, while Rubber Soul and his Yellow Temperance impersonate Kakyoin before attempting to consume Jotaro. In Calcutta they encounter Hol Horse, user of a <b>gun</b> <b>Stand</b> called the Emperor, and J. Geil, a man with two right hands and user of the Hanged Man, a Stand of light that attacks from mirrors. Polnareff avenges his sister by slaying her murderer, J. Geil, but Avdol is seemingly killed by Hol Horse, who flees the scene.|$|E

50|$|A remade {{version of}} the game was released, titled Alien Shooter: Reloaded which {{featured}} the addition of few new levels, simplified role-playing system and a several minor changes. This version was originally created {{in order to make}} the game more suitable for shareware distribution (with the size of only 400 Mb). The shareware release is no longer available, and a newer digital distribution version is now available which is even further compressed down to a 258 Mb download. Reloaded has less music, no coop campaign and the multiplayer is also gone. Therefore, it adds an individual shooting mode <b>Gun</b> <b>Stand</b> and has a bit more levels. However the levels of the game are all smaller than in Alien Shooter 2.|$|E

In spite of an intense five-day bombardment, and several infantry assaults the French failed to make the breakthrough they were hoping to - as the British defences remained largely intact. A large mine was detonated under the fortress, but this made little impact on the defences.|$|R
