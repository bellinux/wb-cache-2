The paper deals with complex investigation of the spectral and luminescent properties of <b>fluorophosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> doped with different concentration of ytterbium and erbium ions. Glass compositions based on Ba(PO 3) 2 -BaF 2 -СaF 2 -MgF 2 -AlF 3 -SrF 2 -YF 3 with different erbium fluoride concentration (from 1 to 12. 5 mol%) were synthesized by conventional high temperature method. Absorption cross-sections and Judd-Ofelt parameters were determined based on the measured absorption spectra data. Erbium ions luminescence was excited by titanium-sapphire laser at 975 nm. Stimulated emission cross section was calculated by McCumber method. Fuchtenbauer-Landenburg formula is used to calculate erbium ions radiation lifetime. Calculated integral values of the absorption cross section are greater than of conventional phosphate glasses and reach abs = 1, 37 × 10 - 18 cm- 2 and em = 1, 39 × 10 - 18 cm- 2.

The nonradiative energy transfer is consistent with an electric-dipole-electric-dipole interaction mechanism.
