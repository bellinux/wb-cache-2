Despite iodine's listing by the WHO as the world's {{most easily}} preventable cause of brain damage, {{there is very little}} known about iodine cycling in terrestrial freshwaters, particularly regarding temporal changes in speciation. This study presents iodine speciation (measured by IC-ICP-MS) data from one year of monthly sampling of a <b>dimictic</b> <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> in the Black Forest (Mummelsee). Total soluble iodine (TSI) levels in the Mummelsee's water column averaged 1. 9 ± 0. 3 μg L- 1. Soluble organically bound iodine (SOI) accounted for the majority of TSI in the lake (85 ± 7 %) and inflow (76 ± 6 %). SOI showed few changes throughout the year, despite stratification, anoxia in the hypolimnion and ice cover. Iodide was lost from the epilimnion during the summer, autumn and winter, which may be related to (micro) biological uptake and sedimentation of dead organic matter. Efficient biological uptake was also suggested by a sediment core, where we found high total iodine concentrations (av. 11. 8 ± 1. 7 mg kg- 1) and a significant correlation with organic carbon content (p < 0. 001). In the hypolimnion a strong iodide flux was observed from the sediments into the water column during lake stratification and low DO levels. Based on I/Corg ratios in the sediment core, the iodide flux into the lake probably occurs by biological decomposition of organic material in the upper 20 cm of the sediments. Iodate levels in the epilimnion increased consistently over the year, whereas it was reduced below detection limits in the hypolimnion during anoxia. The winter turnover lead to reintroduction of oxygen into the hypolimnion and rapid formation of iodate and SOI. During the turnover event, near complete loss of iodide from the water column was also observed. SOI will play the largest role in iodine cycling in the Mummelsee; however, further studies are needed on the biological transformation of iodine species in freshwaters for a more complete understanding of iodine cycling...|$|R
40|$|Food quality affects growth, {{reproduction}} and community structure of zooplankton, and {{has implications for}} nutrient cycling and the transfer of energy and matter in aquatic food chains. While the issue of food quality in clear water lakes has received great recent attention, studies on food quality for zooplankton in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> are scarce. <b>Humic</b> <b>lakes</b> are largely influenced by carbon of terrestrial origin, {{and the effect of}} this large terrestrial carbon influence on the total quality of the resource available for zooplankton is poorly known. On the one hand, there is usually a large contribution of low-quality detritus and bacteria to the particulate carbon pool of <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> On the other hand, cryptophytes and chrysophytes, algal groups generally considered of high quality for zooplankton, are rather common in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> In this thesis, I assess the quality of the food available for zooplankton in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes,</b> and compare it to lakes that are less influenced by terrestrial organic matter (clear water lakes). In a long-term laboratory experiment, in which zooplankton were kept in humic and in clear lake water in the presence or in absence of recent phytoplankton production, differences in zooplankton community composition between lake types as well as comparatively high zooplankton biomass were observed in the <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> {{by the end of the}} study. It was unclear from that study whether the differences in zooplankton community composition and biomass could be due to differences in food quality between lake types. In a series of subsequent studies, I measured the content of fatty acids and elements in seston (suspended particulate matter) to assess the quality of the food available for zooplankton in humic and clear water lakes. I hypothesized that food quality is higher in humic than in clear water lakes of comparable trophy. In a field survey, I found higher food quality (in terms of fatty acids) in humic than in clear water lakes closer to an oligotrophic (low total phosphorus concentration) state. However, in meso- to eutrophic lakes, food quality (in terms of both elements and fatty acids) was lower in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> than in clear water lakes, which resulted in comparatively low growth and reproduction of zooplankton in the <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> My results show that there are differences in food quality between humic and clear water lakes that affect zooplankton growth and reproduction, and, consequently, energy transfer in the food chain. The large influence of terrestrial organic matter in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> can have bearings on food quality for zooplankton, since it can affect, for instance, the relative contribution of algal (high food quality), non-algal and detrital (low food quality) carbon to the total organic carbon pool, as well as microplankton community structure and composition...|$|R

In these lakes, 13 to 42 % of the 16 S rRNA gene sequences of the anoxic water column were assigned to GSB. The spatial distribution of GSB was tightly correlated with the spectrophotometrically measured BChl concentration during the summer season. Maximum BChl concentrations were observed in the uppermost part of the anoxic water layer, covering most of the chlorophyll pigment in these lakes.

40|$|Littoral {{zones in}} lakes {{are among the}} most {{productive}} habitats in the world, but have been seriously understudied, as most limnological studies have concerned only pelagic habitats. The likely importance of littoral zones in clear lakes is widely acknowledged, but in contrast their role in dystrophic <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> has generally been assumed to be minor. In this thesis, littoral importance in whole-lake metabolism was studied in small and highly <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> in Southern Finland, where Lake Mekkojärvi was the principal study lake. Primary production (PP) measurements revealed that littoral periphyton, growing on surrounding aquatic vegetation, can dominate the whole-lake PP, and the highly autotrophic littoral can help balance the whole-lake metabolism or even shift these lakes to occasional net autotrophy. Measurements of bacterial production (BP) within the littoral epiphytic biofilms and in the pelagic zone revealed overall pelagic dominance of BP in Mekkojärvi. However, epiphytic bacteria made a strong contribution, and their highest production rates were almost equal to those of pelagic bacterioplankton. Stable isotope analysis revealed that periphyton can be an important food resource for the consumers in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> The naturally fishless Mekkojärvi was divided into two basins by a plastic curtain and perch (Perca fluviatilis) were introduced to one basin while the other remained fishless. The results indicate that the pelagic zooplankton do not appreciably utilize littoral prey under the fishless state, but that fish can promote coupling of the pelagic and littoral food webs by directly utilizing littoral prey or by inducing predation pressure on zooplankton, which drives them to the littoral to seek refuge from predation. This study emphasizes the important role of the littoral in whole-lake processes in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes,</b> and suggests that when the littoral is taken into account many small <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> are actually more productive and not as heterotrophic as is commonly supposed...|$|R

We put forward a hypothesis that this change will be reflected in the quantity and structure of summer phytoplankton due to expected changes in the water chemistry. We noted a statistically significant decrease in total phosphorus and calcium concentrations, electrolytic conductivity, and Secchi disc transparency, and an increase in water color. The phytoplankton structure changed, with cyanoprocaryota and greens decreasing and flagellates increasing. The alteration was observed in a lake which had previously been drained by ditches, so beaver damming appeared to cause the return of the lake to its original endorheic conditions as well as to a water chemistry and phytoplankton structure more typical of undisturbed <b>humic</b> <b>lakes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The role of {{littoral}} habitats in lake metabolism {{has been}} underrated, especially in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes,</b> {{based on an}} assumption of low benthic primary production (PP) due to low light penetration into water. This assumption has been challenged by recent recognition of littoral epiphyton dominance of whole-lake PP in a small highly <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> and of epiphyton as an important basal food source for <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> biota. However, as these studies have mostly concerned single lakes, {{there is a need}} to test their wider generality. We studied the whole-lake PP and community respiration (CR) in eight small <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> in southern Finland during July 2015 using 14 C incorporation to measure pelagic PP and the changes in dissolved inorganic carbon in light and dark in situ incubations to measure CR and littoral PP by epiphyton. Changes in O 2 concentration in both pelagic and littoral surface water were measured periodically from each lake and, additionally, continuously with a data logger from one lake during the study period. The results revealed that the littoral dominated whole-lake net primary production (NPP) in five of the eight lakes, which was supported by observed O 2 supersaturation in the littoral surface water in most of the lakes. Calculated pelagic:littoral ratios by area correlated negatively with both littoral NPP and littoral contribution to whole-lake NPP. Moreover, there was a significant positive relationship between littoral proportion of whole-lake NPP and the fraction of lake surface area covered by littoral aquatic vegetation. This demonstrates that increased aquatic littoral vegetation cover increases the overall importance of the littoral to whole-lake PP in highly <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Littoral NPP also correlated strongly with littoral O 2 saturation, and the continuously measured O 2 revealed substantial temporal variation in O 2 saturation, particularly in the littoral zone. Whole-lake gross primary production:community respiration (GPP:CR) ratios revealed that accounting for littoral metabolism produced a marked shift towards lake metabolic balance, although all the eight lakes remained net heterotrophic. This study emphasizes that littoral metabolism needs to be accounted for when estimating whole-lake C fluxes in all lakes, even in highly colored humic waters...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{production}} (BP) {{in lakes}} has generally only been {{measured in the}} pelagic zone without accounting for littoral BP, and studies of BP at the whole-lake scale are very scarce. In the dystrophic <b>humic</b> <b>lakes,</b> which are common throughout the boreal region, low light penetration through water has been assumed to seriously limit available habitats for littoral organisms. However, many highly <b>humic</b> boreal <b>lakes</b> have extensive partly submerged vegetation around the lake perimeter which can provide well-lit substrata for highly productive epiphyton. We measured epiphytic BP on the littoral vegetation and pelagic BP in a small highly <b>humic</b> boreal <b>lake</b> in Finland during an open-water season and extrapolated the BP rates to the whole lake. Pelagic BP dominated the combined BP over the study period, but the epiphytic BP contributed an average of 24 % to overall BP over the sampling period and was almost equal to pelagic BP in July. According to these results, a substantial component of BP has been previously overlooked in the lake when BP has been measured only from the pelagic. Our study demonstrates {{that the role of}} the littoral zone in BP in highly <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> has previously been understated, and needs {{to be taken into account}} in assessments of whole-lake carbon cycling and metabolism...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{microbial}} community {{structure and function}} of aquatic ecosystems were investigated. Illumina 16 S gene tag sequencing was performed to profile the bacterial community of 7 <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> across multiple years of sampling, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to investigate the functional characteristics of <b>humic</b> and eutrophic <b>lakes.</b> Lakes are significant in the global carbon cycle. In particular, <b>humic</b> bog <b>lakes</b> are reservoirs for large quantities of terrestrially derived organic matter, and thus link the aquatic and terrestrial carbon cycles. The bacterial communities that inhabit these ecosystems are {{of great interest to}} researchers, as they are the primary respirators of detritus. While DOC quality can be a strong driver of bacterial communities within lakes, resource availability varies greatly with space and time. Here we sequenced the 16 S rRNA gene from over 700 samples from seven characteristic <b>humic</b> bog <b>lakes</b> to investigate the dynamics of bacterial community composition with time. Samples were taken weekly from each of the seven <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> during the ice-off season. For some lakes, communities from as many as four years were represented. This unique dataset allowed us to investigate the variability in diversity across temporal scales of years, seasons, weeks, and days, while maintaining the lens of spatial variation. The diversity of each lake could be characterized adequately after approximately 25 samples that were spaced evenly throughout the ice-off season. Unpredictable year-to-year variation of diversity was observed, although, the normal range of Shannon Diversity was near 4. Diverse spring and early summer communities have been observed for aquatic bacteria in prior studies, but here we identified that on average, the community is also changing at the highest rate during early summer weeks in these lakes. Mixing events, which alter the physical and chemical factors of the habitat, also correlated with times of rapid change of community structure. Conversely, the community changed at the slowest rate during the strongly stratified periods of mid-late summer. Metagenomic sequencing on two samples from one <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> and three samples from a eutrophic lake revealed that the lakes were functionally most similar with space than season. The <b>humic</b> <b>lake,</b> which has a high concentration of humic substances from OM that is leached through a sphagnum mat, contained an overrepresentation of enzymes capable of degrading small organic acids and aromatic compounds. Presumably, photodegradation of humic substances are contributing the labile DOC pool for bacteria, and this represents a model for respiration of terrestrially derived C within aquatic ecosystems. Alternatively, the bacterial community in the eutrophic lake seemed suited for breaking down polysaccharides derived from algal biomass. Though more glycoside hydrolases were observed in the <b>humic</b> <b>lake,</b> the eutrophic community maintained a higher proportion of sulfatase enzymes that would putatively be active in degrading algal cell walls. With these studies, we have identified that the diversity and change of bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems vary multiple temporal scales, but the trends are generally shared for similar lakes. We also have seen that the functional potential of the bacterial community is more stable with time than across trophic levels, and the differences between the <b>humic</b> and eutrophic <b>lake</b> are largely a factor of substrate preference...|$|R

Results from lake enclosures during the autumn overturn period revealed a decrease in d 13 C of adult Daphnia from 240. 5 % to 250. 3 %, reflecting extensive consumption of 13 Cdepleted methanotrophic bacteria.

We assessed the spectral characteristics of light absorption by CDOM in a eutrophic, <b>humic</b> shallow mixed <b>lake</b> of temperate Sweden at a high-frequency (30 [*]min) interval and during a full growing season (May to October). Physical time series, such as solar radiation, temperature, wind, and partial pressures of carbon dioxide in water and air, were measured synchronously.

The magnitude of the CDOM loss exceeded subhourly to daily variability by an order of magnitude. Applying Fourier analysis, we demonstrate that variation in CDOM remained largely unaffected by rapid shifts in weather, and no apparent response to in-lake dissolved organic carbon production was found. In autumn, CDOM occasionally showed variation at hourly to daily time scales, reaching a maximum daily coefficient of variation of 15 %. We suggest that lake-internal effects on CDOM are quenched in <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> waters by dominating effects associated with imported CDOM and solar exposure.

These substances are hard to degrade enzymatically because of their high aromaticity and complex structure. However, there is increasing evidence that photochemical processes render the material more bioavailable. We demonstrate a substantial photochemical production of four carboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, formic, and acetic acid) in a <b>humic</b> <b>lake.</b> The combined production rate in the surface water of these four acids was 19 pg C liter-l h-l with natural sunlight. Furthermore, based on radiotracer studies, {{we found that the}} amount of carbon assimilated and oxidized to CO, from malonic, formic, and acetic acid exceeded bacterial carbon production, sometimes by more than one order of magnitude. This implies that carboxylic acids were major bac-terioplankton substrates. Nevertheless, under natural sunlight at the lake surface, microbial utilization of carboxylic acids was substantially lower than the photochemical production of the acids. Hence, photochemically produced carboxylic acids may accumulate in sunlight exposed environments and may also serve as bacterial substrates after mixing into deeper layers, or during night. -Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial sources makes up a dominant fraction of the bioavailable organic matter in the water column of many lakes (Wetzel 1984...|$|R

The humic waters showed a median pCO 2 almost ninefold higher across the 13 -year study than the clear waters, supporting pCO 2 values about tenfold above atmospheric equilibrium. Eutrophication of the clear-water lake resulted in a decrease in pCO 2 to median values below atmospheric equilibrium, producing a strong sink for atmospheric CO 2. In contrast, pCO 2 increased by over tenfold in both lakes during the acidification phase, resulting in very large CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere.

The {{results showed that the}} composition of humic substances is important in their sorption to aquifer material during surface water artificial recharge through infiltration basins to groundwater. The more acidic fraction of humic substances was less effectively sorbed than the more hydrophobic fraction. The removal of the former fraction from the recharged groundwater was effective using weak base anion exchange resin. A high total number of bacteria in presence of cyanobacteria in the subsurface below the infiltration indicated that significant decrease of biodegradation of organic matter, during water passage from blooming <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> to groundwater, is not likely. Because of high amounts of microbially assimilable organic carbon in humic water and its low reduction during chemical treatment, bacterial growth in drinking water distribution systems was dependent on the phosphorus concentration. In the distributed water bacteria were forming biofilm on the pipe surfaces. To reduce the biofilm growth fairly high doses of chlorine were needed. The anion exchange resin was successfully used to determine concentrations of iron-humic complexes in humic groundwater.

High-MW DOC (> 10, 000) comprised an increasing fraction of total DOC with increasing total DOC and humic content of the lakes. High-MW DOC was generally more available to bacteria (i. e., more bacteria were produced per unit of organic carbon initially present) than low-MW (< 10, 000) DOC. The availability to bacteria of this high-MW DOC decreased with increasing humic content. However, although less available in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> than in clearwater lakes, the higher abundance of high-MW DOC made it quantitatively more important as a bacterial substrate; i. e., a larger fraction of the total bacterial yield of the cultures was due to high-MW DOC compounds in <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> than in clearwater lakes. On the average, 48 % of bacterial growth occurred at the expense of DOC of < 10, 000 MW.

The quantum yield spectrum (��) for the direct photoinactivation of Pase increased exponentially with decreasing wavelength, with a much steeper slope relative to other ��. This, combined with modeled half-life values for direct photoinactivation in excess of 5 d, indicates that direct photoinactivation of Pase by natural sunlight in lakes is negligible. Nonetheless, photoinactivation of enzymes occurred rapidly in light-exposed natural waters and suggested an indirect mechanism. The pH of natural waters greatly affected photoinactivation. In acid <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> water exposed to ultraviolet radiation, the half-lives of both Pase and Gase were 4 h. The half-life of these enzymes under the same conditions were twofold higher for lake waters obtained from a limed <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> (8 h).

There was no significant inactivation of controls without H 2 O 2, indicating that enzymes are inactivated through Fe(III) /enzyme binding, which is enabled through the oxidation of Fe(II) by H 2 O 2 to Fe(III).

Lakes Cucao and Huillinco were characterized by a marine influence. All the lakes had brown coloured waters, caused by humic substances, which limit their transparency. Lake Natri was the deepest (58 m), whereas Lake Tepuhueico had the shallowest depth (25 m). Total phosphorus and nitrogen fluctuated between 23. 5 and 35 µg L- 1 and 197 and 380 mug L- 1 (annual average) in lakes Natri, Tepuhueico and Tarahuín, respectively. Lakes Cucao and Huillinco showed extremely high concentrations of total nitrogen (annual average or = 3, 000 mug L- 1) and total phosphorus (= 223 and 497 mug L- 1), and were classified as hyper-eutrophic. Lake Tarahuín registered the greatest diversity of phytoplankton, with 55 species, including Ceratium hirundinella which also occurred in lakes Cucao and Tarahuín. The diversity of the zooplankton community varied across these lakes. The presence of Diaptomus diabolicus (Tumeodiaptomus d. Dussart 1979) (Cucao, Huillinco and Tepuhueico) is noteworthy since this extends its geographical distribution to the sout...|$|R
40|$|Recent European water legislation, the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{requires}} European Member States {{to assess}} the ¿ecological status¿ of surface waters. As part of this, many European countries are choosing to develop a quality classification scheme for chlorophyll concentrations {{as a measure of}} phytoplankton abundance. The assessment of ecological quality and its component parts, such as chlorophyll, must be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or ¿reference condition¿. It is, therefore, necessary to determine chlorophyll reference conditions for all European lake types, or alternatively, models for predicting reference chlorophyll concentrations on a site-specific basis. For this purpose, a large dataset of European lakes considered to be in reference condition has been assembled; 466 lakes in total. Data were included from 12 European countries, but lakes from Norway and Finland dominated and made up 82 % of all reference lakes. Data have been collated on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic type, surface area, and geographical region. Regression models were developed for estimating site-specific reference chlorophyll concentrations from significant predictor ¿typology¿ variables. Reference chlorophyll concentrations were found to vary along a number of environmental gradients. Concentrations increased with colour and alkalinity, and decreased with lake depth and altitude. Forward selection was used to identify independent explanatory variables in regression models for predicting site-specific reference chlorophyll concentrations. Due to data limitations, colour was only included in the model for very <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Depth was selected as an explanatory variable in all models. Alkalinity was included in models for low colour and <b>humic</b> <b>lakes</b> and altitude was included in models for low colour and very <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Uncertainty in the models was quite high and arises from errors in the data used to develop the models (including natural temporal and spatial variability in data) and also from additional explanatory variables not considered in the models, particularly nutrient concentrations, flushing rate and grazing. Despite these uncertainties, site-specific reference conditions are still recommended in preference to type-specific reference conditions, as they should result in reduced error in ecological status classifications, particularly for lakes close to typology boundaries. Because of the bias in the dataset towards Northern European low and medium alkalinity lakes, the models are not currently recommended for application to lakes in Central and Mediterranean regions of Europe where drivers of background productivity could be different.

40|$|Decades of {{conflicting}} results have fueled {{a debate about}} how O 2 affects organic matter (OM) degradation and carbon cycling. In a laboratory study, using both OM taken directly from a <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> and chemically isolated fulvic acid, we monitored the mineralization of dissolved OM in freshwater under purely oxic and anoxic conditions, under oxic then anoxic conditions, and under anoxic then oxic conditions, for 426 d. Between 5 % and 24 % of the initial OM was mineralized, with most extensive mineralization occurring under purely oxic and anoxic–oxic con-ditions. A sequential change in the O 2 regime {{did not result in}} greater overall degradation, but initially anoxic conditions favored subsequent oxic mineralization. A substantially greater fraction of the OM was degraded than in previous shorter studies, with as much as 50 % of the total OM degradation occurring after 147 d into the experiment. Three fractions of the degradable OM were identified: OM degraded only under oxic conditions (68 – 78 %), OM degraded more rapidly under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions (16 – 18 %), and OM degraded at equal rates under both oxic and anoxic conditions (6 – 14 %). The degradation patterns of natural dissolved OM from a <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> and chemically isolated fulvic acid were very similar, which indicates a similar level of bio-availability. The difference between anoxic and oxic degradation was greater in our long-term studies than in previous short-term experiments, which indicates that the oxic and anoxic degradation potentials vary with increas...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{ultraviolet}} (UV) -B {{radiation and}} acidification on pelagic carbon flux in a <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> (dissolved organic carbon [DOC] � 15 mg C L� 1) were studied in a mesocosm experiment {{during the summer}} of 2000. Triplicate tanks (107 liters volume, 1 m high) were exposed to natural solar radiation, a daily extra dose of UV-B radiation, or kept dark. One set of tanks was submitted to a decrease in pH (from 5. 7 to 4. 7), and one set was kept at the natural pH level. During 70 d, water samples were taken regularly from the mesocosms for measurements of DOC, absorbance, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and pH. Additionally, we regularly incubated samples to measure photooxidation rates, primary production, and community respiration. We found an increase in the photooxidation rates in the acidified mesocosms relative to ambient pH. The greater abiotic production of DIC (i. e., photooxidation) in acidified conditions could explain � 27 % of the decline in DOC in the same conditions. Laboratory experiments were done to test the effects of pH on the dissolved organic matter (DOM) photoreactivity. At lower pH values, we found both higher abiotic DIC production and specific absorbance fading, relative to neutral pH values in water from a <b>humic</b> <b>lake.</b> In a separate experiment, samples were exposed to prolonged irradiation under laboratory conditions, resulting in complete loss of absorptivity in the wavelengths between 290 and 400 nm.

Grazing by Daphnia and by nanoflagellates reduced the proportion of MOB in the microbial community and the methanotrophic activity decreased significantly at higher Daphnia densities.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} are increasing inorganic nitrogen (N) loadings to lakes {{in the northern}} hemisphere. In many boreal lakes phytoplankton are N limited, wherefore enhanced N input may affect the productivity of pelagic food webs. Simultaneously, global change causes increased inflows of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to boreal lakes. Between clear and <b>humic</b> <b>lakes,</b> whole lake primary and consumer production naturally differs. However, research is inconclusive as to what controls pelagic production in these lakes. Further, {{it is unclear how}} DOC affects the response of the pelagic food web to enhanced inorganic N availability. The overarching goal of this thesis was to study the effects of inorganic N and organic C for pelagic food webs in boreal lakes. In the thesis, I first identified the main drivers of pelagic production during summer in eight non-manipulated Swedish boreal lakes with naturally low or high DOC. Then I investigated how increased N availability affects the pelagic food chain, and how the response differs with DOC. Therefore, whole lake inorganic N fertilization experiments were conducted in six Swedish boreal lakes across a DOC gradient (low, medium, high) divided into three lake pairs (control, N enriched) with one reference and two impact years. In each lake, I also investigated the response of zooplankton growth using in situ mesocosm experiments excluding planktivores. I found that <b>humic</b> boreal <b>lakes</b> had lower phytoplankton production and biomass than clear water lakes. Further, phytoplankton community composition and food quality differed with DOC. However, high DOC did not reduce pelagic energy mobilization or zooplankton biomass, but promoted a higher dominance of cladoceran relative to copepod species. N addition clearly enhanced phytoplankton biomass and production in the experimental lakes. However, this stimulating N effect decreased with DOC as caused by light limitation. Further, the newly available phytoplankton energy derived from N addition was not efficiently transferred to zooplankton, which indicates a mismatch between producer energy supply and consumer energy use. Indeed, the mesocosm experiment revealed that decreased food quality of phytoplankton in response to N addition resulted in reduced food web performance, especially in clearer <b>lakes.</b> In <b>humic</b> <b>lakes,</b> zooplankton production and food web efficiency were clearly more resilient to N addition. In summary, my thesis suggests that any change in the landscape that enhances inorganic N availability will especially affect pelagic food webs in clear water lakes. In contrast, brownification will result in more lakes being resilient to eutrophication caused by enhanced N deposition...|$|R
40|$|Using {{experimental}} mesocosms, {{we tested}} the strength of bottom-up controls by nutrients and top-down controls by an omnivorous fish (Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus; family Characidae), and the interaction between them on the CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) in the surface waters of a tropical <b>humic</b> <b>lake</b> (Lake Cabiúnas, Brazil). The experiment included the addition of nutrients and fish to the mesocosms in a factorial design. Overall, persistent CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere, supported by an intense net heterotrophy, were observed in all treatments and replicates over the 6 -week study period. The CO 2 efflux (average Â± standard error) integrated over the experiment was similar among the control mesocosms and those receiving only fish or only nutrients (309 Â± 2, 303 Â± 16, and 297 Â± 17 mmol CO 2 m - 2 day - 1, respectively). However, the addition of nutrients {{in the presence of}} fish resulted in a high algal biomass and daytime net autotrophy, reducing the CO 2 emissions by 35 % (by 193 Â± 7 mmol CO 2 m - 2 day - 1). These results indicate that high CO 2 emissions persist following the eutrophication of humic waters, but that the magnitude of these emissions might depend on the structure of the food web. In conclusion, fish and nutrients may act in a synergistic manner to modulate persistent CO 2 emissions from tropical <b>humic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag.
