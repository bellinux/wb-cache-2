40|$|Abstract. Driving axle {{of a light}} bus {{was tested}} on the bench of {{transmission}} system, {{and the cause of}} abnormal vibration and noise was analyzed. Some defects were found from the test, such as oversized impact of <b>hyperboloidal</b> <b>gear</b> pair, eccentricity of drive gear shaft, and poor roughness of tooth face. Several improvement measures were put forward and confirmed by bench test. The results indicate that noise reduced greatly, thus the improvement measures are effective and positive. ...|$|E
40|$|Presented is {{a system}} of {{curvilinear}} coordinates based on the cylindroid. A system of cylindroidal coordinates was originally proposed to parameterize toothed bodies or generalized <b>hyperboloidal</b> <b>gear</b> elements. Cylindrical, spherical, and Cartesian coordinates are special scenarios that emerge from a systems of cylindroidal coordinates. Cylindroidal coordinates are introduced to parameterize the diffusion equation. It is demonstrated that the developed diffusion equation degenerates into established diffusion relations for cylindrical, spherical, and Cartesian coordinates. BACKGROUND The geometric simplicity of cylindrical gearing {{has resulted in a}} methodology for its design, analysis, and manufacuture that corresponds well with practice. The kinematic geometry of spatial gearing (this includes bevel, worm, and hypoid gearconventional pairs) is not well understood from a theoretical viewpoint. The high quality of spatial gears produced today is based on many years of experience and empirical data for their design and manufacture. As a result of the complex geometry that exists in hypoid an...|$|E
