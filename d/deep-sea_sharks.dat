5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sharks</b> in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} black dogfish under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened. The reproductive characteristics of the black dogfish, such as a large female maturation size, may render it susceptible to overfishing, though it is more fecund than other deep-sea dogfish sharks.

5|$|The {{black dogfish}} forms shoals or schools {{that tend to}} be larger during the winter and spring. Though fairly active, its {{swimming}} muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of creatine phosphokinase compared to the shallow-water spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed. The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy. Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sharks</b> parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host. Other known parasites of this species include the fluke Otodistomum cestoides, the copepods Neoalbionella fabricii and Neoalbionella centroscyllii, and the protozoans Haemogregarina delagei and Trypanosoma rajae.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sharks</b> generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sharks,</b> it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E

5|$|Armed {{with large}} teeth {{and a strong}} bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary {{predator}} that takes {{many different types of}} prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 1014 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited {{as an example of the}} susceptibility of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sharks</b> to human exploitation.

2500|$|The {{only known}} predators of adult giant squid are sperm whales, but pilot whales may also feed on them. Juveniles are preyed on by <b>deep-sea</b> <b>sharks</b> and other fish. Because sperm whales are skilled at {{locating}} giant squid, scientists {{have tried to}} observe them to study the squid. Giant squid have also been recently discovered to be cannibalistic; in mid-to-late October 2016, a [...] giant squid washed ashore in Galicia, Spain. The squid had been photographed alive shortly before its death by a tourist named Javier Ondicol, and examination of its corpse by the Coordinators for the Study and Protection of Marine Species (CEPESMA) indicates that the squid was attacked and mortally wounded by another giant squid, losing parts of its fins, and receiving damage to its mantle, one of its gills and losing an eye. The intact nature of the specimen indicates that the giant squid managed to escape its rival by slowly retreating to shallow water, where it died of its wounds. The incident is the second to be documented among Architeuthis recorded in Spain, with the other occurring in Villaviciosa. Evidence {{in the form of}} giant squid stomach contents containing beak fragments from other giant squid in Tasmania also supports the theory that the species is at least occasionally cannibalistic. Alternatively, such squid-on-squid attacks may be a result of competition for prey. These traits are seen in the Humboldt squid as well, indicating that cannibalism in large squid may be more common than originally thought.|$|E

40|$|The {{velvet belly}} lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax) {{is a small}} <b>deep-sea</b> <b>shark</b> {{commonly}} found in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. As {{other members of the}} Etmopteridae family, it displays thousands of tiny epidermal light organs called photophores, which are composed of a cluster of photogenic cells (photocytes) enclosed in a pigmented sheath and topped by a shutter-like structure and a lens. These organs produce a blue-green light that is believed to be involved in numerous functions including camouflage by counterillumination, intraspecific communication and aposematism. According to recent pharmacological studies, this functional versatility is partly achieved thanks to a complex photophore control mechanism, which involves hormones and neural agents. Current experimental data suggest (i) photocytes and the shutter to be the main targets of these pharmacological substances, and (ii) the presence of a link between the targets since the shutter appears to open while photocytes are glowing and inversely. Here, we hypothesize extraocular opsins to endowe photophores with their own light perception (as it was recently shown in a bioluminescent squid) and hence to provide the link between shutter opening and photocyte activity. The present work uses various techniques including transcriptome analysis western blotting, immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of opsins in the shark’s photogenic tissue. Results confirm the presence of extraocular opsins associated with the photophores, which likely supports their involvement in the bioluminescence control mechanism...|$|R
