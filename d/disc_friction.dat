40|$|Somewhere in the {{transmission}} of vehicles today, a wet clutch can often be found. Characteristic {{of this type of}} clutch is that they operate under lubricated working conditions. In earlier research, friction characteristics and performance of wet clutches have been well investigated by several authors. Studies have also been made {{in order to understand the}} ageing of wet clutches. However, most lifetime studies have been made for systems with paperbased <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and systems involving sintered bronze <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> remain unexplored. <b>Friction</b> <b>discs</b> of sintered bronze is used in the Haldex limited slip coupling (LSC), an all-wheel drive system used in cars from many different manufacturers. In order to get a better understanding of how this system can change over time, the study in this master thesis is focused on how frictional performance is affected by oxidation of lubricant, testrig ageing and additive content. This work has been conducted in cooperation with Haldex Traction in Landskrona and Statoil Lubricants in Nynäshamn. The oxidation effects on friction performance was examined using a modified dry-TOST (Waterless Turbine Oil Oxidation Stability Test) on a fully formulated lubricant. The oxidation time period was divided into five steps from 48 hours to 408 h and for each level of oxidation, a friction performance test was run using a pin on disc machine. Also an oil aged in a clutch disc testrig was tested for friction performance. The test is constructed in order to verify that an oil- <b>friction</b> <b>disc</b> combination will last the lifetime of the specific application. Since lubricant additives are vital to the performance of wet clutches the effect of reducing the additive concentration in the oil was also studied, in the range 10 to 100 % of the standard additive formulation. Results showed that a general friction increase can be seen for oxidation, additive reduction and testrig ageing. Lubricant aged in testrig shows significantly different friction characteristics with temperature than lubricants aged by dry-TOST implying that dry-TOST alone is not a sufficient method to evaluate lubricant ageing. Further research has to be made in order to understand the ageing of wet clutches. A better understanding of which mechanisms that are responsible for the decomposition of a lubricant in a wet clutch system such as the Haldex LSC is needed.

The efficiency for crude oil, saline-water, gasoline or kerosene is lower than that for water. The decrease in efficiency, while pumping the crude oil and saline-water is due to the <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> losses over the outsides of the impeller shroud and hub due to viscous effect.

50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates similar to the {{clutches}} in an automobile automatic transmission.

A piston pushes the stack of <b>friction</b> <b>discs</b> and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} in the flow mechanism of the hub plate crown, the current calculation of the <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> loss and the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump often uses empirical formulas. Research on the flow characteristics of the hub plate crown is of practical significance. The shroud and hub cavities are respectively studied with regard to tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °) at the four different operational points (0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp). Results indicate that at the same operational point, the smaller the volute chamber sectional area is, the higher the tangential velocity of the fluid core zone of the shroud cavity is. Radial leakage flow from the volute to the seal ring at the same operational point appears in 0 ° and 90 ° direction; when the flow is large, the tangential and radial velocities of the shroud and hub cavities with the same radius tend to be equal with axial symmetry. The axial leakage flow through the balance holes significantly affects the radial distribution of both tangential and radial velocities of fluid flow in the hub cavity. The numerical calculation results of fluid leakage through the clearance of back sealing ring are in good agreement with the test results. Accordingly, the magnitude of leakage is closely related to the fluid pressure and velocity distribution in the hub plate crown of the centrifugal pump. The analysis of the flow characteristics in the hub plate crown of the centrifugal pump could reveal the cause of the <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> loss from the mechanism, providing a significant guidance for improving the accuracy of calculation and balancing the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} quality {{concerns}} of car manufacturers is brake squeal. There are two CAE (Complex Aided Engineering) method for prediction of brake squeal, CEA (Complex Eigenvalue Analysis) and TDA (Transient Dynamic Analysis). However, CEA method is a quite usual tool to evaluate brake squeal propensity despite its intrinsic overestimation of any system instabilities. In contrast, TDA provides a reduced number of predicted instabilities, {{but it is too}} time consuming for complete FE models. The purpose of this thesis is the comparison of TDA with CEA to identify brake squeal frequencies. The finite element model of studied brake system consists of a brake disc, and pair of brake pads (friction material and backplate). Using the CEA method, brake squeal frequencies are identified by coalescence modes and calculation of Negative Damping Ratio (NDR) for various pressure and friction coefficient. As a comparison with CEA, TDA is performed by use of dynamic explicit solver to extract the variation of amplitude at a node on the brake <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> surface over time. The frequency response function of a node on brake disc can be calculated by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the frequencies correspond to the peaks of frequency response function can be considered as a representative of brake squeal frequency. The comparison of TDA and CEA reveals that even though five modes are introduced by NDR criteria for brake squeal onset, merely two of them are detected by TDA. Taking account of CEA overestimation about unstable modes, it can be concluded that the frequency response derived from the transient response can be a reliable method to represent the system instability. In addition, regarding TDA results brake squeal might happen in an unstable mode even with low value of real part as well as NDR.

40|$|Abstract:For further {{improvements}} in efficiency and performance of gas turbines, the secondary air system, i. e. the required cooling mass flow, plays an important role. The pre-swirled secondary air supply is a common method in the aero industry and is a promising option for heavy- duty gas turbine industry to reduce the air temperature for the blade supply and disc cooling. In the experimental investigation reported here, a system with pre-swirl nozzles was run in a test rig. In the rotating system, static and total relative temperatures as well as relative pressures were measured. The disc and the receiver holes in the flow path entering the rotating system were instrumented. In the stationary system, pressures and temperatures were hooked up in the disc to casing cavities. All mass flows entering and leaving the test rig were measured by means of orifices. The effectiveness of the cooling air was measured by changing the following parameters: • disc velocity to swirl ratio • pre-swirler geometry • mass flow. The experimental data show that a significant increase of cooling air performance, i. e. reduction of total air temperature in the relative frame, can be obtained in the system investigated. The measurements of the test rig confirm that the system effectiveness is basically a function of disc velocity to swirl ratio and pre-swirler pressure ratio. The effective pre-swirler velocity depends highly on the pre-swirler design.
