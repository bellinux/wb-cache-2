Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E

Consider also the fact that he is a soldier, and the Court is composed of members of the British Army.

500|$|Following Omkara, Kapoor took a {{short break}} from acting, as she felt that [...] "nothing [...] {{challenging}} enough <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> yes". In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented, [...] "In my initial years in the industry, I pushed myself {{to do a lot}} of work because I was greedy. I did some films—which I now regret—purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films." [...] Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the Farhan Akhtar action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name).|$|E

500|$|Wanting {{to have a}} {{new style}} of music, Gaga made it clear she did not want her fans to like the song. She wanted to write a song that could define where she was with Born This Way and her life. In an {{interview}} with NME, Gaga explained that the main inspiration behind the song was singer Whitney Houston and also added: [...] "This song is about me going back to New York. I wrote this about the courage it took <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'I hate Hollywood, I just wanna live in Brooklyn and make music'".|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch as Sue {{received}} {{high praise}} for her acting. Canning wrote that she [...] "stole the episode" [...] and [...] "perfectly portrayed a woman [...] hard heart was trying terribly not to break, but {{not being able}} to stop it." [...] BuddyTV John Kubicek stated, [...] "it's impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Lynch wasn't exceptional, because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover-up her emotions was well done and fit perfectly with the character." [...] Respers France commented that [...] "we got to see the range and complexity of Sue Sylvester", and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly said that Lynch did an [...] "outstanding job of delivering even the funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness". Sue's characterization in the series was criticized by several reviewers, however. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times stated that the [...] "consistent inconsistency of Sue's character is wearing thin", and that [...] "our sense of her fails to advance, wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister." [...] Futterman called the episode a [...] "too-little-too late attempt at redemption for Sue's poor characterization this season." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] "feels very self-consciously like a way to just remove her character from the table for the season finale", that [...] "it feels very self-consciously like an attempt by the show to address the fact that the character doesn't make any sense", and criticized the death of Jean: [...] "killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing, and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it." [...] Fallon described the funeral plot line as [...] "pure, classic Glee: Egregiously random, emotionally manipulative, wholly unnecessary to plot development, and, in the end, deeply moving." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E

2500|$|Cardi B is of Christian faith, {{believing in}} God and Jesus Christ; she has {{mentioned}} her [...] "strong relationship" [...] with God in interviews, often {{saying that she}} [...] "talks to him": [...] "If you know me, you know that I have this deep connection to God.

2500|$|Both {{participants}} and {{observers of the}} Cedar Revolution demonstrations have asked if the movement was influenced by recent local and regional events supporting democracy. Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt remarked to a reporter of the Washington Post, [...] "It's strange <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but this process of change has started because of the American invasion of Iraq. I was cynical about Iraq. But when I saw the Iraqi people voting three weeks ago, 8 million of them, it {{was the start of}} a new Arab world".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{sufficient}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> quickly, that painters today only consider {{the object in}} relation to the totality of things and, with regard to itself, {{in relation to the}} totality of its aspects. As they are not unaware of the fact that a form which is more pronounced dominates those which are less pronounced, the plastic dynamism will be born from the rhythmic relations of objects to objects, as with the different aspects of one and the same object, juxtaposed—not superposed, as some would like to believe—with all the sensibility and taste of the painter for whom those are the only rules.

But when I explained to him that my detention was merely temporary, and that I should be able to disprove the whole story as soon as I went before the magistrates, he winked most unpleasantly at the constable who had brought me in, and observed in a tone of vulgar sarcasm, [...] "We have a good many gentlemen here who says the same, sir--don't we, Jim? but they don't always find it so easy as they expected when they stands up afore the beak to prove their statements." ...|$|R
