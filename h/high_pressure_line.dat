40|$|Water hydraulics: {{the idea}} of using a nonflammable, {{environmentally}} friendly, cheap, nontoxic fluid in hydraulic systems has a lot of appeal. Water 2 ̆ 7 s renaissance as a working fluid, however, is crowned for only half the kingdom [...] - it has found application in many low and medium pressure systems, but in high-pressure systems, axial piston units of swashplate type and other piston machines subjected to high side loads in the presence of high pressure gradients cannot survive running on water. This is because water is around 30 times less viscous than mineral oil, which gives it an extremely low load-carrying capacity that is especially detrimental for the piston-cylinder tribological interface of the piston machines described. Increasing the load-carrying capacity of this interface would enable such piston machines to operate in systems with a 300 to 420 bar pressure gradient from the low to the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>line,</b> e. g. construction machinery, forest machinery, aircraft machinery. A series of simulation studies have been conducted using FSTI, the fluid structure thermal interaction model developed at the Maha Fluid Power Research Laboratory, in order to investigate the effect of minimum clearance, speed, four micro surface shaping forms, and four different material properties on the load-carrying capacity of the piston-cylinder interface of an existing 75 cc axial piston unit of swashplate type. The axial piston unit was chosen on account of the fact that axial piston units of swashplate type suffer from a particularly high side load, turning this into a type of worst-case scenario. The four surface shapes studied are the piston profile developed by Lasaar, the axial sine wave piston profile invented by Ivantysynova, Garrett, and Frederickson, a new version of this profile consisting of axial sine waves that switch between two amplitudes at their inflection points, and wide circumferential grooves in the bushing. It was determined that the last surface profile in that list can effect the greatest change in load-carrying capacity with the least amount of unwanted side-effects out of all profiles examined. The four material properties examined are piston and bushing density, modulus of elasticity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity. Here it was determined that the modulus of elasticity of the piston, in particular, had the highest level of influence on the pressure distribution of the interface, and thus its load carrying capacity, out of all material properties investigated in this work. Finally, from the simulation studies conducted, it is apparent that a significant improvement in the load-carrying capacity of water-lubricated piston-cylinder interfaces with high side loads is possible. ...|$|E

S strojem lahko razrežemo materiale do debeline 300 mm. Za razrez kot orodje uporabljamo vodni curek s tlakom do 3800 bar. Hitrost rezanja je odvisna od debeline ter strukture materiala. Zaradi zelo visokega delavnega tlaka so obremenjene komponente stroja, kot so visokotlačni agregat ter visokotlačni vodi. Pri razrezu prihaja do prašenja in ta prah se poseda na linearna vodila, katera imajo ponovitveno natančnost 0, 01 mm. Zato je zelo pomembno strokovno in redno vzdrževanje, saj s tem zagotavljamo visoko kvaliteto vodnega reza, daljšo življenjsko dobo, tako celotnega stroja, kot vgrajenih vitalnih komponent stroja, kot so visokotlačni agregat in visokotlačni vodi. Še posebej je pri obratovanju in vzdrževanju stroja izrednega pomena stopnja čistosti. S to stopnjo čistosti zagotavljamo kvaliteten vodni razrez ter daljšo življenjsko dobo stroja. Pri delovanju stroja moramo posebno pozornost nameniti varnosti zaposlenim, ki so na kakršen koli način povezani s strojem kakor, tudi skrbi za čisto okolje. Water {{cutting machine}} is a mechatronic system {{by which the}} material can be cut with clean water without any additional abrasive agents and without changing {{the structure of the}} work piece. The machine can cut materials up to 300 mm thick. As a cutting tool the water jet with pressure up to 3800 bar is used. Cutting speed depends on the thickness and structure of material.

40|$|In this presentation, CiDRA’s {{patented}} technology platform and its applications will be described. CiDRA's non-invasive, passive sonar array-based flow meter technology performs two independent measurements – flow rate and fluid characterization. Firstly, the meter provides the {{volumetric flow rate}} of the mixture by measuring {{the speed at which}} naturally occurring structures such as turbulent eddies or density variations convect with the flow past an axial array of sensors. Secondly, the meter uses similar sonar-based processing techniques and naturally occurring sound in the process slurry to measure entrained air levels and in some cases fluid composition. The result is a unique ability to measure the flow rate and entrained air level of most fluids – clean liquids, high solids content slurries, pastes, and liquids and slurries with entrained air. Also to be presented is the application of this array-based technology platform in a variety of hydrotransport and minerals beneficiation applications. Examples of these situations include volume flow measurements in tailings lines, thickener discharge, high solids contents pipelines, slurry lines with magnetite and other magnetic ore, slurry lines with abrasive or corrosive materials, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>lines,</b> and slurry and non-slurry lines exhibiting scale buildup. The operational advantages and value of these measurements, even in the presence of scale buildup, will be discussed.
