Richard Roeper gave the film a C+, saying [...] "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." [...] Stephen Whitty of Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said [...] "The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote [...] "Both the {{originality}} and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said [...] "This {{is not a bad}} movie, and to small children <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good one, but it's closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series." [...] Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least show a little effort, guys." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1953 it was {{announced}} that the fort was to be available on a long lease, and a 99-year lease on the fort was bought by The Honourable Gerald Lascelles in 1955. Lascelles was the son of Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood and Mary, Princess Royal, the only daughter of King George V and Mary of Teck. Lascelles was a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. He lived at the fort with his wife, Angela, and their son, Henry. Lascelles described the house as 'falling to pieces' {{at the beginning of his}} occupancy, and refurbished the fort, removing most traces of Edward's renovations in the process, except for the swimming pool and the battlements walk. The 30–40 rooms of the fort were reduced by the Lascelles to the [...] "equivalent of an eight-bedroom house, including quarters for three or four staff. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> manageable home". Angela Lascelles remained dedicated to improving and renovating the house and maintaining the estate. The Lascelles's restoration of the fort was undertaken by the designer Stanley Peters who took three years to return it to its 18th-century state; Peters faced difficulties in removing offices added when Edward became king. A mural added by Peters in the drawing-room, and painted by Oliver Carson, depicted Peters in an incidental role, portrayed in 18th-century clothes chasing butterflies. The Lascelles later claimed the credit for Peters's designs and his career suffered irreparable damage as a result.|$|E

2500|$|The road to {{the caves}} {{originally}} went via , which meant that travellers from the south {{had to take a}} long, roundabout route of about [...] from Katoomba to Oberon, and, from there, to Tarana. In the mid-1880s, hotel keepers in Katoomba wanted to improve business by constructing a {{road to the}} Caves from their town, but the steep, rough ground between the caves and town was a major obstacle, and several attempts failed. However, representations were made to the Premier by Peter Fitzpatrick of Burragorang, who was connected to some mining operations near Katoomba. In April 1884, William Marshall Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks for the State Government, was assigned the job, and worked out a horse-and-carriage track in a 10-day trek from Katoomba to the Caves. The route was, he remarked, 26.5 miles from the Western Hotel in Katoomba. [...] "... Anyone accustomed to walking can do it comfortably in 12 hours... when the proposed horse track is completed, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> enjoyable ride of five hours." [...] It became known as the Six Foot Track.|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I {{think that one of the}} most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E
