5|$|SAS has product {{sets for}} {{specific}} industries, such as government, retail, telecommunications and aerospace and for marketing optimization or <b>high-performance</b> computing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>High-Performance</b> Materials Institute (HPMI) is a {{multidisciplinary}} research institute at Florida State University. Its {{mission is to}} strive to recruit, develop and retain top quality faculty and staff who will develop HPMI into a leader of excellence for research and education {{in the field of}} advanced materials. Currently, HPMI is involved in four primary technology areas: <b>High-Performance</b> Composite and Nanomaterials, Structural Health Monitoring, Multifunctional Nanomaterials Advanced Manufacturing and Process Modeling.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) {{was formed}} in {{partnership}} with Tom Walkinshaw, who primarily manufactured modified, <b>high-performance</b> Commodore variants. To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the HSV Dealer Team into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of Toll HSV Dealer Team.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{compounds}} {{are used}} {{as a catalyst for}} ethylene polymerization. As a metal, yttrium is used on the electrodes of some <b>high-performance</b> spark plugs. Yttrium is used in gas mantles for propane lanterns as a replacement for thorium, which is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for <b>high-performance</b> communication, {{but the idea that}} it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Certain <b>high-performance</b> {{applications}} involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) {{where the}} speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors. Regeneration can occur only in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-EMF and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.|$|E
5|$|Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is a {{magnetic}} compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization, {{made it a}} compound superior to the γ-Fe2O3. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in <b>high-performance</b> audio tape and standard audio cassettes. Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates are added to drilling muds.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union {{pioneered the}} use of {{titanium}} in military and submarine applications (Alfa class and Mike class) as part of programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early 1950s, titanium came into use extensively in military aviation, particularly in <b>high-performance</b> jets, starting with aircraft such as the F-100 Super Sabre and Lockheed A-12 and SR-71.|$|E
5|$|Itanium {{is aimed}} at the {{enterprise}} server and <b>high-performance</b> computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle's and Fujitsu's SPARC processors and IBM's POWER microprocessors. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designed}} as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it. Development was then {{taken up by the}} U.S. Army for a tactical combat aircraft requirement, a sort of <b>high-performance</b> helicopter. In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E
5|$|Some {{items of}} sports equipment, which rely on <b>high-performance</b> materials, {{have been made}} with scandium-aluminium alloys, {{including}} baseball bats and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium. The American firearm manufacturing company Smith & Wesson produces semi-automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.|$|E
5|$|Specialized {{applications}} include use in laboratories as containment for high-pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), <b>high-performance</b> bearings, {{and limited}} use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{being made in}} the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are becoming feasible. The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine, <b>high-performance,</b> {{supersonic}} interceptor {{prototype for}} a United States Air Force (USAF) series of lightweight and simple fighters. Only two aircraft were built; one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic {{research and the}} other served as an armament testbed, both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104s were forerunners of over 2,500 production Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} <b>high-performance</b> motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These had been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in <b>high-performance</b> spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} flux {{for welding}} or soldering, {{metallic}} lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities. Alloys of the metal with aluminium, cadmium, copper and manganese are used to make <b>high-performance</b> aircraft parts (see also Lithium-aluminium alloys).|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized <b>high-performance</b> network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as <b>high-performance</b> rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to {{describe}} inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the high-speed rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E
5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and <b>high-performance</b> machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in <b>high-performance</b> computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E
5|$|Production {{models in}} {{development}} have included convertibles, crossovers, and dedicated hybrids. Under the F marque, Lexus plans to produce <b>high-performance</b> vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA. Lexus officials have also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms. The LS uses a dedicated platform, while the entry-level Lexus ES had {{been criticized for}} being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation, in both styling and powertrain design. The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a <b>high-performance</b> V8 {{version of}} the British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, {{designed}} in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E
5|$|UM {{maintains}} one of {{the largest}} centralized academic cyber infrastructures in the country with numerous assets. The Center for Computational Science High Performance Computing group has been in continuous operation since 2007. Over that time the core has grown from a zero HPC cyberinfrastructure to a regional <b>high-performance</b> computing environment that currently supports more than 1,200 users, 220 TFlops of computational power, and more than 3 Petabytes of disk storage. The center's latest system acquisition, an IBM IDataPlex system, was ranked at number 389 on the November 2012 Top 500 Supercomputers.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{with the}} {{subsequent}} discontinuation of its Chevrolet platform mates, the HHR and the Cobalt, GM has {{withdrawn from the}} <b>high-performance,</b> low-cost sedan market completely. The Ion's most direct successor today is the Chevrolet Cruze, which {{does not have any}} <b>high-performance</b> engine options.|$|E
