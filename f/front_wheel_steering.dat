The car was less successful in 1977 however and the idea was dropped. Reasons given were that although Goodyear had manufactured special tyres for the car, the tyre company had failed to match the development work on them compared to the normal sized tyres used by other teams.

50|$|This is {{no longer}} a common configuration, but some brands of {{automobiles}} use such engines and it is a common configuration for smaller aircraft engines such as those made by Lycoming, Continental and Rotax. Although they are superior to straight fours in terms of secondary vibration, they have largely fallen out of favour for overhead cam design engines, for which an opposed-four cylinder layout would require twice as many camshafts as a straight-four while the crankshaft is as complex to manufacture. The low centre of gravity of the engine is an advantage. The shape of the engine suits it better for mid engine or rear engine designs. With a rear engine layout, it allows a low-tail body while in front engine designs the width of the engine often interferes with the maximum <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle. The latter problem has not stopped Subaru from using it in its all-wheel drive cars, where the difficulty of fitting the wide engine between the front wheels ahead of the front axle is compensated for by the ease of locating the transmission and four-wheel drive mechanisms behind the short length, between the front and rear axles.|$|E

50|$|Mr. Elliott’s first {{well-known}} invention was the non-turning {{front axle}} and self-equalizing brake system he incorporated on his four-wheel quadricycle {{when he discovered}} that the wheels on the bike squealed when turning. That is {{when he realized that}} you couldn’t just connect the front wheels of a normal pair of bicycles with a tie rod, that somehow the inside wheel must turn at a slower speed than the one on the outside if you were to prevent that squeal. With this in mind, Mr. Elliott went home and into his pantry that was between the kitchen and the dining room, there he fastened a piece of string between the inside surfaces of each door. Then, whether swung to the right or the left, the doors remained parallel and swung exactly the same. Next he shortened the string so that the doors were at an angle, their hinges being further apart than their front edges. Standing in the pantry he pushed the left hand door toward the kitchen and noted that only a small amount of movement in this direction produced considerably more movement to the right hand door. After again closing the doors he pushed the right hand door a small distance into the dining room and noticed that the kitchen door opened again wider than it had before. It didn’t take long for him to convert that principle to his quadricycle. It took an imaginative bicycle manufacturer {{to come up with the}} steering solution, so simple, that it has remained to this day the basic system of <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> implemented in automobiles worldwide.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an active safety {{system for a}} wheeled armored vehicle to encounter {{the effect of the}} firing force. The firing force which acts as an external disturbance causes unwanted yaw moment occurred at the center of gravity of the wheeled armored vehicle. This effect causes the wheeled armored vehicle lose its handling stability and the traveling path after the firing condition. In order to overcome the stability problem, a Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> system is proposed in this study. This system is developed based on two established systems, namely, Firing-On-the-Move and Active <b>Front</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> systems. The proposed system is designed to improve the handling and directional stability performances of the armored vehicle while fires in dynamic condition. Four types of control strategies are designed and investigated in this study to identify the most optimum control strategy as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> system using optimization tool, genetic algorithm. The control strategies for the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> are evaluated using various types of vehicle speeds and firing angle in order to obtain an appropriate control structure as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active <b>Front</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> system for the wheeled armored vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Issues of {{stability}} and bifurcation phenomena in ve-hicle lateral dynamics are presented. Based on the assumption of constant driving speed, a second-order nonlinear lateral dynamics model is obtained. Local stability and existence conditions for saddle-node bifurcation appearing in vehicle dynamics with re-spect to the variations in <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle are then derived via system linearization and local bifurcation analysis. Bifurcation phenomena occurring in vehicle lateral dynamics might result in spin and/or system instability. A perturbation method is employed to solve for an approximation of system equi-librium near the zero value of the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle, which reveals the relationship between sideslip angle and the applied front wheel angle. Numerical simulations from an example model demonstrate the theoretical results. Index Terms—Bifurcation analysis, perturbation method, vehicle’s lateral dynamics. I...|$|E

50|$|The {{steering}} ratio is {{the ratio of}} the number of degrees of turn of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to the number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta tricycles and bicycles, the {{steering ratio}} is always 1:1, because the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is fixed to the <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> A <b>steering</b> ratio of x:y means that a turn of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> 360 degrees, causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.|$|R

The control concept presented is composed of three feedback loops: Continuous operation steering control, emergency steering control and emergency braking control.

Thereby, the vehicle's roll damping is robustly improved {{for a wide range}} of speed and height of the center of gravity. The latter may change for example with a truck from ride to ride.
