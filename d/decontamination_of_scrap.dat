40|$|Metal objects {{resulting}} from ER activities were decontaminated using electrolytic methods. The project involved about 500 kg of ballistic test projectiles, 23 augers and drill heads, and 50 pieces of shrapnel containing lead. All objects were free-released and either reclaimed as scrap metal or reused. Electrolytic decontamination was {{proven to be}} an effective method to decontaminate metal waste objects to free-release standards. A cost analysis showed the process to be economical, especially when applied to decontamination of mixed waste, TRU waste, or when the recovered materials could be reused or recycled. The cost of <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrap</b> iron is approximately equal to the cost of its land disposal as low level waste...|$|E

Upon the completion of the literature search and the review of numerous references, it was concluded that there were applications of this technique that were appropriate for the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> some types of RSM, especially when the desired product is a pure elemental metal of high purity. It was also concluded that this technique was not well-suited for the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> RSM stainless steels and other alloys, when it was desired that the metallurgical characteristics of the alloy be present in the decontaminated product...|$|R
40|$|Melt <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> {{radioactive}} <b>scrap</b> metal could {{convert a}} disposal liability into a final product {{that would reduce}} the total volume of material necessary for burial and save substantial material costs. The goal of this project is to optimize a melt decontamination process through {{a basic understanding of}} the factors which govern the partitioning of various radionuclides between metal, slag, and gas phases. Radionuclides which are captured by a slag phase may be stabilized by promoting the formation of synthetic minerals within a leach resistant matrix. The main focus of this project is the application of electroslag remelting (ESR) toward cleanup of surface contaminated stainless steels. This report summarizes work accomplished after 9 -months of a 3 -year project. Activities are ongoing at Sandia National Laboratories and at Boston University. ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{operations}} {{have resulted in}} the accumulation of large quantities of contaminated metallic waste which are stored at various DOE, DOD, and commercial sites under the control of DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This waste will accumulate at an increasing rate as commercial nuclear reactors built in the 1950 s reach the end of their projected lives, as existing nuclear powered ships become obsolete or unneeded, and as various weapons plants and fuel processing facilities, such as the gaseous diffusion plants, are dismantled, repaired, or modernized. For example, recent estimates <b>of</b> available Radioactive <b>Scrap</b> Metal (RSM) in the DOE Nuclear Weapons Complex have suggested that as much as 700, 000 tons of contaminated 304 L stainless steel exist in the gaseous diffusion plants alone. Other high-value metals available in the DOE complex include copper, nickel, and zirconium. Melt processing for the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> radioactive <b>scrap</b> metal {{has been the subject of}} much research. A major driving force for this research has been the possibility of reapplication of RSM, which is often very high-grade material containing large quantities of strategic elements. To date, several different single and multi-step melting processes have been proposed and evaluated for use as decontamination or recycling strategies. Each process offers a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately, no single melt processing scheme is optimum for all applications since processes must be evaluated based on the characteristics of the input feed stream and the desired output. This paper describes various melt decontamination processes and briefly reviews their application in developmental studies, full scale technical demonstrations, and industrial operations...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{faces the}} task of {{decommissioning}} much of the vast US weapons complex. One challenge of this effort includes the disposition of large amounts <b>of</b> radioactively contaminated <b>scrap</b> metal (RSM) including {{but not limited to}} steel, nickel, copper, and aluminum. The <b>decontamination</b> and recycling <b>of</b> RSM has become a key element in the DOE's strategy for cleanup of contaminated sites and facilities. Recycling helps to offset the cost of decommissioning and saves valuable space in the waste disposal facilities. It also reduces the amount of environmental effects associated with mining new metals. Work on this project is geared toward finding decontamination and/or recycling alternatives for the RSM contained in the decommissioned gaseous diffusion plants including approximately 40, 000 tons of nickel. The nickel is contaminated with Technetium- 99, and is difficult to remove using traditional decontamination technologies. The project, titled ``Advanced Technologies for <b>Decontamination</b> and Conversion <b>of</b> <b>Scrap</b> Metal'' was proposed as a four phase project. Phase 1 and 2 are complete and Phase 3 will complete May 31, 1999. Stainless steel made from contaminated nickel barrier was successfully produced in Phase 1. An economic evaluation was performed and a market study of potential products from the recycled metal was completed. Inducto-slag refining, after extensive testing, was eliminated as an alternative to remove technetium contamination from nickel. Phase 2 included successful lab scale and pilot scale demonstrations of electrorefining to separate technetium from nickel. This effort included a survey of available technologies to detect technetium in volumetrically contaminated metals. A new process to make sanitary drums from RSM was developed and implemented. Phase 3 included a full scale demonstration of electrorefining, an evaluation of electro-refining alternatives including direct dissolution, melting of nickel into anodes, a laser cutting demonstration, an investigation of commercial markets for RSM, and refinement of methods to quantify isotopic elements...|$|R

40|$|Background and Methods. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to find out}} whether translocation of bacteria to the abdominal cavity and endotoxemia in rats with sterile peritonitis could be prevented by selective <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the digestive tract. Sterile peritonitis was caused by the intraperitoneal injection of either 100, 150, 200, or 300 mg of zymosan suspended in paraffin. Results: The frequency of infection of the abdominal cavity depended on the dose of zymosan given, ranging from 20 % in rats receiving 100 mg to 89 % in rats receiving 300 mg of zymosan. In rats not receiving antibiotics for selective <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the digestive tract (the control group), Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the digestive tract in all rats, and Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the abdominal cavity in ten of 19 rats. In rats receiving antibioties for selective <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the digestive tract, Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the digestive tract in none of the 14 rats, and likewise, Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the abdominal cavity in none of the 14 rats (p <. 005). Moreover, in rats receiving antibiotics for selective <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the digestive tract, endotoxin levels in feces and plasma were significantly lower, as compared with rats not receiving antibiotics for selective <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the digestive tract. Conclusion: Selective <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the digestive tract prevents translocation of Gram-negative bacilli to the abdominal cavity, and endotoxemia and mortality in rats with sterile peritonitis...|$|R

30|$|From a {{practical}} viewpoint, {{it is considered}} that OC cannot sufficiently exhibit its adsorption ability for cesium ions in soil due to the metal ions it contains, especially potassium ions.

30|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment for}} peri-implantitis includes {{the elimination of}} etiologic factors and the mechanical removal of calculus, cement, and plaque followed by subgingival irrigation with tetracycline and chlorhexidine base mouthwash. Lang et al. first described a treatment protocol for peri-implantitis including mechanical cleaning, <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the implant surface, antibiotic regimen, and regenerative surgery (if required) in 1997 [10]. However, literate indicates {{that the use of}} air-powder abrasive (APA) treatment for the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the implant surface remains controversial. Although some reports advocate that the in vivo usage of APA systems pose a potential risk of emphysema and may have limited clinical applications [11, 12], some other studies, such as the study reported by Duarte et al. found that APA is more effective in the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> dental implants than lasers, metal curettes, and plastic curettes [13]. On the other hand, Renvert et al. compared the use of APA and Er:YAG laser application on dental implant surfaces and found that the two methods produced similar outcomes with regards to the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> implant surfaces. In the present study, we used a combination of APA and citric acid for the <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the surfaces of the retrieved implants, mainly because both methods are easily available, have minimal cost, and are easy to use when compared to laser treatment [14].|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Peri-implantitis is an {{inflammatory}} lesion of peri-implant tissues. Eradication of the causative bacteria and <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> the implant surface {{is essential in}} achieving predictable and stabile clinical results. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is non-invasive adjuvant therapeutic method to surgery {{in the treatment of}} bacterial infection. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate early clinical and microbiological outcomes of periimplantitis after surgical therapy with adjuvant PDT. Methods. Fifty-two diagnosed peri-implantitis sites were divided into two groups. PDT was used for <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> implant surface in the study group; in the control group, chlorhexidine gel (CHX) followed by saline irrigation was applied. Several clinical parameters were recorded before the treatment (baseline values) and three months after surgical treatment. Samples for microbiological identification were collected before therapy, during the surgical therapy (before and after <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> implant surface), and three months thereafter, and analyzed with identification systems using biochemical analysis. Results. The use of PDT resulted in significant decrease of bleeding on probing in comparison to CHX (p < 0. 001). It showed significant <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> implant surfaces with complete elimination of anaerobic bacteria immediately after surgical procedure and three months later. Conclusion. The results indicate that PDT can be used as an adjuvant therapy to surgery for <b>decontamination</b> <b>of</b> implant surface and surrounding peri-implant tissues within the treatment of peri-implantitis.
