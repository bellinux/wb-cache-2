In this study, we use high-frequency ultrasound integrated backscatter to assess liver damage in experimental models of liver ischemia. Ultimately, {{our goal is to}} predict organ suitability for transplantation using high-frequency imaging and spectral analysis techniques. To examine the effects of liver ischemia at different temperatures, livers from Wistar rats were surgically excised, immersed in phosphate buffer saline and stored at 4 and 20 ◦C for 24 h. To mimic organ preservation, livers were excised, flushed with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and stored at 4 ◦C for 24 h. Preservation injury was simulated by either not flushing livers with UW solution or, before scanning, allowing livers to reach room temperature. Ultrasound images and corresponding radiofrequency data were collected over the ischemi...|$|E

Blood transfusion services (BTS) have the responsibility to collect blood only from donors who are at low risk for any infection that could be transmitted through transfusion and who are unlikely to jeopardize their own health by blood donation. A rigorous process to assess the suitability of prospective donors is therefore essential to protect the safety and sufficiency of the blood supply, and safeguard the health of recipients of transfusion and blood donors themselves, while ensuring that suitable donors are not deferred unnecessarily. These World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, Blood donor selection: {{guidelines on}} assessing donor suitability for blood donation {{have been developed to}} assist blood transfusion services in countries that are establishing or strengthening national systems for the selection of blood donors 1. They are designed for use by policy makers in national blood programmes in ministries of health, national advisory bodies such as national blood commissions or councils, and blood transfusion services. WHO guidance on criteria for the selection of blood donors was first published in the distance learning materials, Safe Blood and Blood Products, Module 1 : Safe Blood Donation in 1994. These earlier recommendations were developed on the basis of international best practice but did not have a clear evidence base. In 2009, the WHO Blood Transfusion Safety programme (WHO/BTS) convened a guideline development group (GDG) to prepare evidence-based recommendations on criteria for assessing the suitability of blood donors. The GDG also recognized the need to provide guidance on establishing national systems for blood donor selection. WHO also acknowledges with thanks the technical collaboration and financial contribution of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for this project.

40|$|Biobanks are an {{important}} tool for clinical and research studies conducted on biomarkers of genetic therapy, diagnostic tests and new drugs; however, most biobanks remain incomplete and are often used without uniform standards and criteria. There is also a a lack of high-quality biological samples and many bioethical problems are often overlooked. Currently, Kazakhstan has no standard requirements and protocols for biomedical organizations. However,. an analysis of published data shows that possibly hundreds of samples are analyzed. Therefore, an establishment of biobank with standardized requirements could create better quality research. The National Center for Biotechnology has already started a biobank with more than 1, 500 blood samples, with {{the ultimate goal of}} creating a biobank including around 10, 000 blood samples of healthy volunteers, the same number of samples obtained from individuals with cardiovascular and endocrine diseases with samples stored under special conditions.

40|$|Analyses of {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} cell and endothelial cell function through tissue culture techniques are often employed {{to investigate the}} underlying mechanisms regulating cardiovascular disease. As diseases such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease increase a patient's risk of cardiovascular disease, the development of methods for examining {{the effects of these}} diseases on vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells is needed. Commercial sources of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells generally provide minimal donor information and are in limited supply. This study was designed to determine if vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells could be isolated from human internal mammary arteries obtained from donors undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. As coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a commonly performed procedure, this method would provide a new source for these cells that when combined with the <b>donor's</b> <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> will greatly enhance our studies of the effects of complicating diseases on vascular biology. Internal mammary artery tissue was obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Through a simple method employing two separate tissue digestions, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were isolated and characterized. The isolated vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells exhibited the expected morphology and were able to be passaged for further analysis. The vascular smooth muscle cells exhibited positive staining for α-smooth muscle actin and the endothelial cells exhibited positive staining for CD 31. The overall purity of the isolations was > 95 %. This method allows for the isolation of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells from internal mammary arteries, providing a new tool for investigations into the interplay of vascular diseases and complicating diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Primary care {{physicians}} (PCP) might {{play an important}} role in the acceptance of organ donation (OD) in the population. This would require both a positive attitude and a good basic knowledge about the organ donation and transplantation (ODT) process. Studies on this subject are very limited however. The objectives of this study are to determine the knowledge and attitude of the PCP towards OD in Flanders. Methods. Three-hundred twenty-seven Flemish PCPs completed an electronic questionnaire, comprising 6 sections: demographic factors, practical experience, knowledge, education, attitude and potential role in the ODT process. Results. Eighty-seven percent of the Flemish PCP agree with the implementation of heart-beating organ donation. Ninety-four percent would agree to donate the organs of their own child. 80 % know that even without explicit consent the prelevation of the organs and tissues of each potential Belgian donor will take place. Although they are aware of the current legislation, their knowledge regarding donor criteria showed significant gaps. A minority of the PCP's know that donors can be little brain-dead children (53 %) or elderly above 70 years (45 %). Only 61 % of PCPs know that brain dead is associated with irreversible damage to the brain and only 28 % know that more than one physician is involved in making the diagnosis. A majority (91 %) is willing to play a role in the ODT process. But about two-thirds (61 %) of them doubt their ability to answer questions of patients on this subject. 82. 5 % of this group would find it useful to participate in a specific training. When they are offered different choices to play a role in the process, the most accepted (84 %) one is informing the transplant centre about the <b>donor's</b> <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> and risk behavior. Conclusions. The Flemish PCP has a positive attitude towards ODT. He is willing to play a role in the ODT process. However, our study clearly documents deficits in the knowledge about brain death and the need for postgraduate training in the field of ODT. Correcting these deficits may be an important factor in improving the acceptance of organ donation...|$|R

The workshop offers an opportunity to discuss and evaluate approaches taken to challenging situations regarding donor selection, it promotes consensus development in deciding tissue donor acceptability when donor health issues are not addressed in standards and regulations, and serves to strengthen the professional tissue banking networks across Europe and beyond. This report reflects some of the discussion at the workshop during the annual congress in Vienna in 2012. The cases presented dealt with problems encountered by tissue bank facilities concerning idiopathic thrombocytopenia and auto-immune disorders, hemodilution and blood sample identification, premalignant and malignant lesions, and Huntington's disease. The discussions during the workshop demonstrate that the implications on the safety of tissue transplantation of various tissue donor illnesses, physical findings and behaviours, and the preventive measures taken by tissue facilities, {{may not always be}} agreed by tissue facility medical directors and other professionals. Moreover, they reveal that operating procedures, regulations and standards cannot comprehensively cover all tissue <b>donor</b> findings, <b>medical</b> <b>histories</b> and circumstances surrounding the cause of death.

40|$|The European Association of Tissue Banks (EATB) donor case {{workshop}} is a forum held {{within the}} program of the EATB annual congress. The workshop offers an opportunity to discuss and evaluate possible approaches taken to challenging situations regarding donor selection. Donor case workshops actively engage participants with diverging background and experience in an informal, secure and enjoyable setting. The resulting discussion with peers promotes consensus development in deciding tissue donor acceptability, especially when donor health issues are not conclusively addressed in standards and regulations. Finally the workshop serves to strengthen the professional tissue banking networks across Europe and beyond. This report reflects some of the discussion at the workshop during the annual congress in Lund, Sweden, in 2014. The cases presented demonstrate that the implications of various donor illnesses, physical findings and behaviours on the safety of tissue transplantation, may be interpreted {{in a different way}} by medical directors and other professionals of different tissue facilities. This will also result in diverging preventive measures and decisions taken by the tissue facilities. Some of the donor cases illustrate varied responses from participants and demonstrate that operating procedures, regulations and standards cannot comprehensively cover all tissue <b>donor</b> illnesses, <b>medical</b> <b>histories</b> and circumstances surrounding the cause of death. For many of the issues raised, {{there is a lack of}} published scientific evidence. In those cases, tissue bank medical director judgement is critical to guarantee transplantation safety. This judgement should be based on a proper and documented risk assessment case by case. Conditions or parameters taken into account for risk assessment are amongst others, the type of tissue, the type of processing, the characteristics of the final product, and the availability of an adequate sterilisation methodology. By publishing these difficult donor suitability cases, and the resulting discussions, we provide information for future similar cases and we identify needs for future literature review and scientific research. In this way the donor case workshops play a role in optimizing the quality and security of tissue donation...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{demand for}} transplantable organs exceeds donor organ supply. Transplantation of organs from donors {{with a history}} of {{malignancy}} remains controversial and the transmission of cancer in liver transplant recipients has not been sufficiently examined. Methods. From 2002 until 2017, 83 livers from donors {{with a history of}} malignancy were transplanted at the University Hospital Essen, Germany. Donor and recipient data, type of malignancy, tumor-free interval at organ procurement, and follow-up data were analyzed. Results. Nine different tumor sites (central nervous system [n = 27], genitourinary [n = 24], breast [n = 10], skin [n = 8], colorectal [n = 5], lung [n = 3], hemato-oncological [n = 3], thyroid [n = 2], and larynx [n = 1]) were detected in 83 donors. The majority (58 %) of donors had tumor-free intervals of less than 5 years versus 19 % of 6 to 10 years versus 23 % over 10 years. The risk of tumor transmission from donors was assessed as low in 44 (53 %), intermediate in 28 (34 %), and high in 11 (13 %) cases. During median follow-up of 19. 9 (0 - 155) months, none of the recipients developed donor-transmitted malignancy. Conclusions. Liver transplantation with organs from <b>donors</b> with a <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> of malignancy is feasible, and the risk of donor-transmitted malignancy appears to be low in this single-center analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Medical</b> <b>history</b> taking {{as well as}} Chlamydia {{antibody}} titre (CAT) testing are currently used {{in the selection of}} patients for diagnostic laparoscopy with tubal patency testing. Most research has focused on the predictive value of CAT in isolation from <b>medical</b> <b>history.</b> We assessed therefore whether the combination of <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> and CAT improves the efficiency of selecting patients for laparoscopy as compared to the use of either <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> or CAT. METHODS: Data of 207 consecutive subfertile women were used to create multivariable logistic regression models for the prediction of tubal disease as diagnosed by diagnostic laparoscopy. RESULTS: The model with data of <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> only had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 74). Addition of CAT increased the AUC to 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 78) (P = 0. 065). CAT was positive in 40 women and showed a sensitivity of 0. 37 (95 % CI 0. 26 - 0. 49) for a specificity of 0. 88 (95 % CI 0. 82 - 0. 93). In CAT positive women, a blank <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> did not decrease the probability of tubal disease. Of the 167 women tested CAT negative, 23 (14 %) still had a high probability of disease due to their <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> and 11 of them (48 %) showed tubal abnormalities on diagnostic laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: CAT testing adds valuable information to a woman's risk profile based on her <b>medical</b> <b>history.</b> The combination of <b>medical</b> <b>history</b> taking and CAT testing has a better yield for diagnosing tubal disease than either of these alon...|$|R
