Each of three groups had 25 specimens. Brass rods of uniform length of 40 mm and diameter of 8 mm were used to prepare the moulds.

40|$|Thermal laser polymer bonding is a {{non-contact}} {{process for}} the joining of polymer laminates using thermally <b>activated</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Conventional, contact based bonding techniques suffer from mechanical wear, geometric inflexibility and poor energy efficiency. The application of lasers offers the potential for highly localized delivery of energy and increased process flexibility whilst achieving controlled and repeatable bonding of polymer laminates in a contact free process. Unlike previously reported techniques, here it is reported that laser based non-contact bonding is both viable and highly desirable due to the increased levels of control it affords the user.

40|$|Abstract: There is no {{treatment}} for the fibrosis observed in scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, SSc). Although genome-wide expression profiling has suggested that differences in gene expression patters between non-lesional and lesional skin are minimal, phenotypically these areas of tissue are quite different. In fact, lesional areas of scleroderma patients can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} a differentiated form of fibroblast, termed the myofibroblast. This cell type expresses the highly contractile protein smooth muscle actin (SMA). Fibroblasts isolated from SSc lesions excessively synthesize, adhere to and contract extracellular matrix (ECM) and display <b>activated</b> <b>adhesive</b> signaling pathways. Strategies aimed at blocking myofibroblast differentiation, persistence and activity are therefore likely to be useful in alleviating the fibrosis in scleroderma...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} high {{hydrostatic}} pressure (HHP) and nisin was studied on micro-organisms in minced chicken and beef meat. Pressure {{in the range}} of 0 - 800 MPa and nisin (670 IU g- 1) were applied for vacuum packed minced meat. In chicken meat the total viable cell count decreased by 3 log cycles as an effect of HHP at 300 MPa and by 5 log cycles in combination with nisin. The D value is 35 - 39 MPa for pseudomonads in minced chicken meat. In case of inoculation with L. monocytogenes, the cell count in beef meat was reduced only by pressure higher than 200 MPa (“shoulder”) with a characteristic value of D= 37 - 38 MPa. B. cereus spores, both dormant and <b>heat</b> <b>activated,</b> were very resistant (D= 800 MPa) in beef.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of using a 10. 6 μm CO 2 marking laser to activate a thermally sensitive adhesive coating on {{linear low density polyethylene}} film for the purpose of bonding the film to polypropylene substrate. A potential technical hurdle in the form bubbling has been witnessed and described. Bubbling prevented contact between the two laminates and impinged upon the viability of the bonds produced; film handling improvement is recommended as a solution. The Gaussian profile of the laser in concert with the circular laser spot shape and the traverse strategy of the scans used caused the centre of the bond to be over irradiated whilst the edge was under-irradiated. This had several affects: it limited the area over which an effective bond was achieved; caused delamination of the film at the track edges and locally modified the polypropylene structure. A highly consistent and repeatable mean peel resistance force of 1. 09 N was achieved using the laser <b>activated</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding technique described. Little bond strength dependency upon laser irradiance was observed, which allied with the results of other work, leads to the proposal that the adhesive has a very broad laser irradiance operating range...|$|R
