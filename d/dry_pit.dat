Anti-HAV IgM were detected in 21 out of 202 sera (10. 4 %), whereas 201 sera (99. 5 %) had anti-HAV IgG. The first age attack was in the class-age 0 - 9 years with 64. 7 % of anti-HAV IgM positive sera. Among 202 patients, anti-hepatitis E IgG (sample/over cut off > 1. 0) was identified in 90 patients (44. 5 %). The anti-HEV seropositivity ranged from 17. 6 % to 60. 0 % in the different age groups, with the highest level in the class-age 20 29 years. Anti-hepatitis E IgM were identified in 49 patients with the first age attack in the class-age 10 - 19 years (39. 4 %). HAV RNA was identified by nested PCR in 7 samples out of 15, whereas HEV RNA was present in 4 out of 75 stool samples. Direct DNA sequence of the latter PCR products confirmed {{the presence of the}} HEV genome; comparison of the sequences of the isolates from Egypt with those in data banks revealed the highest homology to the Burma strain. Our data confirm that HAV and HEV are common causes of acute sporadic hepatitis in Alexandria but with different peak age positivity. Occasionally, but not infrequently, dual infections (HAV-HEV and HEV-enteric viruses) were also found. The risk analysis indicates that patients living in rural areas are exposed to a higher risk of hepatitis E infection compared to the urban population, whereas the presence of anti-HEV IgG was significantly associated with consumption of common village water and use of indoor <b>dry</b> <b>pit</b> and oral therapy for schistosomiasis...|$|E

40|$|Some native {{subsistence}} {{farmers in}} South Africa store maize (Zea mays L.) cobs over a fireplace and subject the seeds to smoke and heat. Taro (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott.) propagules are maintained in <b>dry</b> <b>pits</b> for one month, in layers separated by grass straw, and water is prevented from contacting them. These {{methods have been}} used together with others to maintain landraces for centuries, but they have largely been abandoned with no modern technology replacements. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of the maize and taro storage methods on the quality of planting material. Experiments were conducted on three subsistence farms located in KwaZulu-Natal, and at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Two maize landraces, yellow and white, were subjected to the smoke-over-fire storage method for five months during the normal off-season period for maize production in the location. Control maize seeds were stored in unsealed containers away from fire and smoke. Taro propagules of different sizes (80 − 100 g corm− 1, 40 − 60 g corm− 1 and 20 − 30 g corm− 1) were compared for storability in <b>dry</b> <b>pits,</b> in layers separated by grass straw, for one month. Subsequently, sprouted corms were stored in dry conditions to allow shoot development. During maize seed storage, water content was determined monthly. Maize seed quality was determined by viability, germination and seedling vigour. Sprouting and rooting during taro pit storage, and main shoot development during air storage were used to determine taro propagule performance in storage. Seeds that were stored over fire and smoke showed higher germination and vigour that non-smoked seed. Sprouting and shooting of taro propagules were better in large propagules and the optimum storage depth was 35 cm to 40 cm. α-amylase activity increased during pit storage and declined to almost the pre-storage levels during shoot growth period outside the pits, in all corm sizes. It is concluded that smoke and heat storage improve maize seed quality and pit storage enhances taro propagules by inducing sprouting. Data from this study can be used to investigate the physiological and biochemical basis of seed and propagule quality enhancement, and possibly contribute to technological inventions that are based on indigenous knowledge systems...|$|R

40|$|Wastewater lift {{stations}} are facilities designed to move wastewater from lower to higher elevation through pipes. Key elements of lift stations include a wastewater receiving well (wet-well), often {{equipped with a}} screen or grinding to remove coarse materials; pumps and piping with associated valves; motors; a power supply system; an equipment control and alarm system; and an odor control system and ventilation system. Lift station equipment and systems are often installed in an enclosed structure. They can be constructed on-site (custom-designed) or prefabricated. Lift station capacities range from 76 liters per minute (20 gallons per minute) to more than 378, 500 liters per minute (100, 000 gallons per minute). Pre-fabricated lift stations generally have capacities of up to 38, 000 liters per minute (10, 000 gallons per minute). Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in lift stations. A trapped air column, or bubbler system, that senses pressure and level is commonly used for pump station control. Other control alternatives include electrodes placed at cut-off levels, floats, mechanical clutches, and floating mercury switches. A more sophisticated control operation {{involves the use of}} variable speed drives. Lift {{stations are}} typically provided with equipment for easy pump removal. Floor access hatches or openings above the pump room and an overhead monorail beam, bridge crane, or portable hoist are commonly used.

40|$|In this study, {{the odor}} {{compounds}} emitted {{from the field}} workplaces at the Pohang steel complex were measured using analytical instruments and the olfactory method. In addition, the reduction of odor emissions by pyroligneous liquid was evaluated. The odor samples were obtained from slag pots and dry pits, which refrigerate hot slag, and the target compounds were hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and ammonia (NH₃). The levels of odor emissions varied with meteorological and operating conditions, but emissions from dry pits were always much higher than those from slag pots. As the concentration of pyroligneous liquid increased, the concentrations of H₂S and the ratios of dilution decreased. Together with this result and the guideline of odor emissions, the increase of pyroligneous liquid (more than 2. 5 times) in cooling water was suggested to reduce odor emissions. Actually, the reduced levels of H₂S at the slag pot and the <b>dry</b> <b>pit</b> were observed (70 and 94 %, respectively) after the increased amount of pyroligneous liquid. However, {{in order to determine}} the optimal amount of pyroligneous liquid for the economical and efficient removal of odor emissions, the system of cooling water has to be improved and more samples are required for a comprehensive analysis. 본 연구에서는 공기희석관능법과 기기분석법을 이용하여 포항철강공단의 야외 작업장에서 배출되는 악취를 측정하고, 목초액 농도의 변화에 따른 악취배출 저감효과를 확인하였다. 연구대상 시설은 고온의 슬래그를 냉각하는 slag와 dry pit였으며, 주요 악취물질인 황화수소(H₂S) 와 암모니아(NH₃) 를 분석하였다. 악취배출은 기상 및 작업조건에 따라서 많은 차이가 있었으며, slag pot보다는 dry pit에서 고농도의 황화수소가 배출되었다. 목초액 농도가 증가함에 따라 황화수소와 공기희석배수는 감소하므로 목초액의 악취저감 효과를 정량적으로 확인할 수 있었다. 이 결과와 악취배출 규제농도를 함께 고려하여, 목초액 투입량을 2. 5 배 이상 증가시킬 것을 제안하였다. 실제로 목초액 투입량을 증가시킨 이후에 악취배출 저감효과(slag pot: 74 %, dry pti: 94 %) 를 확인할 수 있었다. 보다 경제적이고 악취저감에 효율적인 목초액 투입량을 산정하기 위해서는, 냉각수 순환시스템을 개선하고 일정한 기상 및 작업조건 하에서 보다 많은 시료채취를 통한 종합적인 추가 연구가 요구된다. clos...|$|E
