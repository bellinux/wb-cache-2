50|$|The {{building}} {{is set in}} a large gravel parking area amongst farmland. The {{building is}} <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> on a timber frame with a corrugated iron roof and has a gabled protico over the main entrance.|$|E
50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded {{particle}} <b>boards</b> and cement <b>fibre.</b> Cement bonded particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> have cellulose <b>fibre,</b> {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle <b>boards</b> and cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards.</b> Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. <b>Fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R

50|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} thermal bridge effects is {{the installation of}} an insulation board (e.g. foam board EPS XPS, wood <b>fibre</b> <b>board,</b> etc.) over the exterior outside wall. Another method is using insulated lumber framing for a thermal break inside the wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} spark {{extinguishing}} systems {{goes back to}} the early seventies, when the Federal Anti-Pollution Law (BImSchG) of 1974 required the use of exhaust and dedusting systems in the wood-based material industry. For this purpose, operators of chipboard and <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> facilities were committed to comply with the administrative regulations called Technical Instructions on Air Quality.|$|E
50|$|In 1881 when Mousam Manufacturing Company {{purchased}} Leatheroid {{and moved}} its manufacturing equipment into nearby mill buildings adjacent {{to its own}} leatherboard mill in Kennebunk, Maine, it organized it as a separate company, the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company. Emery Andrews, S.B. Rogers, Stephen Moore, and Homer Rogers were board members and controlling stock holders in the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company {{as they were in}} Mousam Manufacturing Company. In 1891 the Mousam Manufacturing Company and the Leatheroid Manufacturing Company along with Harwood Manufacturing Company of Leominster, Massachusetts, the Towne Manufacturing Company of Boston, Massachusetts, and the Clegg and Fisher Mill at Lawrence, Massachusetts, were merged into a new company known as the Consolidated <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> and Leatheroid Company. This consolidation was known as the National <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> Company with Emery Andrews as president and the board of directors consisting of Charles H. Allen, Homer Rogers, J. A. Harwood, Stephen Moore, and W.C. Gogswell. In 1918 the National <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> Company changed its name to Rogers Fibre Company. The officers of Rogers Fibre Company in 1920 were Elliott Rogers, Pres., Kennebunk, Me.; Louis Rogers, V-P; E. W. Freeman, Clerk, Portland, Me.; L. B.Rogers, Treas. & Gen. Mgr.; E. O. Hallberg, Asst. Treas. Boston, Mass. In 1930 the Leatheroid business of Rogers Fibre Company and its equipment were sold to the Delaware Hard Fibre Company. All usable equipment was removed from the Leatheroid operations in the Island and Dirigo buildings at Kennebunk, thus bringing an end to Leatheroid production in Kennebunk, Maine.|$|E
40|$|The ceramisation of wood <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> is an {{efficient}} route to produce high strength, wear resistant and corrosion resistant construction elements with low density for applications up to elevated temperatures. Carbonisation and siliconizing {{are the basic}} processes of the ceramic conversion at high temperatures. Materials and technological details are discussed. The templates based on natural fibres enable a large variety of ceramic structures. The chances of using technical wood <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> are demonstrated. The properties of wood-based silicon carbide ceramics are comparable with commercial available SiSiC. Decisive technological and economic advantages are a low-cost shaping process and an effective net shape machining of carbon pre-forms. The efforts are obvious reducible for finishing ceramic components. The processing route offers new outlooks concerning large dimensioned and complex shaped ceramic components especially for unique copies and small series. The manu facturing of prototypes is demonstrated with focus on optical applications. Anticipated application fields are highlighted...|$|R
50|$|Earlier gas light {{pipes and}} {{fittings}} remain to {{the upper and lower}} rear verandahs. Original door and window joinery and hardware remain throughout the building. The building has timber floors throughout except for the upper verandahs which are now sheeted with a thick <b>fibre</b> cement <b>board.</b> <b>Fibre</b> cement sheeting encloses the bathrooms to the northwest and the enclosed services corridor of the ground floor rear verandah.|$|R
50|$|As longboard design progressed, lighter {{balsa wood}} and glass <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> with {{directional}} fins (or skegs) allowed greater freedom of movement, whilst allowing better riders to adopt more exaggerated stances. Arms {{raised in the}} air, hands clasped behind head, signify control and balance and this became a hallmark move. Combined with the difficult 'Hang Five' and Hang Ten moves, when a rider positions at the front (or nose) of a board, a soul arch becomes a significantly more difficult trick, requiring a considerable level of skill and balance.|$|R
50|$|A {{pulp mill}} is a {{manufacturing}} facility that converts wood chips or other plant fibre source into a thick <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> {{which can be}} shipped to a paper mill for further processing. Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.|$|E

50|$|As a sawmill {{originally}} {{established to}} produce timber for fruit packing cases, {{it is also}} important in demonstrating the evolution of the State's fruit growing industry. At the time, the North Coast was among the most productive fruit growing regions in the State. It is also indicative of the former use of timber as a material for packing cases. By the 1950s, timber was being superseded by corrugated <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> as the preferred material for packaging.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaminated boards were {{produced}} by laminating banana stem <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> with banana leaf tapes. Various laminated boards {{were created by}} changing the number of layers of leaf tapes used. The tensile strength, elongation at break, flexural modulus and impact strength of the laminated boards increased with increasing number of layers of the leaf tapes. The elastic modulus of the laminated boards, however, showed the opposite trend. The orientation of fibre in the leaf tapes has little effect on impact strength but other properties studied showed that the properties measured along the fibre orientation were higher than that in the perpendicular direction...|$|R
50|$|Uses of kenaf fibre include {{engineered}} wood, insulation, clothing-grade cloth, soil-less potting mixes, animal bedding, packing material, {{and material}} that absorbs oil and liquids. It is also useful as cut bast fibre for blending with resins for plastic composites, as a drilling fluid loss preventative for oil drilling muds, for a seeded hydromulch for erosion control. Kenaf {{can be made}} into various types of environmental mats, such as seeded grass mats for instant lawns and moldable mats for manufactured parts and containers. Panasonic {{has set up a}} plant in Malaysia to manufacture kenaf <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> and export them to Japan.|$|R
40|$|The WKI {{calculation}} model published by Mehlhorn (1986) was up-dated for the formaldehyde emission potential of currently produced particleboards.

50|$|Armitage Manufacturing Company, {{also known}} as <b>Fibre</b> <b>Board</b> Container Company, is a {{historic}} factory building located in Richmond, Virginia. The original section was built in 1900, and is a two-story, brick building; a third story was added in 1924. Around 1928, a three-story extension was constructed {{at the rear of}} the front wing. In 1954, a large barrel-roofed, metal bowstring truss wing was added. It was constructed for the production of building supplies and roofing paper, and then used for corrugated container manufacturing. The building is used as a warehouse.|$|E
50|$|Wood is a {{naturally}} occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a lignin and hemicellulose matrix. Engineered wood includes {{a wide variety}} of different products such as wood <b>fibre</b> <b>board,</b> plywood, oriented strand board, wood plastic composite (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), Pykrete (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or laminated paper or textiles, Arborite, Formica (plastic) and Micarta. Other engineered laminate composites, such as Mallite, use a central core of end grain balsa wood, bonded to surface skins of light alloy or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.|$|E
50|$|Atikokan's main {{employers}} are the Atikokan Generating Station located 20 kilometres {{north of the}} community, the general hospital, Quetico Provincial Park and (collectively) its canoeing outfitters. Ontario Power Generation (OPG) {{has been one of}} Atikokan's main employers since the early 1980s. Constructed as a fossil-fuel burning facility, the Atikokan Generating Station burned coal shipped from Saskatchewan until 2012. It was then converted to a biomass plant, re-opening in 2014. Formerly, Fibretech, a <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> processing plant in Atikokan closed, but was converted by Rentech Inc. to produce wood pellets to supply the newly converted biomass generating station.|$|E
5000|$|Austerity {{houses were}} small, {{with an eye}} to the future {{addition}} of bedrooms as families expanded. To save on the cost of building materials and labour, living rooms and dining rooms were combined into one space, entrance halls disappeared {{with the arrival of the}} [...] "L" [...] shaped house, and verandahs shrunk to small cantilevered porches over the front door. People made do with one chimney, and pretentious ornamentation was dropped. Building materials increasingly included asbestos cement (sold by Wunderlich as [...] "Durabestos" [...] and James Hardie as 'Fibrolite'), and compressed <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> such as Masonite and Cane-ite, as well as Timbrock hardboard.

30|$|Paints A and B {{were applied}} to birch plywood boards (dimensions: 76  ×  74  ×  1  cm 3). The side faces of the plywood boards were sealed using ‘Pyrotect Lack’. Paint C was applied to <b>fibre</b> cement <b>boards</b> (dimensions: 76  ×  74  ×  1  cm 3). Paint C was also applied to the side faces of the <b>fibre</b> cement <b>boards.</b> All paints were applied {{according}} to the manufacturer’s instructions referring {{to the amount of}} paint per surface area, application of ground coats and the duration of drying phases. Paints dried at room temperature were protected from direct radiation for a period of 5  days until the field experiments were started. Textile samples were fixed to wooden frames of 76  ×  74  cm lateral lengths.|$|R
50|$|Case milling was an {{important}} industry associated with fruit growing. It was valued because it provided a useful outlet for timber which would otherwise have no economic value. There was a high demand for fruit and vegetable cases in the immediate post-War period with case milling peaking in 1949. 45% of cases were manufactured for packaging fresh fruit {{but they were also}} used for a range of other foodstuffs and manufactured goods. By the early 1950s, corrugated <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> containers, developed during World War II, began to compete with the traditional wooden cases and the latter experienced a steady decline in use. By 1955 - 56 there were still some 58 wooden case manufacturers in Queensland comprising mostly small firms. Some 40% of the case millers in Queensland also milled timber for other uses.|$|E
50|$|Pizza boxes {{made from}} solid <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> take up {{about half the}} space the boxes with E flute size {{cardboard}} need, and {{a quarter of the}} space of those made of B flute size cardboard. Apart from the material itself, the stability of the box is determined by the form it is folded into. The type of pizza box with flaps firmly attached to the side walls that are folded into the front wall has established itself as the standard. In this case, the walls of the box are connected at the edges and this increases its stability. The traditional way of folding the box is an example of this folding type. Its disadvantage is that the walls of the box rise vertically which makes cutting the pizza in the box with a pizza cutter more difficult.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the term}} MDF {{has become a}} generic name for any dry process <b>fibre</b> <b>board.</b> MDF is {{typically}} made up of 82% wood fibre, 9% urea-formaldehyde resin glue, 8% water and 1% paraffin wax. and the density is typically between 500 kg/m3 (31 lb/ft3) and 1,000 kg/m3 (62 lb/ft3). The range of density and classification as light, standard, or high density board is a misnomer and confusing. The density of the board, when evaluated {{in relation to the}} density of the fibre that goes into making the panel, is important. A thick MDF panel at a density of 700-720 kg/m3 may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.|$|E
40|$|A {{condensed}} {{review on}} the state of the art of the production of medium density <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> is given. Thereafter, results of investigations on pulping beech and pine wood under different conditions according to the TMP- and CTMP-process are presented. The pulps derived from both wood species were analysed for some of their physical and chemical properties. The results reveal: Waste water from the CTMP-process has higher chemical and biological oxygen demand. The CTMP-process seems to be milder than the TMP-process as it leads to pulps with higher fibre length, especially in case of beech. The content of acetyle groups is much lower in CTMP-pulps than in TMP-pulps, CTMPpulps emit also more acetic acid than TMP-pulps. With increasing pulping temperature the pH-value decreases and the buffering capacity towards alkali increases...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{considers}} a stabilization of temperature of a wood fiber during production of medium close <b>fibre</b> <b>boards</b> MDF in a wood-processing industry. The original purpose to solve energetic optimalization of a kiln dryer {{has become a}} serious problem. It turned out that production suffers with a big heat loss which results in big heat loss gained during a kiln drying. Primary aim of this thesis is an examination of a cooling effect of environment on chosen parts of a production line and suggestion of acceptable proceeding to minimize heat loss and to rise temperature of the wood fiber to required temperature. Solution is aimed on the section of a production line between drying equipment and press. First part of the thesis introduces technology of production of <b>fibre</b> <b>boards,</b> introduction to heat transfer problems and also basics of computer modeling of heat flow and transfer using CFD simulation. The next part includes {{an evaluation of the}} heat loss of chosen parts of the production line in a current working condition and its comparison with computer simulations. Verification of accuracy of the results while using both approaches to solution is a first step to the improvement of the current situation. It is possible to use the verified calculation model for the following solution of effects on convective and radiation heating of a wood fiber layer. An important factor in the last period of a calculation is a real temperature of the fiber board-mat at the entrance to a press. The higher entering temperature in a set temperature range is reached, the lower time needed for pressing will be and simultaneously the whole industrial process will be cut short. The solution of a problem leads to an achievement of an energy saving and should become a solid basis from which {{it would be possible to}} evaluate an improvement of production of MDF boards. The conclusion of the thesis includes an analysis of findings which refers to a heating of wood fiber and it’s effectiveness for a practical use...|$|R

50|$|Most {{packaging}} for {{the transport}} of pizzas is made of cardboard, because this material is cheap and has many useful properties. Both solid <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> and single wall corrugated board are used. The corrugated cardboard in use is often of the E flute size (micro or fine waves with a flute pitch of 1.0 to 1.8 mm), but thicker B flute cardboard with a flute pitch of 2.2 to 3.0 mm are also used. Not only the geometric construction of the cardboard determines {{the stability of the}} box, but also especially the type of paper and its grammage. For the liner mostly containerboard is used {{on the inside of the}} box. This does not only make the box stable, it becomes more resistant against humidity and oil as well.To reduce the space needed to store the packaging to a minimum, the pizza boxes are folded just before use out of flat blanks. The required storage space depends very much on the different thickness of the material.|$|E
50|$|New {{materials}} {{used on the}} library were detailed in the May/June 1961 issue of Building Materials, which featured the building. Such materials included Rotary Red Cedar Exterior plywood panelling, also featured in the Plywood and Plywood Products journal of September 1961. The roof membrane of the library was formed with 2 inch thick laminated <b>fibre</b> <b>board</b> clad with bituminous felt and finished with white grain render and a copper fascia. When completed, the centre point of {{the roof of the}} building was finished with an amber acrylic light dome, apparently the largest acrylic dome produced in Australia at the time. Machinery connected to the upper most level of glazing surrounding the building allowed the windows to be mechanically opened. Installed in the ceiling of the library were two concentric light troughs formed with fluorescent tubes between purlins concealed with a translucent acrylic sheeting, operating {{in much the same way}} internal lighting operates with most current suspended ceiling systems. As well there were a number of suspended lighting features of circular fluorescent tubes fixed together on a light framework.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{the example}} of {{lignocellulosic}} fibres from pinewood, we could substitute the addition of resin by employing various hydrolases, especially xylanase plus cellulase from Trichoderma reesei. Differently {{to the use of}} oxidases, the polysaccharides of the wood in this case are activated for fibre-to-fibre bonding. Already after a few minutes incubation time and less than 3 % of enzyme dosage, there is a substantial improvement in strength and hygroscopic properties of glue-free MDF. The material properties meet approximately the standard of EN 622. We received different results with different xylanase-cellulase-complexes. According to the present results, high activity in xylanase plus high activity in endo-glucanase are necessary for the successful modification of the lignocellulose fibres.
