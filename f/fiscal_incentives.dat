The hybrid market share of new car sales began to {{increase}} significantly in 2009, when the government implemented aggressive <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentives</b> for fuel efficient vehicles and the third generation Prius was introduced. That year, the hybrid market share of new car sales in the country, including kei cars, jumped from less than 5% in 2008 to over 10% in 2009. If only conventional passenger cars are accounted for, the hybrid market share was about 15%. By 2013 the hybrid market share {{accounted for more than}} 30% of the 2.9 million standard passenger vehicles sold, and about 20% of the 4.5 million passenger vehicles including kei cars. Sales of standard cars in 2016 totaled 1.49million units, with the hybrid segment achieving a record 38% market share. Accounting for kei cars, hybrids achieved a market share of 25.7% of new passenger car sales, up from 22.3% in 2015. In 2016 every one of the standard cars listed in the Japanese top-20 best-selling car ranking had a hybrid version on sale. and the two top-selling standard cars were models only available as a hybrid, the Toyota Prius and the Toyota Aqua.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the R&D <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> program on R&D by Dutch firms. Taking a factor-demand approach we measure the elasticity of firm R&D capital accumulation to its user cost. Econometric models are estimated using a rich unbalanced panel of firm data covering the period 1996 - 2004 with firm-specific R&D user costs varying with tax incentives. Using the estimated user cost elasticity, we perform a cost-benefit analysis of the R&D incentive program. We find some evidence of additionality suggesting that the level-based program of R&D incentives in the Netherlands is effective in stimulating firms' investment in R&D. However, the hypothesis of crowding out can be rejected only for small firms. The analysis also indicates that the level-based nature of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> scheme leads to a substantial social dead-weight loss...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{lobbying}} {{has long}} been important in West African countries to induce government import-substitution policy. The objectives of governments were to defend infant industries and mobilise fiscal revenue. The doctrine, at a moment conflicting between World Bank and IMF, stopped the liberalisation included in the first structural adjustment programs. But during the 1990 s, a consensus was born between the two institutions to support WAEMU regional integration. Although the WAEMU institutional organisation was unfavorable to decreasing protection, {{the support of the}} Washington Consensus and of the European Union has permitted trade policy de-privatisation through the application of Common External Tariff (CET). But the maintaining of different <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> systems in each country reduces the effectiveness of this new trade instrument (CET).

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{justification for}} a greenhouse gas (GHG) {{cap and trade}} system is that participants will trade emission permits until their marginal cost of abatement equals the equilibrium price of emission permits. However, for fiscally constrained governments this logic does not apply, as they have a <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> to let welfare concerns, rather than industrial cost efficiency, guide their abatement policy. Then, global cost efficiency will fail even if just a (small) subset of governments are fiscally constrained.

50|$|Alligator farming has minimal {{adverse effects}} on the environment, and has at least two {{positive}} direct effects on alligator conservation. Because the luxury goods industry has a reliable stream of product, illegal poaching is reduced. Juvenile crocodilians can also be released into the wild to support a steady population. Wild alligator conservation has also benefited indirectly from farming. Ranching businesses protect alligator habitats {{to take care of}} nesting sites. The <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> to keep a healthy environment for breeding alligators means that the environment and its wildlife are seen as an economic resource. This can augment the governmentâ€™s willingness to take care of crocodilian populations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} education and occupational choice on the growth-inequality relationship. Occupations that play asymmetric roles in the production process are distinguished. The dynamic evolution of the detrended distribution of income is characterized and shown to converge to an endogenous, non-degenerate, stationary distribution. The long-run growth rate converges to a simple function of stuctural and fiscal parameters and the Lorenz curve describing long-run inequality. The impact of government policy on the growth-inequality relationship and welfare is assessed. The analysis is sensitive to whether we consider the short- or long- run effects and to whether redistribution takes place via taxation, expenditure or <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes. ...|$|R

Water/sewer impact fees, on the other hand, are found to reduce construction throughout the entire metropolitan area. Copyright Blackwell Publishers, 2006...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{conditions}} under which decentralization and fiscal competition lead to a policy of subsidizing cultural activities. A theoretical analysis discusses these subsidies as a form of local public good provision which makes a city more attractive to highly educated individuals. The analysis shows that the incentive to provide the public good is particularly strong, if institutional restrictions prevent local governments from adjusting their tax structure. An empirical analysis considering the case of public theaters in Germany supports the view that public subsidies attract highly educated individuals and capitalize in the earnings of workers with basic education. Given institutional restrictions, the empirical effects suggest that local jurisdictions face a substantial <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> to subsidize cultural activities...|$|R

40|$|A common {{feature of}} multi-jurisdictional systems is {{equalization}} programs. The implementation of such programs, {{that is based}} on some measurement of sub-national fiscal capacity and effort, is particularly complex. Within a political economy model, this paper analyzes the impact of such systems on accountability, identifying a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect arises because with equalized fiscal resources, a consequence of equalization, citizens attach more importance to any remaining variation in public good supplies and so punish rent-taking more severely. This induces politicians to restrain themselves and so accountability improves. The negative effect arises because the complexity of such programs reduces the informational content of observed public good supplies. This introduces a perverse <b>fiscal</b> <b>incentive</b> that reduces accountability. Thus, the overall impact of equalization programs on accountability depends on the balance of these effects.
