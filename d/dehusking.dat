40|$|Genetic {{variability}} {{and relationship}} of 13 tropical sweet corn inbred lines derived from different source popula-tions were investigated using agronomic traits during three consecutive years. Non-significant effects {{of years and}} years-by-lines indicated the stability of performance of the inbred lines per se over years. Contrastively, the effects of inbred lines were significant for all traits measured, indicating great genetic variability in their perfor-mance. Among the inbred lines, TSN-S 8, TSK-S 8, BAK-S 8, MAN-S 8, MMIN-S 8 and TSG-S 8 {{were found to be}} high yielding, with high husked fresh ear yield, <b>dehusked</b> fresh ear yield and number of ears per hectare, while DFS-S 8 and TFZ-S 8 were found to be superior for ear characteristics including husked ear length, <b>dehusked</b> ear length, number of kernel rows per ear and TSS. The high heritability estimates obtained from husked and <b>dehusked</b> fresh ear yields in this study indicate that the inbred lines have become homozygous at almost all the loci after eight generations of selfing. Husked fresh ear yield was phenotypically and genetically correlated with <b>dehusked</b> fresh ear yield, number of ears per hectare, husked and <b>dehusked</b> ear weights, <b>dehusked</b> ear length, husked and <b>dehusked</b> ear diameter, number of kernels per row and number of kernel rows per ear, indicating direct positive contribution of these traits to husked fresh ear yield. Visualizing the relationship among the inbred lines using singular value decomposition biplot analysis revealed that the inbred lines could be assigned into three distinct groups. This indicates a strong indication of the potential of the inbred lines for their utilisation towards production of new hybrid varieties by crossing the inbred lines from different groups. It can be concluded that the inbred lines studied varied substantially in many aspects, and these differences could be exploited for specific purposes in breeding programs...|$|R

However, <b>dehusked</b> coconut fruits stored at 30 C deteriorated. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger were the principal fungal agents associated with the spoilage. An investigation of the proximate composition of the <b>dehusked</b> fruits stored at 30 C indicated a marked significant difference in the percentage composition of moisture, protein, ascorbic acid and carbohydrate content of 3. 970. 28, 3. 980. 07, 0. 010. 002 and 9. 271. 02 respectively as against 46. 820. 43, 3. 770. 05, 2. 480. 15 and 11. 890. 22 obtained for <b>dehusked</b> coconut fruits prior to storage. These results suggest that the deterioration in nutritional composition was due to breakdown of protein and carbohydrate by the spoilage fungi. Further tests confirmed the ability of the isolated spoilage fungi to utilize the different carbohydrate and nitrogen sources as source of carbon and energy. Aspergillus flavus showed the ability to grow and utilize more of the various carbohydrate sources than Aspergillus niger, although the latter utilized lactose better.
