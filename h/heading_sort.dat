40|$|One hundred sixty English-cross steers (244 kg, SD= 23 kg) {{were used}} in each yr of a 2 -yr study to {{determine}} effects of sorting on performance, carcass characteristics, variability, and profitability in a long yearling system utilizing ranch-source calves. Steers were back grounded during winter then grazed smooth brome-grass pastures followed by warm season native range prior to entering the feedlot in the fall. Steers were stratified by BW and allotted to 1 of 4 treatments: 1) 40 <b>head</b> <b>sorted</b> by pre-grazing BW where heavy steers entered the feedlot in July (PST), 2) 40 <b>head</b> <b>sorted</b> by BW entering the feedlot (FDL), 3) 60 <b>head</b> <b>sorted</b> by BW and fat thickness {{at the end of}} the feeding period (IND), and 4) 20 head that were not sorted (UNS). No differences were observed for performance during back-grounding or grazing phases (P 3 ̆e 0. 30). Cattle receiving PST sorting weighed less entering the feedlot and consumed less feed with less feedlot ADG compared to other treatments (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). No differences in feed efficiencies were detected (P = 0. 84). Cattle receiving PST sorting had greater marbling scores (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and less variation in BW upon feedlot entry which resulted in less variation in carcass weight compared with UNS (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Cattle sorted by BW entering the feedlot tended (P = 0. 08) to have less variation in carcass weight compared with UNS. There were no differences in carcass weight or profitability when calculated on either a live or value basis. No sorting strategy increased carcass weight, reduced discounts for overweight or corpulent carcasses, or improved profitability over UNS...|$|R

Using qualitative evaluation, we compare three shallow processing methods for extracting index terms, i. e., terms {{that can be used to}} model the content of documents. We focus on two criteria: quality and coverage. In terms of quality alone, our results show that technical term (TT) extraction [Justeson and Katz 1995] receives the highest rating. However, in terms of a combined quality and coverage metric, the <b>Head</b> <b>Sorting</b> (HS) method, described in [Wacholder 1998], outperforms both other methods, keyword (KW) and TT...|$|R

50|$|Chilean Horses were {{selected}} for lateral dexterity, courage to confront and pin belligerent cattle and an even temperament that permitted {{a high degree of}} trainability while conserving needed energy for a long day's work. By the 18th century, the yearly round-ups that had been required by decree since 1557 took on massive dimensions. The pens that received cattle herded down from the mountainous terrain needed to have a capacity of no less than 7,000 <b>head.</b> <b>Sorting</b> the cattle by ownership, designated use, and requirements for castration and branding resulted in herding and pushing cattle down long alleyways into classifying pens. This gave rise to the aptitudes now used in the modern-day Chilean rodeo that are performed in a crescent-shaped arena known as a medialuna (half-moon arena).|$|R

40|$|Evaluation {{of natural}} {{language}} processing tools and systems must focus on two complementary aspects: first, evaluation of {{the accuracy of the}} output, and second, evaluation of the functionality of the output as embedded in an application. This paper presents evaluations of two aspects of LinkIT, a tool for noun phrase identification linking, sorting and filtering. LinkIT uses a <b>head</b> <b>sorting</b> method to organize and rank simplex noun phrases (SNPs). LinkIT is to identify significant topics in domain-independent documents. The first evaluation, reported in D. K. Evans et al. 2000 compares the output of the Noun Phrase finder in LinkIT to two other systems. Issues of establishing a gold standard and criteria for matching are discussed. The second evaluation directly concerns the construction of the browsing application. We present results from Wacholder et al. 2000 on a qualitative evaluation which compares three shallow processing methods for extracting index terms, i. e., terms {{that can be used to}} model the content of documents. We analyze both quality and coverage. We discuss how experimental results such as these guide the building of an effective browsing applications...|$|R
