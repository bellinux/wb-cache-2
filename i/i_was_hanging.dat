500|$|The {{track that}} {{underwent}} {{the most extensive}} change was [...] "I Miss You", an old song from the Debut era, {{the result of the}} input of Howie Bernstein (a protégé of Hooper and an aspiring programmer), who gave the song its [...] "Latin-tinged [...] ". Back in London, Björk contacted [...] "old standby" [...] Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar Örn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on [...] "Enjoy". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Björk's request. The singer decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called [...] "Travessia". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor [...] "immediately bolstered" [...] "Hyperballad", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] and [...] "Isobel". This addition of strings, brass and percussion elements gave Post the balance Björk felt her original recordings had lacked. By the time the album was finished in April 1995, the list of co-producers included: Björk, Hooper, Bernstein, Massey, and Tricky. Björk has said: [...] "The people I collaborated with were all people <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> out with in clubs in London. I had known them all for a while before we ended up working together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although The Someloves' Mather was not {{interested}} in touring or even performing live, the other members created Dom Mariani's Orange with the line-up of Mariani, Moon, Italiano and Zupanovich to showcase the album. They also recorded a track, [...] "Christ-masonic", for a various artists' compilation, Rockin' Bethlehem: The Second Coming (1990). In 1998 Mariani described how Orange developed, [...] "The Someloves was a loose studio idea ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> out to play live again but Darryl wasn't into it ... the record company were also putting the pressure on us to go on the road ... The album had been well received, so it was a real shame we couldn't go on with it. So it became Orange". Orange performed The Someloves' and some new material but by mid-1991 Orange had also disbanded. In 2006, Half A Cow records issued [...] "Don't Talk About Us: The Real Pop Recordings of the Someloves 1985-89" [...] which collected together every official recording The Someloves made.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E

60|$|Although the boy {{had told}} me that it was but ten feet to the floor below I {{experienced}} the same thrills as though <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>hanging</b> above a bottomless pit. Then I released my hold and dropped--four feet to a soft cushion of sand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{too late}} to talk like that," [...] I replied, smiling as I remembered how eager my partner had been to go as a soldier when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> back. [...] "We're like to see an hundred times worse than this before we're many hours older." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Slavin said, [...] "I guess I hear them, and I'll {{stay right}} where I am. They can't see me in the shadow, and if they knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> round it might worry them. You don't want to hang out a red rag {{when you have a}} {{difference}} of opinion with a bull." ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{there was}} a pretty smooth sea, and little wind; yet, at this extreme elevation, the ship's motion was very great; {{so that when the}} ship rolled one way, I felt {{something}} as a fly must feel, walking the ceiling; and when it rolled the other way, I felt as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> along a slanting pine-tree.|$|E
5000|$|Of this release Tom says: [...] "Grant Rephlex and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>hanging</b> out and <b>I</b> played him {{a load of}} old stuff, {{bits and}} pieces from 1994 and whatever. He really liked it and so some of it went out as 'Buzz Caner'. I sort of changed my mind about it when the smoke cleared." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the loss}} to Jennifer Howard, Petersen told the local Ipswich newspaper, The Queensland Times, in an article dated 31 January 2015 {{that she would not}} run for office in the future.

60|$|MY DEAR CUMMY,--The {{cupboard}} {{has not yet}} turned up, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> on {{to be able to}} say it had. However, that is only a {{trick to}} escape another letter, and I should despise myself if I kept it up. It was truly kind of you, dear Cummy, to send it to us: and I will let you know where we set it and how it looks.|$|E
60|$|I could {{but just}} {{perceive}} the ship below me, {{like a long}} narrow plank in the water; {{and it did not}} seem to belong at all to the yard, over which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging.</b> A gull, or some sort of sea-fowl, was flying round the truck over my head, within a few yards of my face; and it almost frightened me to hear it; it seemed so much like a spirit, at such a lofty and solitary height.|$|E
60|$|One last glance I {{gave her}} as I bestrode the rail of her balcony. Then I lowered myself as I had ascended. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> by my hands, seeking with my foot for the coping {{of the window}} beneath me, when, suddenly, there came a buzzing in my ears. I had a {{fleeting}} vision of a white figure leaning on the balcony above me; then a veil seemed drawn over my eyes; there came a sense of falling; a rush as of a tempestuous wind; then--nothing.|$|E
5000|$|Before Hawkwind, House {{played in}} High Tide and the Third Ear Band, who contributed the soundtrack to Roman Polanski's Macbeth. Guitarist Tony Hill recounted how House {{became a member}} of High Tide: [...] "Pavli and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>hanging</b> out with and {{crashing}} where we could at Mike's or Wayne's. Simon ended up crashing there as well. Simon was playing bass then. He said: 'I used to play violin, you know?' So I said 'Get it!' That was basically it." ...|$|R

5000|$|I wasn’t that {{excited about}} doing Primus again, but Larry and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>hanging</b> out, and that {{friendship}} was rekindled. It was very apparent that it wasn’t {{going to happen}} with Tim Alexander, and he wasn’t that excited about doing things again. So, we talked to Jay Lane, and we actually had a jam with Jay Lane, and he brought this huge ball of energy back into the room from the very second he started playing, and that's the main reason we’re doing it again. There's this creative flow again that hasn’t been there in a long time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{broke in}} a third passenger, [...] "and he was so d----d civil that when she dropped her ring in the straw, he struck a match agin all your rules, you know, and held it for her to find it. And {{it was just as}} we were crossin' through the brush, too. I saw the hull thing through the window, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> over the wheels with my gun ready for action. And it wasn't no fault of Judge Thompson's if his d----d foolishness hadn't shown us up, and got us a shot from the gang." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy's face clouded. [...] "She {{thanked me}} {{and said it was}} very thoughtful--and kind--though it might have been only an accident"--he stammered--"and then she said perhaps <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> round and coming there a little too much lately, and that as Burroughs was very watchful, I'd better quit for two or three days." [...] The tears were rising to his eyes, but by putting his two clenched fists into his pockets, he managed to hold them down. Perhaps Mr. Hamlin's soft hand on his head {{assisted}} him. Mr. Hamlin took from his pocket a notebook, and tearing out a leaf, sat down again and began to write on his knee. After a pause, Leonidas said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|But Tom was aboard by this time, and {{he started}} the balloon up a little, and stopped it again {{as soon as the}} end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me, and roaring and {{springing}} up in the air at the ladder, and only missing it about a quarter of an inch, it seemed to me. It was delicious to be out of his reach, perfectly delicious, and made me feel good and thankful all up one side; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> there helpless and couldn't climb, and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other. It is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that; and it is not to be recommended, either.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I have a {{right to}} hope. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>hanging</b> on here, Bell, longer than I ought to have done, because I could not bring myself to leave you without {{speaking}} of this again. I did not wish to seem to you to be importunate--" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Green Men {{had planned}} to end their appearances, if the Canucks go all the way. Said Force: [...] "We have said from Day 1 we will hang with them until the Canucks win the Stanley Cup. the Canucks win the Cup this year, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hanging</b> up the suit. I will {{encourage}} it to be hung from the rafters at Rogers Arena. It won't happen, but I encourage it. If the Canucks lose, we will see what happens." [...] Sully suggested that [...] "Nothing is official. We haven't made a joint decision just yet. If one guy goes down, then the ship goes down with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We young folks quite {{lost our}} heads that night, and I {{have n't a}} very clear idea of how I got home.

60|$|I was his nephew, his {{peculiar}} {{and intimate}} nephew. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> {{on to his}} coat-tails all the way through. I made pills {{with him in the}} chemist's shop at Wimblehurst before he began. I was, you might say, the stick of his rocket; and after our tremendous soar, after he had played with millions, a golden rain in the sky, after my bird's-eye view of the modern world, I fell again, a little scarred and blistered perhaps, two and twenty years older, with my youth gone, my manhood eaten in upon, but greatly edified, into this Thames-side yard, into these white heats and hammerings, amidst the fine realites of steel--to think it all over in my leisure and jot down the notes and inconsecutive observations that make this book. It was more, you know, than a figurative soar. The zenith of that career was surely our flight across the channel in the Lord Roberts B....|$|E
60|$|But, {{reaching}} up, I grasped a branch, and, swinging {{clear of}} the lower one, I began to kick at the bear. This stopped him. Then he squealed, and began to kick on his own account. Hiram {{was trying to get}} the noose over a bind foot. After several attempts he succeeded, and then threw the rope over the lowest branch. I gave a wild Indian yell of triumph. The next instant, before I could find a foothold, the branch to which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> snapped like a pistol-shot, and I plunged down with a crash. I struck the bear and the lower branch, and then the ground. The fall half stunned me. I thought every bone in my body was broken. I rose unsteadily, and for a moment everything whirled before my eyes. Then I discovered that the roar in my ears was the old hunter's yell. I saw him hauling on the rope. There was a great ripping of bark and many strange sounds, and then the cub was dangling head downward. Hiram had pulled him from his perch, and hung him over the lowest branch.|$|E
6000|$|When arrived near home (at Grumpley, {{three miles}} from our village, where the [...] "True Blue" [...] {{generally}} stops to take a glass of ale at the Poppleton Arms) {{it was as if}} our Member, Mr. Poppleton himself, was come into the country, so great was the concourse of people assembled round the inn. And there was the landlord of the inn and all the people of the village. Then there was Tom Wheeler, the post-boy, from Mrs. Rincer's posting-hotel in our town; he was riding on the old bay posters, and they, Heaven bless us! were drawing my aunt's yellow chariot, in which she never went out but thrice in a year, and in which she now sat in her splendid cashmere shawl and a new hat and feather. She waved a white handkerchief out of the window, and Tom Wheeler shouted out [...] "Huzza!" [...] as did a number of the little blackguard boys of Grumpley: who, to be sure, would huzza for anything. What a change on Tom Wheeler's part, however! I remembered only a few years before how he had whipped me from the box of the chaise, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> on for a ride behind.|$|E
6000|$|She {{clasped her}} hands, {{with a low}} cry of delight. [...] "Oh, where is Oscar?" [...] she said softly. [...] "Where <b>is</b> Oscar?" [...] <b>I</b> looked round for him. He was gone.

60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really {{anxious to}} oblige Amelia, I met the Count accidentally next {{day on the}} steps of Morley's. (Accidentally, that is to say, so far as he <b>was</b> concerned, though <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>hanging</b> about in Trafalgar Square for half an hour to see him.) I explained, in guarded terms, that I {{had a great deal of}} {{influence}} in my way with Sir Charles; and that a word from me-- I broke off. He stared at me blankly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think I'm altruistic? I'm not. I'm just as {{selfish and}} self-centred {{as any other}} man who wants a thing very badly. I'm as altruistic as a child crying for the moon. I want you to marry me because I love you, because there never was anybody like you, because you're the whole world, because I always have loved you. I've been dreaming about you for a dozen years, {{thinking}} about you, wondering about you--wondering where you were, what you were doing, how you looked. I {{used to think that}} it was just sentimentality, that you merely stood for a time of my life when I was happier than I have ever been since. I used to think that you were just a sort of peg on which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> a pleasant sentimental regret for days which could never come back. You were a memory that seemed to personify all the other memories of the best time of my life. You were the goddess of old associations. Then I met you in London, and it was different. I wanted you--you! I didn't want you because you recalled old times and were associated with dead happiness, I wanted you! I knew I loved you directly you spoke to me at the theatre that night of the fire. I loved your voice and your eyes and your smile and your courage. And then you told me you were engaged. I might have expected it, but I couldn't keep my jealousy from showing itself, and you snubbed me as I deserved. But now ... things are different now. Everything's different, except my love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"The {{engineer}} {{stayed on}} deck {{while the men}} went down below. The skipper hadn't {{got back to the}} chart-room before I saw thirty feet of bowsprit hanging over the break of the fo'c'sle. Thirty feet of bowsprit, sir, doesn't belong to anything that sails the seas except a sailing-ship or a man-of-war. I speculated quite a long time, with my hands on the bulwarks, as to whether our friend was soft wood or steel plated. It would not have made much difference to us, anyway; but I felt there was more honour in being rammed, you know. Then I knew all about it. It was a ram. We opened out. I am not exaggerating--we opened out, sir, like a cardboard box. The other ship cut us two-thirds through, a little behind the break of the fo'c'sle. Our decks split up lengthways. The mizzen-mast bounded out of its place, and we heeled over. Then the other ship blew a fog-horn. I remember thinking, as I took water from the port bulwark, that this was rather ostentatious after she had done all the mischief. After that, I was {{a mile and a half}} under sea, trying to go to sleep as hard as I could. Some one caught hold of my hair, and waked me up. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hanging</b> to what was left of one of our boats under the lee of a large English ironclad. There were two men with me; the three of us began to yell. A man on the ship sings out, 'Can you climb on board if we throw you a rope?' They weren't going to let down a fine new man-of-war's boat to pick up three half-drowned rats. We accepted the invitation. We climbed--I, the engineer, and the ship's boy. About half an hour later the fog cleared entirely; except for the half of the boat away in the offing, there was neither stick nor string on the sea to show that the Hespa had been cut down." ...|$|E
