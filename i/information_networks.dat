40|$|Entity <b>information</b> <b>network</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} structural relationships between entities. Taking advantage of its extension and heterogeneity, entity <b>information</b> <b>network</b> {{is more and more}} widely applied to relationship modeling. Recent years, lots of researches about entity <b>information</b> <b>network</b> modeling have been proposed, while seldom of them concentrate on equipment-standard system with properties of multi-layer, multi-dimension and multi-scale. In order to efficiently deal with some complex issues in equipment-standard system such as standard revising, standard controlling, and production designing, a heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>network</b> model for equipment-standard system is proposed in this paper. Three types of entities and six types of relationships are considered in the proposed model. Correspondingly, several different similarity-measuring methods are used in the modeling process. The experiments show that the heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>network</b> model established in this paper can reflect relationships between entities accurately. Meanwhile, the modeling process has a good performance on time consumption...|$|R
40|$|This paper shows {{firm level}} micro {{analysis}} of <b>information</b> <b>network</b> use {{and its impact}} on firm's productivity. New evidences on economic impacts of IT by type of its application are provided, based on METIfs firm level data of Japanese manufacturers and distributors. It is found that productivity impact of <b>information</b> <b>network</b> use is different, depending on application of network. In addition, due to rapid progress of information technology, economic implications of <b>information</b> <b>network</b> are different also by the timing of its introduction. METI's datasets covers <b>information</b> on <b>network</b> use by its type, as well as firm's IT use throughout the period of 1990 's. Detail analysis of <b>information</b> <b>network</b> use at Japanese firms can shed a new light on heterogeneous and dynamic nature of firm level IT use and its performance. ...|$|R

When they reach zero, the cubes open, but appear empty; however, massive numbers of cardiac arrest cases are reported, killing {{about a third of}} humanity, and the Doctor finds one of his own hearts has stopped. As Amy helps him to restart his heart, Kate finds the boxes emitted a signal traced to seven sites across the globe, including the hospital Rory works at.|$|E

2500|$|In a major {{speech on}} January 21, 2010, Clinton, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} the U.S., declared that [...] "We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas", while highlighting how [...] "even in authoritarian countries, <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable." [...] She also drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet. Her speech, which followed a controversy surrounding Google's changed policy toward China and censorship, appears to mark a split between authoritarian capitalism and the Western model of free capitalism and Internet access. Chinese officials responded strongly, saying Clinton's remarks were [...] "harmful to Sino-American relations" [...] and demanded that U.S. officials [...] "respect the truth", and some foreign policy observers thought that Clinton had been too provocative. But the White House stood behind Clinton, and demanded that China provide better answers regarding the recent Chinese cyberattack against Google. Clinton's speech garnered marked attention among diplomats, as {{it was the first time}} a senior American official had clearly put forth a vision in which the Internet was a key element of American foreign policy.|$|E
