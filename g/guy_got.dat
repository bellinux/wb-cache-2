2500|$|... 1) A <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> married. On {{their first}} night together, his wife started {{piercing}} her ears with a needle. When {{they had sex}} a bit later, he found {{she was not a}} virgin. He said: [...] "my lady, the hole you must have created while in your father's house, you're making here, and the one you should make here you've already made there".|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dixon made no difficulty, {{and was so}} profuse in thanks that <b>Guy</b> <b>got</b> {{out of her way}} as fast as he could, and {{was soon}} on the soft thymy grass of the hill-side, the little girl frisking about him in great delight, playing with Bustle, and {{chattering}} merrily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] {{said the}} Kid approvingly, [...] "that Smith <b>guy's</b> <b>got</b> more grey matter under his thatch than you'd think {{to look at}} him. I--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Through {{extensive}} advertising, the neologism [...] "moxie" [...] {{has entered}} popular American usage {{with the meaning}} [...] "courage, daring, or spirit", as in [...] "This <b>guy's</b> <b>got</b> moxie!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to these issues, Grabelle stated that, [...] "Trabue does not speak a shred of truth... I heard those <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> into some pretty hardcore drugs... and they are just miserable." ...|$|R
60|$|It didn't take my practised ear long to {{discover}} that it wasn't me and Charlie that the great public was cheering for. We would go round the floor without getting a hand, and every time Mrs Charlie and her <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> to a corner there was a noise like election night. She sure had made a hit.|$|E
6000|$|At Rincon, {{a hundred}} miles from San Antonio, they left the train for a buckboard which was waiting there for Raidler. In this they {{travelled}} the thirty miles between the station and their destination. If anything could, this drive should have stirred the acrimonious McGuire {{to a sense of}} his ransom. They sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna. The pair of Spanish ponies struck a nimble, tireless trot, which gait they occasionally relieved by a wild, untrammelled gallop. The air was wine and seltzer, perfumed, as they absorbed it, with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers. The road perished, and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself, steered by the practised hand of Raidler, to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard, each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance. But McGuire reclined upon his spine, seeing nothing but a desert, and receiving the cattleman's advances with sullen distrust. [...] "W'at's he up to?" [...] was the burden of his thoughts; [...] "w'at kind of a gold brick has the big <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> to sell?" [...] McGuire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the owner}} & {{driver of the}} Bulldozer monster truck was Guy Wood, who had been racing monster trucks for 15 years. <b>Guy</b> <b>got</b> his start in the sport of monster truck racing at a race track near to his home at the time. As demand for his {{presence}} increased, so did {{his interest in the}} sport until he was racing the truck full-time. Eventually, Guy gave the rights to Bulldozer to USA Motorsports.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> a {{night out}} when their coaches took them to Hooters to lift their spirits. However, not wanting outside distraction, Uriah Hall alienated himself from the group because he would rather {{concentrate}} on fighting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say," [...] said Curly, from whose panoplied breast all {{shafts of}} wit fell blunted. [...] "Any of you kiddin' <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> a drink on you? Have your fun. Say, I've been hittin' the stuff till I don't know {{straight}} up." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nitzsche {{said about}} DeVille, [...] "We {{hit it off}} right away. Willy pulled out his record collection, he started playing things, that was it. I thought, Holy shit! This <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> taste!" [...] Wrote Ben Edmonds, who paired Nitzsche with Mink DeVille: ...|$|R
50|$|Crown {{prosecutor}} Ben Vanderkolk alleged Macdonald {{closed the}} farm gates which forced Guy {{to stop and}} get out of his vehicle. Vanderkolk said when <b>Guy</b> <b>got</b> out, Macdonald shot him in the throat and then in the face. Police believe the killing occurred at about 4.43am. Defence counsel Greg King said four nearby residents testified they were woken by 'bangs' at about 5am and since Macdonald was seen on the farm at about 5am he could not have been the killer.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the show}} {{numerous}} references are made concerning Sheridan's analogous role {{in history to}} that of a messiah.A number of religious phrases are used to refer to Sheridan: messiah, messianic, and The Second Coming. In season four, episode 17, [...] "The Face of the Enemy", When Garibaldi speaks with William Edgars about capturing Sheridan, Garibaldi says [...] "I don't know, but I think the last <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> 30 pieces of silver for the same job" [...] a reference to Judas' betrayal of Jesus.|$|E
5000|$|As Capt. John Sheridan's forces {{approach}} Earth, {{the fighting}} grows more fierce. Out-gunned {{and unable to}} flee, President Clark's remaining ships still refuse to surrender. Meanwhile, Dr. Stephen Franklin and Lyta Alexander find themselves on Mars again with their disturbing cargo. Michael Garibaldi matter-of-factly informs Edgars that John Sheridan's trap has been baited with his father. Pleased, Edgars again promises Garibaldi the elusive reward of the whole truth. [...] "I think the last <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> thirty pieces of silver for the same job," [...] Garibaldi remarks with distaste as he leaves.|$|E
5000|$|... : In Episode 8, the <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> {{to choose}} which girl to eliminate. Tanisha {{informed}} the guys that chose the eliminated girl would be automatically eliminated. In the end, Lea had enough votes to stay thus winning Love Games and Natalie was eliminated along with Corey B. and Taylor.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards said {{in victory}} lane that he [...] "actually enjoyed race. Obviously {{this is what}} we had to do. The <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> me off pit road first and that's what won it for me. We've got a shot at the {{championship}} at Homestead and that's all we wanted." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon {{being cut}} by the 49ers, Mitchell chose to close the book on this playing career even though {{he may have been}} able to pursue an {{opportunity}} in the fledgling World Football League, saying, [...] "I had a chance, whatever happened, good or bad, and I figured a <b>guy's</b> <b>got</b> to work someday." ...|$|R

50|$|Viktor Pronin (Yevgeni Urbansky) {{returned}} from the army to the bride (Svetlana Zhgun), and she - the other. Then Victor went to great Kursk ore, where the work {{is in full swing}} - all live in anticipation of the first car of ore. To check Pronyakin, Brigadier (Vsevolod Sanaev) gives him beaten MAZ: mend - a long time came. The <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> in the hostel to repair the car and began to put one after the other records. Victor had got no friends, embittered against him brigade, but the first bucket of ore carry exactly it.|$|E
5000|$|... "On {{one side}} of the disc was a {{recording}} of Knute Rockne, the famous football coach of Notre Dame, speaking - no, rather, yelling - at his team during halftime and they were losing, so you can imagine the energy there. However.... on the flip side of this funny old recording was a trombone solo by somebody named Tommy Dorsey. It was called 'I'm Getting Sentimental Over You.' Well, you know the rest of the story. I was absolutely intrigued by the sound this <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> on that old scratchy 78, so I thought, well, why can't that be me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He {{came right}} after guys. After {{a couple of}} <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> on in the second inning, he had that {{adrenaline}} going, and he pitched out of it. He used all his pitches which is what everyone wanted to see, and he threw them all very well." [...] Visalia Rawhide catcher Mark Reed, August 2011 ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When Courtney was state's {{attorney}} {{and all of}} us <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> indicted and Nitti was hollerin' like hell, we broke through and we got the assistant state's {{attorney and}} we got the witness {{and let me tell you}} I had the jury, too, just in case. That's the way we got to revert to these days." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ernest: [...] "Everything I do has a moral to it. Yes, I've been {{in films}} {{that have had}} shootings. I made The Wild Bunch (1969), which was the {{beginning}} of the splattering of blood and everything else. But there was a moral behind it. The moral was that, by golly, bad <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> it. That was it. Yeah." ...|$|R
5000|$|Food Network renewed {{the series}} after the {{successful}} inaugural trial run and {{the series is}} now in its thirteenth season. Beginning in season two, <b>Guy</b> <b>got</b> a more personalized set including a [...] "guy" [...] fridge with a #05 and racing stripes, a pin ball machine, big screen television, in-house bar, and a bumper-pool table.

5000|$|The Scary <b>Guy</b> <b>got</b> {{his first}} tattoo {{at the age}} of 30 and now has tattoos that cover an {{estimated}} 85% of his body. Over the years, his collection has grown as an artistic reflection of his life and experiences. They are what he calls, modern tribalism and reflect events he has experienced from humorous to stressful. One of these is a tattoo of a man called [...] "Yuppiecide", a representation of his former self. Scary Guy's other tattoos represent his love of art and others are chosen simply because The Scary Guy was a computer salesman at one point in his life and they looked [...] "cool".|$|E
5000|$|Paul Thompson of Pitchfork Media {{gave the}} album a very {{positive}} review calling it [...] "a record of practically nothing but graceful abandon. Each line seems immaculately crafted, every note falling into perfect order, every word sung with the proper bite and bile. This is what Bejar was building to, why he became a songwriter in the first place, and he reaches quite a precipice. Songs move effortlessly between bits of received wisdom, the drama is amped up to almost unthinkable levels, and these tunes feel like {{a long series of}} exclamation points. The <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> really good really fast, and he knew it-- his wit is sharp, his observations are keen, and his gaze is withering." ...|$|E
5000|$|I can see that! [...] "Hey, <b>guys,</b> I've <b>got</b> {{something}} the wife gave me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The band's label, Columbia Records, was {{nonetheless}} {{very impressed with}} the song and the recording process. Bruce Lundvall, then-president of Columbia, walked in on the recording sessions for Toys when the band {{was working on the}} song and remarked: [...] "You <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> an incredible thing going here. I just came from a Herbie Hancock session and this is much more fun".|$|R
6000|$|... "And so you see, sir," [...] he continued, [...] "there isn't {{the least}} {{chance in the}} world for you. Captain <b>Guy's</b> <b>got</b> her on board his ship; he's with her by {{sunlight}} and starlight. He's lost his ship for her and he wants to marry her. And on the other hand, it'll be weeks and weeks and perhaps months before you can see her, or write to her either, as like as not, and long before that Captain Guy will have his affair settled, and there isn't any reason in my mind to doubt which way it will settle. And so you just take my advice, sir, and stop drawing that long face. There are plenty of good girls in the world; no reason why you shouldn't get one; but if you are moping for the one that Captain <b>Guy's</b> <b>got</b> his heart set on, I'm afraid you'll end by being as much out of your head as you were when I found you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Frank Rosenthal said in Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi about Victor's family, [...] "Lots of time, {{members of}} his family were turned down for things just because of his (his brother Anthony and Michael's) reputation, and that really {{frustrated}} him. One time, his own brother (Pasquale Spilotro, Jr.) went to get a job at a casino (in Las Vegas, Nevada). I've got to say that his brother was more than qualified. Legitimate. But in forty-eight hours the poor <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> fired because of his last name. The casino owner didn't want to put up with the heat he'd get from the (Nevada State Gaming Enforcement Commission Control Board). Tony went nuts. He's ready {{to go to war with}} the casino owner." ...|$|E
5000|$|Williams {{said about}} the song (when he was at RTL Late Night on 2 November 2016): [...] "Angels is a song that myself and Guy Chambers wrote {{and it was the}} first of our songs that we wrote together. We could tell and hoped and prayed that we got {{something}} incredibly special. After we wrote the song, <b>Guy</b> <b>got</b> very ill, straight away. I kind of walked back from his house to my flat in the cold and in the snow with this tape in my hand and about a mile and a half in, I hailed a cab down. He played it and said [...] "that is great, that is, Robbie, that is gonne be number 1", and you know what: it never was number one.|$|E
5000|$|Tommy Bedford {{was sitting}} on the coach with some of his team-mates when the <b>guy</b> <b>got</b> in the driver's seat. He looked like a driver because he had a cap on. He started the {{ignition}} and pulled away from the hotel in London's Park Lane. And then all hell broke loose. The police outriders had been caught by surprise. Half the team weren't even on the bus. And where on earth were they going? As they sped past Green Park underground station one of the players managed to get his hands round the driver's neck. The bus crashed into half a dozen cars. The police arrived. Chaos. The guy had tried to hijack the Springbok rugby team. And all this only four hours before kick-off.|$|E
5000|$|Mowat excoriated Goddards article as, [...] "...bullshit, {{pure and}} simple... this <b>guy’s</b> <b>got</b> as many facts wrong {{as there are}} flies on a toad that’s roadkill.". Journalist Val Ross of The Globe and Mail agreed that [...] "Mowat, more passionate polemicist than {{rigorous}} reporter, painted federal bureaucrats in darker colours than many deserved," [...] but that Goddards piece erred {{in the same way}} against Mowat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said RIDE," [...] said Grayson. [...] "Any fool can SIT on a horse. NO, I hain't got nothin', an' I'm busy now. Hold on!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} as though seized {{by a sudden}} inspiration. He looked sharply at Bridge {{for a moment and}} then shook his head sadly. [...] "No, I'm afraid you couldn't do it--a <b>guy's</b> <b>got</b> to be eddicated for the job I got in mind." ...|$|R
