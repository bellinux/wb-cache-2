5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} in the ground in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the £15,000 cost of the new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, {{one of his many}} influential changes was {{to take advantage of the}} lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on <b>Fridays</b> <b>and</b> First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E

Newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for Rocky Horror conventions. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres. The National Fan Club was established in 1977 and later merged with the International Fan Club. The fan publication The Transylvanian printed a number of issues, and a semi-regular poster magazine was published {{as well as an}} official magazine.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, Dave Russell {{joined the}} club from Bury who were, at the time, two {{divisions}} above Tranmere. Considered a shrewd businessman, Russell made some revolutionary changes. He developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. More visibly, he introduced an all-white kit {{to set the}} team apart from local rivals, Division One club Everton; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. He also {{took advantage of the}} floodlights, regularly arranging home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on <b>Fridays</b> <b>and</b> Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays; Friday night games continued until the 1990s. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened. He became general manager in 1969, allowing Jackie Wright to take over.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on <b>Fridays</b> <b>and</b> Saturdays.

5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on <b>Fridays</b> <b>and</b> Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which he was supposed to play dance music, to rehearse his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 1. On the District and Piccadilly lines, {{the station is}} between Earl's Court and South Kensington, and on the Circle line, it is between High Street Kensington and South Kensington. Gloucester Road is the westernmost {{interchange}} between these three lines, although the tube map promotes the easier interchange at South Kensington.

5|$|Trains {{originally}} ran until 01:00, but {{following the}} privatisation {{of the service}} through concession to Metrovías, the company temporarily moved the closing time back two hours in 1994 to carry out works on the lines, a change which was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions {{as well as a}} campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 on weekdays and 3:00 on <b>Fridays</b> <b>and</b> Saturdays. These proposals have been rejected by Subterráneos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced schedule is needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.|$|E

5|$|The Hindu elite {{follow the}} {{religious}} ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding {{their faith in}} local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship {{and how it is}} housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity. These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community. In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on <b>Fridays,</b> <b>and</b> a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.|$|E
