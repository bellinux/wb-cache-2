40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a technique to}} identify requirements <b>discordances</b> among stakeholders. This technique is validated in experiments. An extended version of the goaloriented requirements elicitation method, termed AGORA (Attributed Goal-Oriented Analysis), and its supporting tool are used. Two types of requirements <b>discordances</b> among stakeholders are defined: the first arises from the different interpretations by the stakeholders {{and the second is}} the result of different evaluations of preferences. <b>Discordances</b> are detected by the preference matrices in AGORA. Each preference matrix represents both preferences of each stakeholder and the estimated preferences of other stakeholders. A supporting tool for the AGORA method was developed. This tool is a groupware that seamlessly combines face-to-face meetings for goal elicitation and distributed individual sessions for scoring preference values. The experimental results showed that the proposed classification of <b>discordances</b> was sound and that the occurrences of the requirements <b>discordances</b> could be detected by preference matrices...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To compare three {{methods for}} using HIV- 1 {{genotype}} to predict antiretroviral drug susceptibility. Methods: We applied three genotypic interpretation algorithms to 478 reverse transcriptase (RT) and 410 protease sequences for which phenotypic data were available. Sequences {{were obtained from}} clinical practice and from published sequences in the Stanford HIV- 1 RT and Protease Sequence Database. The genotypic interpretation algorithms included: Stanford HIVdb program (HIVdb), the Visible Genetics/Bayer Diagnostics Guidelines 6. 0 (VGI) and a genotypic interpretation program (AntiRetroScan, ARS) developed at the University of Siena, Italy. Genotypic interpretations were normalized to a three-level output: susceptible, intermediate and resistant. <b>Discordances</b> were defined as differences between genotype and phenotype for the same virus isolate. <b>Discordances</b> for which an isolate was considered susceptible by one test but resistant by another test were considered major <b>discordances.</b> Results: The frequency of major <b>discordances</b> between genotype and phenotype was 10. 6, 13. 7 and 15. 7...|$|R

To assess the concordance of these algorithms and to identify sequences causing interalgorithm <b>discordances,</b> we applied four publicly avail-able algorithms to the sequences of isolates from 2, 045 individuals in northern Cali-fornia.

However, there is nothing {{as far as we know}} that requires this. All that is required is that a B cell recognising antigen X endocytoses and processes a protein Y (normally =X) and presents it to a T cell. Roosnek and Lanzavecchia showed that B cells recognising IgGFc could get help from any T cell responding to an antigen co-endocytosed with IgG by the B cell as part of an immune complex. In coeliac disease it seems likely that B cells recognising tissue transglutamine are helped by T cells recognising gliadin.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} term, Prime Minister Sharif built Pakistan's first major {{motorway}} {{which is known}} as M2 Motorway (3MM), often called the Autobahn of South Asia. This semi-government and semi-private mega-project was completed in November 1997 {{at a cost of}} US$989.12million. His critics questioned the layout of the highway, criticizing its excessive length, its being away from the important cities, and the absence of link roads even with important towns. Furthermore, the funds originally allocated to the construction of Indus Highway linking Peshawar with Karachi were shifted to M2 Motorway thus benefiting his native Punjab and Kashmir provinces at the cost of other provinces. When the true nature of Sharif's motives were exposed, the people of other provinces were extremely displeased, leading to <b>discordance</b> and disharmony among provinces. The welfare of other provinces, notable Sindh and Balochistan Province, were not seriously taken by Sharif and his ruling chief ministers and people of these provinces were disenchanted with him. After the completion of this mega project, Sharif's policies were undermined by lack of capital for investments. There was an influx of foreign capital when he loosened foreign exchange restrictions and opened Karachi Stock Exchange to foreign capital, but the government remained short of funds for investments.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the accuracy of}} direct susceptibility testing (DST) with conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), both using disk diffusion, on clinical samples. A total of 123 clinical samples (respiratory tract samples, urine, vaginal and abdominal abscess discharges, bile fluid and a haematoma punctate) were selected on various indications; direct inoculation on Mueller–Hinton agar and antibiotic paper disks were applied. In parallel, standard culture, identification and AST on the colonies grown overnight was executed. Both AST and DST were interpreted after identification of the isolates. The results from both AST and DST for 11 antibiotics tested on 97 samples with Gram-negative rods showed 93. 4  % total agreement, 1. 6  % minor <b>discordances,</b> 4. 6  % major <b>discordances</b> and 0. 4  % very major <b>discordances.</b> Analysing the discordant results, DST predominantly resulted in more resistant isolates than AST.

For the 26 samples yielding staphylococci, a total agreement of 100  % was observed for the nine antibiotics tested. Overall, the highest percentage of discordant results occurred for the β-lactam antibiotics amoxicillin–clavulanate (13. 4  %) and cefuroxime (12. 4  %). When used selectively and interpreted carefully, DST on clinical samples is potentially very useful in the management of critically ill patients, as the time to results is shortened by approximately 24  h.

25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell <b>discordance</b> this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{hypothesis}} {{for the cause}} of motion sickness is that it functions as a defense mechanism against neurotoxins. The area postrema in the brain is responsible for inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When feeling motion but not seeing it (for example, in a ship with no windows), the inner ear transmits to the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell the brain that everything is still. As a result of the <b>discordance,</b> the brain will {{come to the conclusion that}} the individual is hallucinating and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The brain responds by inducing vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin. Treisman's indirect argument has recently been questioned via an alternative direct evolutionary hypothesis, as well as modified and extended via a direct poison hypothesis. The direct evolutionary hypothesis essentially argues that there are plausible means by which ancient real or apparent motion could have contributed directly to the evolution of aversive reactions, without the need for the co-opting of a poison response as posited by Treisman. Nevertheless, the direct poison hypothesis argues that there still are plausible ways in which the body's poison response system may have played a role in shaping the evolution of some of the signature symptoms that characterize motion sickness.|$|E
