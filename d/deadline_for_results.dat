40|$|Objectives, policy {{relevance}} {{and content of}} workshop The QUENCH workshop would be co-organised by KIT & ITU and {{in cooperation with the}} IAEA. Its aim would be to bring together all those scientists working in the field of reactor safety, particularly in the field of fuel rod & bundle degradation under extreme/transient conditions in the reactor as well as in storage pools. Based on the activities of the QUENCH & other severe nuclear accident facilities at KIT Campus Nord & ITU it offers a means of simulating these complex accidents and providing data on real fuel and fuel simulants for modellers both at the small and the plant scale. This is of central relevance to the above EC programme's objectives of operational safety improvement. It will offer added value in that neighbouring countries such as Russia & Ukraine also attend these workshops as well as most SARNET 2 members which is a Europe-wide Network of Excellence. Of special value is also the co-operation with the IAEA via the Technical Working Group on Fuel Performance and Technology.

The last conference was held in September 2011 in Tsukuba, Japan. Objectives, policy relevance and content of workshop The conference will include oral and poster presentations, and additional meetings of the ICRM Working Groups will provide an informal setting for deepening discussions of the conference themes. A special session on science-based advice to policy makers will be a novelty at this conference; a speaker from DG ENER is invited. The conference topics Intercomparisons, Measurement standards and reference materials, Radionuclide metrology in life sciences and Quality assurance and uncertainty evaluation in radioactivity measurements – next to those on techniques – will be of special value for target countries, developing a measurement infrastructure in radioactivity. Within several of the conference topics, radioactivity measurement in environmental samples will be an important issue, close {{to the needs of the}} target countries with a view to obligations arising from the Euratom Treaty for member states. In particular, intercomparisons organised on behalf of DG ENER among environmental monitoring laboratories have always been discussed during the past four ICRM conferences.

40|$|We {{extend a}} recently-proposed {{framework}} for the rate-distortion optimized transmission of packetized media. The original framework assumed that each packet has a single arrival deadline and that a packet is useless if it arrives after its deadline.

One example is the case of decoders that can recover from late packet arrivals through the accelerated retroactive decoding (ARD) of the dependency chain. We extend the original framework to consider multiple <b>deadlines.</b> <b>Results</b> <b>for</b> the ARD decoding case show that the multiple deadline formulation yields rate-distortion improvements that increase as latency constraints grow tighter, with PSNR gains of up to 3. 15 dB and bit-rate savings of up to 47 % observed at low latencies...|$|R

Okapi is a simple and robust set-oriented system based on a generalised probabilistic model with facilities for relevance feedback, but also supporting {{a full range of}} deterministic Boolean and quasi-Boolean operations. For TREC [...] 1 [1] the "standard" Robertson [...] Sparck Jones weighting function was used for all runs (equation 1, see also [5]). City's performance was not outstandingly good among comparable systems, and the intention for TREC [...] 2 was to develop and investigate a number of alternative probabilistic term-weighting functions. Other possibilities included varieties of query expansion, database models enabling paragraph retrieval and the use of phrases obtained by query parsing. Unfortunately, a prolonged disk failure prevented realistic test runs until almost the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> submission of <b>results.</b> A full inversion of the disks 1 and 2 database was only achieved a few hours before the final automatic runs. None of the new weighting functions (Section 1. 1) was properly evaluated until after the results had been submitted to NIST; we have since discovered that several of these models perform much better than the weighting functions used for the official runs, and most of the results reported herein are from these later runs...|$|R
