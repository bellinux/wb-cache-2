5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{traces of}} {{platinum}} {{in the gold}} used in ancient Egyptian tombs and hieroglyphs as early as 1200 BC. However, the extent of early Egyptians' knowledge of the metal is unclear. It is quite possible they did not recognize there was platinum in their gold.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> nearly 500 {{planetary}} {{systems with}} multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star.|$|E
5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, theorists <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> many {{different}} realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved {{are generally not}} viable models of the real world, but they have certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful for solving problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute {{claimed to}} <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> element 87 when {{analyzing}} pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto-optical machine. Allison requested {{that it be}} named virginium after {{his home state of}} Virginia, along with the symbols Vi and Vm. In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of his discovery.|$|E

5|$|Most {{settlements}} in ancient Egypt were {{situated on the}} alluvium of the Nile floodplain. This moist environment was unfavorable for long-term preservation of papyrus documents. Archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> a larger quantity of papyrus documents in desert settlements on land elevated above the floodplain, and in settlements that lacked irrigation works, such as Elephantine, El-Lahun, and El-Hiba.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 2010, astronomers using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory {{announced}} that, while {{viewing the}} remnant of SN 1979C {{in the galaxy}} Messier 100, they <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> an object which could be a young, 30-year-old black hole. NASA also noted the possibility this object could be a spinning neutron star producing a wind of high energy particles.|$|E
5|$|Over the decades, {{experimental}} condensed matter physicists <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{a number}} of exotic states of matter, including superconductors and superfluids. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including Subir Sachdev hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence {{will make it possible}} to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.|$|E

Officials believe the list of registered students matches the number of students evacuated or captured from the mosque and Jamia Hafsa.|$|E
5|$|Researchers <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> archaeological {{evidence}} of musical instruments {{in many parts}} of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The American artist Miriam C. Rice pioneered {{research}} into using various mushrooms for natural dyes. Starting {{in the late}} 1960s, she discovered mushroom dyes for a complete rainbow palette. Swedish and American mycologists, building upon Rice's research, <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> sources for true blues (Sarcodon squamosus) and mossy greens (Hydnellum geogenium). Hypholoma fasciculare provides a yellow dye, and fungi such as Phaeolus schweinitzii and Pisolithus tinctorius are used in dyeing textiles and paper.|$|E
25|$|Much of Europe came {{to doubt}} that Leibniz <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> {{calculus}} independently of Newton, and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected. Voltaire, an admirer of Newton, also wrote Candide {{at least in part}} to discredit Leibniz's claim to <b>having</b> <b>discovered</b> calculus and Leibniz's charge that Newton's theory of universal gravitation was incorrect.|$|R

Examining and {{measuring}} Change radiation, he <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> that all known Change Projectors were actually redistributors of Change radiation from a single source, a so-called Grand Projector. Were this projector destroyed, all creatures would cease to function, and the Overlords would likely be removed whence they came. <b>Having</b> <b>discovered</b> {{the source of the}} Change Radiation - at Mount Silverstone - they set out with Deceptors to find and destroy the source, which would hopefully bring reality back to normal.|$|R
