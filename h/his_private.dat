5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, {{the first player to}} pocket <b>his</b> <b>private</b> number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing <b>his</b> <b>private</b> number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of <b>his</b> <b>private</b> number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but is not out of the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing <b>his</b> <b>private</b> number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E
