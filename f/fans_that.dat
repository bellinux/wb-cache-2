5|$|McBride's {{tenure as}} owner was viewed favorably, {{partly because of}} the Browns' on-field success but also because he gave Paul Brown a free hand to coach and sign players. One of the new {{ownership}} group's first acts was to assure Cleveland <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> Brown would retain complete control over the football side of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> {{it was one of the}} weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} {{advertisement for}} Late Registration was directed and animated by Maggie Rogers, Abby Johnson and Paul Tuersley of Mr & Mrs Smith Design Ltd. It featured a gigantic version of West's teddy bear mascot Dropout Bear roaming {{through the streets}} of London. The advert received an award from British music magazine Music Week for Best Music TV Commercial. On the day of the album's release, West made an in-store appearance at New York's Lincoln Center Tower Records to autograph copies for <b>fans.</b> <b>That</b> same day, Late Registration was released in its entirety for online streaming on AOL Music.|$|E

5|$|Balls Mahoney faced Masato Tanaka in {{the second}} Extreme Rules match of the night. Mahoney got the early {{advantage}} after throwing a beer can {{in the face of}} Tanaka. Tanaka gained the advantage after executing a superplex off the top rope. Mahoney won the match after hitting Tanaka with a steel chair. Before the WWE Championship match, Eugene came to the ring to cut a promo. He reminded the <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> he was Eric Bischoff's nephew, before being interrupted by The Sandman. Sandman hit Eugene repeatedly with his Singapore cane, leaving Eugene to run to the back, with The Sandman chasing after him.|$|E
5|$|In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the Tar Heel <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> {{watched the}} game on the {{television}} flooded Franklin Street after the victory over the Jayhawks. Over two thousand people rushed the street, which prevented cars from passing for over an hour. Police were required to help maintain the crowds. This has since turned into a tradition where people overrun Franklin Street following a win over the Duke Blue Devils or whenever the Tar Heels have won a National Championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design {{was too much of}} a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E

5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{were indeed}} relegated {{at the end}} of the 2007–08 season. Despite intense {{speculation}} that he would move to Rangers, with Rangers fans taunting Hibs <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> Brown would sign for them, Brown agreed a move to Celtic. Willie McKay commented that Brown was excited about playing for such a successful club and the chance to play in the UEFA Champions League. Brown was transferred for £4.4 million, the largest transfer fee exchanged between two Scottish clubs. The previous record was the £4 million transfer of Duncan Ferguson from Dundee United to Rangers. Brown scored in his final appearance for Hibs, against Celtic, for whom he had agreed to sign the previous week. During the game he was cheered by both sets of supporters.|$|E
5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain extraneous plot points relating to Attack of the Clones. Lucas had previously promised <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to {{devote more time to}} Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E

5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> {{had grown}} up with the music in the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E
5|$|Strange Journey {{released}} on October 8, 2009 in Japan, and March 23, 2010 in North America. The first {{information on a}} new title in the series appeared {{in the form of}} a teaser site created on July 16, 2009 for the Japanese Atlus website, depicting Earth with a large hole in the bottom. Using the page's source code and locating an unused graphic, it was deciphered the game's title was Strange Journey and confirmed it to be a Megami Tensei title. A week later, Atlus officially announced the game for the DS, clearing up a rumor among <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> the title was an entry in the Persona series.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews.

As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, {{it seemed like a}} suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E

5|$|The old rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the final round}} of the 2000–01 season, when one of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian League history was played. Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium, Bežigrad, and both teams were {{competing}} for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home team needed a win for the title, while a draw was enough for Maribor. The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off, and the stadium with a capacity of 8,500 was completely sold out. At the end, the match ended with a draw (1–1) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3,000 of their <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> gathered in Ljubljana that day.|$|E
5|$|With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. {{splitting}} up, the Midnight Express {{needed a}} new team to defend their newly won title against. They began {{a long series of}} matches against The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches were so well received by the <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> independent promoters all over the United States still book those two teams against each other today, 20 years after the rivalry started.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Many {{rock and}} metal <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> became Christians through the {{ministry}} of Christian metal bands were rejected from churches in the 1980s. In 1984, California pastor Bob Beeman saw this problem and soon started the ministry called Sanctuary - The Rock and Roll Refuge. This fellowship brought many musicians together and formed groups such as Tourniquet, Deliverance, Vengeance and Mortal that would soon become ground breaking acts in Christian music culture. Sanctuary's first worship leader was Stryper's vocalist Michael Sweet and later Barren Cross' bass player Jim LaVerde. Sanctuary sponsored the first Christian metal festival, The Metal Mardi Gras, held in 1987 in Los Angeles. This proved influential and soon Christian metal festivals were organized elsewhere as well. Sanctuary's activities began spreading, and it had 36 parishes all over the United States at its peak by the 1990s. The Sanctuary parishes {{had a significant impact}} on the Christian metal movement: groups that would later become notable such as P.O.D. performed their first concerts in Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{apparent}} misconception among video game <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> the SNES title Secret of Evermore {{was released in}} lieu of an English language version of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995. Secret of Evermore was developed by a new team at Square's office in Redmond, Washington called Square Soft. According to Fehdrau, no one {{who worked on the}} Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 2000, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released with ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana as part of the Seiken Densetsu Collection on June 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard {{posted a}} release {{date for the}} game's first beta of Summer 2009, but failed to release a beta during that time. Since May 6, 2009, it was {{possible}} to sign up for the beta phase of the game. In November 2009, the game's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured <b>fans</b> <b>that</b> it would happen next year. In February 2010, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month. On February 17, 2010, StarCraft II began closed beta testing, as promised. The beta was expected to last for 3–5 months. Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $400. Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9. According to the company, they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of beta testing. As of July 23, 2010, eighteen patches had been released for the beta (only seventeen on European servers), including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor. On May 12, 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X, for the users who had signed up. On May 17, 2010, Blizzard announced that {{the first phase of the}} beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31, but it was later extended to June 7. The second phase began on July 7, 2010, and ended on July 19, 2010.|$|E
