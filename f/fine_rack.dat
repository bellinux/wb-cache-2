Both are typically used on a surface plate and have a heavy base with an accurately flat, smooth underside.|$|E

50|$|Lillet (French pronunciation: li'le), classed as {{an aromatised wine}} within EU law, is a French wine-based {{aperitif}} from Podensac. It {{is a blend of}} 85% Bordeaux region wines (Semillon for the Blanc and for the Rosé, Merlot for the Rouge) and 15% macerated liqueurs, mostly citrus liqueurs (peels of sweet oranges from Spain and Morocco and peels of bitter green oranges from Haiti). The mix is then stirred in oak vats until blended. During the aging process, Lillet is handled as a Bordeaux wine (undergoing <b>fining,</b> <b>racking,</b> filtering etc.).|$|R

50|$|In 1961, the Redskins drafted {{their first}} African-American player, RB Ernie Davis — {{the first black}} Heisman Trophy winner. Davis was {{subsequently}} traded to the Cleveland Browns for future Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. The Redskins were the last NFL team to integrate, having maintained an all-white roster due to owner George Marshall's racist views. Pressure from the NFL {{and the federal government}} finally forced them to give in. Although Bobby Mitchell was only welcomed to the team grudgingly, he delivered a <b>fine</b> performance, <b>racking</b> up 1,384 yards and 11 TDs during the 1962 season. Nonetheless, the Redskins still struggled with a 5-7-2 record that year. 1963 brought an even worse 3-11 showing where Norm Snead threw 27 interceptions. 1964-1965 saw two consecutive 6-8 seasons after which Bill McPeak was fired.|$|R

Access to thesis {{and accompanying}} PDF permanently restricted to Ball State community onlyMy grandfathers {{and my two}} great uncles, my old men, were heroes to me. Growing up in the cushy suburbs of Cincinnati, I knew I {{wanted to be a}} man like they were men. I wanted to invent and build to solve problems, to hunt and fish, to know how to do hard labor, and to live like they lived. In this immersion journalism project I seek to reconcile the differences between my lack of self-reliance, the skills I deemed necessary to be considered a man, and the skills my old men possessed, by attempting to live like they lived. I worked at Smoke Rise Ranch as a ranch hand for three weeks, and let loose twenty-one yearling heifers. I went hunting for deer, but never fired my gun. I built a very <b>fine</b> quilt <b>rack</b> after first failing miserably. These efforts at attaining a connection with my old men fill these pages as lighthearted anecdotes of incompetence and struggle, moments of triumph, and my recognition of my heroes’ flaws: {{it is not easy to}} deconstruct a hero. It is a narrative of choices, of attempting to define the kind of man I want to be for my family in light of the kind of men they were. Some names have been changed.

Alternatively, a combination of attraction and repulsion measures can sucessfully pass fish by the intake and into a safe corridor. At the Laudal powerplant in Norway, Atlantic salmon smolts were tagged with conventional radio tags during the migration period in four different years. A statistical model could be developed to predict how flow diversion could attract fish into a bypass channel and strobe light {{in front of the}} intake had repulsing effect during night. In order to create favorable flow diversion at the intake, manipulation of mountanious reservoirs were modelled and the economic cost related to flood spill and flow changes were calculated. Finally, an advanced computational fluid dynamics model was calibrated and applied at the intake to describe the hydraulics at different flow conditions and relate the physical variables to accurate recordings from stateof-the-art three dimensional radio tags surgically implanted in smolts. The results can be used to generate general rules for safe bypassing of salmon smolts at intakes...|$|R
5000|$|The Road Test: The {{road test}} is {{conducted}} {{on the streets of}} Hamilton, Ontario, the location of the show's decisive drive since Canada's WorstDriver 7. The test will be done in a Ford Thunderbird Jason is first to take the final drive, which is the first time he's driven in a major city with his glasses; unfortunately, they don't prevent him from missing the first turn, and his rather unsafe U-turn results in him causing a small traffic jam as he tries to get back on course. Subsequently, he runs red lights and stops at green lights, makes prohibited turns, and stops in crosswalks. He gets onto the highway safely enough, but then makes a huge mistake by slowing down and dropping gear, causing the engine to rev dangerously high before Andrew makes him put it back in the correct gear. He then misses the turn-off and makes an extremely dangerous lane change to get back on-track. Adding insult to injury, {{on the way back to}} the starting point, he parks in two spots designated for use by medical personnel only, and then urinates in public. After this, and the 16 total infractions (with $1,865 in potential <b>fines)</b> he <b>racks</b> up, Andrew predicts that the only way Jason will avoid being Canada's Worst Driver is if Chanie and/or Siham has a spectacularly bad final drive. Chanie gets off to a bad start by illegally stopping in an intersection, a mistake she makes again twice in quick succession. She follows this up with a plethora of mistakes, including illegal lane changes, driving in the wrong lane, making prohibited turns, and even driving into a bus station (the same one, in fact, that Canada's Worst Driver 8 co-"winner" [...] Flora Wang drove into on her own final drive). As the drive progresses, Andrew notes that whereas Jason simply seemed inattentive in his drive, Chanie seems totally ignorant of the most basic driving laws. While the car is turning onto the highway, Andrew notices that Chanie is once more adopting the bizarre driving postures that she has been repeatedly told not to use; like Jason, she proves far too slow on the highway, and unbelievably, makes exactly the same illegal lane change that he did while exiting the highway. When they eventually get back to the starting parking lot, Chanie tries to claim that her drive was good because she [...] "didn't hit anything," [...] causing Andrew to point out that in fact, her drive was even worse than Jason's with 24 infractions (and $2,715 in potential fines). Siham has the final drive, and, like Jason, she misses the first turn; she then deals with her mistake in an even more unsafe manner, cutting through a parking lot and ending up driving the wrong way down a one-way street. The rest of her drive goes mostly without incident, but she has what turns out to be the worst of the three highway drives, nearly turning off onto the wrong exit, then dangerously re-entering the flow of traffic and leaving her indicator light on. On the way back to the parking lot Andrew has to prevent her from driving into an intersection, which would have caused a collision with another car. She then goes off-course and does a U-turn in an intersection, against a red light, committing three moving violations in one go. In the end, her drive is the best of the three statistically speaking, but she still had 10 infractions (with a potential $1,450 in fines).|$|R
