40|$|Abstract—In this research, an aerobic {{composting}} {{method is}} studied to reuse organic <b>waste</b> from rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> as soil fertilizer and {{to study the}} effect of cellulolytic microbial activator (CMA) as the activator in the rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> composting. The performance of the composting process was monitored {{as a function of}} carbon and organic matter decomposition rate, temperature and moisture content. The results indicate that the rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> is best composted with water hyacinth and sludge than composted alone. In addition, the CMA is more affective when mixed with the rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste,</b> water hyacinth and sludge since a good fertilizer is achieved. When adding CMA into the rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> composted alone, the finished product does not achieve a standard of fertilizer, especially the C/N ratio. Finally, the finished products of composting rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> and water hyacinth and sludge (both CMA and without CMA), can be an environmental friendly alternative to solve the disposal problems of rubber <b>factory</b> <b>waste.</b> Since the C/N ratio, pH, moisture content, temperature, and nutrients of the finished products are acceptable for agriculture use.

40|$|Since mid- 1980 's, {{grassroots}} {{protests against}} polluting <b>factories,</b> <b>waste</b> dumps and development projects have constituted a main pattern of environmental activism in Taiwan.

Therefore there is a united agreement that {{something needs to be done}} for reducing the causes of global warming and climate change.

(Shah, 2015) Realizing the climate issues and the fact that greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time, Sweden started an environmental protection agency in 1967. Since then Sweden has a strong reputation as one of leaders and environmental pioneer worldwide. The government provides various opportunities for environmentally friendly technologies developments within the country and abroad. (Sweden. se, 2016) The case company is one of high technology Swedish companies that are trying to provide air treatment solutions for industries. They mostly work within food frying <b>factories,</b> <b>waste</b> handling and biogas industries. Their solution is highly beneficial technologically as it reduce industrial pollution as well as transferring the heat and purified water from the recovery process back to the system. Consequently they help companies to save costs through low energy consumption and to be environmentally friendly. However, due to economical globalization and other competitors, especially in Sweden, their high technology is not a guarantee for financial and competitive advantages. Marketing strategy and strategic marketing plan is the necessity for their success in the market within Sweden and internationally.

Through SWOT analysis I have highlighted the strength points which the case company needs to focus on when introducing their product to customers and compete with the competitors. On the other hand the weaknesses were also analyzed and I have came up with a few suggestions that might help in this case in order to take advantage from their opportunities to improve weaknesses.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Composting {{is one of}} {{the applied}} methods to organic waste {{disposal}} methods. In this study, some agricultural and industrial organic wastes of agricultural sector are composted, as different compositions, to see whether they are usable as agricultural aids.

30|$|It {{is without}} a doubt that the tea {{is the most popular}} and widely {{consumed}} beverage that is consumed around the world. The consumption of tea alone equals that of coffee, chocolate, soft drinks and alcohol combined (Macfarlane and Macfarlane 2011). It has been estimated that around the world somewhere between 18 to 20 billion cups of tea are drunk on a daily basis. The prosperity of the tea beverage industry in China has resulted in it being accountable for over 20 % of the domestic beverage market alone. Such a staggering level of consumption brings forth with the issues regarding the safe disposal of the tea leaves as about 90 % of the tea is left behind post-extraction and consumption (Auta and Hameed 2011 b; Peng et al. 2013). The issues do not stop with the waste generated post-consumption as the manufacturing process also contributes to the amount of tea-based organic wastes. It has been reported that about 30, 000 tons of tea <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> in Turkey are disposed of in the small bays surrounding Black Sea (Malkoç and Nuhoglu 2003; Yagmur et al. 2008). The factory-rejected tea that is generated mainly during the withering process of production alone amounted to 100, 000 tons per annum in Malaysia (Nasuha and Hameed 2011 a, b). The annual production of about 857, 000 tons of tea in India results in the generation of about 190, 000 tons of tea <b>factory</b> <b>waste</b> (Wasewar et al. 2008). Furthermore, the rising popularity of tea seed oil results in the generation of over a million tons of tea seed shells as agro-industrial wastes in China alone (Gao et al. 2013). It is quite evident that the generation of such massive quantities of wastes from the tea industry alone will undoubtedly result in a host of environmental problems associated with their improper disposal. Furthermore, the lack of sustainable waste management practices concerning tea industry wastes exacerbates the issue further. Waste tea leaves and the <b>factory</b> generated tea <b>wastes</b> can be classified as carbonaceous adsorbents. Their physiochemical characteristics such as large surface capacity and the fast kinetics of adsorption make it suitable low-cost adsorbent for the removal of effluents from wastewater and also as an inexpensive precursor material for the production of activated carbon.|$|R
