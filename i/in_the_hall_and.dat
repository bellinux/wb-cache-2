5|$|The {{history of}} the temple begins in 963, when it was {{recorded}} that Ten-Thousand Buddha Hall (Wànfó diàn 万佛殿) was built. The date is written on a beam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> is also the date given by a local history of Pingyao county written in the 19th century. A stela written in 1819 also confirms this date. Wanfo Hall is the oldest building at Zhenguo temple, {{and is the only}} surviving building that dates from the short-lived Northern Han dynasty. Although little is known of the temple's history, stelae record that it was renovated in 1540 and in 1816. In 1997, along with Pingyao city and Shuanglin Temple, the Zhenguo temple was inscribed on the World Heritage list as ‘Ancient City of Pingyao’.|$|E

500|$|The {{plasterwork}} in the parlour {{displays the}} arms of Robert Wynn himself, and Robert Wynn's bedchamber above the brewhouse shows the combined arms of the Wynn and Griffith families, which are generally given equal prominence throughout the house.

In the 16th century, Wynn's heraldry {{would probably have been}} echoed in the furnishings of the house, including the fabrics, cups and silverware. The plasterwork also incorporates a number of classical themes, but these are not as well executed as the badges and other emblems: the historian Rick Turner describes them as [...] "rather token additions", and Smith considers this part of the decoration to be [...] "naive".|$|E

500|$|Adlington Hall is {{a country}} house near Adlington, Cheshire. The oldest part of the {{existing}} building, the Great Hall, was constructed between 1480 and 1505; the east wing was added in 1581. The Legh family has lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> in previous buildings on the same site since the early 14thcentury. [...] After the house was occupied by Parliamentary forces during the Civil War, changes {{were made to the}} north wing, including encasing the Great Hall in brick, inserting windows, and installing an organ in the Great Hall. [...] In the 18thcentury the house was inherited by Charles Legh who organised a series of major changes. [...] These included building a new west wing, which incorporated a ballroom, and a south wing with a large portico. [...] It is possible that Charles Legh himself was the architect for these additions. [...] He also played a large part in planning and designing the gardens, woodland and parkland, which included a number of buildings of various types, including a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge that carried a summerhouse.|$|E

Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times said that [...] "the video is sometimes distracting and blurry, wonder what went wrong during recording. The angles are awkward, especially when the audience members are shown touching Madonna's hand. Was it really necessary to show a fan coming unannounced on the stage?" [...] Terry Atkinson from the same paper said, [...] "This follows the typical concert video format of putting you in the best seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> letting the aura of a superior performer encaptivate your senses." [...] Sylvia Chase from The Wichita Eagle said that [...] "seeing Madonna live in an arena and seeing her up, close and personal in the tour cassette is totally different. The energy, the movements, the provocation—all captures you more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave it a positive review, stating [...] "filmed with abrupt, swooping camera movements that accentuate the singer's flouncing, slightly ungainly style of dancing, Madonna Live vividly captures the contradictory elements that have made the performer into a cultural icon {{in spite of a}} shrill, limited singing voice. In close-up, Madonna's provocative pouts, wiggles and come-hither glances become a more than half-deliberate burlesque of erotic centerfold photography. Both her post-disco music and defiant strut suggest a child's parody of grown-up posturing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style house that is {{believed}} to have been originally constructed around 1696. The main block of the house is built in the double cube of the Georgian style. It is unknown if the house originally began as a one-room one-story house with the original structure having been on the current east-end of the main block. The expansion and alteration of houses in this way was common in Ledyard and tool markings and different fenestration patterns are supporting evidence for this theory. The strongest evidence is the pitsaw marks found on the chimney girts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> parlor, exposed framing and sheathing has markings consistent with a water-powered up-and-down saw. It is certain that the house had achieved its two-story and two-room appearance by 1726 due to its parlor being used as a meeting room for church services. Further evidence in the construction of the fireplace flues which indicates that the main block of the house was completed prior to the American Revolution. Around 1780, the main house was extended by [...] in the rear during a two-story addition that gives the house a slight saltbox appearance. This changes were made while under the ownership of Theophilus Avery. Around 1870, under the ownership Theophilus Avery's grandson, also Theophilus Avery, the original kitchen ell was removed from the building and became a separate building to the east of the house. The new and present ell that was constructed served as an open shed until 1965 when it was converted to a shop and office.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{credited}} West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, [...] "establishing a {{style of}} introspective yet glossy rap [...] ", and called him [...] "as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful {{things to say about}} college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up." [...] West's middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers. Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized listeners upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> <b>and</b> Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing. In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a [...] "new art-pop era" [...] in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both creative exploration and extravagant wealth.|$|E
