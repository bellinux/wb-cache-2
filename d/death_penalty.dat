5|$|According to some sources, Clinton was a <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{opponent}} {{in his early}} years, but he eventually switched positions. During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was reinstated in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could face the <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in all circumstances.|$|E
50|$|The High Court, which functioned until 1949, judged 108 cases; it {{pronounced}} eight <b>death</b> <b>penalties,</b> {{including one}} for an elderly Pétain, whose appeal failed. Only three of the <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> were carried out: Pierre Laval; Fernand de Brinon, Vichy's Ambassador in Paris to the German authorities; and Joseph Darnand, head of the Milice.|$|R
50|$|In the {{subsequent}} trials four people {{were convicted of}} murder and given <b>death</b> <b>penalties.</b>|$|R
500|$|Beside this [...] "trial of the parliamentarians", {{military}} courts relayed by civilian courts condemned 5,765 Malagasy nationals (865 {{by military}} courts and 4,891 by civilians). The military courts delivered 44 <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> but carried out only eight executions, while 16 of the 129 <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> pronounced by the civilian courts were enacted. Through amnesties and remissions, all prisoners (except the leaders) were freed in 1957.|$|R
5|$|On 26 September, the Council of Ministers, {{headed by}} Franco, {{confirmed}} the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for {{five of those}} sentenced: FRAP members José Humberto Baena, Ramón García Sanz and José Luis Sánchez Bravo and ETA members Ángel Otaegui and Juan Paredes, while commuting the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{in the case of}} the remaining six.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{was also}} viewed {{as one of}} the crucial swing votes on a measure to repeal the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Colorado and use the {{resulting}} savings to fund a statewide cold case unit. Although he first voted to remove the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> repeal from the legislation, he later voted in support of a version of the bill containing the repeal, which came within one vote of passing the legislature {{on the final day of}} the session.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{of capital}} {{punishment}} gathered at the Utah State Capitol to hold a rally during the final appeals. The protest was attended by Gardner's family, and was organized by Utahans for Alternatives to the <b>Death</b> <b>Penalty.</b> The protest also included the support of Brian King of the Utah House of Representatives, who pledged to urge the legislature to reconsider {{the use of the}} capital punishment. The family of murder victim Michael Burdell had also appealed on Gardner's behalf, stating that Burdell was a pacifist who would have opposed the <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>death</b> <b>penalty's</b> {{suspension}} in 1965, {{there have}} been continued public and media calls for its reintroduction, particularly prompted by high-profile murder cases.|$|R

50|$|Later, the <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> of Ricky and Raymond Tison {{were reduced}} to life {{sentences}} because they were both under twenty {{at the time of}} the crimes. Greenawalt was executed in 1997.|$|R
50|$|The Mattan family's {{first attempt}} to {{overturn}} the conviction was denied in 1969 by the Home Secretary James Callaghan; by this stage, three {{years had passed since}} the <b>death</b> <b>penalty's</b> abolition.|$|R

5|$|This was {{the last}} use of the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Spain; {{following}} the death of Francisco Franco, two months later, no further executions took place. The 1978 Spanish Constitution largely abolished the <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> with the exception of limited cases in times of war, and these exceptions were abolished in 1995. In 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used to convict two of those executed had violated their rights and awarded compensation to their families.|$|E
5|$|After {{a three-week}} trial, in late July a twelve-person jury {{unanimously}} found both Owen and West guilty of murder. The state prosecutors, Kathy Pryce and Karen Seymour Johnson, requested that Owen and West face the <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though the prosecution had sought the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received sentences of 30 and 25 years respectively. Lawyers of the three sentenced to death appealed the sentences.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crime}} {{involved}} {{more than one}} victim, the prosecutors decided to request the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> when the case went to trial. When faced with this possibility, Green's defense team brought in Sean O'Brien, a representative of a Missouri anti-capital-punishment group.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the hearings, the prosecutor, Liautier, demanded four <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> {{and many}} {{sentences}} of lifelong forced labour, with lighter penalties for the accomplices. The verdicts were handed down on 12 December.|$|R
25|$|Freisler {{appears in}} fictionalised {{form in the}} 1947 Hans Fallada novel Every Man Dies Alone. In 1943 he tried and handed down <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> to Otto and Elise Hampel, whose true story {{inspired}} Fallada's novel.|$|R

5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, wherein {{the court ruled that}} Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|From May 1, 1889, {{changes made}} by Congress allowed appeals of capital {{convictions}} to the United States Supreme Court. Forty-four {{cases in which}} Parker imposed the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> were appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned and ordered a re-trial for 30 of them.|$|E
25|$|By May 1951, the CCP Central Committee {{had issued}} a {{directive}} {{calling for a}} stop to the killings, giving the power of arrest and execution back to the central government. Furthermore, it clarified the procedures of dealing with accused counterrevolutionaries, as well as limiting the execution of <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> to those with 'blood debts' or to have 'committed serious crimes'. Others who had received <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> would have their sentences commuted by two years of manual labor, with their performance assessed as {{to determine whether the}} sentence would still be necessary. Despite the directive, while mass arrests and executions subsided in some regions, they still continued, albeit with much more secrecy.|$|R
50|$|Friedrich Schumann {{was convicted}} of murder, and on 13 July 1920 {{he was sentenced to}} seven <b>death</b> <b>penalties,</b> one life sentence, ten years hard labour and several other {{sentences}} in Berlin. He was therefore sentenced to death.|$|R
