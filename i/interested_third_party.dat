40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies to}} which extent the social welfare {{of a game}} can be {{influenced}} by an <b>interested</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> within economic reason, i. e., by taking the implementation cost into account. Besides considering classic, benevolent mechanism designers, we also analyze malicious mechanism designers. For instance, this paper shows that a malicious mechanism designer can often corrupt games and worsen the players’ situation to a larger extent than {{the amount of money}} invested. Surprisingly, no money is needed at all in some cases. We provide algorithms for finding the so-called leverage in games and show that for optimistic mechanism designers, computing the leverage or approximations thereof is NP-hard. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We study {{bilateral}} bargaining {{problems with}} an <b>interested</b> <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> the stakeholder, that enjoys benefits upon a bilateral agreement. To address the stra-tegic implications of stakeholders over negotiations, we consider a model where two bargainers interact {{in the presence}} of a third party that (a) can transfer a share of her benefits to the bargainers but cannot receive a share of the bilateral surplus, and (b) while she may not participate in all periods of the negotiation, she cannot remain entirely inhibited. Our main findings are:(1) the stakeholder’s (reverse) liquidity constraint implies the existence of a multiplicity of stationary subgame perfect equilibria that include outcomes with very asymmetric bilateral agreements, and (2) the partial participation of the stakeholder may be the source of severe inefficiency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract How {{to design}} a fail-stop {{signature}} scheme is still a field in need of cultivation. If an attacker can successfully break an ordinary fail-stop signature scheme, then only a signer not a recipient is able to prove that a forgery has happened. This system only solves one dimensional of cryptographic problems. In this paper, we describe {{a new kind of}} digital signature scheme called fail-stop designated recipient signature scheme. The scheme allows a signer and an intended recipient to cooperatively provide a proof of forgery if an attacker can successfully forge a signature on a message m. The scheme also provides that the intended recipient is the only entity to verify the resulting signature and prove the validity to any <b>interested</b> <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> With this property, we show that our new signature scheme is the best alternative to solve certain problems concerning the protection of confidential documents especially those which are personally sensitive (to the owner) and is also applicable for group of recipients to verify a signature jointly (shared verification) in a group-oriented environment...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{progression}} of computing power and the increasing demands for detailed thermal performance assessment users are shifting from simplified design tools to comprehensive, dynamic thermal appraisal tools which are able to handle the complexity of design. From the standpoint of researchers and developers the days of a single person or even a small group maintaining and advancing such appraisal tools is problematic. Those who wish to advance the state-of-the-art in a particular facet of simulation are given the choice of creating their own tools from scratch or adopting an existing tool and extending it. This paper argues that the latter option can yield significant benefits to the researcher as well as the simulation community. Such a choice does, however contain numerous pitfalls if the core developers and <b>interested</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> researchers do not develop a support structure and means of collaboration.
