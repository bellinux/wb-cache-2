40|$|Standard {{theories}} of insurance, dating from Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976), stress {{the role of}} adverse selection in explaining the decision to purchase insurance. In these models, higher risk people buy full or near-full insurance, while lower risk people buy less complete coverage, if they buy at all. While this prediction appears to hold in some real world insurance markets, in many others, it is the lower risk individuals who have more insurance coverage. If the standard model is extended to allow individuals to vary in their risk tolerance {{as well as their}} risk type, this could explain why the relationship between insurance coverage and risk occurrence can be of any sign, even if the standard asymmetric information effects also exist. We present empirical evidence in five <b>difference</b> <b>insurance</b> markets in the United States that is consistent with this potential role for risk tolerance. Specifically, we show that individuals who engage in risky behavior or who do not engage in risk reducing behavior are systematically less likely to hold life insurance, acute private health insurance, annuities, long-term care insurance, and Medigap. Moreover, we show that the sign of this preference effect differs across markets, tending to induce lower risk individuals to purchase insurance in some of these markets, but higher risk individuals to purchase insurance in others. These findings suggest that preference heterogeneity may be important in explaining the differential patterns of insurance coverage in various insurance markets. ...|$|E

Methods Within the PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) registry of the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry), the authors identified 60, 814 outpatients with CAD from 30 U.

Hierarchical modified Poisson regression models with practice site as a random effect were used to study the association between health insurance (no insurance, public, or private health insurance) and 5 CAD quality measures. Results Of 60, 814 patients, 5716 patients (9. 4 %) were uninsured and 11, 962 patients (19. 7 %) had public insurance, whereas 43, 136 (70. 9 %) were privately insured. After accounting for exclusions, uninsured patients with CAD were 9 %, 12 %, and 6 % less likely to receive treatment with a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACE-I/ARB), and lipid-lowering therapy, respectively, than privately insured patients, and patients with public insurance were 9 % {{less likely to be}} prescribed ACE-I/ARB therapy. Most <b>differences</b> by <b>insurance</b> status were attenuated after adjusting for the site providing care.

40|$|Background: Medicaid {{insurance}} {{has been}} associated with worse asthma outcomes, but the degree to which demographic factors contribute to this relationship has not been well explored. Objective: To evaluate whether insurance status is independently associated with health care utilization (HCU) and asthma control when demographic differences are taken into account. Methods: We used baseline data from adults with severe asthma in the Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens study. HCU was defined as hospitalization or emergency department visit for asthma in the past 3 months. Asthma control was evaluated using the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare HCU and asthma control in patients with Medicaid vs those with private health insurance. Results: Of 1, 315 patients analyzed, 130 (9. 9 %) had Medicaid insurance and 1, 185 (90. 1 %) had private insurance. Medicaid insurance was associated with younger age, female sex, race other than white, obesity, active smoking, lower education level, and unemployment. In unadjusted analyses, Medicaid patients had significantly higher HCU (odds ratio [OR], 3. 08; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 11 - 4. 50) and poorer asthma control (OR, 2. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 84 - 3. 57) compared with patients with private insurance. After adjusting for demographic <b>differences,</b> <b>insurance</b> status was no longer associated with HCU (OR, 1. 43; 95 % CI, 0. 92 - 2. 23), and the strength of its association with asthma control was reduced (OR, 1. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 2. 40).

We also assessed gender differences in such prehospital delay for AMI in Spain, a country with universal insurance. We used data from 2, 951 US and 496 Spanish patients aged 18 – 55 years with AMI. US patients were grouped by insurance status: adequately insured, underinsured, or uninsured. For each country, we assessed the association between gender and prehospital delay (symptom onset to hospital arrival). For the US cohort, we modeled the relationship between insurance groups and delay of > 12 hours. US women were less {{likely than men to}} be uninsured, but more likely to be underinsured and a larger proportion of women than men experienced delays of > 12 hours (38 % versus 29 %). We found no association between insurance status and delays of > 12 hours in men or women. Only 17. 3 % of Spanish patients had delays of > 12 hours and there were no significant gender differences. In conclusion, women were {{more likely than men to}} delay, though it was not explained by <b>differences</b> in <b>insurance</b> status. The lack of gender differences in prehospital delays in Spain suggests that these differences may vary by health care system and culture.

40|$|Objectives. To test {{different}} forms of private insurance coverage as mediators for racial disparities in onset, persistent level, and acceleration of functional limitations among Medicare age-eligible Americans. Method. Data come from 7 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (1996 – 2008). Onset and progression latent growth models were used to estimate racial differences in onset, level, and growth of functional limitations among a sam-ple of 5, 755 people aged 65 and older in 1996. Employer-provided insurance, spousal insurance, and market insurance were next added to the model to test how <b>differences</b> in private <b>insurance</b> mediated the racial gap in physical limitations. Results. In baseline models, African Americans had larger persistent level of limitations over time. Although employer-provided, spousal provided, and market insurances were directly associated with lower persistent levels of limitation, only <b>differences</b> in market <b>insurance</b> accounted for the racial disparities in persistent level of limitations. Discussion. Results suggest private insurance is important for reducing functional limitations, but market insurance is an important mediator of the persistently larger level of limitations observed among African Americans.

40|$|Objective: To promote managed {{competition}} in Dutch health insurance, the insured are {{now able to}} change health insurers. They can choose a health insurer with a low flat-rate premium, the best supplementary insurance and/or the best service. As we do not know why people prefer one health insurer to another, we investigated their reasons for selecting their health insurer and assessed the importance of the supplementary benefit package and the flat-rate premium. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 468 of a total of 884 (52. 9 %). Data were compared among three groups. The first group comprised those who left one health insurer for another (exit). The second group had joined the health insurer (entry) and the third group comprised those who did not switch (stayers). Results: Those in the entry group were statistically significantly less satisfied with their former insurance organization than those in the other groups (exit and stayers) with the insurance organization under investigation. They were also less satisfied than the other groups in respect of the flat-rate premium. Those in the exit group were younger and seemed to be in better health. In general, the insured were only aware of small <b>differences</b> between health <b>insurance</b> funds and the three groups did not differ from each other in this respect. About a quarter of the entry group reported the flat-rate premium as a reason for selecting a particular health insurance fund. However, the most frequently reported reason, for both exit and entry, was the benefit package of the supplementary insurance.
