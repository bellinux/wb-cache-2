6000|$|... "I dispute not, madam," [...] {{said the}} pertinacious preacher, [...] "your benevolent purpose in {{taking charge of}} this youth, or your title to give him this <b>idle</b> <b>character</b> of page, if such was your pleasure; though what the {{education}} of a boy in the train of a female can tend to, save to ingraft foppery and effeminacy on conceit and arrogance, it passes my knowledge to discover. But I blame you more directly for having taken little care to guard him against the perils of his condition, or to tame and humble a spirit naturally haughty, overbearing, and impatient. You have brought into your bower a lion's cub; delighted with the beauty of his fur, and the grace of his gambols, you have bound him with no fetters befitting the fierceness of his disposition. You have let him grow up as unawed {{as if he had}} been still a tenant of the forest, and now you are surprised, and call out for assistance, when he begins to ramp, rend, and tear, according to his proper nature." ...|$|E
5000|$|When no data {{is being}} {{transmitted}} the line is maintained in synchronize mode [...] - [...] a terminal transmits idle characters for approximately 1.3 seconds followed by end-of-idle sequence (...) [...] It then listens for the same sequence for approximately three seconds. For four wire operation, when data {{is being transmitted}} the other wire pair is maintained in synchronize mode. At least one <b>idle</b> <b>character</b> is sent before each transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Notting Hill, west London (where Clark {{runs over}} Eric <b>Idle's</b> <b>character)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Idle's</b> <b>character</b> in the pub makes several cameo {{appearances}} in later episodes, {{referred to as}} [...] "Arthur Name".|$|R
50|$|The plot {{remains the}} same as its 1978 counterpart, with a new {{introduction}} and conclusion with <b>Idle's</b> <b>character,</b> Melvin Hall.|$|R
5000|$|In Monty Python's [...] "Travel Agent Sketch," [...] Eric <b>Idle's</b> <b>character,</b> Mr. Smoketoomuch, {{mentions}} Watney's Red Barrel {{many times}} in his rambling tirade about cheap holiday packages.|$|R
50|$|The punchline of the skit is {{that while}} {{everyone}} in the sketch is convinced of the <b>Idle</b> <b>character's</b> complicity, the viewer is perfectly aware of his innocence in the series of events.|$|R
5000|$|Director Ian MacNaughton {{insisted on}} {{deliberately}} using an excessive level of blood, telling the production team that it [...] "cannot be overdone". The slow motion technique of shooting <b>Idle's</b> <b>character</b> parodied Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point.|$|R
5000|$|The sketch was {{frequently}} performed live. In the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show, Jones's character {{walks away from}} Cleese's character and into a pub where he encounters Eric <b>Idle's</b> <b>character</b> and the sketch segues into [...] "Nudge, Nudge".|$|R
50|$|Each XGA video line {{requires}} 3072 bytes, which {{exceeds the}} maximum FC payload length, so each line {{is divided into}} two FC frames. Transporting an XGA image requires a “payload” of 1536 FC frames. Additionally, an ADVB header frame is added, making a total of 1537 FC frames. <b>Idle</b> <b>characters</b> are required between FC frames because they are used for synchronization between transmitters and receivers.|$|R
50|$|During {{the course}} of about a minute of sketch time, <b>Idle's</b> <b>character</b> breaks an {{expensive}} mirror, knocks over an ornate bookcase, fatally stabs the maid (Carol Cleveland), causes the handy man to fall {{out the window to}} his death, induces an investigating policeman into a fatal heart attack, collapses the roof in on the butler who was trying to help the policeman, and finally, causes the entire 'Prawn Salad Ltd' building to explode.|$|R
50|$|Early {{synchronous}} protocols were byte-oriented protocols, where synchronization {{was maintained}} by transmitting {{a sequence of}} synchronous <b>idle</b> <b>characters</b> when the line was not actively transmitting data or transparently within a long transmission block. A certain number of idles were sent prior to each transmission. The IBM Binary Synchronous protocol (Bisync) is still in use, Other examples of byte-oriented protocols are IBM's Synchronous transmit-receive (STR), and Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP) from Digital Equipment Corporation. Other computer manufacturers often offered similar protocols, differing mainly in small details.|$|R
5000|$|The {{destination}} XGXS adds to or deletes {{from the}} interframe as needed for clock rate disparity compensation prior to converting the interframe code sequence back into XGMII <b>Idle</b> control <b>characters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The source XGXS {{converts}} XGMII <b>Idle</b> control <b>characters</b> (interframe) into an 8b/10b code sequence. The destination XGXS recovers {{clock and}} data from each XAUI lane and deskews the four XAUI lanes into the single-clock XGMII.|$|R
5000|$|In computing, Control-V is {{a control}} {{character}} in ASCII code, {{also known as}} the synchronous <b>idle</b> (SYN) <b>character.</b> It is generated by pressing the [...] key while holding down the [...] key on a computer keyboard.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the show}} was a {{collaborative}} process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, {{the work of the}} Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the Spanish Inquisition in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many [...] "confrontation" [...] sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or <b>Idle's</b> <b>characters</b> with bizarre verbal quirks, such as [...] "The Man Who Speaks In Anagrams"). Cleese confirmed that [...] "most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's". Gilliam's animations, meanwhile, ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).|$|R
50|$|Tradition {{tells us}} that Aylesbury Churchyard {{used to be the}} {{rendezvous}} for the <b>idle</b> and dissolute <b>characters</b> of the town. It also {{tells us that}} all manners of sports and games were carried on there including cock-shying and the like. Soldiers are reported to have been flogged there. No proofs now exist of such proceedings but {{it is not at all}} improbable they occurred.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{arrived in}} the Yukon in 1899 or 1900, {{probably}} from Alabama. She may have arrived with a dance troupe or with a trumpet player. Johnson married her employer, Murray S. Eads, in 1904 {{and went on to}} manage his dance-hall, the Flora Dora. Although she was once charged with [...] "allowing women of loose, <b>idle</b> or suspicious <b>character</b> on the premises for the purpose of keeping company with men" [...] {{she and her husband were}} well respected in Dawson City.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, limited multiplayer functions are available through the Nintendo DS' Wi-Fi functionality. When the connection is active, players can battle each other in dedicated maps. Units can also be loaned between players, and an online shop is available to purchase new items and weapons with in-game currency. The game also has a time-based function where, when the game is left <b>idle</b> while <b>characters</b> are in the [...] "unit barracks", a meter will fill up and the characters will perform limited autonomous actions: these actions can involve leveling up, or crafting new items and weapons. The game can be played with two modes: Classic Mode, which enables permanent death for characters defeated in battle, and the new Casual Mode, which revives fallen units for the next battle. In {{addition to}} this are four difficulty levels: [...] "normal", [...] "hard", [...] "maniac" [...] and [...] "lunatic".|$|R
5000|$|Some {{material}} originally recorded {{went missing}} later, {{such as the}} use of the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the [...] "Summarise Proust" [...] sketch (which was muted during the first airing, and later cut out entirely) or [...] "What a silly bunt" [...] in the Travel Agent sketch (which featured a <b>character</b> <b>Idle</b> who has a speech impediment that makes him pronounce [...] "C"s as [...] "B"s), which was cut before the sketch ever went to air. However, when this sketch was included in the album Monty Python's Previous Record and the Live at the Hollywood Bowl film, the line remained intact.|$|R
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their <b>character</b> <b>idle.</b> They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|R
50|$|On {{the death}} of his mother he came to England, in the reign of Charles II, and was patronized by Sir Edward Spragge, and more {{particularly}} by Sir William Williams, for whom he painted a great number of landscapes, which were destroyed when that gentleman's mansion was burned down. His pictures were in considerable estimation, and he was occasionally employed by Sir Peter Lely to paint his backgrounds. The scenery in his landscapes is wild and romantic, with rocks and broken grounds, in the style of Salvator Rosa. In later life he degenerated into an <b>idle</b> and dissolute <b>character.</b> He died in London in 1692.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Idle</b> (playing a <b>character</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "Arthur Nudge") sits too close to an unassuming pub patron played by Terry Jones. Idle asks Jones a series of questions about his romantic relationships that seem odd and cryptic, but that are eventually revealed to be complex double entendres. Jones becomes irritated by the line of questioning and asks Idle, directly, what he is implying. Idle forwardly admits that he really wants to know whether Jones has ever [...] "slept with a lady," [...] and when directly answered [...] "yes," [...] curiously asks [...] "What's it like?", {{making it one of the}} few Monty Python sketches to end on a clear punch line.|$|R
40|$|The Magnoliaceae shows strong phylogenetic niche conservatism, {{in which}} {{temporal}} petal closure {{has been extensively}} reported. However, it is yet elusive whether temporal petal closure is an <b>idle</b> floral <b>character</b> inherited from their ancestors or an adaptive trait to their habitats. Here, we monitored the process of temporal floral closure and re-opening in a thermogenic plant, Magnolia denudata (Magnoliaceae). Furthermore, we artificially interrupted temporal petal closure and investigated its effects on development of female and male gametophytes. Intriguingly, we found considerable anatomical changes in the anthers shortly after temporal closure of petals: disintegration of tapeta, crack of anther walls, and release of matured pollens. In comparison with normal flowers, artificially interrupted flowers (no petal closure) showed delayed anther development and slower pollen germination on stigmas, while little difference in embryo morphology was observed during the early stage of embryo development. Moreover, seed set and quality were significantly decreased when petal closure was prevented. In addition, we found pollination accelerated floral closure in M. denudata. Taken together, temporal floral closure benefits reproduction of M. denudata in early spring by promoting anther development and pollen function, which {{suggests that it is}} an adaptive floral trait to its specific habitat...|$|R
5000|$|During the {{performance}} of this sketch, technical difficulties (a microphone starts feeding back) make Terry Jones lose his place (he temporarily looks up with a smirk on his face). Eric Idle has trouble keeping a straight face while delivering his lines with an extraordinarily overwrought Yorkshire accent, which also causes Terry Jones to openly burst out laughing. At one point, Jones loses his Pepperpot wig, which goes flying across the stage. Graham Chapman and Michael Palin slide across the stage to hide Jones as he replaces the wig, after which they all have trouble keeping a straight face (particularly Palin). This was always a difficult sketch to perform live—on other occasions, the 'Hand of God' (a large Gilliam-designed cut-out) fingered the wrong <b>character.</b> <b>Idle</b> describes the sketch as [...] "shambolic" [...] as he segues into: ...|$|R
60|$|When he rode away he left {{me sitting}} on the gate, feeling very much disgusted, and almost wishing that, like Marcos Marcó, I had run away during the night. Never had I taken so sudden and violent a dislike to {{anything}} as I then and there did to that estancia, where I was an honoured, albeit a compulsory guest. The hot, brilliant morning sunshone down on the discoloured thatch and mud-plastered walls of the sordid-looking building, while all about wherever I cast my eyes they rested on weeds, old bones, broken bottles, and other rubbish--eloquent witnesses of the dirty, <b>idle,</b> thriftless <b>character</b> of the inmates. Meanwhile my sweet, angelic child-wife, with her violet eyes dim with tears, {{was waiting for me}} far away in Montevideo, wondering at my long absence, and even now perhaps shading her face with her lily hand and looking out on the white dusty road watching for my arrival! And here I was compelled to sit, idly swinging my legs on the gate, because that abominable fat woman had taken a fancy to keep me by her! Feeling mad with indignation, I suddenly jumped down from the gate with an exclamation not intended for ears polite, causing my hostess to jump also and utter a scream; for there she was (confound her!) standing just behind me.|$|R
