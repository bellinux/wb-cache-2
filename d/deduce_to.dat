Most of them see the area as a danger zone, but Stan sees it as a unique {{business}} opportunity and envisions a theme park. However, he accidentally divulges the fact that he left Waddles outside unattended; this pushes Mabel over the edge, and she decides to never speak to her insensitive grunkle again. Soos tries to prevent them from arguing by remaining optimistic though his efforts prove ineffective when he ravels the yarn back up—thus ending the clear-cut path—and accidentally breaks their lantern. Dipper grows to a level of anger equal to his sister, and he and Soos start to fight as Mabel's and Stan's conflict escalates.|$|E

The bar manager tells them that Lumpy was involved with some girl, whom they <b>deduce</b> <b>to</b> be Ramsey. After an uncomfortable argument at Christmas dinner, Kristen pushes Scott to drive up to Ramsey's town and find her. In flashbacks, we learn that Ramsey met Lumpy ten months earlier when he knocked on her door asking for permission to cut across her parents property to go ice fishing. After catching a fish, Lumpy falls through the ice and is rescued by Ramsey. He takes her back to his hotel room where they both get cleaned up but end up having an argument after he asks her to leave. The hotel clerk calls the police on Lumpy and he is arrested, but released after Ramsey shows the police the fishing hole and accident. After this, Lumpy begins visiting Ramsey more frequently and the two develop a close friendship.|$|E

They are confronted by the home's owner, Dr Samuel Holywell, whom they <b>deduce</b> <b>to</b> be an antiquarian; they explain their presence on the pretext that they were delivering him the Tardis to form part of his collection. While the Doctor distracts Holywell, Turlough notices that some of his books are connected with necromancy. It then becomes apparent that the protagonists are being observed by an advanced intelligence, not from their current era. That evening, while the Doctor and Turlough are being entertained by Holywell, Jeake and Flower are robbed by Major Billy Lovemore (a highwayman) and lose their winnings from the previous night. Later Ned Cotton (a drunken watchman) encounters Holywell's maid, Hannah Fry, outside Holywell's house and assaults her. Hearing her cries, Turlough comes to her rescue. Inside the house, Holywell informs the doctor that he has practical proof of the existence of ghosts and is in regular contact with them. Before Turlough can fight save Hannah from Cotton, they are distracted by a man running towards them as if chased invisible pursuers; he drops dead with a playing card in his hand. The Doctor puts the card into his Almanack. Holywell blames himself, believing the death to be a result of his contact with the ghosts.|$|E

Herein, we report on charge carrier lifetime values in bromine doped planar methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI_ 3) solar cells determined by transient photovoltage. The corresponding charge carrier density has been derived from charge carrier extraction. We found increased lifetime values in solar cells incorporating bromine compared to pure MAPbI_ 3 {{by a factor of}} 2. 75 at an illumination intensity corresponding to 1 sun.

30|$|This paper novelly proposes PARE to reorder {{transaction}} execution {{to improve}} {{the performance of the}} state-of-the-art concurrency control mechanism, transaction pipeline, under HFT applications. We for the first time observe and formulate the harmful ordering, which is brought with transaction pipeline and hidden under other concurrency control mechanisms. We <b>deduce</b> <b>to</b> reorder transaction execution in order of contention and further propose two mechanisms to extract reordering blocks and identify the degree of contention of objects. We also propose and formulate the problem of off-line reordering. We prove this is an NP-hard problem and present an off-line reordering approach to approximate the optimal reordering strategy. Experiments demonstrate that PARE outperforms the state-of-the-art concurrency control mechanism significantly on HFT applications in terms of both transaction throughput and latency, and the overhead is limited on typical OLTP benchmarks.|$|E

We exclusively monitor the hydrogenation of Mg domains, owing to the large difference in positron affinity for Mg and Ti. The electron momentum distribution broadens significantly upon transformation to the MgH 2 phase over the whole compositional range. This reveals the similarity of the metal-insulator transition for rutile and fluorite MgH 2.
