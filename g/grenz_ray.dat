50|$|In {{the very}} elderly {{or those with}} {{otherwise}} limited life expectancy, the impact of major day surgery for excision with 5mm margins and large skin flap could be worse than doing nothing or the possibility of failed treatments with imiquimod or <b>Grenz</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> are {{indicated}} {{for treatment of}} eczema, psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis, neurodermatitis, pruritus ani and pruritus vulvae. They {{have been reported to}} be helpful for lichen planus, Grover's disease, Darier's disease, Hailey-Hailey disease and histiocytosis X. <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> have also been used for treatment of actinic keratosis and Bowen's disease.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> are {{produced}} by specially calibrated X-ray machines generally operating in the 10 to 30 kV range to produce X-rays with HVL less than 0.035 mm in aluminum. (HVL is half-value layer, and refers to a thickness of a given material that will cut the X-ray flux by 50%). <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> are absorbed by air and therefore treatments must be given at fixed distances for which the machine has been calibrated. In human tissue <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> have a half-value depth of 0.5 mm and are essentially absorbed within the first 2 mm of skin. [...] The exact mechanism of action is unknown {{but it does have}} effects on the Langerhans cells in the epidermis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> {{are part}} of the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum comprising low energy (ultrasoft) X-rays. These were first investigated by Gustav Bucky in 1923 using a cathode vacuum tube with a lithium borate glass window, which he labeled <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> as he believed that the biological effects resembled those of UV light and traditional X-rays and hence were on the border between the two (Grenz = border in German). These rays are also known as Bucky rays.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} intensively pruritic and partially bullous disseminated superficial actinic prorokeratosis, with acute flare-ups. Histopathological examination showed the characteristic cornoid lamella and subepidermal blister formation in one biopsy. <b>Grenz</b> <b>ray</b> treatment resulted in a marked regression of the skin lesions and pruritus.

40|$|Familial benign chronic {{pemphigus}} or Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized {{by the development of}} recurrent blisters and erosions in the intertriginous areas. Various topical and systemic treatment options include corticosteroids, topical 5 -fluorouracil, topical vitamin D analogs, topical zinc oxide, dapsone, psoralen plus ultraviolet A, systemic retinoids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and photodynamic therapy. In recalcitrant cases, further options including, invasive methods such as <b>grenz</b> <b>ray</b> therapy, carbon dioxide laser abrasion, and erbium: YAG laser ablation, dermabrasion, electron beam therapy, botulinum toxin, and full-thickness excision of affected skin with repair by split-thickness grafting have been reported as useful in treatment of HHD. We describe a case of HHD who was treated with several treatment modalities including antibiotics, corticosteroids, and dapsone earlier and when presented to us had a severe recalcitrant disease. Thalidomide, as a modality of treatment has been successfully used in few cases earlier. Our patient responded well to thalidomide...|$|E
40|$|In {{dermatologic}} oncology several good indications for radiotherapy are known. Precancerous lesions can {{be treated}} by <b>grenz</b> <b>rays,</b> as e. g. large senile (actinic) keratoses, lentigo maligna or large lesions of Bowen's disease or Queyrat's erythroplasia. Well-known indications are also mid-sized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, especially {{in the face of}} elderly patients. The lentigo-maligna melanoma should no longer be considered a radioresistant tumor, and it must be stressed that larger lesions can be successfully treated by radiotherapy. Dermato-radiotherapy shows also excellent palliative results, e. g. in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides, but also in Kaposi's sarcoma either of the classical type or AIDS-associated. In conclusion, radiotherapy is a good alternative treatment modality, especially in elderly patients, since it is painless and is possible on an outpatient basis with excellent functional results...|$|R
5000|$|On July 29, 1977, H.F., a 51-year-old teacher, was {{attempting}} to remove a casserole dish from her new 600-watt microwave oven. The oven signaled {{the end of the}} heating cycle, but the light and the cooking blower were on. During retrieval of the dish, she inserted two thirds of her bare forearms into the oven, for a total time of about five seconds. The oven was still operating. She felt [...] "hot pulsating sensation" [...] and burning in fingers and fingernails and a sensation of [...] "needles" [...] over the exposed areas. Jabbing pain, swelling, and red-orange discoloration of dorsal sides of both hands and forearms appeared shortly afterwards. The next day she sought medical help. Since then, she has undergone treatment with oral and topical cortisone, <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays,</b> ultrasound, and later acupuncture, without relief. Symptoms persisted, including high sensitivity to radiant heat (sun, desk lamp, etc.) and growing intolerance to pressure of clothes and to touch in hands and forearms. Neurological examinations in 1980 and 1981 did not yield a definite diagnosis. Neuronal latencies were within norm. Electromyography discovered denervation in the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and radial nerve on both arms. Severe reduction of number of sweat glands in the finger pulps, in comparison with a random control, was also found. The injury was determined to be caused by the full power of the magnetron; the pulsating sensation was caused either by the stirrer (a mechanical mirror distributing the microwave beam across the oven space to prevent formation of hot and cold spots), or by the arterial pulsation in combination with increased nerve sensitivity. Damage to the A beta fibers, A delta fibers, and group C nerve fibers was the cause of the burning sensation. The increased hypersensitivity to radiant heat is caused by the damage to the A beta, A delta, and polymodal nociceptors (the group C fibers); this damage is induced by a single-time overheating of the skin to 48.5-50 Â°C, and the resulting sensitivity persists for a long time. Degeneration of the alpha motor neurons is also caused by the exposure to heat and radiation. Most of the major nerve trunks were not affected. Damage to the A beta fibers (located in the skin), discovered by the two-point discrimination test, is permanent; the Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, and Merkel nerve endings, which degenerated after denervation, do not regenerate. The sympathetic nervous system was involved as well; the reduction in active sweat glands was caused by destruction of their innervation, the initial edema and reddening was also caused by sympathetic nerve damage.|$|R
