A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors <b>fastened</b> down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a leaf spring for an electromagnetic actuator and {{to such an}} electromagnetic actuator. The leaf spring {{is formed as a}} whole from a disc of plate-shaped, resilient material. The leaf spring comprises a central <b>fastening</b> part, an outer <b>fastening</b> part extending therearound and at least two leaf spring arms extending between the central and outer <b>fastening</b> part. Viewed from the central <b>fastening</b> part, the leaf spring arms (23) have a first zone (24) originating from the central <b>fastening</b> part (21), in which they extend as far as the outer part (22) but for a first clearance (R). The first zone (24) is followed by a second zone (25) in which, without contacting the outer <b>fastening</b> part (22) and proceeding in tangential direction, they bend back as far as the central <b>fastening</b> part (21) but for a second clearance (T).; A third zone (26) follows the second zone (25), in which the spring leaf arms (23) extend towards the outer <b>fastening</b> part (22) to merge therein...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the validity of}} testing button <b>fastening</b> ability as a measurement of hand disability in patients with myotonic dystrophy. Forty subjects with myotonic dystrophy were tested {{on their ability to}} <b>fasten</b> four shirt buttons. The association between button <b>fastening</b> ability, strength of selected proximal upper limb muscles and lateral pinch grip was determined. A significant association (F((4, 35)) = 7. 55, p <. 001) was demonstrated between proximal upper limb strength and button <b>fastening</b> ability, but there was no relationship with lateral pinch grip strength. Myotonia was not a factor affecting button <b>fastening</b> performance. Comparison of these results with those of a group of 13 subjects with other neuromuscular diseases showed button <b>fastening</b> disability in myotonic dystrophy could not be attributed solely to proximal upper limb weakness but is a valid measure of hand disability. A standard for normal button <b>fastening</b> performance was also determined...|$|R

5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is <b>fastened</b> to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>fastening</b> is an {{important}} part for <b>fastening</b> when laying the rails, which requires sufficient <b>fastening</b> pressure, strength, and durability. This article focuses on the fatigue fracture of the spring clip of a <b>fastening</b> and gets a result that the fracture accounts for alternating twist-bend load by examining macro-fracture. The crack origin is {{on the surface of the}} clip where significant decarburization and corrosion exists and its extension makes the clip break by examining metallographic structure and testing micro-hardness. The solution is to improve the heat treatment method and the surface quality avoiding corrosion...|$|R
