A detailed biomechanical model of the pilot is developed within a general purpose multibody dynamics formulation.

40|$|Based on {{the ideas}} of quantum theory of open systems (QTOS) we propose the {{consistent}} approach to study probabilistic many-valued propositional logic of intelligent devices that are composed from separate but interconnected logical units. In this preliminary communication we consider only the simplest example of such systems, namely, four- valued probabilistic logical device composed of two logical subsystems. We demonstrate that similar devices can generate two classes of probabilistic propositions: 1) decomposable propositions, which in fact are equivalent to certain ordered pair of propositions in <b>device</b> <b>subsystems</b> and 2) indecomposable propositions which are connected with inherent logical interaction between device units. The indecomposable propositions are undoubtedly of greatest interest since they, {{as shown in the}} paper, provide powerful additional logical resource compared to standard parallel processing in composite intelligent systems. The contextual logic of composite devices proposed in this paper, as we believe, can be also used for analysis of highly organized systems in cognitive sciences specifically in neuropsychology and linguistics.

40|$|Abstract—Reducing power {{consumption}} {{has become a}} crucial design tenet for both mobile and other small computing devices that are not constantly connected to a power source. However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smartphone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not a-priori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smartphones. Our goal is to characterize the <b>device</b> <b>subsystems</b> and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage {{of all of the}} primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system’s power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the {{power consumption}} of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.
