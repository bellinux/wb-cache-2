50|$|Bruno Nagler began {{wind tunnel}} {{experiments}} into helicopter design in 1926 and developed the first practical swash plate.The Nagler NH-120 {{was developed to}} test the idea of counteracting rotor torque with a small separate rotor. The engine was mounted above the main rotor on a shaft, and the <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> was mounted above both. The NH-160 had a conventional helicopter engine and rotor layout, {{with the exception of}} the smaller <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> mounted under the fuselage between the landing skids. Yaw control on both was effected through changing the difference in rotational speed between the two rotors, using a series of disc brakes. A small tail surface provided directional stability in forward flight. The smaller rotor would spin at a higher rpm, with about 60 percent of the load,. the main rotor being adjustable for lift control.|$|R
50|$|The Yak-100 (initially {{designated}} Yak-22) {{was developed}} in direct competition with Mikhail Mil's Mi-1. Bearing {{a striking resemblance to}} the Sikorsky H-5 (purely coincidental) the Yak-100 had a conventional main and <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration, driven by an Ivchenko AI-26GRFL radial piston engine.

50|$|Ettore Manzolini {{established}} {{a company in}} Rome, Italy to develop a helicopter he had designed. The design was the Manzolini Libellula an unusual co-axial helicopter. The co-axial arrangement {{eliminating the need for}} an <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> allowed the helicopter to have a twin fin arrangement. The Libellula (Registered I-MANZ) first flew on 7 January 1952. An improved version was the single-seat Libellula II which went on to gain Italian certification on 15 October 1962. A three-seater version (the Libellula III) was built and a four-seat Libellula IV was planned but Manzolini stopped development in the late 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|For V/STOL operations, the {{aircraft}} [...] "converted" [...] by tilting its wing to the vertical.

When on the ground, the tail rotor folded against the tail to avoid being damaged during loading. The wing could be rotated to 100 degrees, past vertical, in order to hover in a tailwind.|$|R

Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal light alloy rotor blade that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and brake units, was also present.|$|R

2500|$|The S-76 is of {{conventional}} configuration, with a four-bladed fully articulated main rotor and a four-bladed <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> {{on the port}} side of the tailboom. Two turboshaft engines are located above the passenger cabin. In the prototypes and initial production aircraft, these engines were Allison 250-C30s, {{a new version of the}} popular Allison 250 engine developed specially for the S-76, with a single-stage centrifugal compressor instead of the multi-stage axial/centrifugal compressor of earlier models of the engine, rated at [...] for takeoff. These engines are connected to the main rotor by the main gearbox, a three-stage unit with a bull gear as its final stage rather than the planetary gear used by previous generations of Sikorsky helicopters. This arrangement has 30% fewer parts and lower costs than a more conventional design.|$|R
50|$|The Advancing Blade Concept system {{consisted}} of two rigid, contra-rotating rotors (30 inches apart) which made use of the aerodynamic lift of the advancing blades. At high speeds, the retreating blades were offloaded, {{as most of the}} load was supported by the advancing blades of both rotors and the penalty due to stall of the retreating blade was thus eliminated. This system did not require a wing to be fitted for high speeds and to improve maneuverability, and also eliminated the need for an <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> at the tail. Forward thrust was provided by two turbojets, which allowed the main rotor to only be required to provide lift. It was found to have good hover stability against crosswind and tailwind. With jets installed, it lacked power to hover out of ground effect and used short take-off and landing for safety reasons.|$|R

50|$|After {{the failure}} of his first design, the Brantly B-1, Newby O. Brantly decided to design a simpler and less {{complicated}} helicopter for the private buyer. The B-2 had a single main <b>rotor</b> and an <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>rotor</b> and first flew on 21 February 1953. This was followed by an improved second prototype that first flew on 14 August 1956.|$|R
50|$|The basic Bo 46 {{design was}} {{finalized}} in January 1959. The five-bladed rotor system was initially {{tested in a}} wind tunnel and turned in impressive results. These suggested that the Bo 46 {{would be able to}} reach speeds up to 500 km/h; even advanced designs of the era were limited to speeds around 250 km/h. Construction of three highly streamlined fuselages started at Siebel. There were powered by an 800 hp Turboméca Turmo turboshaft driving a five-bladed Derschmidt rotor. The design originally featured a louvred fenestration for the <b>anti-torque</b> <b>rotor</b> that could be closed in high speed flight, but this was removed from the prototypes and the six-bladed rotor was conventionally mounted {{on the left side of}} the tail. The maximum speed was not limited by rotor considerations, but the maximum power of the engine. Adding separate engines for additional forward thrust was expected to allow speeds as high as 700 km/h.|$|R

25|$|The Djinn was {{developed}} {{to function as a}} practical implementation of the earlier experimental Sud-Ouest Ariel rotorcraft.

During the subsequence test program, one of the prototypes was recorded as having achieved a world altitude record.|$|R

Boeing retains the design rights to the NOTAR technology despite selling the former McDonnell Douglas civil helicopter line to MD Helicopters in early 1999.

The W.9 was completed late in 1944 and assigned serial PX203. It was damaged during ground-running due to incorrect control phasing arising from a high order of pitch-flap coupling, and did not start test flying until 1945.|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} was conical, tapering to the tail. Instead of a side-mounted <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>rotor</b> the Nord used a system patented by its designer where an axially driven pusher propeller, rotating within a circular shroud, forced air through four rotatable, vertical airfoils {{mounted on the}} shroud trailing edge. The shroud was intended to protect the propeller from the rotor downwash, to guard the propeller from objects {{on the ground and}} protect ground staff from the propeller. Air deflected from the blades balanced rotor torque automatically, using information from an hydraulic torque sensor, and also controlled yaw. [...] Two horizontal surfaces controlled fore and aft motion (pitch). In addition the propeller provided thrust for forward propulsion.|$|R

[...] Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, it is the single main <b>rotor</b> with <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>rotor</b> configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration. Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity. Coaxial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and compound helicopters are all flying today. Quadcopter helicopters pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, Bruno Guimbal, {{while working}} at Eurocopter upon the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin and Eurocopter EC120 Colibri helicopters, decided to {{independently}} pursue {{the development of a}} two-seat piston engine helicopter. This rotorcraft would incorporate numerous safety-related and general technological advances commonly applied to larger turbine-powered rotorcraft, but typically absent from piston-engine helicopters. These technologies included Eurocopter's Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> shrouded tail <b>rotor</b> and Spheriflex main rotor, in addition to a composite fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The AS365 Dauphin is a {{twin-engine}} helicopter {{capable of}} travelling long ranges, and {{well suited to}} operating in climates of a high ambient temperature or at locations of significant altitude. The Dauphin is typically powered {{by a pair of}} Turbomeca Arriel turboshaft engines; on later variants, these are equipped with FADEC units, which provide additional functionality such as an automated start-up sequence and a training mode. The engines drive the rotorcraft's foldable Starflex main rotor which and its Fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>rotor</b> via two separate transmissions; these gearboxes are also connected to two separate hydraulic systems as well as a stand-by hydraulic system for emergency use, such as deployment of the landing gear. Electrical power is provided by a pair of starter generators and a cadmium-nickel main battery, an emergency battery is also present.|$|R
25|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{was equipped}} with an uncovered tail boom, outfitted with twin fins and a rudder; both directional control and stability of the vehicle were provided via the controlled deflection of exhaust gases from the engine. As {{a consequence of the}} torque-free method of rotor propulsion, the Djinn did not require the presence of an <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>rotor.</b> A simplistic wheel-equipped twin-skid arrangement was also present; this was retractable via the same manually-operated crank handle used for engine ignition. The Djinn could also be deployed with multiple armaments. In the ground-attack role, it could be equipped with a single machine gun, which was manned from the second seat of the cockpit. For performing anti-tank warfare, the Djinn was able to equip a guided missile; when deployed in an effective manner against an adversary, the manufacturer claimed the combination to be extremely difficult for an opposing tank to sight its adversary and to defend itself during the anticipated rapid speed of engagements.|$|R
2500|$|The H160 is {{the first}} {{rotorcraft}} to feature the Blue Edge five-bladed main rotor.

Aerodynamic innovations include a biplane tailplane stabiliser for greater low speed stability, and a quieter canted fenestron which combined produce an extra 80kg of lift. The H160 {{is the first}} civilian helicopter to utilise a canted fenestron <b>anti-torque</b> tail <b>rotor.</b> The H160 will be powered by two Turbomeca Arrano turboshaft engines; a second engine, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210E, was to be offered as an alternative option, but this was eliminated due to insufficient power output and to reduce design complexity. A redundant backup for the gearbox lubrication system enables in excess of five hours of flight following a primary failure without causing mechanical damage.|$|R
40|$|The {{tail rotor}} of {{conventional}} helicopters {{has always been}} considered a necessary 'evil'. It is necessary to counteract the reaction torque of the engine and to control the helicopter in yaw but it consumes substantial power, has only marginal control authority under unfavourable wind conditions, and it is noisy, vulnerable and dangerous. A solution to all these problems would be a helicopter concept that {{eliminates the need for}} a tail rotor. The so-called 'Ornicopter', a helicopter with flapping blades, is such a concept. The mechanism of the Ornicopter is inspired by bird flight. When birds flap their wings they are able to generate both a lifting force and a propelling force from this single movement. Instead of propelling a helicopter blade by spinning it around and deriving lift from this rotating movement, as is done in conventional helicopter configurations, the Ornicopter flaps its blades like a bird and derives both lift and a propulsive force from this movement. In this case the blades propel themselves and {{there is no longer a}} need for a direct torque supplied by the engine to rotate the blades. The Ornicopter's rotor, therefore, will not cause a reaction torque on the fuselage, which makes the tail <b>rotor's</b> <b>anti-torque</b> function redundant. The goal of the present thesis is to develop a thorough understanding of the Ornicopter concept and its feasibility throughout a realistic flight envelope. The first part presents the analysis of the Ornicopter's main characteristics regarding performance, stability, controllability, handling qualities, as well as an exploratory vibratory analysis. In the second part a preliminary design and sizing thereof are presented based on the conclusions obtained in the first part. The basis for the Ornicopter's study is an analytically-derived flight mechanics model. The model is based on the blade element theory (BET) and considers 6 rigid body degrees of freedom (DoF), 3 DoF blade flapping dynamics and 3 DoF Pitt-Peters inflow dynamics. Previous mathematical models developed as a proof of the Ornicopter concept have concentrated mainly on hovering flight. The model developed in this thesis is capable of representing the Ornicopter's dynamics well within its entire operational flight envelope. As a benchmark for the Ornicopter's specifications, the Bolkow Bo- 105 helicopter is used. The Bo- 105 helicopter is a light twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopter developed in Germany in the 1970 s. For the initial values of the design parameters of the Ornicopter (such as rotor radius, blade loading, rotor tip velocity, vertical fin size) the Bo- 105 helicopter design is used. A 2 X 2 anti-symmetric rotor flapping configuration (with two opposite blades flapping in the same direction) is used for the Ornicopter in order to eliminate the necessity for a tail rotor. Using these design parameters it is demonstrated that the Ornicopter rotor can generate enough propulsive torque to rotate the blades with modest flapping amplitudes (maximum less than 9 deg). The present thesis demonstrates that, compared to the Bo- 105 helicopter, the Ornicopter concept suffers from higher required power, a smaller flight envelope (mainly due to the larger rotor stall area) and lower yaw stability. All these drawbacks are attributed to the large rotor blade angle of attack variation introduced by the forced flapping mechanism and the absence of a tail rotor. In the second part of this thesis, the Ornicopter concept is optimized for performance. Keeping the performance specifications of the Bo- 105 as the objectives, the design values (blade radius, blade loading etc) are turned to fit the Ornicopter concept and no longer use the Bo- 105 design values. The design optimization is formulated through minimization of the required power, while satisfying the stall area requirement. The thesis proves that the optimal design for the Ornicopter as compared to the Bo- 105 benchmark is characterized by a lower blade loading, increased rotor tip velocity and larger vertical fin size. This optimal design results in an enlarged flight envelope due to the reduced rotor stall area and improved yaw stability in forward flight. Nevertheless, despite these improvements in the Ornicopter's flight envelope, there is a slight increase in required power when compared with the Bo- 105 specification (approximately 5 % at 150 knots). To compensate for the higher profile power needed for the Ornicopter's optimal design, a larger rotor radius is required in order to reduce the induced power and keep the increase in the total required power to a minimum. This thesis may be considered as a first step in rationalizing the expectations regarding the Ornicopter's tailless helicopter design. The thesis proved that this new concept shows a slightly poorer performance than that of conventional helicopters regarding power consumption in forward flight and service ceiling. This is disappointing since one of the assumptions was that the elimination of the tail rotor would also eliminate the power consumption associated with a tail rotor. Further analyses of the Ornicopter's performance (such as endurance, payloads, climbing performance, and environmental performance related to safety and noise), costs or maintenance should be performed for a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this helicopter concept.
