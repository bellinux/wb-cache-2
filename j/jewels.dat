5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the <b>jewels</b> to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the <b>jewels,</b> claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the <b>jewels,</b> but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the <b>jewels</b> nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the <b>jewels</b> were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her <b>jewels</b> were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain <b>jewels</b> taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were {{only a small portion of}} the Windsor <b>jewels,</b> which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E

5|$|Szczerbiec, {{together}} with other crown <b>jewels,</b> {{was removed from the}} Wawel Hill on several occasions during that period. After his Polish coronation in 1370, King Louis I of Hungary took the crown <b>jewels</b> with him to Buda; his successor on the Hungarian throne, Emperor Sigismund, rendered them to Poland in 1412. On two occasions, in mid-17th and early 18th centuries, they were evacuated across Poland's southern border to protect them from invading Swedish armies. In 1733, during the War of the Polish Succession, supporters of King Stanislaus I concealed the <b>jewels</b> in a Warsaw church for three years to prevent Augustus III from using them in his coronation. In 1764, they were sent to Warsaw again, to be used in a coronation for the last time – that of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski. They were returned to Kraków afterwards.|$|E

For every 10000 <b>jewel</b> counter points, the player gains 10 extra score points for inflicting enemy damage.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, <b>Jewel</b> {{expanded}} their brand north into Wisconsin by acquiring eight failing stores from Kroger and rebranded the stores <b>Jewel.</b> After {{a decade of}} operations, <b>Jewel</b> closed all of their stores in Wisconsin in 1980.

5|$|The {{marriage}} was unhappy from the start. A few nights following the formal entry, Marguerite Louise demanded the Tuscan crown <b>jewels</b> {{for her own}} personal use; Cosimo refused. The <b>jewels</b> that she did manage to extract from Cosimo were almost smuggled out of Tuscany by her attendants but for the efforts of Ferdinando's agents.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the {{instructions on how to}} deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the <b>jewels.</b> The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the <b>jewels</b> in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jewel</b> Flash (Jueru furasshu) is {{a special}} magic spell that is cast by a Jewelpet using its {{respective}} <b>Jewel</b> Eye. Each Jewelpet has {{their own version of}} <b>Jewel</b> Flash and has their own attributes and strengths, depending on which <b>Jewel</b> they represents. The Jewelpets use this magic to use special spells or synchronize with their human partners, as seen in Twinkle.

50|$|While <b>Jewel</b> found {{limited success}} in New South Wales against long-time {{incumbent}} Franklins, <b>Jewel</b> entered Victoria {{a few years}} before Franklins and found more success there. In the early 1990s, <b>Jewel</b> launched <b>Jewel</b> Country Fresh in response to Franklins and BI-LO launching market-style full-line discount supermarkets. <b>Jewel</b> also acquired the Rainbow supermarket in Doonside, Western Sydney. These formats carried not only dry groceries and frozen foods, but also fresh foods in a market-style environment.|$|R

5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with <b>jewels.</b> He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of <b>jewels</b> or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of the}} Valois, Isabeau was an appreciative art collector. She loved <b>jewels</b> and was {{responsible}} for the commissions of particularly lavish pieces of ronde-bosse—a newly developed technique of making enamel-covered gold pieces. Documentation suggests she commissioned several fine pieces of tableaux d'or from Parisian goldsmiths.|$|E

50|$|Evolutionary {{mismatch}} {{can also}} be seen among insects. One such example is {{in the case of the}} Giant <b>Jewel</b> Beetle (Julodimorpha bakewelli). The male <b>jewel</b> beetle has evolved to be attracted to certain features of the female <b>jewel</b> beetle that allow the male <b>jewel</b> beetle to identify a female as it flies across the desert. These features include size, color, and texture. However, these physical traits are seen manifested in beer bottles as well. As a result, male <b>jewel</b> beetles often consider beer bottles more attractive than female <b>jewel</b> beetles due to the beer bottle's large size and attractive coloring. Beer bottles are often discarded by humans in the Australian desert that the <b>jewel</b> beetle thrives in, creating an environment where male <b>jewel</b> beetles prefer to mate with beer bottles instead of female <b>jewel</b> beetles. This is a situation that is extremely disadvantageous as it reduces the reproductive output of the <b>jewel</b> beetle as fewer beetles are mating. This condition can be considered an evolutionary mismatch, as a habit that evolved to aid in reproduction has become disadvantageous due to the littering of beer bottles, an anthropogenic cause.|$|R

5|$|Since 1994, the Crown <b>Jewels</b> {{have been}} {{on display in the}} Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some of the pieces are used {{regularly}} by the Queen.

5|$|Since the Restoration, {{there have}} been many {{additions}} and alterations to the regalia. A new set of regalia was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, CharlesII having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when MaryII was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband WilliamIII. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown <b>Jewels</b> were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown <b>Jewels</b> continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with paste and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice which continued until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
