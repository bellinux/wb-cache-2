The objective was {{to build up the}} holdings of the new library of the Institute of Archaeology and Prehistory of the University of Barcelona, which were later to pass to the Department of Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology; the transfer of the Faculty of Geography and History to its present premises in the Raval district, {{in the heart of the}} historic core of Barcelona, in 2006, led to the Archaeology Library being integrated within the Biblioteca de la Facultat de Geografia i Història (Library of the Faculty of Geography and History).|$|E
50|$|Since its foundation, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences {{has been}} {{actively}} involved in cooperation with foreign institutions and activities on the international forum. Already in the 19th century the Academy initiated archival expeditions to study sources {{from the history of}} Poland (among other the so-called Roman Expedition to Vatican Archives connected with its opening in 1881), and sent its representatives to international congresses. In 1898, the Academy of Arts and Sciences became the owner of the Polish Library in Paris and opened a scientific station there. The Academy's library in Kraków carried on a broad <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> from the very beginning. In 1921, the PAU became {{a founding member of the}} Union Acadèmique Internationale (UAI). After its activities were resumed, the PAU's membership in the UAI was renewed in 1993, and the PAU began to take part in the research and publication projects of this organization. The publication of the Polish series of the “Corpus vasorum antiquorum” (CVA) was completed with volume 10, devoted to Cypriot pottery from the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. The Kraków sheet in the “Tabula impeńi Romani” (TIR) was worked out and published, and the material for sheet 12 of the “Atlas du Monde Grec et Romain” was prepared. Three volumes of the Polish series in the “Corpus antiquitatum Americanensium” (CAA) have been published; the first two volumes are devoted to the ceramics and Peruvian textiles in the collection of Kraków Archaeological Museum (the Kluger Collection, formerly the property of the PAU), and the third one deals with the materials of the Polish archaeological mission in Peru. The edition of the Polish series “Sylloge nummorum Graecorum” (SNG) has been commenced; its first four volumes are devoted to the collection of Greek coins from the Archaeological Museum in Łódź. PAU members are also participating in the realization of such UAI projects as “Corpus philosophorum medii aevi, Civitas litteraria Europaea, Moravia Magna”. The PAU has declared its intention of joining new UAI projects, such as the realization of the series “Monumenta palaeographica medii aevi” (volume 1 already worked out), “Mundus Scytho-Sarmaticus et Graeco-Romanus” (together with Ukraine).|$|E

40|$|Data from 14 nations reveal IQ gains {{ranging from}} 5 to 25 {{points in a}} single generation. Some of the largest gains occur on {{culturally}} reduced tests and tests of fluid intelligence. The Norwegian data show that a nation can make significant gains on a culturally reduced test while suffering losses on other tests. The Dutch data prove the existence of unknown environmental factors so potent that they account for 15 of the 20 points gained. The hypothesis that best fits the results is that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but rather a correlate with a weak causal link to intelligence. This hypothesis can also explain differential trends on various mental tests, such as the combination of IQ gains and Scholastic Aptitude Test losses in the United States. Over the last decade, scholars in many countries—largely un-known to one another—have been measuring IQ trends {{from one generation to}} the next. In this article their results are col-lected and analyzed so as to reap the benefits comparative data usually yield. It is also argued that this mass of data poses fun-damental problems for developmental psychology, primarily concerning what factors have the most potent effect on IQ, what IQ tests measure, and how IQ tests should be used in making between-groups comparisons. Data Collection The method used to collect data can be simply put. Question-naires, letters, or personal appeals—usually a combination of all three—were sent to all those researchers known to be inter-ested in IQ trends on the basis of scholarly correspondence and the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications.</b> One-hundred sixty-five scholars from 35 countries were contacted.

The first {{monthly meeting}} of the Royal Society of Tasmania for the 1896 session was held {{in one of the}} art {{galleries}} of the Museum on Thursday, May 28 th. The Vice-President (Sir James Agnew) expressed his pleasure at seeing such a large attendance, and thought it augured well for the support that would be given during the session. Like all other institutions, the Royal Society had suffered by the financial depression, but which he hoped and believed was now passing away. He was, at any rate, glad to say that some who had temporarily left the society had resumed their allegiance, and it was hoped that, in addition, a number of new recruits would be secured during the present session. He felt that many more in the community might, and should, with advantage, join the society. Much of the hesitation in doing so, which unfortunately existed, was groundless. There seemed to be an impression abroad that only subjects in the more severe walks of science were discussed; but as all who belonged to the society could testify, any subject appertaining to the good weal of the community was open to consideration, and that fact should result in more support being secured. For instance, that evening the first paper to be read would have reference {{to the health of the}} community. It was a subject that had been before them on more than one occasion, it being regarded as one of the very first importance. If it could be shown, as he believed Mr. Johnston in his paper would do, that the health of this metropolis and the salubrity of the colony generally was not to be surpassed in the world, the establishing of the fact must prove one of considerable importance financially and otherwise to the colony. If that be so, if its great salubrity was so established, Hobart might be chosen as the federal capital of the Australias. If the society, through Mr. Johnston, as one of its members, spread the truth as to the healthiness of Hobart, it would deserve well of the public of Tasmania. They were brought into contact with institutions throughout the scientific world by the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications.</b> There were five new members to be balloted for, namely, Mrs, Agnes Kenyon, of Melbourne; Dr. Arthur Clarke; Mr. W.

40|$|Can {{information}} {{be classified}} {{under the same}} heading as farm equipment or chemicals, {{in the same way}} as machinery which does the work of human hands, or fertilizer which enriches the soil? According to the participants at a workshop on agricultural information in Central Africa, it can indeed. The meeting was organized by CTA in Libreville, Gabon (October 7 - 11, 1991) together with the Institut de Recherche Agronomique et Zootechnique (IRAZ) and supported by the Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC). This was the first of a series of gatherings of this kind that CTA intends to organize for the coming few years. The objective of these meetings is to bring together the Centre's various target groups in order to analyze their different information needs so that a cooperative strategy can be evolved. This first meeting was meant particularly to determine the most urgent requirements in the region, as a basis for the development of remedial programmes. This procedure will be followed for all the other regions of the ACP. The primary task of agricultural information is to oil the wheels of agricultural production, and it does this by informing decision makers, promoting innovation, raising awareness and by making a link between the farm and the outside world. This last is all the more important nowadays because many of the extension and training systems set up during the last 20 years are under threat, and it is vital to keep open the channel between the scientist and the peasant farmer. For this reason the current Lomé Convention, more than any of its predecessors, puts great emphasis on the necessity to develop the ACP countries' own potential for generating and disseminating STI (scientific and technical information) in the field of agriculture and rural development. Awareness of existing STI resources is a prerequisite for development, and so the participants in the workshop underlined the necessity of making a working inventory of operational centres: research programmes should be listed, possibilities of training for scientists and documentalists in publication and dissemination of the results of their work should be identified, and existing publications in the region should be documented. From this inventory of existing resources it will be possible to link complementary activities in the different countries but an effort should be made to make them truly synergetic. Information exchange is the key to this process. Participants at the workshop recommended the creation of a climate conducive for this; this would involve workshop meetings, <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications,</b> free inter-state movement of scientists, creation of a regional scientific journal, streamlining the profession of extension officers and increased publication in international media by scientists from ACP countries. The Libreville meeting was a fruitful learning experience which, it is hoped, will have laid the foundations of a regional organization bringing together the various professions involved in agricultural and rural development. workshop on agricultural information in Central Africa.

40|$|The {{publication}} {{is devoted}} to the history of one of the greatest concepts of tectonics of Asia, that has been widely accepted and yet obliterated with time, while the splendors of this concept are doubtful. Numerous citations in the Russian papers to «The Face of the Earth» by Edward Suess {{and the fact that he}} was elected a Corresponding Member of the Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences clearly demonstrate how highly Suess’s contribution to studies of the structure and geological evolution of Asia was valued by the Russian geological community. Suess’s letters to Vladimir A. Obruchev give evidence how close and productive the relationship between Edward Suess and the Russian researchers was in the late 19 th and the early 20 th centuries and also illustrate how the great tectonic concept of Asia [Suess, 1908] was born and developed. The idea of centrifugal propagation of tectonic waves of the Altaids from a continental node located somewhere in Siberia was mainly inspired by Suess’s profound scientific intuition. The idea matured after Edward Suess got acquainted with Ivan D. Chersky’s paper [Черский, 1886] that greatly facilitated in shaping and improving this idea. It was mailed to Suess by Vladimir A. Obruchev who translated the paper, attached his own map and provided explanations to Chersky’s ideas. The available historical documents suggest that Vladimir A. Obruchev facilitated communication between the Russian geologists, on the one side, and Edward Suess and other Austrian geologists who conducted geological studies in Asia, on the other side. Being actively involved in <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> and cooperation in field data processing, Edward Suess was aware of all the details of the Russian geological studies. In addition to the concept of tectonic arcs of the Altaids and descriptions of main geological structures located in Northern Asia and China, Edward Suess adopted a concept of disjunctive dislocations proposed by the Russian geologists. While interpreting the structure of huge territories of Asia that were poorly studied then, he stuck to the orometric geometry principles and thus, unfortunately, missed the Russian conclusions on disagreement between belts and mountain ridges, superimposed folding, mélanges etc., and such features were not incorporated in his concepts. Papers of Edward Suess, including «The Face of the Earth» which was very positively accepted by the geological scientific community, have never been translated into Russian, unlike other foreign publications. In 1930 – 1940, the name of Edward Suess gradually vanished from references in the Soviet scientific papers. Such a lapse seems to have resulted from the fact that Suess’s papers were misinterpreted and misunderstood by scientists who adhered to the geosyncline theory. Examples of such errors can be easily discovered by reviewing the history of development of concepts of the Siberian and Russian cratons. The truly gentlemanly behavior demonstrated by the key researchers of geology of Asia in the late 19 th and the early 20 th centuries is highly educative and commendable. It is worth studying the scientific reports of Edward Suess and his Russian colleagues with a more detail and comprehensive approach. </p...|$|E
40|$|Congress {{has been}} aware that {{to serve the}} needs of the {{government}} and the nation it must evolve a highly developed foreign acquisitions program. The effective founding of the Library might be said to date from the placing with a London dealer in June 1800 of the first order for an initial shipment of books. The first <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> official <b>publications</b> with a foreign country, France, took place in 1837. However, foreign documents did not begin to arrive at the Library in quantity until after 1867, when Congress passed a resolution authorizing the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> public documents. The previous year, the acquisition of the 40, 000 -volume Smithsonian Institution Library gave the Library of Congress an outstanding collection <b>of</b> foreign scientific <b>publications.</b> The Smithsonian exchange system provided for its continued growth and also served as the mechanism for the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> official <b>publications.</b> As might be expected, the emphasis {{in the development of the}} Library’s collections concerning foreign geographic areas was on Western Europe. However, by the end of the nineteenth century, the Library had also accumulated a considerable Chinese collection (exchange with China started in 1869), and its acquisition in 1907 of the private library of Gennadius Vasilievich Yudin placed it among the foremost institutions in the Russian field. Collections covering other areas of the world were gradually developed but it was not until the 1940 s that emphasis was placed on the prompt and comprehensive acquisition upon <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> all materials the Library might later require. The increased attention to publications from overseas is reflected in the “Canons of Selection ” by the then Librarian of Congress, Archibald Mac-Leish, which read: “The Library of Congress should possess, in some useful form, the material parts of the records of other societies, past and present, and should accumulate, in original or in copy, full and This chapter was prepared by various members of the Library of Congress staf...|$|R

40|$|Peter Lor, University of Pretoria In the Background: The Development of International Librarianship {{during the}} Period 1870 - 1945 A great deal {{has been written}} and much more {{will no doubt be}} written, on the rise of {{documentation}} during the Belle époque and on the close association of key figures such as Otlet and La Fontaine with universalism and utopianism. Their heroic and ultimately unsuccessful project to create a universal database of scientific literature, and similar initiatives by the Royal Society and others, have overshadowed the international activities of librarians during the same period, which also saw the beginnings of international librarianship as a field of activity. Library activities across borders have a long history, but the word 2 ̆ 2 international 2 ̆ 2 was only invented by Jeremy Bentham in 1789, well more than a century after the creation of the Westphalian system. The word 2 ̆ 2 internationalism 2 ̆ 2 followed in 1843. International library activities in the form of international schemes for the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> started during the 19 th Century and from mid-century gained impetus through national and international meetings of librarians held in conjunction with universal exhibitions. The second half of the 19 th Century saw the advent of international conferences of librarians, bibliographers and bibliophiles. The first Anglo-American cataloguing code of 1908 was a product of formal library cooperation between two national library associations. The inter-war period 1918 - 1939 saw a significant growth in international librarianship. The series of international library and bibliographic conferences culminated in the founding of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) in 1927 / 9. It was also a period of growing US influence in Europe, Latin America and Africa through various processes and carried out by various agents. These included visitors to US libraries who went back to their countries to spread American library ideas, the American Library Association, involved in post-war reconstruction of library services, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and the US State Department. The intention {{of this paper is to}} paint a broad canvas of the development of international library activity as a backdrop to developments in documentation. I will also pose questions about the relationship between the two fields. What links were there? What were the differences between the protagonists in terms of their professional backgrounds and institutional settings? How did their concerns and emphasis differ, e. g. in terms of bibliographic control? Was this the period of bifurcation, in which documentation, the precursor of information science, drifted away from librarianship? W. Boyd Rayward Paul Otlet and the Organization of Knowledge For fifty years Paul Otlet devoted himself to the study of how the social and epistemic benefits of the knowledge that was buried within what he called 2 ̆ 2 documents 2 ̆ 2 could be identified, extracted and potentiated for world-wide use. His approach was two pronged. First was technical: the creation, rationalisation and international promotion of new techniques for the processing of information. Second was organisational: the deployment of national and international associations and societies which would assume information-related tasks to support the emergence of a new information based global polity. Despite the sudden and shocking disruption of World War I, this new era seemed for a moment to be the inevitable outcome of the pre-war international arbitration and peace movements that culminated in the emergence of the post-War League of Nations and its associated agencies. Like so many, Otlet was soon disillusioned in the League of Nations. During the 1920 s and 1930 s, he devoted himself to promoting the idea a World City. The Cité Mondiale was to be both a symbolical representation of his vision of a new international polity but also an architectural representation of a planned urban environment for housing the organisations, agencies, services and collections that would be needed for instantiating this vision. At the centre of the Cité Mondiale would rise what we now might call, anachronistically, a global data centre and its related services of information management and dissemination, the Mundaneum. The paper concludes with an analysis of the resonances today of these Otletian projects...|$|E
