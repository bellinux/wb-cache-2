Introduction The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tobacco, <b>alcohol</b> and illicit drugs is associated with increased risks of preventable disease, injury and mortality. <b>Harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tobacco, <b>alcohol</b> and other drugs is a significant public health concern in Australia, as are its considerable impacts on economic and social participation. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS) collects information on alcohol and tobacco consumption, and illicit drug use among the general population in Australia.

The impact of the US Surgeon General’s 1964 report on smoking is a case in point. 4 This report was an important impetus, eventually demonstrating that multiple modes of prevention and treatment intervention resulted in dramatic reduction in smoking in the US and elsewhere, which in turn contributed to reduced death rates from cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer especially. 5, 6 As regards other substance abuse, especially illegal drugs, it may be thought that the inattention from public health and healthcare providers results from a lack of effective medications, therapies or interventions t...|$|R

40|$|<b>Harmful</b> {{excessive}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> has {{a severe}} impact on society {{and it remains}} one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. However, mechanisms that underlie excessive alcohol consumption are still poorly understood, and thus available medications for alcohol use disorders are limited. Here, we report that changing the level of chromatin condensation by affecting DNA methylation or histone acetylation limits excessive alcohol drinking and seeking behaviors in rodents. Specifically, we show that decreasing DNA methylation by inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) with systemic administration of the FDA-approved drug, 5 -azacitidine (5 -AzaC) prevents excessive alcohol use in mice. Similarly, we find that increasing histone acetylation via systemic treatment with several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reduces mice binge-like alcohol drinking. We further report that systemic administration of the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, inhibits the motivation of rats to seek alcohol. Importantly, the actions of both DNMT and HDAC inhibitors are specific for alcohol, as no changes in saccharin or sucrose intake were observed. In line with these behavioral findings, we demonstrate that excessive alcohol drinking increases DNMT 1 levels and reduces histone H 4 acetylation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rodents. Together, our findings illustrate that DNA methylation and histone acetylation control the level <b>of</b> excessive <b>alcohol</b> drinking and seeking behaviors in preclinical rodent models. Our study therefore highlights the possibility that DNMT and HDAC inhibitors can be <b>used</b> to treat <b>harmful</b> alcohol abuse...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alcohol use {{disorders}} (AUDs) {{in persons}} living with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (PLHIV) in high-income countries {{have been associated with}} poor adherence to antiretroviral medications and worse HIV-related outcomes. Little is known about AUDs among people attending HIV services in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Across-sectional study was carried out among PLHIV who attended HIV services at Jimma University Specialized Hospital in September 2012. The World Health Organization’s Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tool (AUDIT) was used to measure probable hazardous, <b>harmful</b> and dependent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> (‘alcohol <b>use</b> disorders’). Associations between AUDs and other variables were explored using logistic regression analysis. All variables associated with AUDs with a p value < 0. 25 were included in the final multivariable model. Results: The overall prevalence of AUDs was 32. 6 %, with hazardous <b>use,</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> and alcohol dependence accounting for 24. 7 %, 2. 8 % and 5. 1 % of the total, respectively. There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of AUDs in persons receiving antiretroviral treatment compared to those who were antiretroviral therapy naïve (32. 6 % vs. 38. 6 %). AUDs were identified in 26. 0 % and 44. 1 % of females and males, respectively. Male gender, smoking cigarettes and psychological distress were positively associated independently with AUDs. Conclusion: The high prevalence of AUDs detected in our facility-based survey of PLHIV in Ethiopia highlights the need to integrate delivery of effective and feasible interventions for AUDs into HIV care.

40|$|Background: Numerous studies {{carried out}} during {{the last twenty years}} point to an {{increase}} of co-morbidity of harmful use of alcohole caused disorders in the population of schizophrenic patients. The results show rate of this kind of co-morbidity between 35 and 80 %. The aims of the investigation are: establishing frequency of <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia, observed against the population statistics data; determination of possible predictors of <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the population of schizophrenic patients (adolsecent bihevioural problems, child neuroticism); determination of heritage {{role in the development of}} the both nosologic entities and the analysis of the outcomes of <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the population of schizophrenic patients (suicide attempts, cognitive impairment). Subjects and methods: The population included 50 inpatients between 20 and 50 years, with primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. Diagnostic procedure was carried out by application: Structured clinical interview ICD 10 (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), Structured questionnaire for the assessment characteristics and effects of <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the population of schizophrenics - modified version, Mini mental state scale and Heteroanamnestic questionnaire. Comparison was made between the patients with schizophrenia and the patients with co-morbidity. Results: The results revealed significantly higher rate <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> co-morbidity in the male population. There is a prominent significant difference in alcoholism heritage in co-morbidity group. A statistically significant difference between the subgroups was found in the frequency of child neuroticism and adolescent behavioral problems. The results point to a higher suicidal risk and higher rate of cognitive impairment in the co-morbidity sub-group. Conclusions: Young male with schizophrenia and family history of alcoholism are especially susceptible by this type of comorbidity. Presence of child neuroticism may represent „protective factor” for development of <b>harmful</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The study stressed some serious consequences of this type of co-morbidity: increase rate of suicide attempts, as well as more frequent development of organic brain tissue impairment...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on freshman women during the critical transition into college. Specifically, the study focused on differences in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts and attitudes toward <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among freshman women prior to college. Further, the study focused on changes in <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts, and attitude toward <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among freshman women during their initial term of college. To provide background, demographic characteristics based on level <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> were compiled. The subjects in this study were 132 entering freshman women attending Oregon State University in fall 1979. The data used in testing the hypotheses under investigation were collected during summer 1979 and during the first weeks of winter term 1980. Alcohol use and alcohol use group classification were determined by a Quantity-Frequency instrument. The Student Alcohol Questionnaire measured the subjects' knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts. The attitude instrument measured attitude toward intemperate (excessive) <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The hypotheses developed to test initial differences in knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts and attitude toward <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> were tested utilizing the analysis of variance. Where significance was indicated, further analysis was conducted with the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure to determine specific initial differences among alcohol use groups. Paired t-tests were utilized to analyze changes in <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> facts, and attitudes toward alcohol use for the total sample and individual use groups. The. 05 level of significance was required for all tests. The results of the study indicated: 1.

There were significant differences in attitude toward the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> among the entering freshman women. a. The abstaining group of freshman women were significantly the least tolerant <b>of</b> intemperate <b>use</b> <b>of</b> alchol by themselves and others. b. The infrequent drinking group of freshman women supported intemperate drinking by themselves and others to a significantly greater extent than the abstaining group. c.
