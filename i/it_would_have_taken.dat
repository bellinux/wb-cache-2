5|$|Myst IV: Revelation is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Myst video game series, developed and published by Ubisoft. Revelation was the first game in the series released on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was not produced as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> twelve compact discs to fit the data. Like , Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 {{there had}} been plans for a £130 million {{combined}} cycle gas turbine power station {{on the site of}} the Ever Ready battery factory to the West of the site of the North station. AES Electrical applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for permission to build the station, which would have been twice as efficient as the coal-fired Stella stations and the first major electricity generation site built in Tyne and Wear in over 40years. The station would have had a generating capacity of 350MW. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> three years to build, and created 400construction jobs, as well as 40full-time jobs after construction. But the proposal was opposed by the coal mining industry and dropped.|$|E
5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
5|$|The only {{close-up}} {{images of}} Ariel {{were obtained by}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. The closest approach of Voyager 2 to Ariel was —significantly less than the distances to all other Uranian moons except Miranda. The best images of Ariel have a spatial resolution of about 2km. They cover about 40% of the surface, but only 35% was photographed with the quality required for geological mapping and crater counting. At {{the time of the}} flyby the southern hemisphere of Ariel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied. No other spacecraft has ever visited the Uranian system, and no mission to Uranus and its moons is planned. The possibility of sending the Cassini spacecraft to Uranus was evaluated during its mission extension planning phase. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn, and these plans were scrapped in favour of remaining at Saturn and eventually destroying the spacecraft in Saturn's atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|For example, a {{light echo}} is {{produced}} when a sudden flash from a nova is reflected off a cosmic dust cloud, and {{arrives at the}} viewer after a longer duration than <b>it</b> otherwise <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> with a direct path. Because of their geometries, light echoes can produce the illusion of superluminal speeds.|$|R
50|$|At {{nearly the}} same time there were {{proposals}} for additional bridges in the area. Cocoa Avenue (now Minuteman Causeway) was proposed to cross to Merritt Island over the Minuteman Causeway. <b>Its</b> route <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> along the old Banana River Bridge. The idea was formally denied on February 26, 1970, by the State of Florida.|$|R

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
5|$|While Germanicus enjoyed {{some success}} in his campaigns against Arminius and his allies, Tiberius decided not to attempt to conquer the Germans and {{recalled}} Germanicus to Rome. The effort <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> to conquer Germania Magna was deemed too great {{when compared with the}} low potential for profit from acquiring the new territory. Rome regarded Germany as a wild territory of forests and swamps, with little wealth compared to territories Rome already had. However, the campaign significantly healed the Roman psychological trauma from the Varus disaster, and greatly recovered Roman prestige. In addition to the recovery of two of the three lost eagles, Germanicus had fought Arminius, the leader who destroyed the three Roman legions in 9 AD, and defeated him in numerous battles. In leading his troops across the Rhine without recourse to Tiberius, he contradicted the advice of Augustus to keep that river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to potential doubts from Tiberius about his motives in taking such independent action. This error in political judgement gave Tiberius reason to controversially recall his nephew. Tacitus attributed the recall to Tiberius' jealousy of the glory Germanicus had acquired, and, with some bitterness, claims that Germanicus could have completed the conquest of Germania had he been given full independence of action.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

Moreover, one second's {{reflection}} had already assured him that this throwing of the dice could not seriously interfere {{with the success of}} his plans.

5|$|The counter-arguments {{were much}} stronger. The {{assumption}} that the Germans would be put off by losses was wrong; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> severe losses for the OKL to change its mind on target selection. The targets were also vital. The airfields themselves supported the squadrons in the field, while {{the loss of the}} vital sector-stations could well have crippled the defence system. Thus the possibility of allowing the bulk of the German bombers to reach their target unscathed was unacceptable. The idea that the Big Wing could inflict heavier losses than had been achieved up until then was based on an overestimate of the numbers of aircraft shot down by the Big Wing. Leigh-Mallory, Sholto Douglas and Bader had based their opinions on claims made by RAF units in battle. However, particularly when a large number of aircraft were engaged, it was possible for the same aircraft to be claimed by more than one pilot. As a result, the RAF claimed 100 or more German aircraft shot down in one day on five occasions, while analysis of Luftwaffe losses has shown that there were only four occasions on which the Luftwaffe lost more than 50 aircraft, and never did they lose 100 or more in a day. Nevertheless, while it is not known whether Mallory and Bader were aware that the claims of the RAF and Big Wings were exaggerated, they certainly tried to use them as a potent tool with which to remove Park and Dowding from command and pursue the Big Wing tactic.|$|E

The act <b>would</b> <b>have</b> established a $140 billion trust fund in lieu of litigation, but as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> proactively <b>taken</b> funds held in reserve by bankruptcy trusts, manufacturers and insurance companies, it was not widely supported either by victims or corporations.|$|R

It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.

Jim said the moon could a LAID them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.|$|R
