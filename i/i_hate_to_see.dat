2500|$|Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone {{called the}} Nuremberg trials a fraud. [...] "(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away {{conducting}} his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg," [...] he wrote. [...] "I don't mind {{what he does}} to the Nazis, but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This {{is a little too}} sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{even at the}} time the Nuremberg trials {{appeared}} to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was [...] "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war Schmitt {{preferred}} {{to work in}} relative isolation in Silvermine for the next 50 years, exhibiting locally or by invitation. A large retrospective exhibit was held in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1980, featuring of his works. In an interview done during the exhibition he stated: “I tried not to exhibit unless I had to. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] go out. I don’t like to show. It’s an interruption to painting but I feel I owe it to people. I’ve never sought publicity.” He continued to paint well into his nineties and celebrated his one hundredth birthday {{at his home in}} Silvermine surrounded by family and friends. He died in Norwalk, Connecticut a few months later.|$|E

60|$|I don't {{know how}} long I slept, but when I woke up, there was Rectus, sitting on a little bench by the state-room wall, with his feet braced against the berth. He was hard at work sucking a lemon. I turned over {{and looked down at}} him. He didn't look a bit sick. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him eating lemons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do {{it because}} I like it. It's a sort of {{sporting}} with your true doctor. He blazes away at a disease where he sees one, as he would at a bear or a lion; the very sight of it excites his organ of destructiveness. Don't you understand me? You hate sin, you know. Well, I hate disease. Moral evil is your devil, and physical evil is mine. I hate it, little or big; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a fellow sick; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a child rickety and pale; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a speck of dirt in the street; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a woman's gown torn; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her stockings down at heel; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything wasted, anything awry, anything going wrong; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> water-power wasted, manure wasted, land wasted, muscle wasted, pluck wasted, brains wasted; I hate neglect, incapacity, idleness, ignorance, and all the disease and misery which spring out of that. There's my devil; and I can't help it {{for the life of}} me, going right at his throat, wheresoever I meet him!" ...|$|E

He was looking well enough, {{but he had}} on a white collar and shoes, and you could tell in a minute that he'd speak polite and pay taxes and stick his little finger out while drinking, just like a sheep man or a citizen. Great skyrockets! but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Perry all {{corrupted}} and Willie-ized like that.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's what I mean to do. I met Carnforth {{driving away}} from here, {{and since the}} fact that he has been here quite often has been troubling me lately, I invited him to pull up right away. When he didn't do it I managed to get hold of the horses' heads, and went right across the road with them. Still, I stopped the team, and I was getting up to talk to Carnforth when Forster came along. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him then." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{may seem}} illogical to the reader, but this {{deference}} {{on the part}} of the old soldier did not amuse me. On the contrary it hurt me. A little pang went through me every time he yielded his leadership. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him display the slightest evidence of age, of weakness. I would rather have had him storm than sigh. Part of his irresolution, his timidity, was due, as I could <b>see,</b> <b>to</b> the unwonted noise, and to the crowds of excited men, but more of it came from the vague alarm of self-distrust which are signs of advancing years.|$|R
500|$|<b>I</b> just <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Eleanor {{let herself}} look as she does. Though never handsome, {{she always had}} to me a charming effect. Alas and alack, ever since {{politics}} have become her choicest interest, all her charm has disappeared! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, thank you," [...] breathed the artist. [...] "I didn't know. And <b>I</b> did <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the thick}} peeling go; it seemed such a waste.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know when}} I began to love Tom, but I {{found out that}} I did last winter, and was as much {{surprised}} as you are," [...] continued Polly, as if glad to unburden her heart. [...] "I {{did n't approve of}} him at all. I thought he was extravagant, reckless, and dandified. I was very much disappointed when he chose Trix, and the more I thought and saw of it, the worse I felt, for Tom was too good for her, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her do so little for him, when she might have done so much; because {{he is one of the}} men who can be led by their affections, and the woman he marries can make or mar him." ...|$|R

5000|$|Adams later apologized {{in person}} to General Nguyễn {{and his family}} for the damage it did to his reputation.

5000|$|It {{has been}} implied that Harmon was {{actually}} throwing {{the game with}} the fumbles and dropped pass. Coach Hayden Fry commented on the issue in his book High Porch Picnic: [...] "Harmon {{took a lot of}} heat because he lost four fumbles, all in the first half. That was uncharacteristic of him; I think he fumbled once during the regular season. The game film reveals that every fumble he lost was caused by a UCLA defender making a hard hit. They just knocked the ball loose. They UCLA did a great job of tackling. UCLA made bad things happen to Iowa; Iowa didn’t self-destruct. Ronnie Harmon had a tremendous football career with the Hawkeyes, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it end that way."Harmon had 14 carries for a total of 55 yards.|$|R
