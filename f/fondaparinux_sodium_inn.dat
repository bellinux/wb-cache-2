40|$|Sulfamate groups (NHSO 3 -) are {{important}} structural {{elements in the}} glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). In this work, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) line-shape analysis is used to explore the solvent exchange properties of the sulfamate NH groups within heparin-related mono-, di-, tetra-and pentasaccharides {{as a function of}} pH and temperature. The results of these experiments identified a persistent hydrogen bond within the Arixtra (<b>fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium)</b> pentasaccharide between the internal glucosamine sulfamate NH and the adjacent 3 -O-sulfo group. This discovery provides new insights into the solution structure of the Arixtra pentasaccharide and suggests that 3 -O-sulfation of the heparin N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS) residues pre-organize the secondary structure in a way that facilitates binding to antithrombin-III.

40|$|Ultralow {{molecular}} weight (ULMW) heparins are sulfated glycans that are clinically {{used to treat}} thrombotic disorders. ULMW heparins range from 1500 to 3000 daltons, corresponding from 5 to 10 saccharide units. The commercial drug Arixtra (<b>fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium)</b> is a structurally homogeneous ULMW heparin pentasaccharide that is synthesized through a lengthy chemical process. Here, we report 10 - and 12 -step chemoenzymatic syntheses of two structurally homogeneous ULMW heparins (MW = 1778. 5 and 1816. 5) in 45 and 37 % overall yield, respectively, starting from a simple disaccharide. These ULMW heparins display excellent in vitro anticoagulant activity and comparable pharmacokinetic properties to Arixtra, as demonstrated in a rabbit model. The chemoenzymatic approach is scalable and shows promise for a more efficient route to synthesize this important class of medicinal agent.

40|$|During {{pregnancy}} thrombo-prophylaxis {{could be}} required in high risk women. If a severe allergic reaction to low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) or a heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs, it's mandatory {{to stop the}} drug. Fondaparinux could be an effective option. In the present review, the maternal and pregnancy outcomes of 65 pregnancies in women using Fondaparinux were reported. It was well-tolerated and rate of pregnancy complications {{was similar to that}} observed in general population. Regarding congenital malformations, further studies are necessary to investigate the safety of the drug. Over the past few years, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has replaced unfractionated heparin as the agent of choice for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy because it has a better safety profile with respect to heparin-associated osteoporosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), as well as reduced monitoring requirements [1]. However, adverse reactions to LMWH can occur via a type I hypersensitivity reaction (urticarial rash), skin necrosis due to vasculitis (type III reaction) or a heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia (HIT). <b>Fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium</b> is a synthetic pentasaccharide that strongly binds to antithrombin and enhances the inactivation of factor Xa without interaction with factor II or platelets. Several studies showed that fondaparinux has an efficacy comparable to LMWH or UFH in the prevention of VTE in major orthopedic surgery, in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as well as pulmonary embolism (PE) without any increase of major bleeding [2]. <b>Fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium</b> has a very low cross-reactivity with both LMWH and UFH and few case reports describe reactions at the injection site of a single dose [3]. Rarely, anti PF 4 /heparin antibodies are generated during fondaparinux treatment, but they are not able to cause thrombocytopenia, because they do not bind PF 4 /fondaparinux complexes [4]. When heparin intolerance or HIT occurs in pregnant women who need thromboprophylaxis, there are limited alternative anticoagulant choices, fondaparinux could been suggested as an option. Warfarin and hirudin cross the placenta and are associated with embryo and fetal toxicities. Lagrange et al. [5] did not observe placental transfer of fondaparinux in an in vitro model with the use of dually perfused human cotyledon. On the other hand, fondaparinux has been reported to pass in vivo the placental barrier, resulting in low but measurable anti–factor Xa activity in umbilical-cord blood, so that a potential hazard cannot be ruled out [6] and [7]. However, the use of fondaparinux in pregnant women is suggested by a level 2 C recommendation from the American College of Chest Physicians for the treatment of those cases with severe allergic reactions to heparin (e. g. HIT) that cannot receive danaparoid [8]. Out of 68 pregnancies so far reported [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16] (Table 1), three were considered not evaluable, because in two cases fondaparinux had been administered one and nine days before delivery [6], and in one case the pregnancy outcome had not been described [11]. Of the remaining 65 cases, none was associated with major bleeding. Pregnancy was complicated by recurrent VTE in one case (1, 5...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSummary.   Background: Antiphospholipid {{antibodies}} {{are associated}} with thrombosis and repeated pregnancy losses during the antiphospholipid syndrome. Several experimental findings indicate that purified antiphospholipid antibodies are directly responsible for inflammation-induced pregnancy losses, or for disruption of the annexin A 5 shield at the trophoblastic interface. We previously showed that passive transfer of CIC 15, a monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody binding to cardiolipin and annexin A 5 that was isolated from a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, induces fetal resorption in pregnant mice. Objectives: To investigate the mechanisms of CIC 15 -induced pregnancy loss. Methods/results: We show that CIC 15 induces fetal loss through a new mechanism that is probably related to procoagulant activity. The time course is {{different from those of}} previously described models, and histologic analysis shows that the placentas are devoid of any sign of inflammation but display some signs of thrombotic events. Despite these differences, the CIC 15 and 'inflammatory' models share some similarities: lack of FcγRI/III dependency, and the efficacy of heparin in preventing fetal losses. However, this latter observation is here mostly attributable to anticoagulation rather than complement inhibition, because <b>fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium</b> and hirudin show similar efficiency. In vitro, CIC 15 enhances cardiolipin-induced thrombin generation. Finally, using a combination of surface-sensitive methods, we show that, although it binds complexes of cardiolipin-annexin A 5, CIC 15 is not able to disrupt the two-dimensional ordered arrays of annexin A 5. Conclusions: This human monoclonal antibody is responsible for pregnancy loss through a new mechanism involving thrombosis. This mechanism adds to the heterogeneity of the obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Chemokines play a {{critical}} role in inducing chemotaxis, extravasation, and activation of leukocytes both in routine immunosurveillance and autoimmune diseases. Traditionally, to disrupt chemokine function, strategies have focused on blockage of its interaction with the receptor. Recently, it has been demonstrated that binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is also required for the in vivo activity of many chemokines. Thus, interference with the GAG-binding of chemokines may offer an alternative, valid, anti-inflammatory strategy. However, the potential of using small polyanions to inhibit the interactions between chemokines and cell surface GAGs has not been fully explored. In this study, a mass spectrometry based filtration trapping assay was utilized to study the interactions between two CCR 2 ligands (MCP- 1 /CCL 2 and MCP- 3 /CCL 7) and a series of low molecular weight, polyanionic molecules. Findings were confirmed by using a hydrophobic trapping assay. The results indicated that Arixtra (<b>fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium),</b> sucrose octasulfate, and suramin were specific binders of the chemokines, while cyclodextrin sulfate, although the most highly sulfated molecule among the ones investigated, showed no binding. The binding stoichiometry of the small molecule ligand was determined from the measured molecular weight of the noncovalent complex. Furthermore, the dissociation constant between MCP- 3 and Arixtra was determined by using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, which compared favorably with the result of the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. The relative binding affinity of these ligands to MCP- 3 was also determined using a competitive filtration trapping assay...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the cost effectiveness of <b>fondaparinux</b> <b>sodium</b> compared with enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. Methods: Using a cohort simulation model, two primary {{analyses were conducted}} {{from the perspective of}} the US healthcare payer. Probabilities for a trial-based analysis were obtained from patients participating in the fondaparinux clinical trial programme supplemented with data from published literature. Probabilities for a label-based analysis were estimated for a hypothetical cohort of US patients receiving either fondaparinux or enoxaparin as recommended by US FDA-approved labelling. Resource use and costs were obtained from large US healthcare databases. Outcome measures were rates of symptomatic thromboembolic events and healthcare costs. Costs were in 2003 values. Results: In the trial-based analysis, fondaparinux was estimated to prevent 15. 1 symptomatic venous thromboembolic events (per 1000 patients) at 3 months for patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery compared with enoxaparin. The cost savings (per patient) of using fondaparinux over enoxaparin are $US 61 at 30 days, $US 89 at 3 months, and $US 155 at 5 years. In the label-based analysis, fondaparinux was estimated to prevent 17. 8 venous thromboembolic events (per 1000 patients) at 3 months compared with enoxaparin, producing savings per patient of $US 25 at discharge, $US 112 over 1 month, $US 141 over 3 months and $US 234 over 5 years. Results remain robust to clinically plausible variation in input parameters and assumptions. Conclusion: Our model suggests that fondaparinux, when compared with the current standard regimen of enoxaparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in major orthopaedic surgery, improves outcomes and is cost saving from a US healthcare-payer perspective over the broad range of assumptions evaluated.
