40|$|Abstract—A Dyck {{shift and}} a Motzkin shift are {{mathematical}} models for constraints on genetic sequences. In {{terms of the}} theory of symbolic dynamics, neither of the Dyck shift nor the Motzkin shift is sofic. In terms of the mathematical language theory, they are non-regular and context free languages. There-fore we can not use the Perron-Frobenius theory to <b>calculate</b> <b>capacities</b> of these constraints. O. Milenkovic has shown that the DSV (Delèst-Schẗzenberger-Viennot) theory for grammars gives us a method of <b>calculating</b> <b>capacities</b> of constraints modeled with context-free grammars. On the other hand, W. Krieger shown that the capacity of the Dyck shift with brackets of n kinds is log(n+ 1). Recently, K. Inoue has shown that the capacity of the Motzkin shift with brackets of n kinds and neutral symbols of m kinds is log(n+m+ 1). We give alternative proofs for these results by using the DSV theory. We also show that the DSV method allow us to <b>calculate</b> the <b>capacity</b> of a constraint given as a combinations of context free languages and shifts of finite type...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Concentrations of dioxins in surface {{sediment}}s and a sediment core {{from the}} coast of southern Vietnam were determined. In surface sediments, concentrations of both PCDD/DFs and coplanar-PCBs were higher in inland than in offshore samples. However, proportion of PCDFs in total PCDD/DFs was higher in inland than in the marine area samples, {{and it can be}} presumed that some combustion source might exist in inland acting as a source of PCDD/ DFs to this region. On the other hand, coplanar-PCBs were specifically high in particular locations of inland and marine area, indicating that scattered hotspots may be present both in inland and the marine areas. Various technical PCBs can be suspected as pollution sources depending on the isomer profiles of different commercial mixtures. In core sediment analysis, no temporal trend either in total concentration or isomer profile was observed. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, which was present in chemical defoliants, was not detected in any of the layers analyzed. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD which is present in chemical defoliants might have diffused in the ocean or remain in deeper layers than in the depth of from which the sample for the present study was collected.
