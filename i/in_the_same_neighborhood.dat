On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E

Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed.

5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>neighborhood</b> recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The public {{perception}} that mental disorder is {{strongly associated with}} violence drives both legal policy (eg, civil commitment) and social practice (eg, stigma) toward people with mental disorders. This study describes and characterizes the prevalence of community violence {{in a sample of}} people discharged from acute psychiatric facilities at 3 sites. At one site, a comparison group of other residents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> was also assessed. METHODS: We enrolled 1136 male and female patients with mental disorders between the ages of 18 and 40 years in a study that monitored violence to others every 10 weeks during their first year after discharge from the hospital. Patient self-reports were augmented by reports from collateral informants and by police and hospital records. The comparison group consisted of 519 people living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhoods <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> patients resided after hospital discharge. They were interviewed once about violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 10 weeks. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} the prevalence of violence by patients without symptoms of substance abuse and the prevalence of violence by others living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> who were also without symptoms of substance abuse. Substance abuse symptoms significantly raised the rate of violence <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> patient and the comparison groups, and a higher portion of patients than of others in their neighborhoods reported symptoms of substance abuse. Violence in both patient and comparison groups was most frequently targeted at family members and friends, and most often took place at home. CONCLUSIONS: 2 ̆ 2 Discharged mental patients 2 ̆ 2 do not form a homogeneous group in relation to violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community. The prevalence of community violence by people discharged from acute psychiatric facilities varies considerably according to diagnosis and, particularly, co-occurring substance abuse diagnosis or symptoms...|$|R
