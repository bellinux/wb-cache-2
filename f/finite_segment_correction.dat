40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of <b>finite</b> <b>segment</b> size and weak chain {{stiffness}} on the properties of polymer solutions in the dilute lirait. We consider both weak coupling (cross over from G- to excluded volume - conditions) and strong coupling (very good solvents), {{pointing out that the}} renormalization group in its standard field theoretic implementation allows for two universal branches corresponding to these two different situations. The strong coupling branch implicitly relies on the existence of a <b>finite</b> <b>segment</b> size, a feature which however does not explicitly show up in the renormalized results. Beyond the leading `corrections to scaling' described by the standard renormalization group flow, the strong coupling branch necessarily is affected by nonuniversal corrections. In field theoretic renormalization we include the first order effects of <b>finite</b> <b>segment</b> size or stiffness in terras of an expansion of the scaling functions about the universal limit. We compare to direct renormalization, where <b>finite</b> <b>segment</b> size or stiffness are included into the renormalization group equations. This somewhat magnifies the effects, but still the nonuniversal corrections are negligible for chains longer than about 500 freely rotating units. Qualitatively the effects in both renormalization schemes are the saine, consistent with experimental or Monte Carlo results...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the negative Dirichlet Laplacian on an infinite waveguide embedded in ^ 2, and <b>finite</b> <b>segments</b> thereof. The waveguide is a perturbation of a periodic strip {{in terms of}} a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables which influence the curvature. We derive explicit lower bounds on the first eigenvalue of <b>finite</b> <b>segments</b> of the randomly curved waveguide in the small coupling (i. e. weak disorder) regime. This allows us to estimate the probability of low lying eigenvalues, a tool which is relevant in the context of Anderson localization for random Schrödinger operators.
