40|$|Abstract Seismic aftershock-hazard {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the first steps toward estab-lishing an integrated risk-based decision-making support framework for emergency management in the event of an ongoing aftershock sequence. This work focuses on providing adaptive <b>daily</b> <b>forecasts</b> of the mean daily rate of exceeding various spectral acceleration values (the aftershock hazard). Two well-established earthquake-occurrence models suitable for <b>daily</b> seismicity <b>forecasts</b> associated with the evolution of an aftershock sequence, namely, the modified Omori’s aftershock model (MO) and the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) are adopted. An adaptive and evolution-ary MO-based aftershock occurrence model with distinct spatial and temporal compo-nents is proposed. In this model, the parameters deciding the temporal decay are updated based on the data provided by the ongoing aftershock sequence. This model adopts an evolutionary spatial seismicity pattern loosely based on spatial clustering of aftershock events in the sequence. Bayesian updating is also employed to provide sequence-based parameter estimates for a given ground-motion prediction model. <b>Daily</b> <b>forecasts</b> of the mean rate of exceedance of various spectral acceleration levels are calculated based on alternative occurrence models and the updated ground-motion prediction relation. As a numerical example, <b>daily</b> <b>forecasts</b> of the aftershock-hazard curve are obtained for the L’Aquila aftershock sequence based on the MO-based and ETAS occurrence models, and an updated version of the Sabetta and Pugliese (1996) ground-motion prediction model.

40|$|It is {{well known}} in the {{hydrometeorology}} literature that developing real-time <b>daily</b> streamflow <b>forecasts</b> in a given season significantly depends on the skill of <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>forecasts</b> over the watershed. Similarly, it is widely known that streamflow is the most important predictor in estimating nutrient loadings and the associated concentration. The intent {{of this study is to}} bridge these two findings so that daily nutrient loadings and the associated concentration could be predicted using <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>forecasts</b> and previously observed streamflow as surrogates of antecedent land surface conditions. By selecting 18 relatively undeveloped basins in the southeast US (SEUS), we evaluate the skill in predicting observed total nitrogen (TN) loadings in the Water Quality Network (WQN) by first developing the <b>daily</b> streamflow <b>forecasts</b> using the retrospective weather forecasts based on K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) resampling approach and then forcing the forecasted streamflow with a nutrient load estimation (LOADEST) model to obtain <b>daily</b> TN <b>forecasts.</b> Skill in developing forecasts of streamflow, TN loadings and the associated concentration were computed using rank correlation and RMSE (root mean square error), by comparing the respective forecast values with the WQN observations for the selected 18 Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) stations. The <b>forecasted</b> <b>daily</b> streamflow and TN loadings and their concentration have statistically significant skill in predicting the respective daily observations in the WQN database at all 18 stations over the SEUS. Only two stations showed statistically insignificant relationships in predicting the observed nitrogen concentration. We also found that the skill in predicting the observed TN loadings increases with the increase in drainage area, which indicates that the large-scale precipitation reforecasts correlate better with precipitation and streamflow over large watersheds. To overcome the limited samplings of TN in the WQN data, we extended the analyses by developing retrospective <b>daily</b> streamflow <b>forecasts</b> over the period 1979 – 2012 using reforecasts based on the K-NN resampling approach. Based on the coefficient of determination (R 2 Q -daily) of the <b>daily</b> streamflow <b>forecasts,</b> we computed the potential skill (R 2 TN-daily) in developing <b>daily</b> nutrient <b>forecasts</b> based on the R 2 of the LOADEST model for each station. The analyses showed that the forecasting skills of TN loadings are relatively better in the winter and spring months, while skills are inferior during summer months. Despite these limitations, there is potential in utilizing the <b>daily</b> streamflow <b>forecasts</b> derived from real-time weather <b>forecasts</b> for developing <b>daily</b> nutrient <b>forecasts,</b> which could be employed for various adaptive nutrient management strategies for ensuring better water quality...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 07 An {{individual}} {{wakes up}} every morning and prepares themselves for the day by checking the <b>daily</b> <b>forecast</b> either through their phone or by the news. In response to either the hot or cold temperature, amount of precipitation, or wind speed, he or she will apply the correct number of layers in accordance with the day's weather conditions. This is done to achieve a maximum amount of comfort during the whole day and gives the person a sense of flexibility to the changes within a day. If a building could respond like a person, by checking the <b>daily</b> <b>forecast</b> and countering with passive and active systems as needed, then it would reduce the building's reliance on active systems that would require more energy use. How can Building Automation Systems utilize these predictive climate technologies to circumvent current oversights and environmental control errors? EBOSS, or Evolutionary Building Operations Systems Solver, is a grasshopper definition developed specifically to help an existing building foster more appropriate responses to changing weather conditions that create oversights and environmental control errors. EBOSS provides simple, interactive systems selection for the building that utilizes an Artificial Neural Network for a more intelligent Building Automation System. This methodology was devised after observing that there is a lack in the amount of depth and understanding of how and why systems are being used which limits each system within a building to stationary setpoints that are unable to adjust to changing weather. EBOSS will instead think of each system not as a single stationary element, but will control and maintain the building’s systems based off past, present, and future data...|$|E
