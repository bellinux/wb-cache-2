The simulation and measurement results show that side-fed <b>helix</b> <b>antennas</b> of various radii gives near perfect circular polarization (CP) almost over the whole sphere except at and around nulls, at a certain turn angle by properly proportioning the area of loop (A) with the product of pitch (ρ) and radianlength (l) of <b>helix.</b> <b>Helix</b> <b>antennas</b> with smaller radii give axial ratio (AR) close to one at higher values of turn angle with lower value of resonant input impedances but CP is less sensitive to inaccuracy in turn angle. However <b>helix</b> <b>antennas</b> with larger radii results in AR close to one at lower values of turn angle and provides better values of input resistance but its AR is more sensitive to variations in turn angle.

50|$|The {{downlink}} {{telemetry signal}} was transmitted at 2273 MHz, over a ±1 MHz bandwidth as a right-hand circularly polarized signal at a nominal power of 5 W and peak power of 7 W.

An omnidirectional antenna {{can be used}} for uplink and downlink, or a medium gain <b>helix</b> <b>antenna</b> can be used (downlink only). Since the spacecraft was spin-stabilized, the spin resulted in a bias in the Doppler signal due to the spacecraft antenna pattern spinning with respect to the Earth station of 0.417 Hz (27.3 mm/s) for the omnidirectional antenna, and −0.0172 Hz (−1.12 mm/s) for the medium gain antenna.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the development and improvement of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) as well as Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). WSN consist of interlinked, wireless devices (nodes) capable of relaying data wirelessly between the nodes. The applications of WSNs are very broad and cover both wireless fitness monitoring systems such as pulse watches or wireless temperature monitoring of buildings, among others. The topics investigated in the work presented within this thesis covers antenna design, wireless propagation environment evaluation and modeling, adaptive antenna control and wireless nodes system design and evaluation. In order to provide an end-user suitable solution for wireless nodes the devices require both small form factor and good performance {{in order to be}} competitive on the marked and thus the main part of this thesis focuses on techniques developed and data collected to help achieve these goals.   Several different prototype systems have been developed which have been used to measure data by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), GKN Aerospace Sweden AB, the Swedish Transport Administration. The system developed with GKN Aerospace was used to do real-time test measurements inside a running RM 12 jet engine and required a substantial amount of measurements, environmental modeling and system validation in order to properly design a wireless system suitable for the harsh and fast fading environment inside a jet engine. For FOI improvements were made on a wearable wireless body area network initially developed during the authors master thesis work.

The formulation is analytical, {{based on the assumption}} of uniform SWTHA and CWTHA currents and the large ratio of the toroidal antenna radius over the turn radius. The solution is general enough for any number of wound turns. The results are finally reduced to those existing results available elsewhere in literature by letting the radius be zero (for infinitely thin wire and circular loop antennas) and the winding number be zero (for the normal circular loop antennas). The reduced results of the potential components are the same as those in the textbooks.
