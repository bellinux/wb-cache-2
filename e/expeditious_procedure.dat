5000|$|At {{the start}} of Dillard's tenure the court's {{decision}} processes were extraordinarily protracted and cumbersome, involving numerous exchanges of individual memoranda, conferences, oral hearings, and repeated circulation of opinions, jointly and individually authored. In order to encourage states to look more often to the ICJ for the resolution of disputes, the court appointed a committee of its judges to simplify its rules of procedure. Dillard served on the committee and became its chairman. The committee's major innovation was to give parties an option to submit a case to a [...] "chamber" [...] of five judges instead of to the full court of fifteen, thereby making possible a more <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E

This greener protocol is catalyzed by phosphosulfonic acid, and proceeds efficiently {{in the absence of}} any organic solvent under optimized, mild, green and environmentally benign reaction conditions in high yields within 20 - 55 minutes...|$|E
40|$|Cross {{correlations}} of ambient seismic noise recordings are studied to infer shear-wave velocities (VS) profiles versus depth. Experiments are performed, over inter-station distances ranging from 60 m to about 400 m, {{in the crowded}} and noisy historical centre of Napoli, where the conditions {{for the use of}} active (controlled source) seismic spreadings are prohibitive, even for just one receiver. From the noise cross correlation, group velocity dispersion curves are extracted, with FTAN method, and their non-linear inversion supplies VS profiles versus depth. The information of nearby stratigraphies and the range of VS variability for samples of Neapolitan soils and rocks confirms the validity and reliability of the results obtained with our <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedure.</b> If successfully tested in other geological settings, the proposed approach is a low cost methodology to get reliable VS velocity profiles versus depth...|$|E

The Convention provides that all Contracting States, as well as any judicial and administrative bodies of those Contracting States, “shall act expeditiously in all proceedings seeking the return of a children” and that those institutions shall use the most <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedures</b> available to the end that final decision be made within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings.|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of coronary arteriography with Judkins' technique {{the rate of}} major complications in 713 patients was 2. 1 %, a rate similar to or lower than those reported from other studies, even though more major complications were considered in this study. No deaths occurred. Although the rate of "other" complications was noted {{as part of the}} quality care survey, it cannot be compared with that in other studies, since the latter did not consider events such as hematoma or incomplete catheterization. The low complication rate may be related to <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedures,</b> familiarity with the Judkin's technique and the operators' experience. Local quality care assessment or clinical review committees should formally evaluate the complication rates for operative and invasive procedures performed in their own institutions...|$|R

Under this program, federal habeas corpus for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, Congress conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the U.S. attorney general, with a possible appeal {{of the state to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As of March 2016, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fragility curves {{represent}} the probabilities that structural damages, under {{various levels of}} seismic excitation, will exceed the specified damage states by means of earthquake intensity damage relations. Conceptual aspects related to seismic vulnerability, damage and risk evaluation are discussed first, together with a short review {{of the most widely}} used possibilities for the seismic evaluation of structures. The capacity spectrum method starting from capacity and fragility curves is then discussed. The determination of capacity curves for buildings using a non-linear structural analysis tools is then explained, together with a simplified <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedure</b> allowing the development of fragility curves. Next, the seismic risk of the special truss moment frame (STMF) systems of Tehran, the capital of Iran, is analysed in this paper using the capacity spectrum method. The seismic hazard of the studied area is described by using the reduced 5 %-damped elastic response spectra. Significant damage is obtained for mid-rise and high-rise special truss moment frames with a Vierendeel middle panel, because of the buckling and early fracture of truss web members. Special truss moment frames with an X-diagonal middle segment also show a low seismic capacity leading to significant expected damage...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} significant primary energy saving and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction, CHP (combined heat and power) {{technology can be}} adopted largely for industrial and civil sectors. Waiting for the cutting-edge appliances (i. e. Fuel Cell) wide deployment, ICEs (internal combustion engines) fuelled with an environmentally-friendly fuel, such as H 2 NG (hydrogen-natural gas mixtures) could represent the bridge technology towards the forthcoming pure hydrogen economy. This paper deals {{with the results of}} an experimental campaign carried out on a Single Cylinder ICE, fuelled with NG (natural gas) and H 2 NG @ 15 % vol. In detail, energy performances were assessed at rated and partial loads. From data analysis, it emerged that the electrical efficiency increased up to 2. 28 %, {{at the expense of the}} heat recovery one, having added hydrogen. Additionally, due to the higher water content in exhaust gas when H 2 NG is burned, it was investigated on how heat recovery efficiency has been affected by condensing operating conditions. Finally, to estimate this benefit, an <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed building three maps for H 2 NG blends condensing properties from 0 % up to 30 % vol. of H 2. Their outputs provided the condensation efficiency value and the absolute gain of heat recovery one with varying exhaust gas temperatures and hydrogen fraction in the mixture...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{isolation}} ofanaerobes is one which the worker is inclined to approach with apologies. Every month or so a paper appears in some journal in which a new and <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedure</b> for the separation of anaerobes is. described. There are many successful ways of isolating anaerobes and it is unwise torecommend any one method above all others. I have succeeded with various arrangements; and wish in this paper to analyze some of the principles governing the isolation of these organisms and to explain {{a few of the}} pitfalls which have caused many workers to believe that the securing of "absolutely pure " anae-robic cultures is a difficult matter. With a little practice and with the exercise of much discrimination, anaerobes may be isolated as quickly, or nearly as quickly, as aerobes. Contamination occurs somewhat more frequently in anaerobic cultures than in those of aerobes. Contamination of originally pure cultures may be attributed to the following causes: (1) In-sufficiently sterilized media; anaerobe media are usually pasty and require more careful sterilization than others. (2) Inocu-lation transfer involving the exposure of the cotton plug and of the inoculum to the air. I have noted in working in London and near the sea in San Francisco, that the more dusty the air, the more frequent are contaminations, and the contamination flora may vary according to location. (3) During incubation in closed jars the cotton plugs may become sufficiently moist fo...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline an <b>expeditious</b> {{numerical}} <b>procedure</b> {{to calculate the}} Stokes flow in a corner due to the rotation of a scraping circular boundary. The method is also applicable to other wedge geometries. We employ a collocation technique utilising a basis of eddy (similarity) functions introduced by Moffatt (1964) {{that allows us to}} satisfy automatically the governing equations for the streamfunction and all the boundary conditions {{on the surface of the}} wedge. The circular honing problem thereby becomes one-dimensional requiring only the satisfaction of conditions on the circular boundary. The advantage of using the Moffatt eddy functions as a basis in wedge geometry is clear and the technique greatly reduces many of the concerns with accuracy and time expenditure associated with alternative numerical methods. An investigation of the details of the eddy structure for our particular geometry is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of legal assurance, justice and expediency are properly stipulated in {{the provisions of}} the Act Number 37 Year 2004.   The legal assurance is seen by the rapidity of the settlement and the <b>expeditious</b> evidentiary <b>procedure.</b> The justice is reflected in equality principle in the proceeding. Then, the expediency is conceived from the imposition of bankruptcy as the last resort (ultimum remidium) and the application of open to public-trial. Nevertheless, in certain case laws from the Commercial Court, the principles were not applied harmoniously.   The legal assurance appears to be more emphasized than the other principles. Take for example the bankruptcy case of PT Telekomu-nikasi Phones (District-Commercial Court of Central Jakarta Number: 48 /Bankruptcy/ 2012 /PN Nia-ga. Jkt. Pst) that has been reviewed and nullified by the Supreme Court Number: 704 K/Pdt. Sus/ 2012). Key words:  legal certainty, justice, expediency, bankruptcy decision...|$|R

40|$|Tabique {{construction}} {{is one of}} the main Portuguese traditional building techniques that use earth based building materials. It is peculiar building technique which uses corn's cob as a filling material for the external tabique walls. The existing tabique construction in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro region of northeast Portugal was studied to learn from it for modern day construction. The research showed that corn's cob, an agricultural waste, has the potential to be used as a sustainable building material for thermal insulation. An experimental work concluded that there are significant similarities between the corn's cob and the extruded polystyrene (XPS) material in terms of microstructure and chemical composition. Furthermore, the results obtained from an <b>expeditious</b> experimental thermal <b>procedure</b> indicate that the corn's cob may have adequate thermal properties for building purpose.

(1) the Commission {{has been}} {{notified}} by the Secretary of State {{that it is}} the judgment of the executive branch that the proposed export or exemption will not be inimical to the common defense and security, or that any export in the category to which the proposed export belongs would not be inimical to the common defense and security because it lacks significance for nuclear explosive purposes. The Secretary of State shall, within ninety days after the enactment of this section, establish orderly and <b>expeditious</b> <b>procedures,</b> including provision for necessary administrative actions and inter-agency memorandum of understanding, which are mutually agreeable to the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Commerce, the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the preparation of the executive branch judgment on export applications under this section. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, explicit direction on the handling of such applications, express deadlines for the solicitation and collection of the views of the consulted agencies (with identified officials responsible for meeting such deadlines), an inter-agency coordinating authority to monitor the processing of such applications, predetermined <b>procedures</b> for the <b>expeditious</b> handling of intra-agency and inter-agency disagreements and appeals to higher authorities, frequent meetings of inter-agency administrative coordinators to review the status of all pending applications, and similar administrative mechanisms. To the extent practicable, an applicant should be advised of all the information required of the applicant for the entire process for every agency's needs {{at the beginning of the}} process. Potentially controversial applications should be identified as quickly as possible so that any required policy decisions or diplomatic consultations can be initiated in a timely manner. An immediate effort should be undertaken to establish quickly any necessary standards and criteria, including the nature of any required assurances or evidentiary showings, for the decisions required under this section. The processing of any export application proposed and filed as of the date of enactment of this section shall not be delayed pending the development and establishment of procedures to implement the requirements of this section.

In submitting any such judgment, the Secretary of State shall specifically address the extent to which the export criteria then in effect are met and the extent to which the cooperating party has adhered to the provisions of the applicable agreement for cooperation. In the event he considers it warranted, the Secretary may also address the following additional factors, among others : ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{stressful}} conditions in aquaculture facilities there is a high risk of bacterial infections among cultured fish. Chlortetracycline (CTC) is one of the antimicrobials used to solve this problem. It is a broad spectrum antibacterial active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Numerous analytical methods for screening, identifying, and quantifying CTC in animal products have been developed over the years. An alternative and advantageous method should rely on <b>expeditious</b> and efficient <b>procedures</b> providing highly specific and sensitive measurements in food samples. Ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) could meet these criteria. The only ISE reported in literature for this purpose used traditional electro-active materials. A selectivity enhancement could however be achieved after improving the analyte recognition by molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Several MIP particles were synthesized and used as electro-active materials. ISEs based in methacrylic acid monomers showed the best analytical performance according to slope (62. 5 and 68. 6 mV/decade) and detection limit (4. 1 × 10 − 5 and 5. 5 × 10 − 5 mol L− 1). The electrodes displayed good selectivity. The ISEs are not affected by pH changes ranging from 2. 5 to 13. The sensors were successfully applied to the analysis of serum, urine and fish samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{finding of}} {{recycled}} lithic artifacts in the Mousterian stratigraphic sequences of Grotta Fumane, Grotta San Bernardino and Grotta Broion {{in the southern}} Alps has stimulated investigations into the economic behavior and technology of Neanderthals during the Late Pleistocene. These three archives preserve remarkable evidence, dated from 90 ky and 40 ky BP, and show distinct signatures in terms of lithic technology, settlement and the provisioning of flint. A study {{has been carried out}} with the aim to detect the possible differentiation of tools between expedient/opportunistic vs. curated/planned and to identify the diverse aspects of tool-kit provisioning to thus infer mobility and provisioning strategies. From the identification of double patinae and from comparisons between these three sites it has been possible to identify occurrences of recycling consisting of the collection and exploitation of old cores and flakes in <b>expeditious</b> or curated <b>procedures.</b> The evidence suggests that the recycling of old artifacts played a variable role in the Neanderthal economic strategy. The final Middle Palaeolithic in the north of Italy is recorded in a handful of sheltered sites and very few open-air settlements that were visited for short-term occupations or that were repeatedly used to accomplish complex tasks, mostly aimed at the exploitation of mineral, non-mineral and subsistence resources. Huge quantities of lithic raw material as well as the geomorphic and ecological variability in the belt between the upper alluvial plain and the pre-Alps depict the context in which Neanderthals lived and circulated in accordance with a model of low residential mobility...|$|R
