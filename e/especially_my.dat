25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 book {{excerpt from}} Roger Ailes: Off Camera, Ailes spoke about facing death, saying, [...] "Because of my hemophilia, I've been {{prepared}} to face death all of my life. When it comes, I'll be fine, calm. I'll miss life, though. <b>Especially</b> <b>my</b> family." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I want {{to thank}} God first for {{everything}} that happened in my life. I {{want to thank}} my children. I want to thank my family, <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> sister, Odeet. I {{want to thank all}} the beautiful friends who share with me my sufferings for 15 years and four months and they so encouraged me, specifically Mr. and Mrs. Meg Eggleston who become a sister to me. She helped me a lot to accept everything. I thank everyone from the staff, nurses, chaplains. I thank everyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking with Prestige Hong Kong, Thicke explained: [...] "The {{new album}} is call Morning Sun. It’s about fresh starts, new beginnings, and the heralding in {{of a new}} day. It’s about {{the last year of}} my life, the time I’ve spent with my friends and family and <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> son." [...] Thicke also spoke of working again with Pharrell and Timbaland as well as with new {{collaborators}} DJ Mustard, Max Martin, and Ricky Reed. Another new single [...] "Back Together", featuring Nicki Minaj, was released on August 6, 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Charles [...] "Wag" [...] Bennett, one of {{the judges}} at the 1966 competition, was {{impressed}} with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. <b>Especially</b> <b>my</b> need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout series three (2007), {{companion}} Martha Jones pines for the Doctor's affection {{ever since}} a kiss between them {{which was only}} used as a [...] "genetic transfer" [...] to distract their pursuers. She is distraught when, temporarily turned into a human in [...] "Human Nature", the Doctor's human persona John Smith, {{falls in love with}} nurse Joan Redfern. She admits in [...] "The Family of Blood" [...] to Smith that [...] " [...] is everything to me, and he doesn't even look at me, but I don't care, because I love him to bits, and I hope to God he won't remember me saying this". The Doctor tells Joan he is capable of everything that Smith was, but she rejects his attempt to establish a relationship with her as the Doctor. In the following episode, [...] "Blink", he refers to being [...] "rubbish at weddings, <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> own". Martha eventually quits as the Doctor's full-time companion in the series finale [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] because she is in love with the Doctor and he seems unable or unwilling to reciprocate; she received similar commiseration from Jack Harkness, who is also infatuated with him, in [...] "The Sound of Drums".|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't {{so much to}} try {{my temper}} as I have now, and then you must remember, Madame Goesler, that I regard these people as being <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> enemies." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore, bear {{lightly on}} her, oh my critics! Bear lightly on her <b>especially,</b> <b>my</b> critics feminine. To {{the worst of}} your wrath and scorn I willingly subject the other lovers with whom my tale is burthened.|$|E
6000|$|Noel got up, and put {{her hands}} on her father's shoulders. [...] "Forgive me for all my badness, and all my badness to come, <b>especially</b> all <b>my</b> badness to come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, colonel. I am {{sure that}} I am very {{grateful}} to you, and all the officers of the regiment, for the kindness you have shown me, <b>especially</b> since <b>my</b> father's death. I shall always remember it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}}, Mr. Cossey," [...] {{answered}} Ida almost passionately: [...] "I have thought until I {{am tired of}} thinking, and I do not consider it fair that you should press me like this, <b>especially</b> before <b>my</b> father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dearest Lady Crich,' she said, 'you are {{beautiful}} as an angel on earth. Angel--angel--don't you think she's good enough and beautiful {{enough to go}} to heaven, Gudrun? They will be in heaven, won't they--and <b>ESPECIALLY</b> <b>my</b> darling Lady Crich! Mrs Marshall, I say!' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{while he}} talked we all listened--how eagerly!--drinking in his words, <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> mother, her eyes bright with the {{moisture}} rising in them; and she often afterwards recalled that evening guest, who was seen no more by us but had left an enduring image in our hearts.|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} spoken {{to himself and}} quite beneath his breath, and of course not meant to reach me. But one of the curious concomitants of my state was that all my senses, and <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> hearing, had become most {{abnormally}} acute. A whisper far away was now {{to me like a}} loud remark made in a room.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--and I don't {{care if they}} are," [...] said Faith. [...] "Do {{you think}} I could see any one {{freezing}} to death without helping them if I could? It wouldn't be right, <b>especially</b> when <b>my</b> father's a minister." ...|$|R
50|$|Be praised, my Lord, {{through all}} your creatures, <b>especially</b> through <b>my</b> lord Brother Sun, who brings the day; {{and you give}} light through him. And he is {{beautiful}} and radiant in all his splendor! Of you, Most High, he bears the likeness.|$|R
6000|$|Gus admired {{it as much}} as I did; for since <b>my</b> return, and <b>especially</b> since <b>my</b> venison {{dinner and}} drive with Lady Drum, he thought I was the finest fellow in the world, and boasted about his [...] "West End friend" [...] everywhere.|$|R
60|$|These {{thoughts}} quite {{turned my}} resolutions again, and when I came to discourse {{with my brother}} again I told him that I inclined to stay and take my lot in that station in which God had placed me, and {{that it seemed to}} be made more <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> duty, on the account of what I have said.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{about the}} tune of it. I would take her without a {{shilling}} to-morrow, if she would have me,--because I like her. She is the only girl I ever did like. But what {{is the use of}} my liking her? They have painted me so black among them, <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> father, that no decent girl would think of marrying me." ...|$|E
60|$|CHRIS. Yes, but greatly {{against my}} will; <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> inward and sinful thoughts, with which all my countrymen, {{as well as}} myself, were delighted. But now all those things are my grief; and, might I but choose mine own things, I would choose never to think of those things more; but when I would be doing that which is best, that which is worst is with me.|$|E
5000|$|In From Dead to Worse {{the heroine}} gives her boyfriend the push on {{realising}} {{that his first}} priority will always be caring for his half-mad were-tiger mother: '"He had too much baggage....Gosh, I never thought I'd catch myself saying that. <b>Especially</b> considering <b>my</b> own"'.|$|R
5000|$|On {{learning}} of his death, former Prime Minister James Callaghan said that Cledwyn Hughes 'was an unfailing counsellor to me throughout my political life, and <b>especially</b> during <b>my</b> time as prime minister. Wales {{has lost a}} great man, and I mourn a true friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who, I, Galeotti?" [...] replied Louis mildly. [...] "Alas! thou mistakest me!--Am I not captive--and {{should not}} I be patient, <b>especially</b> since <b>my</b> anger can only show my impotence?--Tell me then in sincerity.--Have you fooled me?--Or is your science true, {{and do you}} truly report it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I should imagine," [...] {{said the}} {{sculptor}} gravely; [...] "but {{it is an}} advantage that I {{have little or no}} opportunity of enjoying. I know not what became of Hilda after my parting from you. She was not <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> companion in any part of our walk. The last I saw of her she was hastening back to rejoin you in the courtyard of the Palazzo Caffarelli." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{under other}} circumstances, I should have said, Nothing at all except congratulate them most heartily, more <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> son. But {{in this case}} there are reasons which make such a course impossible. As you know, Morris is {{engaged to be married}} to my niece, Miss Porson, and it is a {{contract}} which, even if he wished it, honour would forbid him to break, for family as well as for personal reasons." ...|$|E
60|$|And I feel persuaded in my inmost soul, {{that it is}} to {{the fact}} of my having been a main-top-man; and <b>especially</b> <b>my</b> {{particular}} post being on the loftiest yard of the frigate, the main-royal-yard; that I am now enabled to give such a free, broad, off-hand, bird's-eye, and, more than all, impartial account of our man-of-war world; withholding nothing; inventing nothing; nor flattering, nor scandalising any; but meting out to all--commodore and messenger-boy alike--their precise descriptions and deserts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear it, Colonel. It is really hateful, being {{regarded}} {{as a man who}} has done something, <b>especially</b> at <b>my</b> age. However, I shall leave Hallett to bear the brunt of it. I know that he is on the lookout for a wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Iduna the Fair {{would live}} through it," [...] {{answered}} Ragnar, {{with a hard}} laugh. [...] "But you are right; and, what is more, there will be trouble among the men also, <b>especially</b> with <b>my</b> father and in my own heart. After all there is but one Olaf." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Stella agreed. [...] "Don't run any risks. We shall {{come across}} one another now and then, <b>especially</b> since <b>my</b> father seems {{determined}} to throw open his doors {{once more to}} the usual mob. By the by, does he ever say anything about me?" ...|$|R
