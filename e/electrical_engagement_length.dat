This study was carried out to determine the <b>engagement</b> <b>length</b> of intramedullary pins into clavicular fractures using a small and a large pin. Seven pairs of fresh cadaveric clavicles were prepared and arranged into Group 1 and Group 2 for paired study. A mid-third clavicular fracture was created at the junction of the two curves of the clavicle. In Group 1, a 3. 2 mm diameter threaded Steinman pin was introduced into the medullary canal of the clavicle by retrograde technique and the medial fragment of the fracture was drilled until the pin perforated the bone cortex. In Group 2, a 4 mm diameter threaded Steinman pin was used in the same manner. The results showed that Group 1 had an average engagement of pin into the clavicle of 9. 11 cm with a ratio to total length of the clavicle of 0. 59. In Group 2, the average <b>engagement</b> <b>length</b> into the clavicle was 7. 17 cm with a ratio of 0. 47. The difference was significant, with the smaller pin providing better fixation. The pins in both groups perforated the lateral fragment at the posterosuperior aspect and the medial fragment at the anterior aspect of the clavicle. The angle that the pin made with the long axis of the clavicle in Group 1 was 22. 43 degrees and in Group 2, 26. 57 degrees. Although the 3. 2 mm diameter pin was more aligned to the long axis of the clavicle than the 4 mm diameter pin, the difference was not significant...|$|R

40|$|The {{engagement}} of {{two groups of}} parents and preschoolers while sharing a wordless picture book and an interactive e-book are described, specifically comparing children with typically developing language (TD) versus children with language impairments (LI). Parent–child dyads were video recorded in a laboratory (TD group,) or at a clinical site (LI group,) while sharing a wordless picture book (WL condition) and an e-book (EB condition). Our assessment focused on the areas of (1) child persistence and (2) child verbal <b>engagement</b> (<b>length</b> of turns, verbal responses to parental prompts, gestural responses). The LI group {{spent more time with}} the WL book than the TD group, which was unexpected due to prior reports of poor engagement with print books by LI children; therefore we speculate that children with LI engage with books {{to the extent that the}} language demands of the book and the interaction are adapted to the child’s linguistic capabilities. The LI and TD groups showed similar levels of nonverbal engagement with the EB. Parents in the EB condition behaved differently: parents of TD children coordinated their talk with their child’s actions and perceptions; parents of LI children increased the number of questions and demands for responses markedly, whereas their children reduced the proportion of verbal responses significantly in comparison with the WL condition.

The ideal mean gap width between the piston and the cylinder was obtained after measuring the piston fall rate at a low pressure, while the piston radius {{was obtained from the}} cross-float experiments at a low pressure. The real gap width was obtained from dimensional measurements by measuring the diameter and straightness of the piston and the cylinder. The piston and cylinder radial distortions were calculated using the finite element method. The pressure distribution in the gap was calculated {{on the basis of the}} Navier-Stokes equation for Newtonian viscous flow. The results such as pressure distributions, radial distortions, the pressure distortion coefficient and the piston fall rate were presented for the free-deformation operating mode of the assemblies. The calculation resulted in ideal and real gap profiles indicating that the average pressure distortion coefficient was in good agreement within 0. 017 × 10 - 6 MPa- 1 and the calculations of piston fall rate depended on the gap profile especially at the inlet and outlet zones of the <b>engagement</b> <b>length.</b> Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essai...|$|R

40|$|During {{adolescence}} {{with its}} processes of orientation and search, television as the lead-ing media of adolescents {{has a special}} importance: In times when human knowledge about the world and society is conveyed via the media, television {{is the most important}} media source of information and help for orientation of these adolescents. This is the point on which this thesis is based. It brings the subject of "Youth and Television In-formation" into the centre of interest. Beginning with a reflection on the phenomenons "youth" and "television information" based on social-, educational-, and media-scientific research, this thesis empirically contemplates in its main part on this topic. Information and data in it are based on a face-to-face survey among 210 adolescents between the age of 12 and 17, carried out in the framework of a larger research project referring to the area of conflict "Youth - Politics - Television" in Hamburg, Leipzig and surrounding areas as well as Kempten and surrounding areas. The study's main objective is to describe and research the subject "Youth and Television Information" in its central dimensions in a more extensive way than ever before. "Youth" in this context stands for a specific circle of recipients, varying quantitatively and qualitatively from children and adults, conditioned by their development and so-cialization and with a special access to media. "Television information" in this context stands for the process of using statements, messages and news with an informative qual-ity, which is motivated in a multitude of ways and imbedded into the living contexts of human beings as well as into concrete situations. The theoretical framework for this is the perspective based on a Action Theory with the assumption that the use of media is a social behaviour conditioned by individual, social and media factors. Contrary to the practice of descriptive research on this sector up to now, this exploratory descriptive study takes on the perspective of adolescents and asks the question, what television programmes 12 - to 17 -year-old adolescents themselves consider and use as informative offers, which motivation stands behind the reception, how they evaluate corresponding television offers, what they base their critique on and which expectations they have with regard to content and information. Special attention is directed towards the inter-individual differences which become clearly visible with regard to socio-demographic features (age, education, gender, milieu of intellectual stimulus in the pa-rental home, older siblings, place of residence in the new/old lander and in urban or rural areas) and important context variables (subjective fields of interest, willingness to political <b>engagement,</b> <b>length</b> of television consumption, preferences towards certain providers) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ultimate load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes of threaded steel fasteners subjected to various combinations of tension and shear loads at elevated deformation rates. Threaded steel fasteners are often used to assemble members and components in engineering structures, and the behaviour characteristics of each individual fastener can have a significant influence {{on the performance of}} the total structure. Hence, before the response of a structure can be determined based on a given load scenario the behaviour of each of the involved components and joints must be known as well as the material behaviour at the deformation rates representative for the load situation. The work carried out in this thesis is presented in a synopsis, providing the background, the objectives, the strategy and a summary of the project. Then three individual papers/parts follow where two have been published in peer reviewed journals and the third has been submitted for potential journal publication. The first two papers are dealing with the tensile behaviour of threaded steel fasteners at elevated rates of strain. The objective was to investigate the ultimate tensile load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes. In the first paper, results and observation from the experimental study were presented, and the Alexander model was modified to consider the ultimate load and mode of failure at high loading rates. In the second paper, results from a numerical study were presented. The numerical study was based on the experimental results obtained from the first part. An axisymmetric finite element model was used to predict the tension behaviour characteristics and the failure modes of the threaded steel fasteners. Comparison of results between simulations and experiments showed that the axisymmetric finite element model captured the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with good accuracy. It was observed that the failure modes were influenced by the thread <b>engagement</b> <b>length,</b> the grip length and the strain-rate. The third paper explores the ultimate load and behaviour characteristics of threaded steel fasteners exposed to combined tension and shear load at elevated deformation rates. An experimental and a numerical study were conducted. In the experimental study, the loading angle was 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, where 0 ° corresponded to loading along the axis of the threaded steel fasteners. The numerical study was carried out using a three-dimensional finite element model. Simulations were performed at the same deformation rates as in the experiments, while the load was applied at different angles varying between 0 º and 90 º with 15 º intervals. Interaction curves were established based on both the experimental and the numerical results. The numerical model was found to capture the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with reasonable accuracy. PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Material loss at the Head-Neck {{junction}} {{accounts for}} {{a third of the}} total volume material loss in contemporary metal-on-metal total hip replacements. It is speculated that the material loss is the result of corrosion and mechanical wear (fretting). High volumes of material loss have been reported, especially from the head taper. There is only one report on characterizing the pattern of material loss and this was in {{a very small number of}} cases (n= 5). Our aim was to identify the different material loss patterns at the head taper and their corresponding mechanisms We retrospectively analysed a series of retrieved Large Head Metal on Metal Total Hip Replacements (155 cups, 155 femoral heads and 4 stems). We measured material loss on the bearing surfaces and the head-neck junction using well-published metrology methods. Furthermore we collected patient (age, gender and time of primary/revision operations), pre-revision (cobalt and chromium blood metal ion, oxford hip score, cup orientation and implant position) implant (cup and head size, manufacturer and corrosion severity) data. Finally we used surface analysis techniques (microscopy and spectroscopy) to identify fretting, imprinting and the material composition of debris. We devised a novel four-group classification and two blinded engineers classified the material loss patterns using wear maps derived from the metrology analysis We observed four distinct patterns of taper surface material loss at our retrieval centre and we set out to characterize these types and relate them to patient, implant and clinical variables. The four groups of material loss patterns were defined as: (1) Low wear (n= 63), (2) Open-end band (n= 32), (3) Stripped material loss (n= 54) and (4) Coup-Countercoup (n= 6) (Figure). The Interobserver Reliability Kappa score was 0. 78 (p< 0. 001) indicating substantial agreement between the two examiners. Analysis of variables between the groups identified significantly different head sizes (highest: Group 2, p= 0. 000), corrosion severity (highest: Group 2, p= 0. 004) and time to revision (highest: Group 3, p= 0. 040). We identified four different material loss patterns each with its own mechanism. Corrosion was identified as the principal mechanism in Groups 1 and 3. Group 1 head-neck junctions are thought to have a better seal with less fluid ingress in the junction. Group 3 head-neck junctions are attacked by corrosion either circumferentially, or unilaterally, along the whole <b>engagement</b> <b>length.</b> Mechanically assisted corrosion was the principal mechanism in Group 2. The higher friction torque opens up the open-end part of the junction and the ingressing fluid accelerates the corrosion. Extensive fretting was also observed under the scanning electron microscope. Intra-operative surgical damage was identified as the principal mechanism in Group 4, with only 6 components. The patterns and the mechanisms of material loss at the head-neck junction contribute to the understanding of large head metal-on-metal hip replacements. As a result, better implants can be designed in the future. Clinically, these findings suggest that head size and head taper-trunnion fit are the main factors that determine the longevity of the head-neck junction. On the other hand, patients selection does not influence the integrity of the junction...|$|R

40|$|The current Southwest drought is {{exceptional}} for {{its high}} temperatures and {{arguably the most}} severe in history. Coincidentally, {{there has been an}} increase in forest and woodland mortality due to fires and pathogenic outbreaks. Although the high temperatures and aridity are consistent with projected impacts of greenhouse warming, it is unclear whether the drought can be attributed to increased greenhouse gasses or is a product of natural climatic variability. Climate models indicate that the 21 st century will be increasingly arid and droughts more severe and prolonged. Forest and woodland mortality due to fires and pathogens will increase. Demography and food security dictate that water demand in the Southwest will remain appreciable. If projected population growth is twinned with suburb-centered development, domestic demands will intensify. Meeting domestic demands through transference from agriculture presents concerns for rural sustainability and food security. Environmental concerns will limit additional transference from rivers. It is unlikely that traditional supply-side solutions such as more dams will securely meet demands at current per-capita levels. Significant savings in domestic usage can be realized through decreased applications of potable water to landscaping, but this is a small fraction of total regional water use, which is dominated by agriculture. Technical innovations, policy measures, and market-based solutions that increase supply and decrease water demand are all needed. Meeting 21 st-century sustainability challenges in the Southwest will also require planning, cooperation, and integration that surpass 20 th-century efforts in terms of geographic scope, jurisdictional breadth, multisectoral <b>engagement,</b> and the <b>length</b> of planning timelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Luxury brands are {{increasingly}} interested in developing digital marketing {{strategies that are}} able to attract new customers and improve brand perceptions. At the same time, however, the online context has become untrusted by luxury brands, due to the potential risk of losing control over brand image because of intense interaction with customers through the Web. In spite of this criticality, only few academic studies have investigated the way consumers interact with luxury brands within online dedicated platforms, such as luxury brands’ web communities. Thus, this research, by focusing on the length of English comments left by consumers in the online brand community of luxury brands, investigates the role of engagement (emotional involvement) and valence of comments (positive or negative). In particular, the analysis of comments left on the Facebook official page of the brand Chanel sheds light on a quite counter-intuitive phenomenon, demonstrating that the length of comments is influenced, at the same time, by both the valence of the comments and the level of engagement of the commenter. Results demonstrate that the effect of the <b>engagement</b> on the <b>length</b> of a comment is moderated by the valence of the comment itself. In particular, the study shows that in a luxury brand online community, a high level of engagement is associated with shorter comments, but only when the valence of the comments is negative. This research has both theoretical and managerial implications. In particular, from a practical point of view, the results may be useful to Made in Puglia luxury companies, since they offer interesting insights to companies from Apulia which need to understand how to better use social media for their branding strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{approach has}} long been the main method to investigate the responses associated with metal cutting process such as cutting forces and temperatures and also to optimise the machining operations to accomplish higher productivity. In recent years, with advances in computing power of computers along with development of robust numerical methods such as Finite Element Method (FEM), it has been possible to simulate different machining process under operational conditions. This method can therefore be applied more effectively to optimise the cutting process to achieve higher productivity, while the design requirements are fulfilled simultaneously. Nonetheless, there are some challenges in FE modelling of metal cutting process such as implementation of appropriate constitutive model and well-tuned parameters {{that need to be addressed}} first to attain reliable predictions. In the current study, a methodology is developed to determine the flow stress properties of the work material together with the optimum frictional condition at the tool-chip interface by means of inverse modelling of orthogonal cutting test. The calibrated constitutive model and the friction coefficients are then used to build three dimensional (3 D) FE models to simulate the cutting process under operational conditions. The results of FE simulations are integrated with tailored tool life tests to reduce the number of experiments required for optimisation of machining process. The viability of the presented methodology is evaluated for two different processes; finishing operation of bi-metallic aluminium-grey cast iron component-like samples as well as transverse machining Alloy 718 in aged condition using uncoated cemented carbides. In order to optimise the finishing operation of the bi-metallic workpiece, a limited number of tool life tests are initially carried out under controlled conditions to determine the involved wear mechanism. Microscopic investigations revealed that the main wear mechanism constitutes thermal fatigue cracking. Hence, the milling operation is simulated by means of FEM and the thermally induced stresses at the cutting edge are calculated for certain combinations of cutting parameters including cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is then employed to establish the relation between the cutting parameters and the amount of thermal stresses at the cutting edge. Subsequently, the optimum cutting condition is determined once the amount of thermally induced stresses on the cutting edge and the number of tool <b>engagements</b> per unit <b>length</b> of cut are both minimised. This approach leads to 32 % reduction in cycle time compared to the reference tool life test, while the number of passes to failure for the carbide tool remained nearly at its maximum level. An FE based wear modelling approach is developed to simulate the flank wear evolution of uncoated cemented carbide when transverse machining Alloy 718 in aged condition. In this study, the relation between the volume loss per unit time and the rate of flank wear evolution is established based on Usui’s wear rate equation. The simulation cycle is then presented to integrate 3 D FE simulation of cutting process with the established flank wear rate equation, to predict the wear evolution for predefined simulation cycles. The simulation results showed up to 70 % error in prediction of flank wear evolution. The cause for this deviation and the guidelines for further implementation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, costly {{experimental}} {{procedures have}} been followed in industry to optimise the machining operations {{to secure the}} maximum efficiency in production line, while the functional requirements of the machined surfaces are fulfilled. In recent years, development of robust numerical techniques such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and advances in computing capacity of computers {{have made it possible}} to simulate the machining operations under operational conditions. This has provided a platform to evaluate the responses such as the tool-chip contact stress and temperature for a certain process and to determine the optimum cutting condition by using a considerably smaller number of tool life tests. Nonetheless, the reliability of FE simulation results is shown to largely depend upon implementation of a well-defined material model, which can properly describe the severe material deformation in the vicinity of cutting edge. In the current study a methodology is developed to determine the flow stress properties of the work material together with the optimum frictional condition at the tool-chip interface by means of inverse modelling of orthogonal cutting test. The calibrated constitutive model and the friction coefficients are then used to build three dimensional (3 D) FE models to simulate the cutting process under operational conditions. The FE simulation results are integrated with a limited number of tool life tests to determine the optimum conditions. The viability of the presented methodology is evaluated for finish face milling of the bi-metal aluminium-grey cast iron component-like samples using uncoated cemented carbide tools. This methodology is also adopted for tool flank wear prediction in transverse machining Inconel 718 in aged condition and longitudinal machining 20 MnCrS 5 case hardening steel using uncoated cemented carbide tools. In order to optimise the finish face milling of the bi-metal workpiece, a limited number of tool life tests are initially carried out under controlled conditions to determine the involved wear mechanisms. Investigations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the main wear mechanism constitutes thermal fatigue cracking. Hence, the milling process is simulated under operational conditions and the thermally induced stresses on the cutting edge are calculated for certain combinations of cutting parameters including cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is then adopted to establish the mathematical relation between the cutting parameters and the range of thermally induced stresses on the cutting edge. Subsequently, the optimum cutting condition is determined once the amount of thermally induced stresses on the tool edge and the number of tool <b>engagements</b> per unit <b>length</b> of cut are both minimised. This approach led to 32 % reduction in cycle time compared to a reference tool life test. An FE-based wear modelling approach is developed to predict the flank wear evolution on the uncoated cemented carbide tools in transverse machining Inconel 718 under operational condition. In this approach, initially, the relation between the tool volume loss per unit time and the flank wear evolution rate is established based on the well-known Usui wear model. Once the rate equation was calibrated by the results of the tool life test at a certain cutting condition, it was then possible to integrate it with the FE models to estimate the flank wear evolution for an arbitrary cutting condition. This wear modelling approach is then extended based on the concept of experimental design and RSM to attain a higher accuracy and better computational performance, particularly for the case of 3 D FE modelling of cutting process. The extended methodology is adopted for flank wear estimation in longitudinal turning 20 MnCrS 5 case hardening steel using uncoated cemented carbide tools. The prediction results showed a good agreement with the tool life measurements...|$|R
