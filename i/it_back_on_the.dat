Harvey's exploits at the gaming tables became legendary, one story claiming that he once bet £100,000 on a single game of chance and lost, only to win most of <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following throw. Despite his dissolute lifestyle, Harvey was married and had numerous children; he was survived by six daughters and had three sons who predeceased him.|$|E

Over thirty record labels offered to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot after the departure from Reprise was official. One of the thirty was Warner Brothers affiliate Nonesuch Records, who signed Wilco in November 2001. AOL Time Warner paid Wilco to make the album on Reprise, gave them the record for free, and then bought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nonesuch label.

2500|$|As {{the troops}} of Ney and Sebastiani reached {{the crest of}} the plateau, they found {{themselves}} facing perhaps 100,000 enemies arrayed in three lines stretching from the Aube to the Barbuise. In front of this immense host were skirmishers and at least 100 field guns. Sebastiani immediately attacked Pahlen's cavalry, opposite him, driving <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second line. The French position was extremely dangerous, especially since Torcy-le-Grand was left empty of troops and Arcis was lightly held. In this crisis, Ney kept his battalions in column, ready to retreat. If Schwarzenberg had launched a general attack at this time, the French army would have been shattered. Instead, the Austrian army commander called a council of war, which lasted until noon. The council decided to attack and Schwarzenberg drew up detailed instructions. However, he alone would give the signal to advance.|$|E

If this little cage can hold this heavy book, why can’t an iron or steel cage be the framework for a whole building?" [...] Jenney applied his new idea to the construction of the Home Insurance Building, the first skyscraper in the world, which was erected in 1884 at the corner of LaSalle and Monroe Streets in Chicago. Another source cites the inspiration for the steel skyscraper as coming from vernacular Philippine architecture, where wooden framed construction gave Jenney the idea. The Home Insurance Building was the first example of a steel skeleton building, the first grid of iron columns, girders, beams and floor joists ever constructed.|$|E

He then stands on the floor aligned somewhat behind the Celebrant and chants the Epistle or other reading proper to the day. Meanwhile, the Priest too recites the Epistle in a low voice, and the Deacon, also in a low voice, responds [...] "Deo gratias" [...] ("Thanks be to God") at the end. The Subdeacon next reverences the choir, and then the altar.

Shafer quickly agreed to the pact, which included a 9.5 percent salary increase over four years that was retroactive to April 1, 1991; moved PEF members into the state's health insurance pool; and ended PEF's lawsuit over the state's decision to defer a week's pay until each member retired. Although the PEF executive board voted to recommend the contract to PEF's members, those who voted [...] "no" [...] on the pact argued that PEF had achieved less than other unions, that the deal traded concessions for pay increases, and that the money spent on Kheel's consulting contract had gotten the union nothing better than what had been offered months before. [...] The board meeting was a raucous one, with alleged physical confrontations, a [...] "Dump Shafer" [...] movement hanging banners near the entrance, rumors of decertification, and proposals for PEF to abandon its independence and join either SEIU or AFT. Members of PEF voted 28,774 to 7,281 to ratify the new four-year contract on May 12, 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Between September 10 and 12, 1998, {{the nursing}} home was {{evacuated}} and closed after bricks fell {{from the roof of}} the building due to damage from the Labor Day storm of that year. Residents of the home were forced to leave the facility {{in the middle of the}} night. Patients were transferred to Bellevue Hospital in Lower Manhattan, and the Coler and Goldwater Hospitals on Roosevelt Island. CIty officials under Mayor Rudy Giuliani stated that the buildings were in danger of collapsing, and that renovations were required to make the facility structurally sound. An estimate made by an engineering firm on June 19, 1998 stated it would take $1 million to renovate the facility; following the closure, that figure rose to $50 million. After closing the home, the city initially planned to sell the site, to [...] "get <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tax rolls" [...] according to deputy mayor Joe Lhota. The site was worth an estimated $15 to $20 million. By late October, however, Lhota stated that the sale of the site was blocked by the deed restrictions on the property, based on the 1955 court ruling which prevented the sale of the hospital at that time. Meanwhile, accusations were made against Giuliani of using new tactics to justify closing health facilities, after attempts to privatize Coney Island Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital Center, and Queens Hospital Center. There were also rumors of a plan to develop a hotel on the site. After the plans to sell the site fell through, Giuliani and the city decided to demolish the hospital and develop a waterfront park on the site. The plan was announced October 28, 1998 by Giuliani and the HHC. It was opposed by the local community. On October 30, 1998, District Court Judge Deborah Batts blocked the demolition of the buildings.|$|E

In 2012, P.J. Paparelli {{directed a}} Shakespeare Theatre Company production at the Lansburgh Theatre, starring Andrew Veenstra as Valentine, Nick Dillenburg as Proteus, Natalie Mitchell as Silvia and Miriam Silverman as Julia. Set in the 1990s, and featuring a contemporary soundtrack, mobile phones and guns, the production downplayed the comedy, and instead presented the play as a semi-tragic coming-of-age story. Reviews were mixed, with most critics impressed with the attempts to do something new with the play, but not universally sure the new ideas worked. Also in 2012, a touring production was staged at various venues throughout the UK, including a performance at the Globe Theatre {{as part of the}} Globe to Globe Festival, under the name Vakomana Vaviri Ve Zimbabwe (The Two Gentlemen from Zimbabwe). Directed by Arne Pohlmeier, and spoken in Shona, the entire play was performed with a cast of two; Denton Chikura and Tonderai Munyevu.
