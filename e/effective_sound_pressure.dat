40|$|Extensive {{sound and}} {{vibration}} measuring {{were made to}} three different diesel railcars at the Duerener Kreisbahn (DKB) and at the AKN railway AG (Hamburg). The intensity measuring technique also was used more intensively {{for the first time}} for such measurings. Both together yields extensive readings whose complete representation would blast the extent of a report. For this reason only such data represented which are required to the documentation of the taken statements become in the report on hand. A large part of the measurings was carried out to the verification of calculation models. These calculations were carried out by DUEWAG AG (Krefeld-Uerdingen) (TV 9361). Available software was used and - for the special application - further partly developed. All substantial data of the measurings became therefore the DUEWAG AG provided. The report on hand contains therefore only the description of the measurings carried out and a choice of some substantial results. The following measurings were carried out. - Stand measurings (reverberation measurings, all around measurings, transmission measurings). - Intensity measurings to the inquiry of the sound power and the <b>effective</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution. These measurings were made at the exhaust, at the motor {{as well as on the}} floor and in different heights over the floor. - Driving measurings (<b>Effective</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> measurings in the vehicle and on the outside at the vehicle on the outside wall, comfort measurings on the floor and track height situation measurings, structure sound measurings on the spreading way from the wheelset to the vehicle floor). - Passby measurings (<b>effective</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> measurings in different distances to the track). -Mobility measurings of the wheels. - Roughness measurings on the running surface of the rail. A comparison between the measured emission values and the statements in the Schall 03 shows a good agreement. A broader base by further measurings is however still required. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for the prediction and {{characterization of the}} near-field acoustic levels from closely-spaced clustered rocket engines. The calculations {{are based on the}} method proposed by Eldred, wherein the flowfield from the clustered rockets is divided into two zones. Zone 1 contains the isolated nozzles which produce noise independently, and extends up to a distance where the individual flows completely mix to form an equivalent single nozzle flow. Zone 2 is occupied by the single mixed stream starting from the station where the jets merge. The acoustic fields from the two zones are computed separately {{on the basis of the}} NASA-SP method of Eldred developed for a single equivalent nozzle. A summation of the spectra for the two zones yields the total <b>effective</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level for the clustered engines. Under certain conditions of nozzle spacing and flow parameters, the combined sound pressure level spectrum for the clustered nozzles displays a double peak. Test cases are presented here to demonstrate the importance of hydrodynamic interactions responsible for the double peak in the sound spectrum in the case of clustered rocket nozzles, and the role of ground reflections in the case of non-interfering jets. A graphics interface (Rocket Acoustic Prediction Tool) has been developed to take into account the effects of clustered nozzles and ground reflections...|$|E
40|$|Porous metal {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in noise control with high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> applications such as aircraft engine liners and combustion chambers for rocket engines due to their excellent performance of sound absorption characteristics and distinguished advantages in heat resistance, lightness, and stiffness. Understanding the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> on the acoustic properties of these materials is crucial when attempting to predict silencer performance. In this article, we experimentally investigate the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials at high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level. The effects of material parameters on the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials under high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level are further explored experimentally. Measurements are carried out by using a standard impedance tube that has been modified to accommodate <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level of up to 150 [*]dB. The experimental results show that {{with the increase in}} <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level on the sound absorption characteristics yields different variation regularities in different frequencies. The sound absorption performance of porous metal materials increases with the increase in <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level in low frequency, which is reasonably consistent with the theoretical results. Under high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, the <b>sound</b> absorption characteristics are significantly dependent upon the material parameters such as the metal fiber diameter, the material porosity, and the material thickness.

40|$|Understanding female mate {{preference}} {{is important for}} determining the strength and direction of sexual trait evolution. The <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (SPL) acoustic signalers use is often an important predictor of mating success because higher <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels are detectable at greater distances.

Here we manipulated the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level of cricket mate attraction signals to determine how female phonotaxis was influenced. We examined female phonotaxis using two common experimental methods: spherical treadmills and open arenas.
