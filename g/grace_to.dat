5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered <b>Grace</b> <b>to</b> be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his defeat}} of Metatron {{and access to}} Heaven having been restored, Castiel {{continues}} to face challenges on a personal and large scale, as some angels prefer to remain on Earth and his stolen Grace continues to consume him. Although Metatron has hinted {{that he may be}} able to help Castiel with a remaining fragment of his original Grace, Castiel has rejected the option of making a deal with Metatron to save his own life. Sam and Dean remain ignorant of Castiel's fate, although Crowley is aware of Castiel's condition, at one point killing another angel to transfer her <b>Grace</b> <b>to</b> Castiel so that Castiel could help Sam cure the now-demonic Dean after he was transformed by the Mark of Cain.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person {{can be said to}} have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each {{of the members of the}} trinity.|$|E

Elizabeth is enraged that <b>Grace</b> returned <b>to</b> England, but <b>Grace</b> appeals <b>to</b> Elizabeth not as a monarch but as a woman, urging the Queen not to ignore her nature but {{to use it to}} rule wisely. Elizabeth finds herself drawn to this female pirate she has hated for so long. The two women talk for two hours, in a historic private discussion whose precise content is unknown. At the end of this talk, Elizabeth restores <b>to</b> <b>Grace</b> O’Malley her lands and ships for her lifetime, and in addition, releases Tiernan from prison (“Woman to Woman”).|$|R
5|$|The treatises cover a {{wide range}} of topics, {{including}} Symeon's defense against Stephen regarding his own views on the unity of the Holy Trinity. He also presents his doctrine on mysticism, the necessity of faith, the possibility of direct experience of God, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and more. The last four treatises were written during his exile, and discuss living a holy life while on earth, salvation through faith and good works, and the need for solitude if one wants to become a channel of divine <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> others.|$|E
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

Later, while doing his laundry, Will meets his new upstairs neighbor, Val (Molly Shannon). Immediately, the two take a liking to one another. The next day, Will visits Grace at work and introduces Val to her. After the two leave, Karen (Megan Mullally)—Grace's friend and socialite assistant—tells Grace that she did not like the way Will and Val acted towards one another. Grace, however, refuses to accept what Karen implies.|$|E

5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, the {{earliest}} theologian {{considered part of}} the Reformed tradition, was vigorously opposed to worship practices he believed to be based on tradition rather than the Bible. Nevertheless, he disagreed with Anabaptists, who refused to baptize their children on scriptural grounds. Through his arguments with Anabaptists, Zwingli arrived at the position that baptism was a sign of the covenant between God and his people, but that it did not convey <b>grace</b> <b>to</b> the baptized. He saw baptism as essentially identical to the circumcision of Israelites in the Old Testament in this respect, and used this idea in polemics against Anabaptists. Zwingli's emphasis on baptism as a pledge or oath was to prove unique in the Reformed tradition. Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor, continued the teaching of the continuity of God's covenants and circumcision with baptism. Bullinger also emphasized that baptism indicates duties to the baptized in response to God's grace.|$|E

5|$|In the English {{winter of}} 1873–74, Gilbert {{was chosen by}} W. G. <b>Grace</b> <b>to</b> {{accompany}} his touring team to Australia. Gilbert had a string of single-figure scores and a highest score of 33 not out. Nevertheless, he and Grace got on well, {{and he was a}} popular member of the touring party. Grace enjoyed his company to the extent of hunting kangaroos with him. During the 1874 season Gilbert made a double century in minor cricket, scoring 254 not out for Thornbury against Sneyd Park. Later in the season he made a further representative appearance, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players at Prince's Cricket Ground and opening the batting with W. G. Grace; he scored 14 and 16 and took four wickets in the Players' first innings. He also played in the corresponding fixture the following year.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to {{first-class}} cricket in the 1927 season, Hammond made an immediate impact, becoming only the second man, after W. G. <b>Grace,</b> <b>to</b> score 1,000 runs in May, traditionally {{the first month of}} the English cricket season. This sequence included another effective performance against Lancashire, regarded by some observers {{as one of the best}} innings ever played. He scored 99 in the first innings and 187 in the second to ensure the match was drawn. He again hooked McDonald effectively, at one point hitting five consecutive fours. Hammond played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's for the first time, although he neither batted nor bowled, as well as two Test trials. Coming close to scoring 1,000 runs in June as well, he finished the season with 2,969 runs, including 12 centuries. His average of 69.04 was the fifth highest in first-class cricket. He won selection for the M.C.C. team that would tour South Africa in the winter and the accolade of being named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
