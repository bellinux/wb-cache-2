40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the newly distributed OpenFOAM (www. openfoam. org) OpenSource CFD tool for turbulent flow in water turbines. The aim is to validate the OpenFOAM results for cases that have also been computed with other CFD codes, as well as have been experimentally investigated. Comparisons are made both with numerical and experimental results. The first case studied is the steady flow in the Hölleforsen (Turbine- 99) draft tube. The OpenFOAM result proved to be comparable with results from all the major CFD tools on the market according to the proceedings from the Turbine- 99 III workshop in December 2005 (www. turbine- 99. org). An unsteady computation of the flow in the same draft tube has also been made, yielding an unsteady vortex rope with a period of 0. 48 s. All OpenFOAM draft tube results are similar to results obtained with CFX- 5, and the results are close to the experimental results. The second case studied is the steady flow in the Hölleforsen runner. The computations have been performed both for a single runner blade passage using periodic boundaries, and for the <b>full</b> <b>runner,</b> yielding the same results. In all cases the tip clearance has been included and computations both with and without the runner blade clearance at the hub has been made. The computational results compare well with the experimental results. All the computations use wall-function grids and turbulence is modelled using the standard k-epsilon model...|$|E
40|$|Today, the {{steadily}} increasing amount {{of renewable energy}} production is changing the way hydraulic power plants are used. The intermittent generation of wind and solar power creates instabilities in the electric grid {{that need to be}} countered in a fast and reliable way. Hydro power plants are good at changing power output by simply adjusting the ﬂow through the turbine. They are, however, not designed for that amount of transient loads, which will result in a lower eﬃciency at oﬀ-design operating conditions and a higher degree of fatigue. In this thesis, the ﬂow in a high-head Francis turbine is investigated. The turbine is a model of a full scale prototype turbine operating in Norway. It is {{in the spirit of the}} Francis- 99 workshop series, aimed to determine the state of the art in high-head Francis turbine simulations, that this thesis is written. The geometry and experimental results of the Francis- 99 turbine that are used in this work are freely available at the Lule˚a University of Technology homepage. The focus of the thesis is two-fold; ﬁrstly, the accuracy of a number of turbulence modelling methods are investigated at the best eﬃciency operating condition. The turbulence modelling approaches used are the k-ε RNG and k-ω SST URANS models, together with the k-ω SST PANS and ILES methods. Secondly, the implementation of ﬂow driven runner rotation for the purpose of transient operation simulations is evaluated. The operating condition used to test the functionality of this implementation is a load-rejection case. All simulations are performed in an unsteady framework using the ﬁnite volume code FOAM-extend 3. 1, which is a highly modiﬁable, open-source CFD code. The geometry comprises all parts from the spiral casing to the draft tube outlet, with the <b>full</b> <b>runner</b> and all guide vanes included. All turbulence models perform similarly when comparing the velocity proﬁles, with the ILES and k-ω SST models correlating best with the experiments. The strong swirl appearing in most of the simulations presented at the 2014 workshop does not appear in the present work, which is closer to the experimental results. The turbine head is over-predicted by 10 - 20 % and the extracted shaft work by 12 - 21 %, resulting in good agreement with experimental eﬃciency. The main frequencies of the pressure probes agree with experiments, and correspond to the blade passing frequencies of the runner blades and guide vanes. The implementation of the ﬂow-driven rotation show robustness and promising trends, but further investigation is needed before comments can be made on accuracy...|$|E
50|$|The Fredericton Marathon {{starts and}} {{finishes}} at Queen Square at 730 Aberdeen Street, just by University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University. The run crosses the Saint John River around the 1.5km mark and runs along paved and gravel trail {{next to the}} Nashwaak River. The 5km runners turn around not too far after crossing the river, while all other runners continue on towards Marysville, a suburban neighbourhood of Fredericton, where 10km runners will turn around, leaving half marathon and <b>full</b> marathon <b>runners</b> to continue. Both the half marathon and <b>full</b> marathon <b>runners</b> will turn around after approximately 10.25km and {{head back to the}} start/finish line where the half marathon runners will finish and the <b>full</b> marathon <b>runners</b> will be left with another lap to complete.|$|R

Together, about nine miles (14 km) of the entire marathon course is run on Ocean Boulevard.|$|R
50|$|Two games later {{against the}} Connecticut Huskies, Edney had another {{chance at a}} full court run before the half, and drained a 30-foot 3-pointer {{en route to a}} 102-96 victory. UCLA went on to win its 11th NCAA {{basketball}} championship, defeating the defending champion Arkansas Razorbacks 89-78, (although Edney, with a wrist injured in the semi-final win vs. Oklahoma State, mostly watched from the bench). But UCLA's record 11th National Championship would have been impossible had Edney's <b>full</b> court <b>runner</b> vs. Missouri not fallen. Edney was named to the Tournament Western Regional All-Tournament team.|$|R

[...] "It's been great working with a new person who really understands my vision," [...] Azalea said of Halpin, who had also fashioned the set for her performance of [...] "Trouble" [...] with Jennifer Hudson both at the iHeartRadio Awards and Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards on the previous day. [...] "It's taken some of the workload off me that he's able to understand what I'm trying to achieve instead of battling it, or it being lost in translation," [...] Azalea continued. [...] "Some things just work. With Baz, I really don't have to say it; he's thinking what I'm thinking, and it's great. I'm super-excited about the tour," [...] she said.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no single {{definition}} of ekiden format, for purposes of the Japanese national championships for junior high school and high school, the format has been set. Junior high school in Japan comprises grades 7 through 9, followed by 3 years in high school. For junior high school girls, a team of 5 girls run stages that follow the 3 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 3 kilometer pattern (total 12 kilometers). The boys team is 6 runners following the 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 kilometer pattern (total 18 kilometers).

Since the high school championships were begun in 1950 (boys) and 1989 (girls), on only 3 occasions has the boys race been slightly shorter; once for the girls.

30|$|While {{the sample}} size for the present work was {{relatively}} small, we have evidence that it was reasonably representative of the larger group of runners. Participants {{of the present study}} ran an average of 2  h slower than the full group of race finishers, which it not unusual for those willing to participate in research during a competition. But, the age and sex distributions were similar between the present study group and the <b>full</b> group of <b>runners.</b> Furthermore, the incidence of muscle cramping or near cramping (39 vs. 41  %), nausea or vomiting (57 vs. 60  %), and post-race hyponatremia (10 vs. 7  %) was quite similar between the present sample and the larger study group. We also acknowledge that some of our conclusions are based on a small number of subjects with hyponatremia and that both hyponatremic runners were only mildly hyponatremic and asymptomatic. Furthermore, since we did not perform pre-race blood testing, we cannot assure that all runners were normonatremic {{at the start of the}} race, though of the 62 runners undergoing pre-race blood sampling at other 161 -km ultramarathons where we have done investigations [7, 21], all have been normonatremic. Despite these potential limitations, the findings demonstrate that large amounts of sodium are not required to complete a 161 -km ultramarathon without developing hyponatremia.|$|R
