5|$|In December 1995, Miceli {{signed with}} WCW, {{and as part}} of a storyline by booker Eric Bischoff, showed up on WCW Monday Nitro on December 18, where she threw the WWF Women's Title belt into a trash can. She later {{admitted}} that she regretted the action and would not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> had Bischoff not coerced her. Miceli immediately began using the Madusa name again, and the company brought in Bull Nakano to feud with her; they battled in a match at Hog Wild in August 1996. Due to pre-match stipulations, Madusa was allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle after the match.|$|E
5|$|In Tests, South African Bernard Tancred was {{the first}} cricketer to carry the bat; he made 26 runs in his team's total of 47 against England in 1889. The {{following}} year, Jack Barrett of Australia became {{the first player to}} carry the bat on debut. In the 1892 tour of Australia, England's Bobby Abel scored 132 and became the first player to score a century while carrying the bat. The following year, Bill Woodfull of Australia set a new record by becoming the first player to perform this feat twice in Tests; he scored 73 not out during the third test of England's 1933 tour. Apart from Woodfull, four other cricketers have performed this feat more than once in their in Test careers—while Bill Lawry (Australia), Glenn Turner (New Zealand) and Len Hutton (England), <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> twice, West Indies cricketer Desmond Haynes has performed this feat on three occasions. , Turner's 223, against the West Indies in 1972, is the highest score by a player while carrying the bat. Kraigg Brathwaite of the West Indies is the most recent cricketer to carry the bat in Tests; he made 142 against Pakistan in November 2016. The Australian players have performed this feat more than any other, followed by England. In all, 45 cricketers have carried their bats on 51 occasions in Test cricket.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plans were}} introduced, {{with the most}} {{important}} plan being that of James Madison (the Virginia Plan). The Convention's work was mostly a matter of modifying this plan. Charles Pinckney also introduced a plan, although this wasn't considered and its exact character has been lost to history. After the Convention was well under way, the New Jersey Plan was introduced though never seriously considered. It was mainly a protest to what some delegates thought was the excessively radical change from the Articles of Confederation. Alexander Hamilton also offered a plan after the Convention was well under way, though it included an executive serving for life and therefore the delegates felt it too closely resembled a monarchy. Historians are unsure how serious he was about this, and some have speculated that he may <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> to make Madison's plan look moderate by comparison. The Connecticut Compromise wasn't a plan but one of several compromises offered by the Connecticut delegation. It was key to the ultimate ratification of the constitution, but was only included after being modified by Benjamin Franklin {{in order to make}} it more appealing to larger states.|$|E

Another movement that rocked society of the time was the debate for re-marriage of widows first raised by Ramgopal Ghosh and other Derozians in the Bengal Spectator from 1842 onwards, but it was possible that Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar was behind the scene.|$|E
