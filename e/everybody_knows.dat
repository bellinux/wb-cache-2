5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists {{referred to it as}} Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of R.delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: Russula delica is a species that <b>everybody</b> <b>knows,</b> so to speak, but the evidence indicates that R.delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R.delica sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not R.delica sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…It is best to use R.brevipes for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call R.delica. The name, R.brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.|$|E

6000|$|The next {{afternoon}} {{as the train}} approached Plainton, Mrs. Cliff found herself a great deal agitated as {{she thought of the}} platform at the station. Who would be there,--how should she be met? With all her heart she hoped that there would not be anything like a formal reception, and yet this was not improbable. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> she was coming; <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> by what train she would arrive. She had written to Willy Croup, and she was very sure that <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> everything that she had written. More than this, <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> that she was coming home rich. How rich they were not aware, because she had not gone into particulars on this subject, but they knew that the wealthy Mrs. Cliff would arrive at 5.20 that afternoon, and what were they going to do about it? ...|$|R

25|$|By 1994, Bailey {{had moved}} to Sweden where he {{recorded}} a solo album, 54 days at sea, and in 1996 issued The Saints' album, Howling, which was produced by the band for Blue Rose Records. Bailey provided vocals, guitars and organ, and was joined by Andreas Jornvill on drums, Joakim Täck on bass guitar, Ian Walsh on guitar and Mons Wieslander on guitar. The group toured Australia in February 1997 – their first tour there in eight years. <b>Everybody</b> <b>Knows</b> the Monkey followed in May 1998 on Last Call Records with Bailey were Michael Bayliss on bass guitar, Martin Bjerregaard on drums and Andy Faulkner on guitar – it was produced by Bailey and Martin Hennel.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that <b>everybody</b> <b>knows.</b> There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Flaming Moe's", which parodies [...] "Where <b>Everybody</b> <b>Knows</b> Your Name" [...] from Cheers, {{was well}} received. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly named the song the [...] "Best Theme Song Parody" [...] of 1991. It was later {{included}} in the 1997 album Songs in the Key of Springfield, a compilation of songs from the first seven seasons of the show.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Doc Severinsen, Carson's bandleader {{starting}} in 1967, said the song {{worked so well}} because it was [...] "accessible.

500|$|Each {{section is}} linked by a refrain or {{recurring}} chorus. It {{functions as a}} hook and it differs from the usual [...] "free-associative aspect" [...] of traditional blues. [...] Writer Benjamin Filene sees this and Dixon's desire to tell complete stories, with the verses building on each other, as sharing elements of pop music. [...] The chorus, [...] "But you know I'm here, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> I'm here, Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie man, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> I'm here", confirms the narrator's identity as both {{the subject of the}} gypsy's prophecy as well as an omnipotent seer himself. [...] Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience's unfulfilled desire to brag, while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect. [...] Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant. [...] He sees it as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States. [...] Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view: [...] "It was sex. [...] If you have ever seen Muddy then, the effect he had on women [...] [...] Because the blues, you know, has always been a women's market".|$|E
500|$|Her {{frequent}} European {{tours in}} the 1990s maintained her visibility {{in the eyes}} of the fans and granted her enough income to survive the bleak period. She became so popular in Spain that she was voted for 13 times Best International Singer by the readers of the music magazine Heavy Rock in their annual polls. She often declared to live and tour for the fans and said that she [...] "would never cancel a tour and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that about me".

500|$|The song heavily {{features}} bombastic tribal drums, and paranoia-inducing strings {{that create}} a feeling of tension. The beat of [...] "Monster" [...] {{has been described as}} a [...] "hyperventilating death rattle" [...] by The Washington Posts Chris Richards, commenting that the song was permeated with dark, urgent-sounding moans. The chorus of the song has two separate meanings; on the surface, it appears that West is bragging about his abilities as a rapper, while also making a comment on the media's reception of him, with lines like [...] "gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> I'm a muthafuckin' monster".|$|E

One such character was Mrs. Kelly, a gossip. Leno would sing a verse of a song, then begin a monologue, often his You know Mrs. Kelly? routine, which became a well-known catchphrase: [...] "You see we had a row once, {{and it was all}} through Mrs. Kelly.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Kearsley's phenomenally popular version of Raspe's book had spread to abridged chapbook editions for young readers, who soon became the main audience for the stories. The book, especially in its adaptations for children, remained widely popular throughout the century. It was translated into nearly all languages spoken in Europe; Robert Southey referred to it as [...] "a book which <b>everybody</b> <b>knows,</b> because all boys read it". Notable later translations include Gautier's French rendering and Korney Chukovsky's popular Russian adaptation. By the 1850s, Munchausen had come into slang use as a verb meaning [...] "to tell extravagantly untruthful pseudo-autobiographical stories".

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Robert Cohen and {{directed}} by Rich Moore, with assistance from Alan Smart. [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] was the first episode of the show to feature Moe in a prominent role. The main plot of the episode in which Moe's Tavern becomes famous because of a drink is loosely based on the Los Angeles establishment Coconut Teaszer. The episode also parodies the television series Cheers, including the theme song [...] "Where <b>Everybody</b> <b>Knows</b> Your Name", and a character named Collette is modeled after Shelley Long's character Diane Chambers. Catherine O'Hara originally recorded dialogue for the part of Colette, but the writers felt her voice did not fit the role and instead used a track recorded by regular Jo Ann Harris.|$|E
500|$|The family goes to Nifty Fifties Diner, a 1950s-themed restaurant, {{and they}} see waiters dressed up as celebrities from the 1950s, {{including}} James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley.

Peter repeats the song over and over on the way home in bed and even when waking up Lois, annoying his family. However, the final straw of the family's hatred of Surfin' Bird is when Peter spends over $6,000 of the family fortune to buy himself a two-minute clip on TV saying that [...] "I dream of an America where <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that the bird is the word" [...] and singing the song again.|$|E
