5000|$|Long-term, {{high-dose}} {{studies in}} rats {{have demonstrated that}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> has no significant adverse health effects and is not carcinogenic. [...] The US Food and Drug Administration has classified <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> as {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate,</b> {{commonly}} known as [...] "strawberry aldehyde", is an organic compound used in the flavor industry in artificial fruit flavors, in particular strawberry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> {{is usually}} {{prepared}} by the condensation of acetophenone and the ethyl ester of monochloroacetic acid {{in the presence of}} a base, in a reaction known as the Darzens condensation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> is {{classified}} as an ester and an epoxide; but, despite its common name, {{it is not an}} aldehyde. It is a colourless to pale-yellow liquid that is insoluble in water.|$|E
5000|$|Because of its {{pleasant}} {{taste and}} aroma, <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> finds {{use in the}} fragrance industry, in artificial flavors, and in cosmetics. [...] Its end applications include perfumes, soaps, beauty care products, detergents, pharmaceuticals, baked goods, candies, ice cream, and others.|$|E
50|$|Bubble gum is {{available}} in many colors and flavors. Although the exact ingredients were kept a mystery to customers, chemicals such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate,</b> isoamyl acetate, fruit extracts, and more give it its sweet flavor. When blended, the chemicals and extracts fuse to make a sweet, palatable flavor. Gums made with vanilla, coconut, peppermint, and almond extracts are available.|$|E
5000|$|Most flavors {{represent}} {{a mixture of}} aroma compounds, the raw material that is produced by flavor companies. In rare cases, a single synthetic compound is used in pure form. Artificial vanilla flavors vanillin and ethylvanillin are a notable exception, {{as well as the}} artificial strawberry flavor (<b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate).</b> The ubiquitous [...] "green apple" [...] aroma is based on hexyl acetate.|$|E
50|$|Flavored milk is milk {{that has}} sugar, colorings and (mostly {{inexpensive}} artificial) flavorings added {{to make it}} more appetizing, especially to children (a prominent example {{can be found in the}} artificial strawberry flavor, <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate)</b> can be sold as a powder to be added to plain milk, or bought pre-mixed alongside other milk products. Flavoring can be included in a straw, and some flavored milk products are designed as dietary supplements by including additional vitamins or minerals.|$|E
50|$|Flavors include blue raspberry, orange, lemon, {{strawberry}}, apple, cherry, watermelon, cinnamon, banana, peppermint, cotton candy, and grape {{of which}} strawberry and banana {{can be achieved}} with <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> and isoamyl acetate limonene, respectively. Malic acid {{can be used for}} apple flavor, allyl hexanoate for pineapple, ethyl propionate for fruit punch, cinnamic aldehyde for cinnamon and acetophenone for cherry. More unusual flavors such as berry, cola, lemon lime, peach, tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, or fruit punch can also be found, as well as novelty tastes such as bacon or popcorn. Bubble gum itself is the flavor of Pepto-Bismol or as others have found, cotton candy.|$|E
5000|$|Squashes {{labelled}} [...] "no added sugar" [...] are artificially sweetened, {{usually with}} aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, {{which is much}} cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They {{tend to be very}} low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, <b>ethyl</b> <b>methylphenylglycidate</b> for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) {{to make up for the}} lack of fruit juice taste.|$|E
