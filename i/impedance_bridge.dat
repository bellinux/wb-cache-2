40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the work {{undertaken in the}} design and construction of a millimetre wave, quasi-optical <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge.</b> The instrument operates as a nulling complex reflectometer, with nulling being implemented at the signal frequency by interferometric optical techniques. In principle, the quasi-optical components of the reflectometer are operable in the frequency range 80 GHz to 500 GHz, though the range of continuous coverage is determined by the waveguide components and antennas used to couple sources and detectors into the Gaussian beams. Gaussian beam mode theory has been employed {{in the design and}} measurement of the quasi-optical components, which behaved as expected. Phase and polarisation effects within the <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge</b> were modelled and the consequent behaviour of the <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge</b> predicted. A comparison of these predictions with early results led to refinement of the model. This model is based upon a more complete description of the transmissivities and reflectivities of the wire grid polarising beam splitters and accurately predicts the instrument behaviour. A data acquisition and control system has been built to facilitate automated operation of the <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge.</b> This system is interfaced to an AcornÂ® Archimedes microcomputer and the hardware and software has been developed to enable interrupt driven data acquisition.

When {{the work}} of designing and building a null detector was undertaken as a thesis, the initial research was broken up into two phases. The first phase consisted of analyzing the conditions necessary for balancing <b>impedance</b> <b>bridges</b> of various types.

The bridge is essentially a comparator and its basic property is to attain two equipotential points to compare the bridge arms to each other. The customary types of null detectors used in balancing <b>impedance</b> <b>bridges</b> may be classified under the following headings-, :- (1) Headphones with or without amplification; (2) Tuned vibration galvanometers; (3) A.
