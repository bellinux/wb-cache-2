500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> of doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out {{and went into}} a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike many of The Cars' album covers, {{the cover}} for The Cars was {{designed}} by the record company, rather than drummer David Robinson. The cover was not well liked {{by the members of}} the band, however. Robinson said, [...] "I thought that when the Elektra came out it was way too slick. The pictures of us I didn't like." [...] Guitarist Elliot Easton expressed dislike for [...] "that big grinning face," [...] saying, [...] "Man, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> of that cover." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in {{his senior}} year of high school, Fabolous began to pursue a career in hip hop music. He was invited to rap live on American record {{producer}} and music executive DJ Clue's radio show, then on New York City radio station Hot 97. DJ Clue subsequently signed Fabolous to his record label, Desert Storm Records. Fabolous was then featured on several DJ Clue mixtapes, as well as mixtapes with Roc-A-Fella artists. This earned Fabolous and Desert Storm a distribution deal with Elektra Records. In a September 6, 2001 interview with Hot104.com, Fabolous said he never planned on becoming a rapper and told the website: [...] "I was just trying to make some money, ya know? <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> of being broke. This was something where I could make some money. It just happened for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rex told me {{that even}} in 1939 Wolfe was irked by the FBI's {{consuming}} curiosity about the private business of law-abiding citizens. In consequence, Wolfe felt under no constraint {{to tell the truth}} about himself when interrogated by Stahl. There was, however, another reason for Wolfe's contradictory statements about his place of origin. Rex explained: [...] "Editors and publishers are responsible for the discrepancy. … In the original draft of Over My Dead Body Nero was a Montenegrin by birth, and it all fitted previous hints as to his background; but violent protests from The American Magazine, supported by Farrar & Rinehart, caused his cradle to be transported five thousand miles. … <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> of all the yapping, and besides it seemed highly improbable that anyone would give a damn, or even, for that matter, ever notice it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gutteridge did not {{particularly}} like {{being associated with}} the Dunedin Sound. He stated, [...] "People didn't think about the sound of things, people put on guitars and then clanged out stuff. <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> of a guitar sound that wasn't thought about. I had my own personal style. I mean, I wrote Clean's Point That Thing Else' at 17." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wilson {{also criticized}} {{scientific}} types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in their fanaticism. In a 1988 interview, {{when asked about}} his newly published book , Wilson commented: I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I wrote this book because <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them. They're actually dogmatically committed to what they were taught when they were in college....|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> {{of making}} movies where all I did was {{walk across the}} screen and look pretty. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|R

Wenham, <b>I</b> suppose <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> {{of being}} shut up with Mathers, {{although}} I am sure I don't {{see what else}} was possible.

2500|$|In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited {{personal}} {{reasons for his}} move.
