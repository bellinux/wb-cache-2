40|$|System-on-a-chip (SOC) {{processes}} are under intense development for high-speed, <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>transceiver</b> circuitry. As frequencies, data rates, and circuit complexity increases, {{the need for}} substrates that enable high-speed analog operation, low-power digital circuitry, and excellent isolation between devices becomes increasingly critical. SiGe/Si modulation doped field effect transistors (MODFETs) with high carrier mobilities are currently under development to meet the active RF device needs. However, as the substrate normally used is Si, the low-to-modest substrate resistivity causes large losses in the passive elements required for a complete high frequency circuit. These losses are projected to become increasingly troublesome as device frequencies progress to the Ku-band (12 - 18 GHz) and beyond. Sapphire is an excellent substrate for high frequency SOC designs because it supports excellent both active and passive RF device performance, as well as low-power digital operations. We are developing high electron mobility SiGe/Si transistor structures on r-plane sapphire, using either in-situ grown n-MODFET structures or ion-implanted high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structures. Advantages of the MODFET structures include high electron mobilities at all temperatures (relative to ion-implanted HEMT structures), with mobility continuously improving to cryogenic temperatures. We have measured electron mobilities over 1, 200 and 13, 000 sq cm/V-sec at room temperature and 0. 25 K, respectively in MODFET structures. The electron carrier densities were 1. 6 and 1. 33 x 10 (exp 12) /sq cm at room and liquid helium temperature, respectively, denoting excellent carrier confinement. Using this technique, we have observed electron mobilities as high as 900 sq cm/V-sec at room temperature at a carrier density of 1. 3 x 10 (exp 12) /sq cm. The temperature dependence of mobility for both the MODFET and HEMT structures provides insights into the mechanisms that allow for enhanced electron mobility {{as well as the}} processes that limit mobility, and will be presented...|$|E

This marks the <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>transceiver</b> in silicon and {{the highest level of}} functional integration above 100 GHz in any semiconductor technology. The downconversion gain peaks at- 5 dB and the transmit power is- 5 dBm when measured at the transceiver pads. Both degrade by approximately 25 dB when measured above the antennas of the transceiver with on-die antennas. The experimental performance of dipole (with and without floating metal strips) and patch antennas is also investigated. The measured 15 -dB gain of a standalone amplifier is centered at 170 GHz and remains higher than 10 dB from 160 GHz to 180 GHz while the saturated output power is 0 dBm at 165 GHz.

40|$|Today’s {{integrated}} system on chips (SoCs) usually consist {{of billions of}} transistors accounting for both digital and analog blocks. Integrating such massive blocks on a single chip involves several challenges, especially when transferring analog blocks from an older technology to newer ones. Furthermore, the exponential growth for IoT devices necessitates small and low power circuits. Hence, new devices and architectures must be investigated to meet the power and area constraints for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In such cases, design automation becomes an essential tool to reduce the time to market of the circuits. This dissertation focuses on automating the design process of analog designs in advanced CMOS technology nodes, as well as reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) superconducting circuits. For CMOS analog circuits, our design automation technique employs digital automatic placement and routing tools to synthesize and lay out analog blocks along with digital blocks in a cell-based design approach. This technique was demonstrated {{in the design of}} a digital-to-analog converter. In the domain of RQL circuits, the automated design of several functional units of a commercial Processor is presented. These automation techniques enable the design of VLSI-scale circuits in this technology. In addition to the investigation of new technologies, several new baseband signal processor architectures are presented in this dissertation. These architectures are suitable for low-power mm 3 -scale WSNs and enable <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>transceivers</b> to operate within the power constraints of standalone IoT nodes...|$|R

40|$|The massive {{levels of}} {{integration}} following Moore 2 ̆ 7 s Law making modern multi-core chips prevail in various domains ranging from scientific applications to bioinformatics applications for consumer electronics. With {{higher and higher}} number of cores on the same die traditional bus based interconnections {{are no longer a}} scalable communication infrastructure. On-chip networks were proposed enabled a scalable plug-and-play mechanism for interconnecting hundreds of cores on the same chip. Wired interconnects between the cores in a traditional Network-on-Chip (NoC) system, becomes a bottleneck with {{increase in the number of}} cores thereby increasing the latency and energy to transmit signals over them. Hence, there has been many alternative emerging interconnect technologies proposed, namely, 3 D, photonic and multi-band RF interconnects. Although they provide better connectivity, higher speed and higher bandwidth compared to wired interconnects; they also face challenges with heat dissipation and manufacturing difficulties. On-chip wireless interconnects is one other alternative proposed which doesn 2 ̆ 7 t need physical interconnection layout as data travels over the wireless medium. They are integrated into a hybrid NOC architecture consisting of both wired and wireless links, which provides higher bandwidth, lower latency, lesser area overhead and reduced energy dissipation in communication. An efficient media access control (MAC) scheme is required to enhance the utilization of the available bandwidth. A token-passing protocol proposed to grant access of the wireless channel to competing transmitters. This limits the number of simultaneous users of the communication channel to one although multiple wireless hubs are deployed over the chip. In principle, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) based medium access scheme would improve the utilization of the wireless resources. However, this requires design of multiple very precise, <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>transceivers</b> in non-overlapping <b>frequency</b> channels. Therefore, the scalability of this approach is limited by the state-of-the-art in transceiver design. The Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) enables multiple transmitter-receiver pairs to send data over the wireless channel simultaneously. The CDMA protocol can significantly increase the performance of the system while lowering the energy dissipation in data transfer. The CDMA based MAC protocol outperforms the wired counterparts and several other wireless architectures proposed in literature in terms of bandwidth and packet energy dissipation. However, the reliability of CDMA based wireless NoC 2 ̆ 7 s is limited, as the probability of error is eminent due to synchronization delays at the receiver. The thesis proposes the use of an advanced filter which improves the performance and also reduces the error due to synchronization delays. This thesis also proposes investigation of various channel modulation schemes on token passing wireless NoC 2 ̆ 7 s to examine the performance and reliability of the system. The trade-off between performance and energy are established for the various conditions. The results are obtained using a modified cycle accurate simulator...|$|R
