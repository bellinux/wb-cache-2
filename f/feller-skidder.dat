40|$|The optimal {{model for}} a {{hydraulic}} crane compound scheme is discussed for four types of mobile loggingmachines:secondarytransporttruckorlorry, skidder (<b>feller-skidder),</b> forwarder, and harvester (feller-buncher). Keywords: Design, logging, optimization, harvester, forwarder, truck, crane, forest engineering. INTRODUCTION Theestablished practice of usingcranesonmobile forest machines indicates {{that it is more}} reasonable to locate a crane on the cab or with the cab on a rotatingplatform. Thiscompoundschemeimproves the field of vision, the user comfort, and reduces the crane weight. However, the crane-holding cabs of forest machines (e. g., VALMET 824, FMG 200 BGN, FMG 678 MINI) need additional strengthening of the cab or frame (Figure 1). The location of the crane with the cab on a rotating platform makes the forest machine structure heavier and more complicated (Figure 2). This type of crane compound scheme is used mostly on the powerful feller-bunchers (e. g., Russian ML- 20, LP- 19 A) and h [...] ...|$|E
