50|$|Research done using Zebrafish dackel (dak) {{have shown}} that in EXT2-/- Zebrafish, chondrocytes fail to undergo {{terminal}} differentiation and bone formation fails to progress from pre-osteoblasts stage to osteoblasts. Instead, abnormal lipid deposition and premature adipocyte differentiation takes place. The expression of xbp1, master regulator of osterix gets reduced, suggesting that unfolded proteins responses {{may play a role}} in pathogenesis of multiple osteochondroma. The research concludes that heparan sulphates are required for terminal differentiation and formation of scaffold that is needed for bone development. At least one copy of EXT2 gene is needed for proper bone development and to maintain the balance between bone and fat cell lineages. Due to homozygous loss of EXT2 function, leads to imbalance between cartilage, bone, and fat cell lineages. These observations in null zebrafish points toward the musculoskeletal defects observed in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Due to the findings of bone-fat imbalance in Zebra fish model, <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> address status of lipid composition in patients with multiple osteochondroma.Research conducted using sequencing methods has identified a novel frame shift mutation at the glycosyltransferase domain (c.1457insG) located at codon 486 of exon 6 of the EXT1 gene, that causes multiple osteochondromas. This study was conducted in two multiple osteochondroma (MO) patients from the Chinese descent (same family) and the results were validated with four other members of the same MO family and 200 unrelated healthy subjects. The results of the mutations were validated using two different sequencing methods (Exome and Sanger). The results of immunohistochemistry and multiple sequence alignment supports the cause of MO being a mutation in EXT1 gene. However, the exact molecular mechanism of multiple osteochondroma remains unclear. The EXT1 gene encodes the endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes polymerization of heparin sulfate chain at the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Heparin sulfate regulates signal transduction during chondrocyte differentiation, ossification, and apoptosis. Malfunction in heparin sulfate synthesis causes chondrocytes to rapidly differentiate. Based on these results <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the glycosyltransferase domain of the EXT1 and its involvement in the development of multiple osteochondromas.Osteochondromas are associated with secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas, but the pathogenesis of the malignant bone tumor remains unknown. Research has demonstrated that chondrocytes with dysfunctional EXT1 is present in solitary osteochondromas, but the EXT1 is functional in sporadic (solitary) secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Research indicates that osteochondromas creates a special niche in which wild type cells are mixed in with EXT functional cells. Then these EXT functional cells undergo other mutations, that give rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, indicating the involvement of an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. <b>Future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> address the contributing gene that causes the formation of peripheral chondrosarcoma. It should also illustrate what causes chondrocytes functional with EXT1 and EXT2 within the osteochondroma to become more susceptible to mutations leading to malignancy.|$|E

In 2010 a group of NZF members united to initiate a discourse about ways to improve that situation.

30|$|Another {{limitation}} of this study is the sample size. While the sample size was adequate per research convention (Rovai, Baker, & Ponton, 2013), a larger sample size may yield different results. Likewise, a sample that represents a more equitable distribution of participants from countries around the world may produce different results. Finally, study that examines different factors and their respective influences on student course outcomes, including non-academic outcomes, such as satisfaction, sense of community, and self-efficacy, may provide a clearer picture of the international student experience. <b>Future</b> <b>study</b> <b>should</b> examine a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors.|$|R
30|$|From Figure 3, {{it could}} also be found that {{arsenite}} is commonly more strongly adsorbed on ceria NPs than arsenate especially when pH was above 9. Theoretically, arsenate is commonly more strongly adsorbed on ceria NPs than arsenite since arsenate presents as H 2 AsO 4 - and HAsO 42 - when pH is from 2 to 8, while arsenite presents as As(OH) 30 species. Some reports showed that at all pH values, arsenic(V) was more strongly bound than arsenic(III) [28 – 30].

50|$|The faults {{location}} in a seismically active zone {{and a low}} erosional environment makes it a good study area. Although many characteristics of geomorphology have been preserved, the area has not been extensively studied using the new methodologies currently available. The fault has sparked new interest in its geometrical and kinematic characteristics within recent years. Previous studies on the El Tigre Fault {{have a range of}} inconstancies. Information obtained on the fault can vary from a reactivated fault with a normal component in Jurassic and Palaeocene, an Eocene strike-slip fault, an Oligocene northwest-verging thrust fault, and a south-east dipping normal fault inverted in the Neogene. Research models in the 1980s describe the fault as system anywhere from 800 km up to 1000 km in length. The kinematics, geometry, extension, and deformation have not been widely agreed upon, therefore the new interest in the El Tigre Fault should lead to further studies using modern technology. These <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> shed light on the discrepancies that have resulted from lack of in depth information in the past.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{criticism}} against the availability heuristic has claimed that making use of the content that become available in our mind {{is not based on}} the ease of recall as suggested by Schwarz et al. [...] For example, {{it could be argued that}} recalling more words that begin with K than words with the third letter being K could arise from how we categorize and process words into our memory. If we categorize words by first letter, and recall them through the same process, this would show more support for the representativeness heuristic than the availability heuristic. Based on the possibility of explanations such as these, some researchers have claimed that the classic studies on the availability heuristic are too vague in that they fail to account for people's underlying mental processes. Indeed, a study conducted by Wanke et al. demonstrated this scenario can occur in situations used to test the availability heuristic.

5000|$|The exact phylogenetic {{position}} of protostegids among turtles is uncertain. Some phylogenetic studies determine the leatherback turtles {{in the family}} Dermochelyidae to be their closest living relatives, with both these families being monophyletic. Conversely, the phylogenetic analyses conducted by Joyce (2007) and Anquetin (2012), which included one protostegid species (Santanachelys gaffneyi), recovered the family as only distantly related to leatherback turtles. Joyce (2007) recovered Protostegidae as basal eucryptodiran turtles lying outside the crown group of Cryptodira (the least inclusive clade containing all living cryptodirans) and closely related to Solnhofia parsonsi; Santanachelys had a similar phylogenetic position in the analysis conducted by Anquetin (2012), who stressed that <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> include more protostegids to confirm this phylogenetic placement. If confirmed, these results would prove that protostegids weren't close relatives of leatherback turtles (or in fact any living cryptodirans), but instead [...] "represent an independent lineage of marine turtles that originated in the Late Jurassic". The analyses conducted by Sterli (2010) and Sterli & de la Fuente (2011) recovered Santanachelys (and, presumably, the entirety of Protostegidae) as even more distantly related to living cryptodirans; it {{was found to be}} basal turtle lying outside the crown group of turtles (the least inclusive clade containing cryptodirans and pleurodirans).|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in cultural research and human emotions is the lack of diversity in samples. Currently, the research literature is dominated by comparisons between Western (usually American) and Eastern Asian (usually Japanese or Chinese) sample groups. This limits our understanding of how emotions vary and <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> include more countries in their analyses.Another challenge outlined by Matsumoto (1990) [...] is that culture is ever changing and dynamic. Culture is not static. As the cultures continue to evolve it is necessary that research capture these changes. Identifying a culture as [...] "collectivistic" [...] or [...] "individualistic" [...] can provide a stable as well as inaccurate picture of what is really taking place. No one culture is purely collectivistic or individualistic and labeling a culture with these terms does not help account for the cultural differences that exist in emotions. As Matsumoto argues, a more contemporary view of cultural relations reveals that culture is more complex than previously thought. Translation is also a key issue whenever cultures that speak different languages are included in a study. Finding words to describe emotions that have comparable definitions in other languages can be very challenging. For example, happiness, which {{is considered one of the}} six basic emotions, in English has a very positive and exuberant meaning. In Hindi, Sukhi is a similar term however it refers to peace and happiness. Although happiness is a part of both definitions, the interpretation of both terms could lead to researchers to making assumptions about happiness that actually do not exist.|$|E

Almost four decades later, human and social scientist are reassessing their orientation to futures thinking and anticipatory attitude.
