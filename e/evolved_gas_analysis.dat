40|$|The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) {{instrument}} suite on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity Rover detected both {{reduced and}} oxidized nitrogen-bearing compounds during the pyrolysis of surface materials from three sites at Gale Crater. Preliminary detections of nitrogen species include NO, HCN, ClCN, CH 3 CN, and TFMA (trifluoro-Nmethyl-acetamide). On Earth, nitrogen {{is a crucial}} bio-element, and nitrogen availability controls productivity in many environments. Nitrogen has also recently been detected {{in the form of}} CN in inclusions in the Martian meteorite Tissint, and isotopically heavy nitrogen (delta N- 15 approx + 100 per mille) has been measured during stepped combustion experiments in several SNC meteorites. The detection of nitrogen-bearing compounds in Martian regolith would have important implications for the habitability of ancient Mars. However, confirmation of indigenous Martian nitrogen bearing compounds will require ruling out their formation from the terrestrial derivatization reagents (e. g. N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide, MTBSTFA and dimethylformamide, DMF) carried for SAM's wet chemistry experiment that contribute to the SAM background. The nitrogen species we detect in the SAM solid sample analyses can also be produced during laboratory pyrolysis experiments where these reagents are heated in the presence of perchlorate, a compound that has also been identified by SAM in Mars solid samples. However, this does not preclude a Martian origin for some of these compounds, which are present in nanomolar concentrations in SAM <b>evolved</b> <b>gas</b> analyses. <b>Analysis</b> of SAM data and laboratory breadboard tests are underway to determine whether nitrogen species are present at higher concentrations than can be accounted for by maximum estimates of nitrogen contribution from MTBSTFA and DMF. In addition, methods are currently being developed to use GC Column 6, (functionally similar to a commercial Q-Bond column), to separate and identify unretained compounds such as NO, N 2 O, and NO 2, which are difficult to detect by EGA-MS due to mass interferences at 30, 44 and 46, respectively.

40|$|The Regolith Evolved Gas Analyzer (REGA) is a {{high-temperature}} furnace {{and mass}} spectrometer instrument {{for determining the}} mineralogical composition and reactivity of soil samples. REGA provides key mineralogical and reactivity data {{that is needed to}} understand the soil chemistry of an asteroid, which then aids in determining in-situ which materials should be selected for return to earth. REGA is capable of conducting a number of direct soil measurements that are unique to this instrument. These experimental measurements include: (1) Mass spectrum <b>analysis</b> of <b>evolved</b> <b>gases</b> from soil samples as they are heated from ambient temperature to 900 C; and (2) Identification of liberated chemicals, e. g., water, oxygen, sulfur, chlorine, and fluorine. REGA would be placed on the surface of a near earth asteroid. It is an autonomous instrument that is controlled from earth but does the analysis of regolith materials automatically. The REGA instrument consists of four primary components: (1) a flight-proven mass spectrometer, (2) a high-temperature furnace, (3) a soil handling system, and (4) a microcontroller. An external arm containing a scoop or drill gathers regolith samples. A sample is placed in the inlet orifice where the finest-grained particles are sifted into a metering volume and subsequently moved into a crucible. A movable arm then places the crucible in the furnace. The furnace is closed, thereby sealing the inner volume to collect the <b>evolved</b> <b>gases</b> for <b>analysis.</b> Owing to the very low g forces on an asteroid compared to Mars or the moon, the sample must be moved from inlet to crucible by mechanical means rather than by gravity. As the soil sample is heated through a programmed pattern, the <b>gases</b> <b>evolved</b> at each temperature are passed through a transfer tube to the mass spectrometer for analysis and identification. Return data from the instrument will lead to new insights and discoveries including: (1) Identification of the molecular masses of all of the gases liberated from heated soil samples; (2) Identification of the asteroid soil mineralogy to aid in the selection process for returned samples; (3) Existence of oxygen in the asteroid soil and the potential for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU); and (4) Existence of water and other volatiles in the asteroid soil.
