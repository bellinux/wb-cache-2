40|$|Abstract Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC), {{found in the}} bone-marrow, the blood circulation, adipose tissue and fetal lungs, have {{recently}} been subject to great interest from researchers and clinicians worldwide. These cells provide the body with progenitors for mesodermal derived tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscles, fat and haematopoietic stroma. Whether MSCs also give rise to cells from other embryological derms, the ekto- and endoderm, is under investigation. Suggested explanations why MSCs seem to differentiate into cells of non-mesodermal tissues include transdifferentiation, de-and re-differentiation and cell-fusion. The existence of a pluripotent cell like the ones found in early embryological life is another possibility. How the MSCs function in vivo is subject to discussion. The cells have experimentally been shown to incorporate into certain tissues as functional cells. In yet other sites MSCs provide damaged tissues with humoral factors stimulating tissue repair. MSCs used in therapeutic medicine can be autologous cells (from the patient himself) or allogenous (from another individual). They can be mobilized to the circulation from the bone-marrow by colony stimulating factors or be extracted directly from tissues. MSCs <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> can then be subject to manipulation ex vivo or simply undergo expansion. The cells will then, after intravenous infusion, {{find their way to}} the harmed tissues probably by different homing mechanisms. MSCs can also be transplanted directly into the tissue of interest. This paper will discuss the above and in addition include several studies on the potential use of MSCs in clinical practise...|$|E

40|$|Within breast {{reconstruction}} technologies, abject fat {{has become}} an ever-commodifiable unit of biovalue that is understood as endlessly malleable and to promise a bright new future of breasted materiality – and corporeal ‘wholeness’ – following breast cancer surgery. Fat transfer – known as autologous reconstruction – understands and deploys fat as capital, with certain ‘fatty’ {{parts of the body}} outsourced and rearranged to make new (and organic) ‘breasts. ’ Fat grafting repurposes unwanted body fat and, through lipofilling, is used to add volume or correct a breast contour problem after lumpectomy or reconstruction. Such fat can potentially become an endless fount, with the harvested material banked for future use (such as with the U. S. FDA-registered Liquid Gold™ mini-fat bank). Most recently, new research has looked to use fat stem cells to regenerate tissue damaged through radiation, and new techniques of fat autogenesis will transform the future of breast reconstruction, potentially enabling fat cells to be implanted into a breast-shaped mold on the chest and new fatty-tissue grown into a ‘breast. ’ This paper is concerned with analyzing the following questions in the context of these technologies: in which ways and under what conditions can ‘fat as abject’ become ‘fat as biovalue’; what forms of subjectivity are invited and enabled via these technologies; what forms of biosociality are imagined in response to these technologies; and, importantly, how is the body understood and experienced, and what emergent (and contingent) forms of materiality are produced when the protean substance ‘fat’ becomes biovalue to be <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> precisely in order to ‘make the body whole again’...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{culture of}} cells and tissues were {{undertaken}} {{to understand the}} intricacies of cellular biology per se until recently, when such in vitro grown cells and tissues have started evolving as tools of regenerative medicine. Only after such clinical applications of in vitro cultured cells and tissues became a possibility, various criteria about the compatibility of in vitro environments to the cells and tissues have gained significant attention. Among the in vitro cultured cells, chondrocytes pop up {{as one of the}} most approved cell-based products by regulatory authorities of many countries including the USA, Europe and Japan [1]. In this procedure, it has been reported by several studies that human articular chondrocytes (HACs) when cultured as monolayer, they tend to de-differentiate [2] whereas 3 D cultures help to establish the native hyaline phenotype [3]. Variations of such significance in the in vitro behaviour of other cell types have also been reported in literature [4 - 9] which clearly demonstrate that in vitro environments play a crucial role in maintaining cells with the proper phenotype and functionality for clinical transplantation. Another major factor which needs to be studied thoroughly iscellular senescence in the in vitro environment. Though cells derived from older individuals may share cellular and molecular phenotypes with in vitro senescent cells, in vitro acquired cellular senescence is a proven phenomenon [10]. While the 'Hayflick limit' specifies a particular number of maximum population doubling for a specific cell type in vitro, the same cell type in vivo may undergo more than the Hayflick limit specified population doubling in a lifetime without senescence [11] creating the need for improvising current in vitro cell culture techniques to reflect what occurs in vivo. Given the above background, the goal of in vitro cell and tissue engineering is to grow cells with optimal functionality while simultaneously preventing uncontrolled or premature differentiation and the onset of senescence [12]. Stressing the importance of in vitro environments, even regulatory agencies like the US-FDA use in vitro manipulation as a gauge to classify cell therapies[13]. In this issue, a diverse assortment of articles ranging from the use of scaffolds for in vitro culture by Gomathysankar et al [14] to employing tools for in vivo transplantation of cells by Maiti et al [15]and Fauzi et al [16] have been published. During regenerative medicine applications, cells undergo several transitions across environments, starting with an in vivo to in vitro transition when <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and subjected to culture-expansion or tissue engineering kind of processing and then a reversal back to an in vivo environment. While the factors and materials employed in the in vitro eco-system are known, their effects are known though to an extent, some of their implications still remain unknown and the mechanisms of those implications are largely obscure [17 - 19]. These bunch of changes in the whole eco-system inside-out and vice versa need a meticulous and flawless assessment which is indispensable in improvising the clinical outcome of regenerative medicine applications.

40|$|THESIS 10341 A {{number of}} {{clinical}} situations exist where bone regeneration {{is required in}} large quantities, such as {{for the treatment of}} critical size bone defects and for the replacement of whole bones lost due to trauma or disease. The current ?gold standard? treatment is implantation with an autologous bone graft, <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> patient?s own <b>body.</b> Drawbacks of this approach include donor site morbidity, and a limitation on the quantity of tissue available for harvest, which have motivated the search for alternative novel strategies, aimed at bone regeneration. The field of tissue engineering aims to regenerate or replace damaged tissues through a combination of cells, three-dimensional scaffolds and signalling molecules. To date, bone tissue engineering applications have generally focussed on the direct osteogenic priming of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) seeded scaffolds in a process resembling intramembranous ossification. Limitations associated with the traditional intramembranous approach have led to increased interest in the tissue engineering of hypertrophic cartilaginous constructs in vitro that remodel into bone in vivo, thereby recapitulating the process of endochondral ossification...|$|R

40|$|Continuing {{progress}} in reduction of size and power consumption of semiconductors, and {{significant improvement in}} their capability to compute sense and communicate data, have enabled a new area of wearable electronics and smart garments. Mobile electronics devices such as smart phones, tablets, laptops, e-readers and GPS devices have shaped and defined the world of consumer electronics. As such those devices interact with us on every day level, keeping us connected with environment {{through the use of}} sensors, imagers, location based services and data networks. Looking beyond typical consumer applications, there is an increasing demand for a wearable and energy efficient electronics capable of operating <b>from</b> human <b>harvested</b> energy. This study will present a solution that is capable of providing basic human bio-parametric data such as: body temperature, pressure, man down indication, impact occurrence indication as well as data on orientation and inclination. All those functions will be embedded as wearable electronics and be able to operate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> energy that was <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> human <b>body.</b> <b>The</b> need to have this kind of data collected on the human subject in especially demanding environments and situations is greatly appreciative in applications related to search and rescue agencies, paramedics, firefighters and security and police. The solution presented in this thesis is focusing on energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>from</b> human <b>body</b> and <b>the</b> environment, together with utilization of such energy for wearable electronic...|$|R
40|$|Implantable {{medical devices}} usually require a battery to operate {{and this can}} {{represent}} a severe restriction. For most cases, the implantable medical devices must be surgically replaced because of the dead batteries; therefore, the longevity of the whole implantable medical device {{is determined by the}} battery lifespan. For this reason, the researchers have been studying energy <b>harvesting</b> techniques <b>from</b> <b>the</b> human <b>body</b> in order to obtain batteryless implantable medical devices. <b>The</b> human <b>body</b> is a rich source of energy and this energy can be <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> body heat, breathing, arm motion, leg motion or the motion of other body parts produced during walking or any other activity. In particular, the main human-body energy sources are kinetic energy and thermal energy. This paper reviews the state-of-art in kinetic and thermoelectric energy harvesters for powering implantable medical devices. Kinetic energy harvesters are based on electromagnetic, electrostatic and piezoelectric conversion. The different energy harvesters are analyzed highlighting their sizes, energy or power they produce and their relative applications. As they must be implanted, energy harvesting devices must be limited in size, typically about 1 cm 3. The available energy depends on human-body positions; therefore, some positions are more advantageous than others. For example, favorable positions for piezoelectric harvesters are hip, knee and ankle where forces are significant. The energy harvesters here reported produce a power between 6 nW and 7. 2 mW; these values are comparable with the supply requirements of the most common implantable medical devices; this demonstrates that energy harvesting techniques is a valid solution to design batteryless implantable medical devices...|$|R
40|$|Autogenous {{iliac crest}} has long {{served as the}} gold {{standard}} for anterior lumbar arthrodesis although added morbidity results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bone graft <b>harvest.</b> Therefore, femoral ring allograft, or cages, have been used to decrease the morbidity of iliac crest bone harvesting. More recently, an experimental study in the animal showed that <b>harvesting</b> local bone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anterior vertebral <b>body</b> and replacing <b>the</b> void by a radio-opaque beta-tricalcium phosphate plug was a valid concept. However, such a concept precludes theoretically the use of posterior pedicle screw fixation. At one institution a consecutive series of 21 patients underwent single- or multiple-level circumferential lumbar fusion with anterior cages and posterior pedicle screws. All cages were filled with cancellous bone <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> adjacent vertebral <b>body,</b> and <b>the</b> vertebral <b>body</b> defect was filled with a beta-tricalcium phosphate plug. The indications for surgery were failed conservative treatment of a lumbar degenerative disc disease or spondylolisthesis. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to report on the surgical technique, operative feasibility, safety, benefits, and drawbacks of this technique with our primary clinical experience. An independent researcher reviewed all data that had been collected prospectively <b>from</b> <b>the</b> onset of the study. The average age of the patients was 39. 9 (26 - 57) years. Bone grafts were successfully <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> 28 vertebral bodies in all but one patient whose anterior procedure was aborted due to difficulty in freeing the left common iliac vein. This case was converted to a transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF). There was no major vascular injury. Blood loss of the anterior procedure averaged 250 ml (50 - 350 ml). One tricalcium phosphate bone plug was broken during its insertion, and one endplate was broken because of wrong surgical technique, which did not affect the final outcome. One patient had a right lumbar plexopathy that was not related to this special technique. There was no retrograde ejaculation, infection or pseudoarthrosis. One patient experienced a deep venous thrombosis. At the last follow up (mean 28 months) all patients had a solid lumbar spine fusion. At the 6 -month follow up, the pain as assessed on the visual analog scale (VAS) decreased from 6. 9 to 4. 5 (33 % decrease), and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) reduced from 48. 0 to 31. 7 with a 34 % reduction. However, at 2 years follow up there was a trend for increase in the ODI (35) and VAS (5). The data in this study suggest that harvesting a cylinder of autograft <b>from</b> <b>the</b> adjacent vertebral <b>body</b> is safe and efficient. Filling of the void defect with a beta-tricalcium phosphate plug does not preclude the use of posterior pedicle screw stabilization...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports <b>the</b> biogas {{production}} <b>from</b> {{water hyacinth}} (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms) grown under different nitrogen concentrations of 1 -fold [28 mg/L of total nitrogen (TN) ], 2 -fold, 1 / 2 -fold, 1 / 4 -fold and 1 / 8 -fold and plants <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> a polluted water body. This studywas carried {{out for a}} period of 4 months at ambient mesophilic temperatures of 30. 3 – 31. 3 ◦Cusing six 3 -barreled batch-fed reactors with the innermost barrel (45 L) being used as the digester. There was no marked variation in the C/N ratios of the plants cultured under different nitrogen concentrations. The addition of fresh cow dung having a low C/N of 8 resulted in a significant reduction in the C/N ratios of the water hyacinth substrates. However, gas production commenced 3 days after charging the reactors and gas production rates peaked in 4 – 7 days. The volatile solids (VS) degradation and gas production patterns manifested that in conventional single-stage batch digesters acidogenesis and methanogenesis ofwater hyacinth requires a retention time of around 27 – 30 days and 27 – 51 days, respectively. Substrates in the f- 1 digester (i. e., the digester containing plants grown under 28 TN mg/L) having the lowest VS content of 45. 3 g/L with a highest C/N ratio of 16 showed fairly higher gas production rates consistently (10 – 27 days) with higher gas yields containing around 50 – 65 % of CH 4 (27 – 51 days). Moreover the highest overall VS (81. 7 %) removal efficiencies were reported <b>from</b> <b>the</b> f- 1 digester. Fairly higher gas production rates and gas yields with fairly higher CH 4 contents were also noticed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> f- 2 digester containing substrates having a C/N of 14 and f-out digester (containing <b>the</b> plants <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> polluted water <b>body)</b> having <b>the</b> lowest C/N ratio of 9. 7 with a fairly high VS content of 56 g/L. CH 4 production was comparatively low in the f- 1 / 8, f- 1 / 4 and f- 1 / 2 digesters having VS rich substrates with varying C/N ratios. We conclude that water hyacinth could be utilized for biogas production irrespective {{of the fact that the}} plants are grown under higher or lower nitrogen concentrations and that there is no necessity for the C/N ratio to be within the optimum range of 20 – 32 required for anaerobic digestion. Further it is concluded that several biochemical characteristics of the substrates significantly influences biogas production besides the C/N ratio...|$|R
40|$|Injury to {{nerve tissue}} in the {{peripheral}} nervous system (PNS) results in long-term impairment of limb function, dysaesthesia and pain, often with associated psychological effects. Whilst minor injuries can be left to regenerate without intervention and short gaps up to 2 cm can be sutured, larger or more severe injuries commonly require autogenous nerve grafts <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> elsewhere in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> (usually sensory nerves). Functional recovery is often suboptimal and associated with loss of sensation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tissue innervated by the harvested nerve. The challenges that persist with nerve repair have resulted in development of nerve guides or conduits from non-neural biological tissues and various polymers to improve the prognosis for the repair of damaged nerves in the PNS. This study describes the design and fabrication of a multimodal controlled pore size nerve regeneration conduit using polylactic acid (PLA) and (PLA) :poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) fibers within a neurotrophin-enriched alginate hydrogel. The nerve repair conduit design consists of two types of PLGA fibers selected specifically for promotion of axonal outgrowth and Schwann cell growth (75 : 25 for axons; 85 : 15 for Schwann cells). These aligned fibers are contained within the lumen of a knitted PLA sheath coated with electrospun PLA nanofibers to control pore size. The PLGA guidance fibers within the nerve repair conduit lumen are supported within an alginate hydrogel impregnated with neurotrophic factors (NT- 3 or BDNF with LIF, SMDF and MGF- 1) to provide neuroprotection, stimulation of axonal growth and Schwann cell migration. The conduit was used to promote repair of transected sciatic nerve in rats {{over a period of}} 4 weeks. Over this period, it was observed that over-grooming and self-mutilation (autotomy) of the limb implanted with the conduit was significantly reduced in rats implanted with the full-configuration conduit compared to rats implanted with conduits containing only an alginate hydrogel. This indicates return of some feeling to the limb via the fully-configured conduit. Immunohistochemical analysis of the implanted conduits removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rats after the four-week implantation period confirmed the presence of myelinated axons within the conduit and distal to the site of implantation, further supporting that the conduit promoted nerve repair over this period of time. This study describes the design considerations and fabrication of a novel multicomponent, multimodal bio-engineered synthetic conduit for peripheral nerve repair...|$|R
