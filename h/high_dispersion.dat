5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its <b>high</b> <b>dispersion</b> of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E

25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and <b>high</b> <b>dispersion</b> (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{numerical}} simulations {{were performed}} to investigate all stages of modulation instability development from the initial pulse of pico-second duration in photonic crystal fiber: quasi-solitons and dispersive waves formation, their interaction stage and the further propagation. Comparison between 4 different NLS-like systems was made: the classical NLS equation, NLS system plus <b>higher</b> <b>dispersion</b> terms, NLS plus <b>higher</b> <b>dispersion</b> and self-steepening and also fully generalized NLS equation with Raman scattering taken into account. For the latter case a mechanism of energy transfer from smaller quasi-solitons to the bigger ones is proposed to explain the dramatical increase of rogue waves appearance frequency {{in comparison to the}} systems when the Raman scattering is not taken into account.

500|$|Diamonds can be {{identified}} by their high thermal conductivity. Their high refractive index is also indicative, but other materials have similar refractivity. Diamonds cut glass, {{but this does not}} positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the Mohs scale and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature. The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly, using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones; these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly <b>high</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a loupe (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds [...] "by eye".|$|E
2500|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, {{the most notable}} natural simulant of diamond is zircon. It is also fairly hard (7.5), but more importantly shows perceptible fire when cut, due to its <b>high</b> <b>dispersion</b> of 0.039. Colorless zircon has been mined in Sri Lanka for over 2,000 years; prior to the advent of modern mineralogy, colorless zircon {{was thought to be}} an inferior form of diamond. It was called [...] "Matara diamond" [...] after its source location. It is still encountered as a diamond simulant, but differentiation is easy due to zircon's anisotropy and strong birefringence (0.059). It is also notoriously brittle and often shows wear on the girdle and facet edges.|$|E
2500|$|University of Toronto Professor Tom Bolton {{was hired}} at the DDO in 1970. [...] In 1971 he used {{data from the}} Uhuru X-ray observatory, and Naval Research Laboratory {{sounding}} rockets launched from White Sands Missile Range to find the optical companion star to the X-ray source Cygnus X-1. [...] Those X-ray telescopes had {{a certain degree of}} accuracy, but follow-up optical-wavelength studies of possible companions were required to eliminate a shortlist of many stars in the same area of sky. [...] Bolton observed the star HDE 226868 independently of the work by Louise Webster and Paul Murdin, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, who could not prove that star was Cygnus X-1's optical companion. The <b>high</b> <b>dispersion</b> of the [...] telescope's spectrograph, combined with the [...] aperture was adequate to prove the star was the source of the X-ray emissions and that its behaviour was inconsistent with a normal eclipsing star.|$|E

The aerogel and xerogel showed distinctive reducibility {{as evidenced by}} H 2 -TPR. It was the supercritical drying (SCD) and the stronger interaction between NiAl 2 O 4 spinel and Al 2 O 3 support giving rise to <b>higher</b> <b>dispersion</b> of metallic Ni in aerogel than in xerogel catalyst.

2500|$|Diamonds {{are usually}} cut into brilliants {{to bring out}} their {{brilliance}} (the amount of light reflected back to the viewer) and fire (the degree to which colorful prismatic flashes are seen). Both properties are strongly affected by the cut of the stone, {{but they are a}} function of diamond's high refractive index (RI—the degree to which incident light is bent upon entering the stone) of 2.417 (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) and <b>high</b> <b>dispersion</b> (the degree to which white light is split into its spectral colors as it passes through the stone) of 0.044, as measured by the sodium B and G line interval. Thus, if a diamond simulant's RI and dispersion are too low, it will appear comparatively dull or [...] "lifeless"; if the RI and dispersion are too high, the effect will be considered unreal or even tacky. Very few simulants have closely approximating RI and dispersion, and even the close simulants can be separated by an experienced observer. Direct measurements of RI and dispersion are impractical (a standard gemological refractometer has an upper limit of about RI 1.81), but several companies have devised reflectivity meters to gauge a material's RI indirectly by measuring how well it reflects an infrared beam.|$|E

3000|$|In {{addition}} to the individual skill scores, the PIAAC data set provides information on hourly wages 15 of employed persons. Table  5 shows the dispersion of numeracy test score results, wages, and years of schooling 16 measured by the coefficient of variation. This data already shows {{that there is no}} clear empirical relationship across countries between wage dispersion and numeracy skill dispersion. Countries with the <b>highest</b> <b>dispersions</b> of numeracy test scores are the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, whereas the countries with the lowest dispersions are Japan, the Netherlands, and Finland. In terms of wage inequality, countries with the <b>highest</b> wage <b>dispersion</b> are Japan, the USA, and the UK, and the countries with the lowest wage dispersions are Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. If there was a strong link between skill dispersion and wage dispersion, the data would be expected to show that the countries with the <b>highest</b> skill <b>dispersions</b> exhibit the <b>highest</b> wage <b>dispersion</b> and vice versa; this is not always the case here. Additional analysis also shows that the same conclusions hold when wage inequality between different population subgroups is observed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{transmission}} speed of optical networks strongly {{depends on the}} impact of <b>higher</b> order <b>dispersion.</b> In the presence of coherent interference which can’t be kept under control by optical filtering, the impact of <b>higher</b> order <b>dispersion</b> becomes more serious. In this paper we give general expressions that describe pulse deformation due to even <b>higher</b> order <b>dispersion</b> in a single-mode fiber. The impulsive responses for even order dispersion in the presence of coherent interference are characterized by symmetrical waveforms with long trailing skirts. Individual and joint influence of second and fourth order dispersion on the transmission quality is studied. Pulse shape and eye diagram are obtained. 1...|$|R
