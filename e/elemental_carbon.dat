[...] However, anaerobic bacteria use {{a wide variety of}} compounds as the terminal electron acceptors in cellular respiration: nitrogenous compounds, such as nitrates and nitrites; sulfur compounds, such as sulfates, sulfites, sulfur dioxide, and <b>elemental</b> sulfur; <b>carbon</b> dioxide; iron compounds; manganese compounds; cobalt compounds; and uranium compounds.|$|R
25|$|Within the mantle, carbon {{may exist}} as hydrocarbons—chiefly methane—and as <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon,</b> carbon dioxide, and carbonates. The abiotic {{hypothesis}} is that the full suite of hydrocarbons found in petroleum can either be generated in the mantle by abiogenic processes, or by biological processing of those abiogenic hydrocarbons, and that the source-hydrocarbons of abiogenic origin can migrate out of the mantle into the crust until they escape to the surface or are trapped by impermeable strata, forming petroleum reservoirs.|$|E
2500|$|Organic matter (OM) can {{be either}} primary or secondary, the latter part {{deriving}} from the oxidation of VOCs; organic material in the atmosphere may either be biogenic or anthropogenic. Organic matter influences the atmospheric radiation field by both scattering and absorption. Another important aerosol type is <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> (EC, also known as black carbon, BC): this aerosol type includes strongly light-absorbing material and is thought to yield large positive radiative forcing. Organic matter and <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> together constitute the carbonaceous fraction of aerosols.

2500|$|Black carbon (BC), or carbon black, or <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> (EC), {{often called}} soot, is {{composed}} of pure carbon clusters, skeleton balls and buckyballs, {{and is one of}} the most important absorbing aerosol species in the atmosphere. It should be distinguished from organic carbon (OC): clustered or aggregated organic molecules on their own or permeating an EC buckyball. BC from fossil fuels is estimated by the IPCC in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, 4AR, to contribute a global mean radiative forcing of +0.2 W/m² (was +0.1 W/m² in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, SAR), with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W/m². Bond et al., however, states that [...] "the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W/m² with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W/m²" [...] with [...] "total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W/m²" ...|$|E
40|$|Marine fine {{aerosols}} were simultaneously {{collected over}} sea and at offshore islands during three cruise sampling campaigns {{to investigate the}} spatial distribution of atmospheric fine particles (PM 2. 5) and the influences of sea salts and anthropogenic particles on the chemical characteristics of PM 2. 5 in the Taiwan Strait. Field sampling results indicated that PM 2. 5 concentrations over sea were generally higher than those at the offshore islands, while the PM 2. 5 concentrations in the daytime were commonly higher than those at nighttime. Moreover, the concentrations of PM 2. 5 were generally {{higher than those of}} coarse particles (PM 2. 5 – 10) with an exception of the winter cruise in 2014. Moreover, sea salts accounted for 6. 5 – 11. 1  % and 11. 0 – 13. 5  % of PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands and over sea, respectively. The contributions of non-sea salt-water soluble ions (nss-WSI) to PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands were obviously higher than those over sea, while the contributions of ss-WSI for PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands were much lower than those over sea during the cruise sampling campaigns. Anthropogenic metallic elements including Zn, Mn, Pb, Cr, and Ni had higher concentrations over sea than those at the offshore islands, suggesting that PM 2. 5 was not only influenced by marine aerosols but also by anthropogenic particles originated from human activities such as industrial processing, fuel burning, and vehicular and shipping exhausts. Higher mass ratios of Ni/Al and Ni/Fe over sea than those at the offshore islands suggested that shipping emissions had higher influences on marine fine particles than crustal dusts in open sea while compared to those at the offshore islands. The carbonaceous contents of PM 2. 5 indicated that the concentrations of organic carbons (OC) were generally higher than those of <b>elemental</b> <b>carbons</b> (EC). The higher mass ratios of organic and <b>elemental</b> <b>carbons</b> (OC/EC) were observed at the central and north Taiwan Strait, and follow by the offshore islands and the south Taiwan Strait. Overall, sea salts and anthropogenic particles had significant influences on the chemical composition of PM 2. 5 over sea and at the offshore islands...|$|R

50|$|As an {{autotrophic}} bacterium, A. thiooxidans uses {{inorganic substances}} {{to fulfill its}} energy requirement, and atmospheric carbon to satisfy its carbon demands. Because A. thiooxidans derives its energy from inorganic <b>elemental</b> sulfur, <b>carbon</b> directly from the atmosphere, and nitrogen from ammonium sulfate and other inorganic salts, and also because of its small mineral requirements, this autotrophic microorganism was likely among the first aerobes contributing to weathering through the formation of sulfuric acid, which interacted with insoluble phosphates, carbonates, and silicates.|$|R
2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E

40|$|In May 2003, both MODIS aerosol {{optical depth}} (AOD) and carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) measurements from MOPITT show significant trans-Pacific transport to North America. We apply the global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, {{to analyze the}} main features of the long-range transport events. Enhancements of MOPITT CO over the tropical Pacific are much broader than MODIS AOD enhancements. We find in model simulations that a major fraction of the CO enhancements in the subtropics in May is due to biomass burning in Southeast Asia in April. Biomass burning CO was recirculated into the subtropical high-pressure system and lingered for a much longer period than aerosols transported at higher latitudes. Simulated AOD enhancements are due {{to a combination of}} dust, sulfate, and organic and <b>elemental</b> <b>carbons.</b> Dust contribution dominates the AOD enhancements in early May. Model results indicate that dust transport takes place at higher altitude than the other aerosols. MODIS observations indicate a bias in model simulated pathway of dust transport in one out of the three cases analyzed. Sensitivities of dust transport pathways are analyzed in the model. The dipole structure of transport, consisting of the Aleutian Low to the north and the Pacific High to the south, over the Pacific is found to be a key factor. The placement of the dipole structure relative to model parameters such as up-stream wind field and source location may lead to the high sensitivity of simulated transport pathways...|$|R
