40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyzed}} the spatial-temporal dynamic changes of landscape patterns in Hailer and around areas. Firstly, landscape patterns types of research area {{were divided into}} water, sand, farmland, city and grassland based on remote sensing images of 1986, 1991, 1996 and 2001 and field investigation. Then the grassland was classified into higher coverage grassland, high coverage grassland, medium coverage grassland and low coverage grassland by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Finally, the spatial-temporal dynamic changes of above-mentioned eight kinds of landscape patterns were analyzed using landscape ecology principle. The results indicated that human activities intensified significant from 1986 to 2001 in research area. The area of grassland landscape decreased quickly, and the fragmentation extent intensified. The dominant landscape in research area changed from higher-high coverage grassland <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> coverage grassland. The expansion of sand landscape is obvious in periphery of road, city and farmland. The grassland vegetation degenerated seriously. Fragmentation of city landscape lightened, and city landscape patches tended to decrease and centralized. Economy development pattern of research area is in a stage that is transforming from extensive pattern to intensive urbanization pattern...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the spatial distribution of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments of the Segara Anakan nature reserve and their potential origins using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total alkane concentrations ranged from 3755 to 129, 027 mu g kg(- 1), and the concentrations of 16 PAHs ranged from 375 to 29, 517 mu g kg(- 1). The ratios of specific n-alkanes (e. g., CPI 24 - 34, WaxC(n), and Paq), including a new proposed index, terrestrial-marine discriminant (TMD), {{as well as the}} ratios of selected PAHs (e. g., Ant/Sigma 178, Fl/Sigma 202, BaAnt/Sigma 228, and IPyr/Sigma 276), showed that the sources of hydrocarbons in the sediments were generally biogenic, including both terrigenous and marine, with an anthropogenic pyrolytic contribution (petrogenic and biogenic combustion). For the environmental risk assessment, a sediment quality guideline (SQGs) comparison indicated that the station risk levels ranged from low <b>to</b> <b>medium-low,</b> except for R 6, which has a greater impact on the ecological risk for marine organisms.

40|$|The Zhijiadi Ag-Pb-Zn deposit {{is located}} in the central North China Craton. Fluid {{inclusions}} (FIs) studies indicate three types of FIs, including aqueous, aqueous-carbonic, and daughter mineral-bearing multiphase inclusions. The daughter minerals in FIs are mainly composed of marcasite, chalcopyrite, calcite, and dolomite. Microthermometric data show that the homogenization temperature and salinity of FIs decrease gradually from early to late stages. Homogenization temperatures from early to main to late stages span from 244 to 334 °C, from 164 to 298 °C, and from 111 to 174 °C, respectively, while their salinities are 4. 0 – 9. 9 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., 0. 5 – 12. 7 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., and 0. 2 – 8. 8 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., respectively. Trapping pressures drop from 203 – 299 [*]MPa (the early stage) to 32 – 158 [*]MPa (the main stage). The dropping of pressure and temperature and mixing and/or dilution of ore-forming fluids result in the formation of ore deposit. Combined with C-O-S-Pb isotopic compositions, the initial ore-forming fluids and materials were likely derived from a magmatic system. As a whole, we proposed that this deposit belongs <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> temperature hydrothermal deposit related to volcanic and subvolcanic magmatism strictly controlled by the fault zones...|$|R

40|$|The “Scansano-Magliano in Toscana” area is {{characterized}} by a morpho-structure chiefly made-up by sandstone and shelly-calcareous lithologies. Generally, these complexes host minor aquifers in Tuscany, since they have medium <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> permeability. In the area under examination, a sandstone outcrop develops with continuity along the ridge of the structure for several kilometers and above a shelly substratum. Consequently, this hydrostructural context suggested the possibility that a significant groundwater body was hosted in the sandstones. In order to verify this assumption, an isotopic study was carried out taking into account several wells and springs sited on the sandstone outcrop and its surrounding area; the samples collected over a period of two years were analyzed to obtain δ 18 O‰, δ 2 H‰ and 3 H. A study of the hydrostructural and morphological condition was also performed, and minor springs were selected. The analyses of this spring-water resulted in the characterization of the isotopic features of the infiltration water in the studied area, which represents a fundamental base of work for the interpretation of the data of groundwater points which drain long flow paths. By means of this approach, the groundwater framework was defined and the presence of a significant and continuous groundwater body within the sandstone complex was verified. A preliminary conceptual hydrogeological model was also proposed...|$|R
