The <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this paper is how to allocate the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of transports to the cargo transported. The cargo type was limited to high volume, low value cargo. The problem was also addressed from a transport purchasing perspective. The research was both case study inspired as well as action research oriented. The model was developed in a company where the researcher actively participated in its development. The company in the case study is a major European transport purchaser for high volume, low value cargo. The results of the case study have been generalised into a method for allocating the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of the transport to the cargo itself. The practical implication is a method which enables transport purchasers to allocate <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of transports to the cargo transported. The method accounts for transport flow characteristics, the utilisation {{of the means of}} transport, and the characteristics of the cargo transported, such as packaging characteristics. The theoretical implication is a contribution to developing a general allocation theory for determining the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of transported cargoes...|$|R

This thesis essayed {{to find an}} {{approach}} to <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> and indicator identification {{in order to establish}} a valid base for implementation of an integrated environmental management system in a Latvian construction company. The construction industry has been selected as the area of interest because its “product” is affecting humans, the environment and other industries in the most direct and significant way. A management system is required for achieving a balance between development driving forces. By examining existing environmental management systems - their weaknesses and strengths - opportunities for improvement were determined and used during development of the approach. The thesis includes a review of legislation, international standards, and research. The result of the thesis is a 2 -Level Matrix, which serves as an <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> identification and relevant indicator selection tool. Within the theoretical framework, the established approach was tested at construction sites and discussed amongst construction experts. The matrix allows performance of <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> ranking and provides support for the decision-making process, while establishing an Integrated Environmental Management System. www. ima. kth. s...|$|R

In this paper, LEAP model is used to perform extensive scenario analysis by examining overnight capital cost, fuel cost, operation & maintenance cost (O&M), and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from different source of power plants. However, the outcome of simulations show that New Coal scenario (NC) is more attractive economically requiring less running and capital cost than Business as usual scenario (BAU) and Green future scenario (GF). Meanwhile in GHG emissions analysis, GF scenario is more viable in <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> with BAU and NC scenarios having comparatively higher emissions. These scenario simulations provide recommendations in economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> for Pakistan's future electric power sector infrastructure...|$|R

Applicant cities were {{evaluated}} in several ways: climate change, local transport, public green areas, air quality, noise, waste, water consumption, waste water treatment, sustainable utilisation of land, biodiversity and environmental management. Out of 35 participant cities, eight finalists were chosen: Stockholm, Amsterdam, Bristol, Copenhagen, Freiburg, Hamburg, Münster, and Oslo. Some of the reasons why Stockholm won the 2010 European Green Capital Award were: its integrated administrative system, which ensures that <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> are considered in budgets, operational planning, reporting, and monitoring; its cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 25% per capita in ten years; and its decision towards being fossil fuel free by 2050. Stockholm has long demonstrated concern for the environment. The city's current environmental program is the fifth since the first one was established in the mid-1970s. In 2011, Stockholm passed the title of European Green Capital to Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Until 2001, the pre-war {{houses in}} the {{historic}} centre of George Town was protected from urban development by the Rent Control Act, which prohibited landlords from arbitrarily raising rentals as a measure to provide affordable housing to the poor. Its eventual repeal visibly changed Penang's demographic pattern and economic activity; overnight appreciation of real estate prices forced tenants of multiple generations out of their heritage homes to the city's outskirts, where new townships were being developed. Unperturbed development of modern high-rises, usually in {{the expense of the}} heritage houses, also caused the dilapidation of parts of the city centre. These sparked concerns of the continued existence of Penang's collection of heritage houses (Southeast Asia's largest), leading to more vigorous conservation efforts.In 2008, George Town was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with Malacca. It was a recognition of the conservation efforts of the [...] "unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia". The subsequent cleaning up of George Town and other measures to improve traffic flow, pedestrianisation, cultural and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> by the newly elected Pakatan Rakyat state government also led to George Town being ranked Asia's 8th most liveable city by ECA International in 2010. The city's services sector has since been boosted by the private sector and an influx of foreign investors, who have converted shophouses within the UNESCO zone into trendy eateries, hotels and shops.|$|E
