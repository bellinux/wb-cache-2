So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as <b>gallium</b> <b>arsenide.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{ferromagnetic}} semiconductor <b>gallium</b> manganese <b>arsenide</b> {{is an important}} test-bed material for spintronics applications. Whilst a Curie temperature anywhere close to room temperature {{has yet to be}} demonstrated, the excellent micromagnetic properties, simple band structure and unusual combination of having both low moment densities and high spin-orbit coupling make this an interesting material to study from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This thesis reports some experimental studies into the magnetic and magnetoresistive anisotropies in <b>gallium</b> manganese <b>arsenide.</b> In the first main chapter a study of the Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in thin (Ga,Mn) As films is reported, based on transport measurements of micro-scale devices, contributing to the first systematic study in this material. The Anisotropic Magnetoresistance comprises crystalline and non-crystalline components; this study shows that a uniaxial crystalline component can dominate over the whole range of temperatures from 2 K up to the Curie temperature, the first time this has been seen in any material system to our knowledge. The following chapter shows that the magnetic anisotropy of <b>gallium</b> manganese <b>arsenide</b> thin films can be engineered by lithographically patterning the material into structures on length scales of a micron or less. Using electron beam lithography to define the structures and SQUID magnetometery to study the resulting magnetic configuration, it is shown that the magnetic anisotropy can be greatly modified, even resulting in a switching of the easy- and hard-axis directions. Finally a new technique based on Anisotropic Magnetoresistance measurements is presented to locate the crossover of competing magnetic anisotropy coefficients in the temperature domain. Conventionally performed by SQUID magnetometry, this new technique is cheaper and simpler whilst qualitatively reproducing the main features of the SQUID measurements...|$|R

By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and <b>gallium</b> <b>arsenide</b> are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E

40|$|Spintronics-based {{technologies}} {{are poised to}} leapfrog the current limitations on the scaling, speed, and power consumption of electronic devices. Conventional devices rely on complex structures and magnetic-field-based switching to manipulate data. In order to overcome these limits, new methods must be developed to reliably transmit and store data more efficiently. The understanding and manipulation of magnetic domain walls (DWs) may play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of new non-volatile and down-scalable logic and memory devices. This thesis investigates current-induced magnetization dynamics and control mechanisms in the ideal ferromagnetic semiconductors Phosphorus-doped <b>Gallium</b> Manganese <b>Arsenide</b> (Ga,Mn) (As,P) and <b>Gallium</b> Manganese <b>Arsenide</b> (Ga,Mn) As. In spin-orbit (SO) coupled materials with broken inversion symmetry, unpolarized electric fields provide a means to control magnetization orientation via the inverse spin-galvanic effect (ISGE). The ISGE generates a non-equilibrium spin-accumulation which can exert a torque on a magnetization if the spins are generated in (or injected into) a ferromagnetic material. This so-called current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) is calculated for a broad range of experimental parameters and compared with previous measurements. The study also assess the viability of using SOTs to control DW motion in semiconductor micro-structures. Typically, DW mobility is divided into steady and precession motion regimes with different mobilities, separated by the so-called Walker breakdown (WB). By manipulating the magnetic anisotropy of (Ga,Mn) (As,P) using piezoelectric strain, these experiments investigate the potential of strain to shift the WB, establishing strain-modified DW mobility as tool for electrically controlled DW motion...|$|R

A series of chemical discoveries and insights, on germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) surfaces and <b>gallium</b> arsenide-aluminum <b>arsenide</b> (GaAs-AlAs) interfaces, has brought the elec-tronics revolution to its present state of development.

50|$|Single crystal {{epitaxial}} {{films of}} InGaAs can be deposited {{on a single}} crystal substrate of III-V semiconductor having a lattice parameter close {{to that of the}} specific <b>gallium</b> indium <b>arsenide</b> alloy to be synthesized. Three substrates can be used: GaAs, InAs and InP. A good match between the lattice constants of the film and substrate is required to maintain single crystal properties and this limitation permits small variations in composition on the order of a few per cent. Therefore, the properties of epitaxial films of GaInAs alloys grown on GaAs are very similar to GaAs and those grown on InAs are very similar to InAs, because lattice mismatch strain does not generally permit significant deviation of the composition from the pure binary substrate.|$|R
