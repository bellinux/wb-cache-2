40|$|Abstract: The {{drivers of}} ten {{vehicles}} (tram, helicopter, saloon car, van, forklift, two mobile excavators, wheel loader, tractor, <b>elevating</b> <b>platform</b> truck) were studied {{with regard to}} the combined exposures of whole-body vibration and awkward posture during occupational tasks. Seven degrees of freedom (DOFs), or body angles, were recorded as a function of time by means of the CUELA measuring system (Computer-assisted registration and long-term analysis of musculoskeletal workloads) for the purpose of posture assessment. The vibrational exposure is expressed as the vector sum of the frequency-weighted accelerations in the three Cartesian coordinates; these were recorded simultaneously with the posture measurement. Based upon the percentage of working time spent under different workloads, a scheme is proposed for classification of the two exposures into three categories. In addition, a risk of adverse health effects classified as low, possible or high can be assigned to the combination of the two exposures. With regard to posture, the most severe exposure was measured for the drivers of the wheel loader and for the tractor driver, whereas the lowest exposure was measured for the helicopter pilots and van drivers. With regard to the combination of whole-body and posture exposures, the tractor driver and the <b>elevating</b> <b>platform</b> truck driver exhibited the highest workloads...|$|E

40|$|Low {{back pain}} and local pain at the {{cervical}} spine {{are the most}} reported injuries of occupational drivers. Medical treatment and sick leaves are the costly consequences. One {{of the most important}} physical factors of musculoskeletal complaints is awkward posture, besides whole-body vibration (WBV) exposures. Due to the complexity of field measurement of posture, these exposures have been assessed so far mostly by self-evaluation and questionnaires. This works continues the work of a study which showed the feasibility of the measuring system CUELA (Computer-assisted registration and long-term analysis of musculoskeletal workloads) for the measurement of the combined exposures of posture and WBV. To develop this measuring system further, this work (1) used CUELA {{for the first time at}} representative work places and proposed an assessment scheme which is relevant for practical use (2) compared the self-evaluation of the exposure with field measurements. (1) The combined exposures of posture and WBV have been measured for the first time for occupational drivers during several different, routine operations (tram, helicopter, saloon car, van, forklift, two mobile excavators, wheel loader, tractor, <b>elevating</b> <b>platform</b> truck). As a result, the posture exposure is largest for the wheel-loader and tractor operators, while the helicopter pilot and the van driver have experienced the lowest posture exposures. However, the combined exposures are largest for the operators of the tractor and the <b>elevating</b> <b>platform</b> truck. The combined exposures of posture and WBV are thus related for the first time quantitatively to the operations and vehicles of this study. This is a basis for future assessments and studies (e. g., the design of case-control-studies). In addition, a new scheme for the quantitative assessment for the combined exposures of posture and WBV has been proposed. The measurement results have been assessed so far for individual body angles by means of literature and standard data and combined with WBV results. With the new scheme it is possible to assess the combined exposures in a single quantity which is a relevant advantage for practical applications. (2) The following study investigates the comparability and limits of self-evaluation with regard to field measurement for combined exposures. On the one hand the relation between questionnaire and field measurement data are investigated, on the other hand factors are identified that may influence the individual perception of WBV. To this end the self-evaluations of 45 occupational drivers concerning the combined exposures of posture and WBV have been compared to field measurements. Musculoskeletal complaints have been included into the investigation as additional factor. Although the measured WBV exposures have been small and very similar for all drivers, some of the drivers overestimated their WBV exposure (“WBV-over-estimators”). These drivers have significantly increased posture exposures for the head and back inclination as compared to those drivers that have not overestimated their WBV exposure. The “WBV-over-estimators” also have significantly increased musculoskeletal complaints in the areas of the thoracic and cervical spine as well as the shoulders and arms. Thus it has been shown that the self-evaluation of the WBV exposure can be influenced significantly by factors such as posture or musculoskeletal complaints which underlines the importance of field measurements and which should always be considered in further investigations. This work applied a measuring system of the combined exposures of posture and WBV for the first time at work places during normal operations. In addition, it developed a new scheme for the quantitative analysis of the measurement results. Finally, the influences on the self-evaluation of WBV exposures have been investigated which underlined the importance of field measurements for further investigations as compared to the use of questionnaires...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory ergometers {{have high}} costs, {{becoming}} inaccessible {{for most of}} the population, hence, it is imperative to develop affordable devices making evaluations like cardiorespiratory fitness feasible and easier. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and validate an Automated Step Ergometer (ASE), adjusted according to the height of the subject, for predicting VO 2 max through a progressive test. The development process was comprised by three steps, the theoretical part, the prototype assembly and further validation. The ASE consists in an <b>elevating</b> <b>platform</b> that makes the step at a higher or lower level as required for testing. The ASE validation was obtained by comparing the values of predicted VO 2 max (equation) and direct gas analysis on the prototype and on a, treadmill. For the validation process 167 subjects with average age of 31. 24 ± 14. 38 years, of both genders and different degrees of cardiorespiratory fitness, were randomized and divided by gender and training condition, into untrained (n= 106), active (n= 24) and trained (n= 37) subjects. Each participant performed a progressive test on which the ASE started at the same height (20 cm) for all. Then, according to the subject’s height, it varied to a maximum of 45 cm. Time in each stage and rhythm was chosen in accordance with training condition from lowest to highest (60 - 180 s; 116 - 160 bpm, respectively). Data was compared with the student’s t test and ANOVA; correlations were tested with Pearson’s r. The value of α was set at 0. 05. No differences were found between the predicted VO 2 max and the direct gas analysis VO 2 max, nor between the ASE and treadmill VO 2 max (p= 0. 365) with high correlation between ergometers (r= 0. 974). The values for repeatability, reproducibility, and reliability of male and female groups measures were, respectively, 4. 08 and 5. 02; 0. 50 and 1. 11; 4. 11 and 5. 15. The values of internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) among measures were all > 0. 90. It was verified that the ASE prototype was appropriate for a step test, provided valid measures of VO 2 max and could therefore, be used as an ergometer to measure cardiorespiratory fitness...|$|E

40|$|What {{you need}} to know about {{ambulance}} safety & standards>> By Nadine Levick, MD, MPH What is it that we need to know about ambulance safety? How do we digest the information that’s put forward by manufacturers? Does KKK-A- 1822 compliance mean the ambulance can endure a crash? What’s safe and what isn’t? What works and what doesn’t? And where do we go to find out? A Disconnect Since the 1960 s, when we left the Cadillac and went into the “box, ” we essentially lost the safety oversight of the automotive industry. What has been the status quo in the ambulance vehicle industry since then hasn’t matched what’s standard in the automotive and transportation industry. Extensive data now highlights some of the strengths and weaknesses of how we address the transportation safety aspects of EMS. Data currently demonstrate that per mile traveled per vehicle, ambulances are one of the most hazardous vehicles on the road. 1 Concept vehicles are on the market, but where are the data and automotive safety oversight to support these modifications? Automotive safety experts have raised serious concerns about the safety of these vehicles built outside the purview of technical experts in occupant protection and vehicle crashworthiness. 2 Would you dare to administer medication that was demonstrated by clinical experts to be unacceptably toxic? Would you use equipment that had been known for 10 years to be unsafe or, worse yet, lethal? No. The interior of this Dlouhy Sprinter from RETTmobil 2008 features a special <b>elevating</b> <b>platform</b> for the stretcher, secure lockdowns for equipment and folding seats. Notice the absence of hazards in the head strike zone. So why aren’t we holding ourselves to the same standard when it comes to the vehicles we ride in every shift? A Shift in Standards It might come as quite a surprise, but neither the KKK Ambulance Specification nor the Ambulance Manufacturers Division (AMD) Standards are standards of occupant crash protection or vehicle crashworthiness. In fact, in some areas, they even conflict with current technical automotive safety engineering practices. 3 KKK- or AMD- compliance doesn’t demonstrate that an ambulance is crashworthy or will protect occupants in the rear patient compartment in the event of photo courtesy Ken Beers/EMS safety foundation a crash. Although KKK and AMD default to the Federa...|$|E
