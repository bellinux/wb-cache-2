Among the pieces he designed for the exhibition was a 25-by-12 foot billboard featuring an image based upon Chief Wahoo and the text [...] "Smile for Racism". Amidst controversy, the school initially announced that the piece would not be funded or shown. Heap of Birds announced his intent not to attend the opening, and alleged that the school was afraid of losing donations from Indians owner Richard Jacobs. The Indians' spokesman had no comment on the matter, while {{the chairman of the}} institute's board explained that he was offended by the piece and said, [...] "I don't think that's art." [...] Eventually, the school reversed its position after determining that it was contractually obligated to fund the work. Heap of Birds decided to attend the opening, and the piece was eventually shown. He produced at least two different variations on the work, referred to in a journal as American Leagues 1 and American Leagues 2, both of which used the same design.

Soil amendment and aging were conducted to recover leaching soils. The percentages of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn removed by column leaching were 90 %, 88 %, 90 %, and 67 %, respectively, when 3. 9 bed volumes of 50 mM EDTA were used. At the pilot scale, on-site metal removal efficiencies using the selected leaching procedure were 80 %, 69 %, 73 % and 62 % for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. EDTA leaching decreased soil CEC, total P, total K and available K concentrations but increased organic matter and total Kjeldahl N concentrations. The subsequent amendment and soil aging further reduced the DTPA-extractable heavy metals in the leached soils. Growth of the first crop of pak choi in the leached soil was inhibited but the second crop grew well after the soil was aged for one year and the concentrations of Cd and Pb in the edible parts were below the Chinese statutory limits. The results demonstrate the potential feasibility of the field leaching technique using EDTA combined with subsequent amendment and soil aging for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soils.

During the last decade, shape analysis has obtained great achievements in the <b>field</b> of <b>heap</b> abstraction.

In addition, several generic static analyzers have been introduced. These compositional analyzers combine many types of abstraction into the same analysis to prove various properties. The main contribution of this paper is the combination of Sample, an existing generic analyzer, with a TVLA-based heap abstraction (TVAL+). ...|$|R

40|$|Software {{tools for}} program understanding, transformation, verification, and testing often require an {{efficient}} yet highly-precise alias analysis. Typically {{this is done}} by comput-ing points-to information, from which alias queries can be answered. This paper presents a novel context-sensitive, demand-driven alias analysis for Java that achieves efficiency by answering alias queries directly, instead of relying on an underlying points-to analysis. The analysis is formulated as a context-free-language (CFL) reachability problem over a language that models calling context sensitivity, and over another language that models field sensitivity (i. e., flow of reference values through <b>fields</b> of <b>heap</b> objects). To improve analysis scalability, we propose to compute procedural reachability summaries online, during the CFL-reachability computation. This cannot be done indiscrim-inately, as the benefits of using the summary information do not necessarily outweigh the cost of computing it. Our approach selects for summarization only a subset of heavily-used methods (i. e., methods having {{a large number of}} in-coming edges in the static call graph). We have performed a variety of studies on the proposed analysis. The experi-mental results show that, within the same time budget, the precision of the analysis is higher than that of a state-of-the-art highly-precise points-to analysis. In addition, the use of method summaries can lead to significant improvements in analysis performance...|$|R

40|$|Bioleaching of {{chalcopyrite}} is {{only possible}} {{in the presence of}} thermophilic micro-organisms. While suitable conditions can be generated within a heap naturally through the exothermic reaction, the effectiveness of the process can be improved with an additional heat source. Chilean copper mines are primarily located in the Atacama Desert, which has the highest solar irradiation levels on the planet. Solar thermal energy can be incorporated into the heap bioleaching process to raise the temperature in the heap and increase the copper extraction rates. A heap bioleaching system, including ponds and a solar thermal collector field, has been simulated over one year using HeapSim and TRNSYS. The maximum copper extraction achievable for the system without a solar thermal field is 67 % with a 7 kg/h m 2 solution flow rate. A maximum extraction of 85 % over one year could be achieved with a collector <b>field</b> to <b>heap</b> area ratio of 1 : 1 and a 10 kg/h m 2 solution flow rate. An economic analysis compares the capital cost of the solar thermal system to the revenue from additional copper extraction. The net present value and internal rate of return were positive for collector areas in the range of 10, 000 – 150, 000 m 2 for a heap area of 200, 000 m 2. The peak NPV occurs at 50, 000 m 2 at which point an extractionof 76 % is achieved over one year of leaching...|$|R

The Coal Board Offices eventually closed down in 1987, leaving the Statue isolated on the seafront in Dover. In 2001, Dover District Council launched the Coalfields Heritage Initiative Kent (CHIK) project.Which was to record and preserve the Mining Heritage of Kent.

In {{many high}} {{mountain}} districts, {{not only are}} the inhabitants likely to be hurt by hardship of life, and retarded by roughness of manners, but their eyes are familiarized with certain conditions of ugliness and disorder, produced by the violence of the elements around them. Once accustomed to look upon these conditions as inevitable in nature, they may easily transfer the idea of inevitableness and fitness to the same appearances in their own houses. I said that mountains seem to have been created to show us the perfection of beauty; but we saw in the tenth chapter that they also show sometimes the extreme of ugliness: and to the inhabitants of districts of this kind it is almost necessary to their daily comfort that they should view without dislike aspects of desolation which would to others be frightful.

40|$|Fulcra is a {{flexible}} and accurate pointer analysis framework. The algorithms developed permit accurate analysis of programs within SPEC and Mediabench benchmark suites generally within {{a small number}} of seconds. Even when a very detailed heap allocation model is used, the longest analysis time is 5 min, while similar frameworks require hours or months. Furthermore, comparisons of accuracy show that the algorithms developed for Fulcra can provide orders of magnitude difference between the least and most accurate analysis configurations. While the implementation is exciting, the author’s primary goal is not to laud its speed or accuracy, but to provide a guide to designers in how to construct very flexible pointer analysis frameworks. For example, the algorithms developed for Fulcra enable control of context sensitivity, <b>field</b> sensitivity, and <b>heap</b> sensitivity at the granularity of a single program object. It is only through this flexibility that frameworks can hope to find a true balance between accuracy and scalability capable of satisfying the timeliness demanded by some clients with the result quality demanded by others. The contributions of Fulcra center around its whole-hearted embrace of hybrid pointer analysis algorithms and the design of elegant qualified constraint-based algorithms that enable simple, flexible, and accurate approachs to context and heap sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Providing high {{performance}} for pointer-intensive programs on modern architectures is an increasingly difficult problem for compilers. Pointer-intensive programs are often bound by memory latency and cache performance, but traditional approaches {{to these problems}} usually fail: Pointer-intensive programs are often highly-irregular and the compiler has little control over the layout of heap allocated objects. This thesis presents {{a new class of}} techniques named ``Macroscopic Data Structure Analyses and Optimizations'', which is a new approach to the problem of analyzing and optimizing pointer-intensive programs. Instead of analyzing individual load/store operations or structure definitions, this approach identifies, analyzes, and transforms entire memory structures as a unit. The foundation of the approach is an analysis named Data Structure Analysis and a transformation named Automatic Pool Allocation. Data Structure Analysis is a context-sensitive pointer analysis which identifies data structures on the heap and their important properties (such as type safety). Automatic Pool Allocation uses the results of Data Structure Analysis to segregate dynamically allocated objects on the heap, giving control over the layout of the data structure in memory to the compiler. Based on these two foundation techniques, this thesis describes several performance improving optimizations for pointer-intensive programs. First, Automatic Pool Allocation itself provides important locality improvements for the program. Once the program is pool allocated, several pool-specific optimizations can be performed to reduce inter-object padding and pool overhead. Second, we describe an aggressive technique, Automatic Pointer Compression, which reduces the size of pointers on 64 -bit targets to 32 -bits or less, increasing effective cache capacity and memory bandwidth for pointer-intensive programs. This thesis describes the approach, analysis, and transformation of programs with macroscopic techniques, and evaluates the net performance impact of the transformations. Finally, it describes a large class of potential applications for the work in <b>fields</b> such as <b>heap</b> safety and reliability, program understanding, distributed computing, and static garbage collection...|$|R
