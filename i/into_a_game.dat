5|$|On March 16, 2013, Burrows {{scored a}} goal six seconds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> against the Detroit Red Wings, setting a Canucks record for fastest goal scored {{to start a}} game. This surpassed the {{previous}} record of nine seconds set by Trevor Linden and was also the fourth-fastest goal scored to start a game in NHL history. Burrows managed 13 goals and 11 assists in the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} {{early on that}} most of the budget be spent on the writing and voice actors. The {{original}} story was written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> script by the co-directors and design team. It was subsequently handed over to Christian Divine and Cano to be fine tuned in English. Story and character development were highlighted over point-and-click puzzles, making choice and consequence integral to how the narrative unfolds. Hannah Telle auditioned for Max Caulfield in July 2014 and was offered the part; Ashly Burch auditioned for both Max and her given role Chloe Price. The recording sessions were done in Los Angeles, California, with the French developer brought in via Skype.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E

5|$|Three {{franchise}} {{records were}} set during the season. Henrik Sedin became the Canucks all-time leading scorer, surpassing Markus Naslund. Alexandre Burrows scored six seconds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> {{making it the}} fastest goal to start a game for Vancouver. Vigneault became the all-time leader in games coached. As a way of celebrating 100 years of hockey in British Columbia, the Canucks wore a special patch on their jerseys with the logo of the Vancouver Millionaires, the first professional team in the city. They also wore replica jerseys of the Millionaires for one game.|$|E
5|$|The Joker forces Batman <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries {{are sent to}} hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E

The reserve now has several important conservation species, including lion, elephant, giraffe, black and white rhinoceros, hippopotamus and cape leopard.|$|E
25|$|The Realtors stepped {{their offense}} {{on the third}} quarter, even leading at some points. But James Yap scored 20 of his 30 teams in the payoff period to lead Purefoods <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>Game</b> 7. Williams had a lackluster {{offensive}} game although he grabbed 17 rebounds; but it was Marc Pingris who grabbed the most boards, with a series high 21 rebounds.|$|E
25|$|Chess spread {{throughout}} the world and many variants of the game soon began taking shape. Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> often played on {{the intersection of the}} lines of the board rather than within the squares. Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia, the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire. Muslims carried chess to North Africa, Sicily, and Iberia by the 10th century.|$|E

25|$|Rose matched Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's playoff {{debut of}} 36 {{points to lead}} the Bulls <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>Game</b> 1 road victory. Rose also became the second player to have a 35-point, 10-assist game in their playoff debut in history, after Chris Paul did the feat in 2008; his 36 points was also the highest points scored by a Bull in a playoff game since Michael Jordan retired. The win also marked the Bulls' first postseason win against the Celtics in history.|$|E
25|$|On July 3, 2011, Heatley {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Wild for Martin Havlát. There he joined former {{teammate}} Devin Setoguchi who had also been traded by the Sharks to the Wild on June 24, ten days before him. While producing a solid season, scoring 53 points, the Wild ultimately failed to reach the playoffs despite a hot start to the year. On February 9, 2012, Heatley recorded the fastest goal in Wild history, scoring 13 seconds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> against the Vancouver Canucks.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Sinclair {{scored the}} most bizarre of his own goals. After 3 minutes <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> at Middlesbrough, he coolly slotted the ball past keeper Ian Walker in a {{seemingly}} laid-back situation. This resulted in a 1–0 defeat for Leicester. This own goal against Middlesbrough {{was not to be}} his last for the club. In March 2004, Sinclair and his Leicester City teammates, Paul Dickov and Keith Gillespie were arrested in Spain over sexual assault charges, while on a training holiday. The charges were later dropped. Leicester released Sinclair {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season.|$|E

25|$|Michigan {{needed to}} reverse its {{fortunes}} in 1985, {{and they began}} doing so with new quarterback Jim Harbaugh. Harbaugh led the Wolverines to a 5–0 record, propelling them to a No. 2 ranking heading <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> with the #1 Iowa Hawkeyes. Michigan lost 12–10, but did not lose another game {{the rest of the}} season to finish at 10–1–1 with a victory over Tom Osborne's Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl. In 1986 Michigan won the Big Ten at 11–2, suffering a loss to the Arizona State Sun Devils in the 1987 Rose Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Griffin had {{an ambitious}} but {{unsuccessful}} attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> {{show of the}} same name. His last game show was a wild game show called Ruckus, which emanated from the Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, {{with the intent of}} national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get a look at it, via reruns that aired for a time on GSN.|$|E
25|$|Kassian {{made his}} Canucks debut {{the night after}} the trade, {{registering}} a shot on goal and 12 minutes and 27 seconds of ice time in a 2–1 shootout loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. Kassian scored a goal and an assist, his first of each with the Canucks, {{in a game against}} the Sabres on March 3, his third game with the Canucks. The following game, against the Dallas Stars, Kassian was called to take a penalty shot 24 seconds after the opening faceoff, making it the second-fastest penalty shot to be called in NHL history (after Maurice Richard took a penalty shot 12 seconds <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> against the Chicago Blackhawks). He missed against goaltender Richard Bachman while attempting a backhand deke. On July 3, 2014, Kassian signed a two-year contract extension with the Canucks worth $3.5 million.|$|E

25|$|Entering the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks were {{paired with}} the eighth-seeded and {{defending}} Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks, who had eliminated Vancouver {{in the previous}} two years. While Vancouver initially took a 3–0 lead in the series, Chicago came back to also win three straight games and force the series <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>Game</b> 7. Luongo, who {{had a history of}} struggling against the Blackhawks, was pulled in Games 4 and 5; he also began Game 6 on the bench in favour of Cory Schneider before returning as the starter in Game 7. In the deciding game, Vancouver held a 1–0 lead with less than two minutes remaining in regulation when they gave up a shorthanded goal to Chicago captain Jonathan Toews. Forced into overtime, winger Alexandre Burrows scored his second goal of the game following a failed clearing attempt by Chicago defenceman Chris Campoli to win the series.|$|E
25|$|On November 16, during Week 11, a {{game between}} the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium ended in a 13–13 tie, the first NFL tie game since November 10, 2002, when the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers ended in a 34–34 draw. After the game, Donovan McNabb {{mentioned}} {{that he did not}} know there were ties in the NFL, apparently confusing the NFL's postseason rules (where teams can and have played double overtime games because those contests continue until a team finally wins) with the regular season rules. This drew the ire of many fans, who thought that a quarterback of his caliber should know some fundamental rules; however, none of McNabb's critics accused him of not playing to win during the OT period in Cincinnati, and his play was tied <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> that was widely derided as one of the ugliest, most disjointed results in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E
