30|$|Slums can {{be viewed}} as the first {{location}} of rural migrants when they arrive in a city, the place from which they explore labor opportunities. This often means being close to the city center and living in <b>deficient</b> <b>housing.</b> The problem is that in LAC many slums have turned into a permanent and burgeoning phenomenon due to poverty traps. In light of anticipated future urbanization, as mentioned earlier, the integration of formal housing supply and transport systems is key {{to meet the demands of}} new low-income migrants. Even so, slum dwellers in some cases may choose to stay in the slums given their strong preference for the location or because of social and economic bonds.|$|E
40|$|Since 1969, California’s Housing Element Law has {{required}} that municipalities address housing equity and housing production. In California, housing equity {{means that a}} municipality has planned for the future production of low-income housing that is priced from 0 to 120 % of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s median family income, and market-rate housing that is priced higher than 121 %. For a purposive sample of municipalities (Sacramento and Los Angeles regions, 1990 to 2007, n = 53), this research found that as compliance with the law increased, the sample experienced <b>deficient</b> low-income <b>housing</b> production but surplus market-rate housing production. Mixed-effects models indicated that compliant municipalities were associated not only with increased low-income housing production but also with decreased annual housing production in comparison to noncompliant municipalities. While these associations contrast with Lewis, they suggest that municipal compliance may support California’s goal of providing housing equity but may also constrain California’s overall housing production...|$|R
50|$|Certain {{behaviors}} such as eating, rumination, and lying down {{can be related to}} the health of the cow and cow comfort. These behaviors can also be related to the productivity of the cows. Likewise, stress, disease, and discomfort will have a negative effect on the productivity of the dairy cows. Therefore, it can be said that it is in the best interest of the farmer to increase eating, rumination, and lying down and decrease stress, disease, and discomfort to achieve the maximum productivity possible. Also, estrous {{behaviors such}} as mounting can be a sign of cow comfort, since if a cow is lame, nutritionally <b>deficient,</b> or are <b>housed</b> in an over crowded barn, the performance of estrous behaviors will be altered.|$|R
40|$|B {{cells have}} been {{reported}} to promote graft rejection through alloantibody production. However, there is growing evidence that B cells can contribute to the maintenance of tolerance. Here, we used a mouse model of MHC-class I mismatched skin transplantation to investigate the contribution of B cells to graft survival. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of B cells prolongs skin graft survival but only when the B cells were isolated from mice housed in low sterility "conventional" (CV) facilities and not from mice housed in pathogen free facilities (SPF). However, prolongation of skin graft survival was lost when B cells were isolated from IL- 10 <b>deficient</b> mice <b>housed</b> in CV facilities. The suppressive function of B cells isolated from mice housed in CV facilities correlated with an anti-inflammatory environment and with the presence of a different gut microflora compared to mice maintained in SPF facilities. Treatment of mice in the CV facility with antibiotics abrogated the regulatory capacity of B cells. Finally, we identified transitional B cells isolated from CV facilities as possessing the regulatory function. These findings demonstrate that B cells, and in particular transitional B cells, can promote prolongation of graft survival, a function dependent on licensing by gut microflora...|$|R
30|$|Geographical {{segregation}} is a {{major problem}} affecting the income opportunities of slum dwellers. Slums are usually “bad” neighborhoods with deficient services (urban infrastructure, health, education, etc.), social and economic violence, and limited working opportunities. Usually the jobs available are unstable, informal, and have low productivity. Wealthier neighborhoods of the city, on the other hand, have more economic opportunities but are hard to reach for some low-income households. Sometimes the transport links are deficient or nonexistent; other times the slums are located in areas far from the city center. The social stigma of slum dwellers because they live in <b>deficient</b> <b>housing</b> is also a factor reducing their possibilities in the city. Geographical segregation is just one aspect of social (and, in some countries, racial) segregation endured by slum dwellers. For example, Perlman (2003) provides evidence from slums in Rio de Janeiro suggesting that the stigma of having a residential address in a squatter settlement has adverse consequences on the probability of getting a job.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} links between housing stressors, social {{supports}} and psychological distress. It was hypothesised that exposure to housing stressors would be significantly related to psychological distress, but that the adverse effects of housing stressors would be moderated by perceptions of social support resources. In other words, the stress/symptom relationship would be attenuated for individuals who {{believe that they have}} active and supportive social relationships. The results of a study conducted in the two New Zealand cities of Auckland and Christchurch partially confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that social support plays a role in mitigating the adverse effects of housing stressors. However, this relationship depends on the severity of the housing stressors. Among our respondents, the presence of social support was indeed associated with reduced symptom levels for those exposed to moderate housing stressors. However, among respondents subjected to high levels of housing stressors, social support was not associated with reduced psychological distress, indicating the need for a more specific policy response to the issue of seriously <b>deficient</b> <b>housing.</b> mental health housing stressors social support psychological distress New Zealand housing and health...|$|E
40|$|While housing {{issues in}} urban agglomerations of sub-Saharan Africa have {{attracted}} considerable scholarly attention, comparatively {{little is known}} about housing problems in rural areas. Taking issue with this shortcoming in our contribution, we first replicate a survey of housing conditions in a rural district of Western Kenya dating back to 1980. Although we observe a significant improvement of housing structures over the past 25 years, we can also establish that <b>deficient</b> <b>housing</b> conditions fall disproportionately on the poor. Departing from this result, we secondly analyze an aided self-help housing scheme which aims to facilitate the improvement of housing conditions for the poor in rural areas of Kenya. Based on data gathered from 263 face-to-face interviews we examine the financial sustainability of the underlying mortgage system and aim to identify the main drivers of mortgage default through multivariate logit analysis. Our statistical results indicate that it is mainly endogenous variables like the size and the age of the program which drive mortgage default. At the same time, typical poverty variables are not significantly correlated with mal-performance in mortgage repayment and therefore increased targeting of poorer population groups is unlikely to result in declining repayment rates...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium (Mg) {{has been}} {{described}} to possess an anxiolytic function, {{but a number of}} studies present inconsistent results on this matter. In this study the effect of Mg deficiency on anxiety-related behavior, brain and blood plasma Mg in young adult male C 57 BL/ 6 JOlaHsd and C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl mice was studied. The animals were put on a control or Mg deficient diet from day 0 and significant hypomagnesaemia was evident from day 12 onwards in the test animals. Housing and test conditions were under either conventional light regime (white light behavioral test conditions) or reverse light regime (red light behavioral test conditions). The animals were tested in three tests for unconditioned anxiety: the modified Hole Board (day 14), the light-dark test (day 21) and the elevated plus maze (day 28). Overall integrated behavioral z-scores were calculated over these three behavioral tests. Mg showed a structure dependent distribution {{at the level of the}} brain, that differed between C 57 BL/ 6 substrain and light regime (conventional versus reverse), respectively. Likewise, total brain Mg did differ between substrain and light regime, but was not affected by the diet. Animals on the Mg <b>deficient</b> diet <b>housed</b> under conventional light regime had a higher final (day 28) blood plasma corticosterone level as compared to controls. Animals housed under reverse light regime exhibited no diet effect of plasma corticosterone levels. The significant hypomagnesaemia at blood plasma level resulted in an effect of Mg deficiency on avoidance, but not overall anxiety-related behavior. Significant differences regarding avoidance behavior were found between the two substrains and light regimes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) {{are gaining}} {{recognition}} as alternative procurement strategy to government-provider approach in mass housing in many countries, including Nigeria. However, {{there are few}} studies exploring their implementation structures, especially in the developing countries. This study examined the implementation structure of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in housing in Nigeria using Ogun State as a case study. Qualitative research approach was used and data were derived from oral interviews with key industry stakeholders. It was observed that the implementation structure of PPPs in housing {{in the study area}} was a combination of the New National Housing and Urban Development Policy, government agencies and corporate private sector organizations, Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, commercial banks, building regulations and bye-laws as well as PPP agreements. This structure influenced the assignment of roles and risks amongst the partners in housing projects; and was found to be <b>deficient</b> in low-cost <b>housing.</b> The paper explored the policy and practice implication of this development and argued for the improvement of social content of PPPs in urban housing delivery in Nigeria.

5000|$|France {{lagged behind}} Bismarckian Germany, {{as well as}} Great Britain, in {{developing}} a welfare state with public health, unemployment insurance and national old age pension plans. There was an accident insurance law for workers in 1898, and in 1910, France created a national pension plan. Unlike Germany or Britain, the programs were much smaller - for example, pensions were a voluntary plan. [...] Historian Timothy Smith finds French fears of national public assistance programs were grounded in a widespread disdain for the English Poor Law. [...] Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s. Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem. [...] The French medical profession guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States. [...] For example, {{there was a long}} battle over a public health law which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the <b>deficient</b> health and <b>housing</b> legislation of 1850.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt {{from the}} full-text article: Housing {{possesses}} certain characteristics which qualify {{it for an}} instrumental role in income redistribution policy. Housing is a commodity which for the poor is generally deficient in quality and frequently inadequate in quantity even at modest quality levels. The poor pay a substantial share of their income for housing. The majority of families with incomes under four thousand dollars spend over one-fourth of their total income on housing, while most of those with incomes under two thousand dollars annually normally spend over one-third for housing, as compared with less than one sixth of average family income devoted to housing {{in the case of}} the total population. And the poor are generally concentrated, in part because of a lack of cheap housing elsewhere, in neighborhoods where the pathology of poverty reinforces itself. In such areas public facilities, including schools, health care services, police protection and sanitation, are generally inferior. Minority persons generally are compelled to pay prices for housing that reflect the racially discriminatory attitudes of whites. Poor minority persons, therefore, may be obtaining even less housing for their outlays of money and deriving even less in the way of public services as a result. Some of the economic costs incurred by the poor or by public agencies on their behalf as a result of inadequate housing may be indirectly reflected in expenditures for medical care. Social costs of <b>deficient</b> <b>housing</b> may be identified with poverty behavior patterns, such as the incidence of juvenile delinquency. The purpose of the present study is to explore the relationship between client alienation and efforts by the social work profession to intervene in behalf of the welfare poor. Specifically, this investigation focuses on the ideas, proposals, and studies that have appeared in the social work literature that would indicate efforts by social workers to increase or decrease client alienation. Social work is practiced primarily in agency and organizational settings. Attention will be given to the nature of these structures to determine how they affect client alienation and prevent social workers from relieving alienation. The dimensions of client alienation will be discussed using Melvin Seeman 2 ̆ 7 s classification of powerlessness and meaninglessness. A further expansion of the concept of client alienation will be obtained by looking for ways to prevent alienation by combining social work concepts with the concepts of micro-macro society as suggested in the writings of Amitai Etzioni...|$|E
5000|$|France 1871-1914 {{followed}} {{well behind}} Bismarckian Germany, {{as well as}} Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health. Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s. Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.

However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{insecurity}} (EI) {{reflects an}} inability to adequately meet basic household heating, cooling, and energy needs. EI is a pervasive and often-overlooked problem for low-income families with children. Conceptually, EI is a multi-dimensional construct that describes the interplay between structural conditions of housing {{and the costs of}} household energy. EI is characterized by three primary elements: physical EI – <b>deficient</b> and inefficient <b>housing</b> structures, economic EI – disproportionate share of household income allocated to utility expenses, and coping EI – energy-related coping strategies that could potentially compromise the quality of the home environment and have negative health consequences. The relevance of EI is indicated by the fact that lower-income families are more likely than their counterparts with higher-incomes to: (1) live in housing with heating and electrical problems, (2) have experienced multiple heating equipment breakdowns, (3) have had an interruption in utility service, (4) have inadequate insulation and insufficient heating capacity, and (5) report being uncomfortably cold for more than 24 hours during the winter. As a result of these energy deficiencies, energy costs tend to be comparatively higher for lower-income groups, thus reducing their ability to purchase other basic necessities of life such as food, as they face the “heat or eat” dilemma. Despite the prevalence of EI and implications for {{the health and well-being of}} families with children, there are no national statistics available to both illuminate this problem and generate more attention at the policy level. This brief describes the extent of economic EI by family income, demographic characteristics, and geographical area, using the latest and most comprehensive data available. We examine the disproportionate share of household income allocated to energy expenses among families with children, defining this as economic EI, and refer to households with more than 10 percent of energy burden as “energy insecure. ” This measure is based on the Department of Energy’s annual estimates of homes that experience an energy affordability gap. This brief looks at the prevalence of economic EI among households with children under age 18 in the United States, using the 2011 American Community Survey (ACS) data. Economic EI is measured using household energy expenditures, which include home heating, cooling, appliances, and lighting as a percentage of annual household income. For instance, if a family of four had an annual household income at the federal poverty level (FPL) of $ 22, 350 in 2011 and its gross annual energy bill was $ 2, 500, the household’s gross economic EI would be above 10 percent. This family would be categorized as experiencing economic EI. This situation may materialize into trade-offs with other competing expenses such as food and shelter, thus reflecting a potential “trifecta of insecurity” in meeting three basic needs: housing, food and energy. Clearly, this issue has important implications for children’s well-being, given the unequal distribution of economic EI and its disproportionate impact on low-income families...|$|R
