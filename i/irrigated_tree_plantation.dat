Having arrived with an American {{merchant}} vessel that was plying the copra trade at a time, when the local inhabitants were having difficulties <b>irrigating</b> their palm <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> Stanisław helped them solve the problem. Accordingly, the village was renamed to its present-day name in his honor.

40|$|Increasing land-use {{intensification}} {{in recent}} decades {{has led to the}} loss and subdivision of large pristine areas, which generally affects species' presence and abundance. However, not every species responds equally to land-use changes: vulnerability of species to landscape transformation may be conditional on their degree of plasticity in habitat use. To assess the behavioural modifications that enable bird populations to persist after landscape management, we compared habitat selection patterns of Red-necked Nightjars (Caprimulgus ruficollis) in two close (10 km) but contrastingly-managed areas in southwestern Spain. Macro-scale analyses showed that nightjar activity (i. e. nesting, roosting and foraging) was dependent on land cover type. In both the unmanaged and the managed area, open shrublands were positively selected as nesting habitat, whereas pinewood patches in the unmanaged area were replaced by pine <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> as roosting habitats in the managed property. Individuals in both areas used paved and unpaved roads as the main foraging habitat. Nevertheless, marshlands and lowlands in the unmanaged area were replaced by <b>irrigated</b> fruit <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> as secondary foraging habitats in the managed property. The micro-scale analysis showed that nightjars in the unmanaged site sat preferentially nearby autochthonous Juniperus phoenicea trees to hawk flying insects in short upward sallies from the ground, whereas birds commonly used tall dense exotic trees (e. g. Acacia saligna, Nicotiana galuca, Casuarina equisetifolia) in the managed property. Based on similarities in body condition of nightjars and on their greater abundance in the managed area compared to the unmanaged site, we conclude that species tolerant to anthropogenic alterations (i. e. having high plasticity in habitat choice) could to some extent cope with or even benefit from moderate landscape transformation...|$|R
40|$|The Gareh Bygone Plain is an arid area, {{south of}} Zagros Mountains, in Southern Iran, where a floodwater {{spreading}} {{project has been}} implemented for artificial recharge of groundwater. Knowledge/mapping of actual evapotranspiration for the mainland uses (natural pasture, <b>irrigated</b> crops and <b>tree</b> <b>plantations)</b> is of major importance for water management in this remote area. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model was used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ET) using non-cloudy images for 32 dates of Landsat 5 TM from May 2009 to October 2010. Various improvements were required for ET computations, including relative to the very high wind speed observed. Reference ET was computed with observed weather data and SEBS products. Thus, crop coefficients (Kc) were obtained as the ratios of actual to reference ET relative to the main types of vegetation. The mid-season Kc generated with SEBS were compared with those previously obtained {{in the region and}} with those published in literature. Consumed water by cultivated crops based on SEBS compared well with applied water measurements. Coherent results were obtained which allow validating the SEBS approach for conditions of limited available data...|$|R

40|$|Regarding rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> {{researchers}} lack a {{basic understanding}} of soil microbial communities; specifically, little is known about whether or not soil microbial variation is correlated with succession in these plantations. In this paper, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to investigate the diversity and composition of the soil bacterial communities in a chronosequence of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> that were 5, 10, 13, 18, 25, and 30 years old. We determined that: (1) Soil bacterial diversity and composition show changes over the succession stages of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations.</b> The diversity of soil bacteria were highest in 10, 13, and 18 year-old rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> followed by 30 year-old rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> whereas 5 and 25 year-old rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> had the lowest values for diversity. A total of 438, 870 16 S rDNA sequences were detected in 18 soil samples from six rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> found in 28 phyla, 66 classes, 139 orders, 245 families, 355 genera, and 645 species, with 1. 01 % sequences from unclassified bacteria. The dominant phyla were Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (relative abundance large than 3 %).

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{means to}} map <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> {{is needed to}} detect tropical land use change and evaluate reforestation projects. To analyze recent <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> expansion in northeastern Costa Rica, we examined the potential of combining moderate-resolution hyperspectral imagery (2005 HyMap mosaic) with multitemporal, multispectral data (Landsat) to accurately classify (1) general forest types and (2) <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> by species composition. Following a linear discriminant analysis to reduce data dimensionality, we compared four Random Forest classification models: hyperspectral data (HD) alone; HD plus interannual spectral metrics; HD plus a multitemporal forest regrowth classification; and all three models combined. The fourth, combined model achieved overall accuracy of 88. 5 %. Adding multitemporal data significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0. 0001) of all forest types, although the effect on <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> accuracy was modest. The hyperspectral data alone classified six species of <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> with 75 % to 93 % producer’s accuracy; adding multitemporal spectral data increased accuracy only for two species with dense canopies. Non-native tree species had higher classification accuracy overall and made {{up the majority of}} <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> in this landscape. Our results indicate that combining occasionally acquired hyperspectral data with widely available multitemporal satellite imagery enhances mapping and monitoring of reforestation in tropical landscapes...|$|R

This algorithm highlighted the unique phenological characteristics of deciduous rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> during the dry season. Phenology of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> and natural evergreen forests was delineated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager imagery during 2009 - 2014.

40|$|As the {{greatest}} rainwater users among all vegetative land covers, <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> have been employed strategically to mitigate salinity and water-logging problems. However, large-scale commercial <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> in high rainfall areas reduce fresh water inflows to river systems supporting downstream communities, agricultural industries and wetland environmental assets. A bio-economic model {{was used to}} estimate economic demand for water by future upstream plantations in a sub-catchment (the 2. 8 million ha Macquarie valley in NSW) of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Given four tree-product values, impacts were simulated under two settings: without and with the requirement that permanent water entitlements be purchased from downstream entitlement holders before establishing a <b>tree</b> <b>plantation.</b> Without this requirement, gains in economic surplus from expanding <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> exceeded economic losses by downstream irrigators, and stock and domestic water users, but resulted in reductions of up to 154 GL (gigalitres) in annual flows to wetland environments. With this requirement, smaller gains in upstream economic surplus, added to downstream gains, could total $ 330 million while preserving environmental flows. Extending downstream water markets to new upstream <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> to equilibrate marginal values across water uses, helps ensure water entitlements are not diminished without compensation. Outcomes include better economic-efficiency, social-equity and environmental-sustainability.

In this study, we use an atmosphere-vegetation interaction model (AVIM 2) to estimate the likely impacts of extreme precipitation events on carbon fluxes and carbon stocks of a <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> in south China. Our results indicate that shifting from moderate precipitation events to extreme precipitation events whilst keeping monthly precipitation unchanged could decrease the <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> carbon accumulation. <b>Tree</b> <b>plantation</b> net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, soil carbon stock and vegetation carbon stock could decrease by 4. 2, 28, 4. 3 and 1. 4 % during the studying period of 1962 - 2004, respectively.

Observed and simulated gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem productivity have significant positive correlation with soil water content (SWC), especially the deep SWC.

Large-scale <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> are expected {{to play a major role}} in carbon economies but could have negative ecological and economic consequences when key environmental values such as biodiversity conservation are not considered. We discuss three potential “bio-perversities”—negative outcomes for biodiversity—that could result from inappropriate <b>plantation</b> <b>tree</b> programs aimed solely at reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating rapid climate change effects. These are: (1) clearing native vegetation to establish <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> (2) planting <b>trees</b> that become invasive taxa, and (3) <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> negatively affecting key ecosystem processes such as fire and hydrological regimes. These bio-perversities may result from common mistakes in environmental management: (1) too narrow a focus on a single environmental value, (2) failing to adequately quantify ecological uncertainty, and (3) failing to anticipate how different groups of people respond to an environmental problem. We highlight ways to prevent possible bio-perverse outcomes in large-scale plantation programs. These include requiring that risk assessments precede project establishment, full carbon accounting is undertaken, incentives used to stimulate <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> establishment are rigorously examined, and rigorous compliance and ecological monitoring is undertaken...|$|R
