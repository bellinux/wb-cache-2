Everything looked normal as the flight began its takeoff roll at 15:03.|$|E
5|$|Amatsukaze {{approached}} SanFrancisco {{with the}} intention of finishing her off. While concentrating on SanFrancisco, Amatsukaze <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> the approach of Helena, which fired several full broadsides at Amatsukaze from close range and knocked her out of the action. The heavily damaged Amatsukaze escaped under cover of a smoke screen while Helena was distracted by an attack by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of the 10 February 1942 the German {{flotilla}} prepared to undertake their operation. As they slipped anchor RAF bombers appeared over head. The German ships conducted a u-turn and sped back to the dock. The RAF bombers released their bombs but did little damage. Fortunately they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> anything untoward.|$|E

5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a {{long list}} of minor changes to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E
5|$|In fact, most Ho-Chunk {{sided with}} the United States during the Black Hawk War. The warriors that {{attacked}} St. Vrain's party acted with no authority or oversight from the Ho-Chunk nation. As the war began to be defined along racial terms most white settlers in the region <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> the distinction. This led to unwarranted fear of all Native Americans in the area, even those friendly to the settlers' cause. One example of this appeared {{in an article published}} in the New Galenian on May 30, 1832. While the article described the events of the massacre it also went on to associate the murders of St. Vrain and his companions with the Sauk and Fox of Keokuk's band.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} realise the mistake was General Dembiński, the {{commanding}} officer of the Reserve Corps tasked with defending the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To make things worse for the Poles, General Umiński, {{the commanding officer}} of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> {{what was happening in}} Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E

25|$|The crew <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> {{that the}} left brakes had been dragged during its take off roll and had {{overheated}}. The overheated brakes were retracted by the crew and entered the wheel wells. The wheel wells subsequently closed to secure the wheels. The wheel wells did not have sufficient cooling, and so {{the temperature of the}} brakes continued to rise, reaching as high as 600 degree Celsius.|$|E

25|$|Administrators {{sought to}} remove Occupy Harvard from the library, {{threatening}} to revoke library access for participating students. Participants, instructed {{to take down}} signs because they violated an unwritten library policy, argued that the signs were protected by written library policy defending free speech. Police removed the protestors' signs, but did not ban anyone from the library. Harvard students quoted in the Crimson {{said that they were}} not bothered by the group and in some cases <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> its presence.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Powers courted Dorothy Pressler Lemke from Northborough, Massachusetts, who {{was also}} looking for love through lonely hearts ads.

Lemke <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> that instead of sending her trunks to Iowa, where Powers claimed to be living, he sent them to the address of Cornelius O.

25|$|Carey contended he {{knew nothing}} of the {{donation}} kickback scheme.

He testified before a grand jury in August and October 1997 that {{he knew nothing}} of the kickbacks, only the donations.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of March, a train carrying the personnel of the British embassy in Saint Petersburg arrived in Tampere. The British had left Russia {{in the aftermath of}} the October Revolution and were now heading back home through Finland and Sweden. The Finnish-American Reds, August Wesley and Verner Lehtimäki, negotiated with the British and the Reds agreed to let them cross the front line in Vilppula. When the British convoy reached the White lines, they were greeted with gunfire as the Whites <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> the white flag against the snowy background and assumed the Union Jack was some kind of socialist banner. Eventually, crossing the front line succeeded and the British returned safely home.|$|E
25|$|Believing that {{a frontal}} attack across the Monocacy {{would be too}} costly, Early sent Brig. Gen. John McCausland's cavalry of about 1,100 men down Buckeystown Road to find a ford and outflank the Union line. McCausland crossed the Monocacy below the McKinney-Worthington ford, about a mile {{downstream}} from the Georgetown Pike bridge, and attacked Wallace's left flank. Due to the rolling terrain, McCausland's men <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>notice</b> that four regiments of Ricketts's veteran troops had taken a position along a fence separating the Worthington and Thomas farms. Consequently, the Union line was able to fire a single volley that destroyed McCauland's front line and panicked the remaining Confederates. McCausland rallied his brigade and launched another attack, {{but was unable to}} break the Union line and retreated.|$|E
