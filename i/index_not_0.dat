Cities in seismic areas still have large inventories of older and potentially deficient buildings. To analyze every building and estimate its vulnerability in detail is costly. A simple method to rank quickly older buildings according to their seismic vulnerability is needed to help engineers prioritize the use of resources for rehabilitating the most vulnerable buildings. ^ Four indicators of building damage or collapse were evaluated using numerical analysis and prior data from building surveys: column index (Hassan 2 ̆ 6 Sozen, 1997), R factor, ratio of column shear capacity to plastic shear demand, and ratio of column moment capacity to beam moment capacity. Idealized building frames were studied using nonlinear numerical analysis. Numerical models of these building frames with different spans, column sizes, numbers of floors, and transverse reinforcement ratios were analyzed with 44 ground motion records. Each numerical analysis used an algorithm to estimate whether a hypothetical building represented by a numerical model {{was likely to be}} severely damaged by strong ground motion. ^ Among the four indicators studied, the column index was observed to be 1) the simplest and 2) the one with the best correlation with estimates of vulnerability to damage. Approximately 3 / 5 of the hypothetical building frames represented by numerical models with column <b>indices</b> <b>not</b> exceeding <b>0.</b> 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{subjects}} of ordered groups and of infinite permutation groups have long en­ joyed a symbiotic relationship. Although the two subjects come from very different sources, {{they have in}} certain ways come together, and each has derived considerable benefit from the other. My own personal contact with this interaction began in 1961. I had done Ph. D. work on sequence convergence in totally ordered groups {{under the direction of}} Paul Conrad. In the process, I had encountered "pseudo-convergent" sequences in an ordered group G, which are like Cauchy sequences, except that the differences be­ tween terms of large <b>index</b> approach <b>not</b> <b>0</b> but a convex subgroup G of G. If G is normal, then such sequences are conveniently described as Cauchy sequences in the quotient ordered group GIG. If G is not normal, of course GIG has no group structure, though it is still a totally ordered set. The best that can be said is that the elements of G permute GIG in an order-preserving fashion. In independent investigations around that time, both P. Conrad and P. Cohn had showed that a group admits a total right ordering if and only if the group is a group of automor­ phisms of a totally ordered set. (In a right ordered group, the order is required to be preserved by all right translations, unlike a (two-sided) ordered group, where both right and left translations must preserve the order...|$|R

40|$|The {{damage and}} {{retrofit}} {{costs of the}} selected group of masonry buildings, which were damaged by the earthquake in the Upper Posočje region in 1998 and 2004, is analyzed in the thesis. All the necessary documentation for the nine buildings made by clay brick, five stone buildings and three buildings made by concrete blocks, was obtained at the National technical office in Tolmin and Bovec. The buildings’ damage was analyzed {{on the basis of}} the type of crack (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) and their sizes in terms of width, length and depth. The damage index is introduced in order to characterize damage with single parameter. Additionally, the measures for rehabilitation and retrofit of buildings were analyzed even in terms of costs per square meter of gross floor area and in terms of the proportion between the costs of rehabilitation and those required for construction of new masonry building. The results show that the damage index for the analyzed buildings varies from 0. 01 to 0. 65, which roughly means a proportion of the damaged wall of the structure. We found that the high cost of rehabilitation of masonry buildings for which the damage <b>index</b> does <b>not</b> exceed <b>0.</b> 65, do <b>not</b> cause the cost of rehabilitation of structural elements, but measures to prevent the occurrence of these damage, such as the installation of wall ties and other non-structural measures (new plaster, various works on the roof, façade works and repair of electrical and piping installations) as a consequence of the damage to structural elements or inadequacy of some parts of buildings...|$|R
