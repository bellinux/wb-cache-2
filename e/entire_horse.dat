2500|$|The 1st U.S.V.I. was {{recruited}} at Point Lookout prison camp between January 21 and April 22, 1864, as a three-year regiment. Assigned to the District of Eastern Virginia, Department of Virginia and North Carolina, it moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where on orders of General Grant it was relegated to provost duty there, Portsmouth, Virginia, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. [...] In August 1864 Grant ordered {{it to the}} Department of the Northwest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The 1st U.S.V.I. traveled by ship to New York City, and by train to Chicago, where it received further orders splitting the regiment. Four companies continued to Milwaukee, while six companies (B, C, D, E, H, and K) were sent to St. Louis, Missouri, arriving there August 22. They moved by the steamboat Effie Deans and by forced march to Fort Rice, Dakota Territory, arriving there October 17 for garrison duty. Conditions were hard over the winter, and fully 11% of the command died of illness, primarily scurvy. Between May 10 and August 31, 1865, Company K garrisoned Fort Berthold and Company B the trading post known as Fort Union {{at the mouth of}} the Yellowstone, obliged to travel by steamboat through hostile territory. [...] Four companies were present at Fort Rice, along with two companies of the 4th U.S.V.I., when a large force of Lakota and Cheyenne led by Sitting Bull attacked for three hours on July 28, 1865, making away with the <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> herd and killing two soldiers. In October 1865 the battalion returned to St. Louis to muster out November 27.|$|E

5000|$|Flakey Dove (10 April 1986 [...] - [...] 13 February 2016) was a British racehorse {{best known}} for her win in the 1994 Champion Hurdle. In a career which lasted from January 1990 until January 1995 she ran forty-four times and won {{fourteen}} races. Although she won two races on the flat, Flakey Dove was a specialist hurdler who competed mainly in National Hunt races. She ran in some races restricted to mares {{in the early part of}} her racing career, but was mainly campaigned against geldings and <b>entire</b> <b>horses</b> in open competition.|$|R

5000|$|Tobiano is a {{dominant}} gene, designated TO. Therefore, one parent {{must be a}} tobiano for the pattern to occur, and the coat pattern will occur with a single copy of the Tobiano gene present (i.e. the horse is heterozygous for Tobiano). Furthermore, when a horse is homozygous for Tobiano coloring, all of that horse's offspring will be spotted, {{with only a few}} exceptions: If either parent passes the dominant gray gene to the foal, then its spots will be visible while it is young, but will gradually become lighter until finally, as the gray gene acts upon all coat colors, the <b>entire</b> <b>horse's</b> coat fades. In the case of horses born Tobiano but turn gray, the skin will retain pigmented and unpigmented skin beneath its hair that may produce [...] "ghost" [...] markings. A homozygous Tobiano that also carries a dilution gene, such as a Pinto with a base color of palomino or buckskin may not reliably produce spotted offspring if bred to another horse with a dilution gene, as a double-dilution may [...] "wash out" [...] the base color.|$|R

50|$|Barding {{was often}} used in {{conjunction}} with cloth covers known as caparisons. These coverings sometimes covered the <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> from nose to tail and extended to the ground. It is unclear from period illustrations how much metal defensive covering was used in conjunction. Textile covers may also be called barding.|$|E
50|$|The head is also trimmed closely, paying special {{attention}} to the jaw, muzzle, ears (including the inside), and eyes.

5000|$|Hunter clip: The <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> is clipped, {{except for}} the legs and a patch of hair under the saddle. This clip traces back to the hunt field, and is still used there today, as it {{provides}} extra protection {{to the back of}} the horse (essential during several hours of hunting) as well as to the lower legs (which may be cut by brambles), but still allows the horse to stay cool while galloping.|$|E

60|$|It {{appeared}} to me probable that the immense woolly mane of the male American bison, which reaches almost to the ground, and is much more developed in the males than in the females, served as a protection to them in their terrible battles; but an experienced hunter told Judge Caton {{that he had never}} observed anything which favoured this belief. The stallion has a thicker and fuller mane than the mare; and I have made particular inquiries of two great trainers and breeders who have had charge of many <b>entire</b> <b>horses,</b> and am assured that they “invariably endeavour to seize one another by the neck.” It does not, however, follow from the foregoing statements, that when the hair on the neck serves as a defence, that it was originally developed for this purpose, though this is probable in some cases, as in that of the lion. I am informed by Mr. McNeill that the long hairs on the throat of the stag (Cervus elephas) serve as a great protection to him when hunted, for the dogs generally endeavour to seize him by the throat; but it is not probable that these hairs were specially developed for this purpose; otherwise the young and the females would, as we may feel assured, have been equally protected.|$|R

50|$|A hitch {{is judged}} {{the moment it}} enters the arena. Usually, {{there is only one}} judge for all the hitches in an <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> show, and it is usually a {{different}} judge than the halter classes. The hitches are judged on a variety of aspects including physical conditioning of the horses, conformation, hoof size, cleanliness and quality of turnout, movement of the horses, quality of action, manners and how well the horses work together as a team and as a hitch as a whole. The presentation and soundness of the wagon is also evaluated, as well as the drivers ability to drive the hitch.|$|E
50|$|Further, the Court {{held that}} the Act served a public use or public purpose. “If the purpose sought to be {{achieved}} by the legislation is a public one and it contains elements of public benefit, then {{the question of how}} much benefit the public derives is for the legislature, not the courts.” The Court found that the principal purpose of the Act was to stimulate economic activity at the racetracks, including the creation of jobs and the attraction of sports and entertainment. Moreover, the emphasis of the Act was to benefit the <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> racing industry, not the individual track owners. Even though the owners will obviously benefit from the increased economic activity at the tracks, it is an indirect benefit. The ultimate result of the infusion of funds will increase the horse racing activity, which in turn stimulates the horse breeding and agricultural industries in the state.|$|E
50|$|The rider {{must also}} {{understand}} that the muscling and improved cardiovascular fitness that is seen within {{a month or two}} of conditioning work does not indicate that the <b>horse's</b> <b>entire</b> body is at the same peak.

5000|$|Horses {{covered with}} scale armor are alluded {{to in the}} ancient Chinese book of poetry, the Shi Jing dating between the 7th to 10th centuries BC—however, these did not cover the <b>entire</b> <b>horse.</b> Comprehensive armor for horses might {{have been used in}} China as early as the Three Kingdoms period. It was not until the early 4th century, however, that cataphracts came into {{widespread}} use among the Xianbei tribes of Inner Mongolia and Liaoning, which led to the adoption of cataphracts by the Chinese armies during the Northern and Southern Dynasties era. Numerous burial seals, military figurines, murals, and official reliefs from this period testify to the great importance of armored cavalry in warfare. Later, the Sui Empire maintained the use of cataphracts, but the use of horse armor declined in the Tang Empire (becoming limited to ceremonial guards of honor) for reasons that remain unclear, but one theory goes that as the frontiers of the Tang empire expanded ever further afield, the need for endurance meant that cataphracts, laden down with heavy armour were unable to cope with long distance pursuits and patrols. The use of cataphracts was then revived in the Liao, Western Xia, and Jin dynasties—the super-heavy cataphracts of the Xia and Jin were especially effective and were known as [...] "Iron Sparrowhawks" [...] and [...] "Iron Pagodas" [...] respectively. The Song Empire also developed cataphract units to counter those of the Liao, Xia, and Jin, but the shortage of suitable grazing lands and horse pastures in Song territory made the effective breeding and maintenance of Song cavalry far more difficult, in addition to the Song's vulnerability to continual raids by the emerging Mongol Empire for over two decades, which eventually vanquished them in 1279 at the hands of Kublai Khan. The Yuan dynasty, successors to the Song, which were a continuation of the Mongolian Empire, seem to have all but forgotten the cataphract traditions of their predecessors, and the last remaining traces of cataphracts in East Asia seems to have died with the downfall of the Yuan in 1368.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{absorption}} and resonance Raman spectra and the azide binding kinetics of ferric horse heart myoglobin (Mb) and mini myoglobin (a chemically truncated form {{of horse}} heart Mb containing residues 32 – 139) have been compared. The steady-state spectra show that an additional six-coordinated low-spin form (not present in <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> heart Mb, which is purely six-coordinated high spin) predominates in mini Mb. The distal histidine is possibly the sixth ligand in this species. The presence of two species {{corresponds to a}} kinetic biphasicity for mini Mb that is not observed for horse heart Mb. Azide binds to horse heart Mb much more slowly than to sperm whale Mb. This difference may result from a sterically hindered distal pocket in horse heart Mb. In both cases, the rate constants level off at high azide concentrations, implying {{the existence of a}} rate-limiting step (likely referable to the dissociation of the axial sixth ligand). The faster rate constant of mini Mb {{is similar to that of}} sperm whale Mb, whereas the slower one is similar to that of <b>entire</b> <b>horse</b> heart Mb...|$|E
25|$|<b>Entire</b> {{herds of}} <b>horses</b> were {{slaughtered}} by the Botai hunters, apparently in hunting drives.

50|$|As regimental {{riding master}} he {{introduced}} substantial {{changes to the}} cavalry training programme, reintroducing the use of leaping bars, training individual soldiers before teaching formation riding to entire squads, and appointing a dedicated soldier in each troop who was trained to break in new horses. Over {{the next few years}} the regiment's standard of horsemanship rose, increasing Nolan's reputation. When the regiment was inspected by Major General John Aitchison, a man known for his high standards, he wrote that: Nolan's system of training horses and teaching riding is worthy of being more generally known. The seat of the men is more uniform and the hand light and firm, and as the hand and heel work together the horses in the ranks are steady to a degree I did not expect to see on a regiment mounted on <b>entire</b> <b>horses.</b> Nolan then became a staff officer, joining the staff of General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, as an aide-de-camp in January 1849. He quickly became close friends with Berkeley's two sons, Charles and George, who were also enthusiastic about horse-racing. In 1850 Nolan accompanied Berkeley {{on a tour of the}} region, conducting horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was also promoted, purchasing a Captaincy on 8 March. Despite these successes, Nolan recognised that his prospects were far more limited in India than in England, and he could not afford the increased costs of serving in the colonies. At the same time, service in India was not taken seriously by many of the officers in high command, and would not be sufficient on its own to advance him. Accordingly, he obtained two years sick leave on 16 January 1851 and returned to England, intending to tour Europe and write a book on cavalry theory.|$|R
