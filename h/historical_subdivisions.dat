40|$|A reappraisal of the {{stratigraphy}} and depositional {{development of}} the Upper Greensand (Late Albian) of the Devizes District, southern England. Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association, XXX. 000 - 000. Three members are recognised within the Upper Greensand Formation of the Devizes district {{on the basis of}} outcrop, newly acquired cored borehole and petrographical data. These are, in ascending stratigraphical order, Cann Sand Member, Potterne Sandstone Member and Easterton Sandstone Member. Compared to the imprecise <b>historical</b> <b>subdivisions,</b> the members provide a much clearer indication of lithological variation through the Upper Greensand, and this in turn provides clues to its depositional development. The biostratigraphy of each member has been determined using macrofossils and microfossils. The new biostratigraphical data clarifies the relationship of the Potterne Rock to the traditionally named 'Ragstone' which caps the Shaftesbury Sandstone in the Shaftesbury district, and suggests that the correlation of the Potterne Rock and 'Ragstone' is less straightforward than previously suggested. There are some distinct contrasts with the stratigraphy of the Upper Greensand southwest of Devizes (Shaftesbury & Wincanton districts). Whilst tectonic influences have been demonstrated to affect coeval strata in parts of the eastern Weald, these may not be the dominant control on the Devizes succession, which seems to be more strongly influenced by its palaeogeographical setting with respect to sediment source areas, and the effect this had on the volume and timing of sediment infill. Palaeogeography may also be indirectly responsible for the absence of cherts in the Upper Greensand of the Devizes area, in contrast to their conspicuous development in the Upper Greensand of southwest England and the Weald...|$|E
40|$|Phylogeographic {{analyses}} of the fauna of the Australian wet tropics rainforest have provided strong evidence for long-term isolation of populations among allopatric refugia, yet typically there is no corresponding divergence in morphology. This system provides an opportunity to examine the consequences of geographic isolation, independent of morphological divergence, and thus to assess the broader significance of <b>historical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> revealed through mitochondrial DNA phylogeography. We have located and characterized a zone of secondary contact between two long isolated (mtDNA divergence > 15 %) lineages of the skink Carlia rubrigularis using one mitochondrial and eight nuclear (two intron, six microsatellite) markers. This revealed a remarkably narrow (width < 3 km) hybrid zone with substantial linkage disequilibrium and strong deficits of heterozygotes at two of three nuclear loci with diagnostic alleles. Cline centers were coincident across loci. Using a novel form of likelihood analysis, {{we were unable to}} distinguish between sigmoidal and stepped cline shapes except at one nuclear locus for which the latter was inferred. Given estimated dispersal rates of 90 - 133 m x gen(- 1 / 2) and assuming equilibrium, the observed cline widths suggest effective selection against heterozygotes of at least 22 - 49 % and possibly as high as 70 %. These observations reveal substantial postmating isolation, although the absence of consistent deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at diagnostic loci suggests that there is little accompanying premating isolation. The tight geographic correspondence between transitions in mtDNA and those for nuclear genes and corresponding evidence for selection against hybrids indicates that these morphologically cryptic phylogroups could be considered as incipient species. Nonetheless, we caution against the use of mtDNA phylogeography as a sole criterion for defining species boundaries...|$|E

40|$|Peri-urban {{areas have}} {{commonly}} been defined {{in relation to}} a nearby metropolitan area on their inner boundary, a rural area on their outer boundary, or as the land in between. Peri-urban areas usually are not homogenous but are dynamic areas and the focus of significant non-metropolitan growth, both in Australia and internationally. A functional analysis requires an examination of the reciprocal relations of interacting systems as well as the characteristics, extent and impacts of cities and rural areas on peri-urban areas. Typologies of peri-urban development must address this heterogeneity. An examination of two Australian peri-urban case study areas applies an enhanced typology and reveals a disorderly pattern of existing subdivision with little discernible pattern and reflecting <b>historical</b> <b>subdivision</b> approvals...|$|R

40|$|In {{setting the}} ancient Latin hymn Te Deum to music I {{maintained}} three major objectives: first, {{that the work}} would be enjoyable and moving {{to an audience of}} widely varying backgrounds in music; second, that the orchestra and chorus would find the work enjoyable and rewarding to perform, even through repeated rehearsals; and third, that the spirit of the text be reflected in the music in a more complete and consistent manner than is generally heard in settings of this prayer. To effect the first two objectives the music employs generally transparent textures, a chant-derived and grateful vocal line, and an extended modal harmonic idiom somewhat related to the French and American schools {{of the first half of}} this century. Relationships with the past also include uses of cantus firmus technique, Gregorian chant in direct quote, paraphrase, and spirit, St. Martial organum and free organum, canon, use of men's voices in the alto range, and several types of counterpoint and polyphony. An archaic flavor is furthered by restricting the woodwinds to double-reeds and flutes, by doubling of a woodwind melody by pizzicato srings, and occassional string passages senza vibrato. The relationship of text to music has a direct bearing on form and is centered on the crucial last verse of the Te Deum. The humble prayer of petition, written for the first time in the hymn in the first person singular, suggested the approach for the entire work, namely an intimate, personal, and reflective mood. Therefore, all the music preceding the final verse is preparatory to this final statement. The three <b>historical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> of the hymn provide the three separate parts of my setting, and each part contains references to the corresponding Gregorian melody. In addition, each part also employs elements of the original setting of the final verse. As Stravinsky has written, in the end, God must not be praised with loud, fast music...|$|E

Although more pronounced in the gecko, phylogeographic structure was congruent between E. amplus and P. ossa. In contrast to the saxicolous, rainforest-restricted P. ossa and E. amplus, the rainforest-generalist species, C. rhomboidalis, does not display strong geographic population structure. The differences in genetic population structure exhibited by the three species are consistent with species-specific differences in ecology...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} study {{contrasting}} patterns of variation in regulatory and nonregulatory enzymes of the central metabolic pathways we have examined the molecular variation in four uncharacterized hexokinase genes unique to muscle, fat body, and testis in Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. Earlier isoenzyme studies had designated these genes as Hex-A, Hex-C, and Hex-t. There are two tightly linked testes-specific genes designated here as Hex-t 1 and Hex-t 2. Substantial and concordant differences across species are seen in levels of both amino acid and silent polymorphism. The flight muscle form Hex-A is the most conserved followed by the fat body hexokinase Hex-C and testis-specific hexokinases Hex-t 1 and Hex-t 2. While constraints acting at the amino acid level are expected, the silent polymorphisms follow this pattern as well. All genes are in regions of normal recombination, therefore hitchhiking and background selection are not likely causes of interlocus differences. In D. melanogaster latitudinal clines are seen for amino acid polymorphisms at the Hex-C and Hex-t 2 loci. There is evidence for accelerated amino acid substitution in Hex-t 1 that has lost residues known to be associated with glucose and glucose- 6 -phosphate binding.

40|$|Background Sympatric speciation—the {{divergence}} {{of populations}} into new species in absence of geographic barriers to hybridization—is the most debated mode of diversification of life forms. Parasitic organisms are prominent models for sympatric speciation, {{because they may}} colonise new hosts within the same geographic area and diverge through host specialization. However, {{it has been argued}} that this mode of parasite divergence is not strict sympatric speciation, because host shifts likely cause the sudden effective isolation of parasites, particularly if these are transmitted by vectors and therefore cannot select their hosts. Strict sympatric speciation would involve parasite lineages diverging within a single host species, without any population subdivision. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a case of extraordinary divergence of sympatric, ecologically distinct, and reproductively isolated malaria parasites within a single avian host species, which apparently occurred without <b>historical</b> or extant <b>subdivision</b> of parasite or host populations. Conclusions/Significance This discovery of within-host speciation changes our current view on the diversification potential of malaria parasites, because neither geographic isolation of host populations nor colonization of new host species are any longer necessary conditions to the formation of new parasite species...|$|R
40|$|Population {{substructure}} {{and biological}} differentiation was studied among the Golla, a pastoral caste {{living in the}} southern areas of Andhra Pradesh (AP) in India, using 11 anthropometric measurements and 20 quantitative dermatoglyphic variables. The {{data were collected from}} a sample of 334 adult males drawn from 30 villages distributed in the Chittoor district of AP, who belonged to 8 endogamous subunits of the same caste. Multiple discriminant analysis of the anthropometrics suggests a highly significant degree of discrimination that is consistent with the microgeographic variations of the groups. In contrast, in different sets of dermatoglyphs discrimination is low and generally inconsistent with both the geographic and ethnohistorical affiliations of the groups. These findings are reflected in the FST value for anthropometry, which is more than double the value of dermatoglyphs. The patterns of gene flow as inferred through the regression of phenotypic variance on the distance of groups from the centroid is not generally consistent with the known backgrounds in the case of either dermatoglyphs or anthropometry. It is concluded that at the level of caste substructure representing the lowest level of population hierarchy, the quantitative variables examined here may not portray a complete picture of the <b>historical</b> process of <b>subdivision.</b> The results of this study are not in congruence with those based on another study of 13 short tandem repeat loci on the same set of populations (Reddy et al. 2001), which may provide better insights into the population structure and history of subdivision that are consistent with the known ethnohistorical backgrounds of the populations...|$|R
