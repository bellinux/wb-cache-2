5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips that {{emphasized}} mild sadomasochism and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up on trying to shade in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> simply outlining it.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian {{newspaper}} al-Ayyam {{reported that}} Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds {{at his home}} in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret service. Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, Taher Jalil Habbush, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.|$|E
5|$|Since Moore was grievously {{wounded in}} the battle, his second-in-command, Midshipman Richard Stillingfleet, {{surrendered}} the crew and the vessel. Moore was taken back to Machias and put into the care of Ichabod Jones's nephew, Stephen Jones. However, Moore's wounds were too severe and he died the following day. Three other members of Moore's crew were killed, including Robert Avery. The remaining crew members of the British schooner were held at Machias for a month, then {{handed over to the}} Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Reports circulated that as many as 100 British men died in the battle. Machias lost two men, John McNiell and James Coolbroth, and three others were badly wounded: John Berry, who had a musket ball enter <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> exit behind his ear, Isaac Taft, and James Cole.|$|E

5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E
5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{knocked out}} Johansson {{in the fifth}} round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, {{to become the first}} man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, {{seemingly}} out before he landed flat on his back. With glazed eyes, blood trickling from <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson lay unconscious for five minutes before he was helped onto a stool.|$|E

He also played an arsonist and a wealthy executive as well as main antagonist in an episode of the FOX TV show The Good Guys.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{inside the}} house lasted for five minutes. A patrol officer nearby, Steve Leonard, heard the shots {{and headed to the}} scene, getting the address from multiple 911 dispatches. When he got to the house, he encountered an injured victim and immediately got between the victim and the house, as Huff was coming down the steps. Before the officer could complete his demand that Huff drop his weapon, Huff placed the gun in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> shot himself through the head.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 2008, it was {{announced}} that Čech had undergone emergency surgery on his chin and lips following an accidental collision with Tal Ben Haim during training. He had 50 stitches put on <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> chin and missed 22 games due to injuries. He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against Wigan Athletic which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the Champions League final against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a penalty shootout.|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{that there were some}} discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded. According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou, Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35seconds of waterboarding, which involved stretching cellophane over <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> nose and pouring water on his face to create the sensation of drowning. Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{deprived}} of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on {{the pretext of}} killing a snake and {{shot himself in the}} chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E
25|$|During this ceremony, {{the king}} {{also had to}} participate, {{although}} he was a Christian, {{and he had to}} drink of the mead that was offered and consecrated for Odin, Njord and Freyja. The peasants also wanted him to eat of the meat, but he only gaped over the handle of the cauldron and held a linen cloth between <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> the meat. The peasants were not at all satisfied with a king who would not participate fully in the blót. The King had however, been seriously humiliated and later he converted to the old faith. The tradition says that he was buried in the old ways.|$|E

25|$|When Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, in 1867 {{failed to}} answer a letter Tewodros II of Ethiopia had sent her, he took it as an insult and imprisoned several British residents, {{including}} the consul. An army of 12,000 was sent from Bombay to Ethiopia to rescue the captured nationals, {{under the command of}} Sir Robert Napier. The Ethiopians were defeated, and the British stormed the fortress of Magdala (now known as Amba Mariam) on April 13, 1868. When the Emperor heard that the gate had fallen, he fired a pistol into <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> killed himself. Sir Robert Napier was raised to the peerage, and given the title of Lord Napier of Magdala.|$|E
25|$|As {{depicted}} in the pulps, The Shadow wore a wide-brimmed black hat and a black, crimson-lined cloak with an upturned collar over a standard black business suit. In the 1940s comic books, the later comic book series, and the 1994 film starring Alec Baldwin, he wore either the black hat or a wide-brimmed, black fedora and a crimson scarf just below his nose and across <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> chin. Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double-breasted trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen {{in some of the}} later comics series, The Shadow would also wear his hat and scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.|$|E
25|$|Ninomiya {{began his}} career in the {{entertainment}} industry when he joined the Japanese talent agency Johnny & Associates in 1996 at the age of 13.
