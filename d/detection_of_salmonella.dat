The first, and most important goal, was to see if the 25 participating laboratories in this study could detect Salmonella in minced beef. The second goal was to compare the different analysis methods for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in minced beef. Each laboratory received a package containing minced beef and 35 gelatin capsules containing different levels of Salmonella. According to the instructions, the laboratories spiked the meat with the capsules and tested those samples for the presence of Salmonella. The laboratories used three methods for running this test: Rappaport Vassiliadis Soya broth (RVS), Mueller Kauffmann Tetrathionate novobiocin broth (MKTTn) and Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV). The first two methods are internationally prescribed for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in food, while the third (MSRV) is prescribed for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in veterinary faeces. All laboratories found Salmonella in just 88 % of the samples using one of the food methods (MKTTn).

In this paper we describe development and characterization of a novel assay that utilizes the normal infection cycle of bacteriophage SJ 2 for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar Enteritidis in broth.

The high incidence <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> isolated from imported foods illustrated the existence of an international health hazard resulting from the continuous introduction of exogenous strains of pathogenic microorganisms on a large scale...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{media were}} {{compared}} {{for their ability}} to recover salmonellae from seagull faecal material after pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water and enrichment in Rappaport's broth. Of the 847 specimens examined 96 were found to be positive for <b>salmonellae.</b> Use <b>of</b> Brilliant Green agar containing sulphamandelate supplement resulted in the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> from each <b>of</b> the 96 samples found to be positive and was the most efficient medium tested. Brilliant Green agar lacking the supplement was the least effective medium, salmonellae being isolated from only 80 samples using this medium. All of the media tested were shown to support the growth of a wide range <b>of</b> <b>salmonella</b> serotypes, although Salmonella typhi and S. dublin did not form colonies on those media which contained Brilliant Green. Hynes' modification of deoxycholate citrate agar was shown to be considerably less inhibitory to salmonellae after ageing for four days. Ageing of other media had no significant affect on their ability to support the growth <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> {{was developed}} and evaluated by using artificially contaminated specimens of poultry feed, feces, litter, or carcass rinsings, and naturally contaminated water samples. Specimens containing <b>salmonellae</b> <b>of</b> serogroups B or C 2 inhibited the binding of polyvalent anti-O serum to microtiter plate wells coated with lipopolysaccharide <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> typhimurium (serogroup B) or Salmonella albany (serogroup C 2), respectively. Treatment of specimens with Rhozyme 41 (a protease) inhibited nonspecific reactions. The ELISA detected 106 of 111 culture-positive specimens contaminated with <b>salmonellae</b> <b>of</b> serogroups B or C 2. Nineteen of 20 specimens containing <b>salmonellae</b> <b>of</b> serogroup C 1 and all of 36 culture-negative specimens were ELISA negative. All seven water samples that contained <b>salmonellae</b> <b>of</b> serogroups B or C 2, including three that were culture positive only after delayed secondary enrichment, were ELISA positive. Seven of the nine water samples that contained <b>salmonellae</b> <b>of</b> other serogroups, and all 38 culture-negative samples, were ELISA negative. The ELISA was simple to perform, produced results in 48 h, and was more economical than culture methods...|$|R
