40|$|Asynchronous {{serial data}} {{interfaces}} require {{the receiver to}} recover the data by examining the bitstream and determining where each bit should be sampled {{in the absence of}} a clock sent with the data. There are several ways to implement this type of receiver in Xilinx FPGAs. RocketIO ™ transceivers are designed specifically for this task but are not available in all Xilinx FPGAs. Depending on the device family and speed grade, SelectIO ™ inputs and FPGA logic resources can implement asynchronous serial receivers at bit rates up to nearly 1 Gb/s. For data with short run lengths and low jitter, sampling the bitstream about four times per bit period can be sufficient. Such a low oversampling rate data recovery technique is described in XAPP 224, Data Recovery. However, when the data has long run lengths without bit transitions or high jitter tolerance is required, higher oversampling rates are required, traditionally requiring the use of multiple clock phases that often consumes several <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> <b>managers</b> (DCMs) and many global clock resources. Xilinx Virtex™- 4 and Virtex- 5 devices a have high-precision programmable delay element associated with every input pin. These delay elements, called IDELAY, can be used to implement an oversampler that uses very few FPGA logic resources and, more importantly, just a single DCM and two global clock resources to do 8 X oversampling. This solution provides better jitter tolerance than techniques that use multiple DCMs. When paired with a suitable data recovery scheme, the oversampling technique described here can be used with many different data protocols up to 550 Mb/s in Virtex- 5 devices and 500 Mb/s in Virtex- 4 devices. As an example of how to use the technique, a reference design implements a SD-SDI (SMPTE 259 M) receiver running at 270 Mb/s...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{isolated}} {{switched mode}} power supplies (SMPSs) commonly utilise digital control methods over their classical analogue counterparts. These methods are now preferred {{for ease of}} programmability and implementation, scalability and they also accommodate advanced control techniques such as adaptive control. However in most digital implementations, inexpensive opto-couplers are still used to transmit analogue signals across the isolation barrier. It {{is well known that}} these types of opto-couplers suffer many drawbacks including variable gain due to ageing effects. The main research contribution in this thesis focuses on developing and implementing a full bi-directional digital data-link between both sides of the isolation barrier, i. e. all signals (feedback and auxiliary) are digitalised and transmitted as a single encoded data stream across the isolation barrier. A key advantage of this scheme is that only a single set of digital couplers is required to achieve bi-directional communication, when compared with its analogue counterpart which would require multiple opto-couplers. This proposed scheme is therefore a more cost-effective and efficient solution and does not suffer from performance degradation due to ageing effects. To reduce the size and improve power efficiency and loop response, switching frequencies are continually increasing. Higher switching frequencies reduce the transmission window and therefore the number of bits to be transmitted across the isolation barrier per switching cycle needs to be minimised. To achieve this objective for the bi-directional data-link proposed, a new state-dependent encoding scheme for the required analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) has been specifically designed. This state-dependent encoding scheme ensures a high resolution during the steady-state operation of the SMPS while still providing adequate accuracy during transients. Along with the state-dependent ADC, two digital pulse width modulators (DPWMs) for single- and multi-phase SMPSs have been designed for use with the proposed communication system. These DPWMs were implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), but are also suitable for application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The DPWM designs only require a small number of logic elements while achieving high speed and high resolution, temperature independence and good scalability. This has been achieved using a hybrid approach which uses a novel fine-resolution block along with a coarse resolution block. This approach takes advantage of <b>digital</b> <b>clock</b> <b>manager</b> (DCM) blocks available on most commercial FPGAs available today. Manual placing and routing techniques result in high linearity and monotonic behaviour. For test purposes, the bi-directional communication scheme has been implemented on FPGAs and verified using a custom-built SMPS board...|$|E
