It is only in labour {{there can be}} profit--that is to say a [...] "making in advance," [...] or [...] "making in favour of" [...] (from proficio). In exchange, there is only advantage, i.e., a {{bringing}} of vantage or power to the exchanging persons. Thus, one man, by sowing and reaping, turns one measure of corn into two measures. That is Profit. Another by digging and forging, turns one spade into two spades. That is Profit. But the man who has two measures of corn wants sometimes to dig; and the man who has two spades wants sometimes to eat:--They exchange the gained grain for the gained tool; and both are the better for the exchange; but though there is much advantage in the transaction, there is no profit. Nothing is constructed or produced. Only that which had been before constructed is given to the person by whom it can be used. If labour is necessary to effect the exchange, that labour is in reality involved in the production, and, like all other labour, bears profit. Whatever number of men are concerned in the manufacture, or in the conveyance, have share in the profit; but neither the manufacture nor the conveyance are the exchange, and in the exchange itself there is no profit.|$|E

The paper investigates {{the manner in which}} exchange rate changes influence the inherent tension that exists between the incentives to collude and compete. It is shown that the sign and degree <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> rate pass-through depends critically upon: the expected duration of a change in the exchange rate and the relative competitive strengths of the firms. The predictions of the model closely accord with the empirical evidence on exchange rate pass-through...|$|R
