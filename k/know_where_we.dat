500|$|On March 12, 2015, Disney officially {{announced}} that a feature-length sequel to Frozen was in development with Buck and Lee returning as directors, and Del Vecho returning as producer. In a May 2015 interview, Buck said, [...] "We have lots of things to figure out {{but at least we}} <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are going." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that voice recording for the film was due to start later in the month, but in September of that same year, she retracted her earlier comments as mistaken and explained that she had been working instead on other Frozen projects such as the upcoming holiday special. In April 2017, Disney {{announced that}} the sequel would be released on November 27, 2019.|$|E
500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{crew member}} asked Powers, {{one of the}} students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are. We must have got lost after that last turn." [...] Cox then transmitted; [...] "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." [...] The response {{after a few moments}} was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. [...] "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" [...] "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, [...] "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't know how far down and I don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, a P-61 Black Widow {{from the}} 547th Night Fighter Squadron, named Hard to Get, {{had taken off}} at 18:00, piloted by Capt. Kenneth Schrieber and 1st Lt. Bonnie Rucks. About 45minutes before the attack, Schrieber cut the power to the left engine at [...] over the camp. He {{restarted}} it, creating a loud backfire, and repeated the procedure twice more, losing altitude to [...] Pretending that his plane was crippled, Schneber headed toward low hills, clearing them by a mere [...] To the Japanese observers, it seemed the plane had crashed and they watched, waiting for a fiery explosion. Schneber repeated this several times while also performing various aerobatic maneuvers. The ruse continued for twenty minutes, creating a diversion for the Rangers inching their way toward the camp on their bellies. Prince later commended the pilots' actions: [...] "The idea of an aerial decoy was a little unusual and honestly, I didn't think it would work, not in a million years. But the pilot's maneuvers were so skillful and deceptive that the diversion was complete. I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> would have been without it." [...] As the plane buzzed the camp, Lt. Carlos Tombo and his guerrillas along with {{a small number of}} Rangers cut the camp's telephone lines to prevent communication with the large force stationed in Cabanatuan.|$|E

500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players want is a fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> get off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1987, Lightfoot filed {{a lawsuit}} against {{composer}} Michael Masser, claiming that Masser's melody for the song [...] "The Greatest Love of All"—recorded by George Benson (1977) and Whitney Houston (1985)—stole 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". The transitional section that begins [...] "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" [...] of the Masser song has the same melody as [...] "I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" [...] of Lightfoot's song.

2500|$|Even 1968's [...] "Aerial View No. 1", {{despite the}} spatial {{hint of the}} title, is far from literal. Certain {{features}} of structure and color render a literal interpretation of this image as an aerial landscape difficult or even impossible. The attempt at interpretation is both invited and repulsed. But by about 1970, with the [...] "Night Landings" [...] paintings, there was a definite shift away from the previous decade's stubbornly refractive attitude. The [...] "Night Landings" [...] offer a much more definite sense of scale and viewpoint, especially {{with the aid of}} the titles. [...] "Night Landings: Nairobi" [...] is not disorienting in the least: we <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are; we know we're in a plane, we know the plane is landing, and we even know roughly what time it is: we are looking down, and we see vividly the city named in the title, with the surrounding land and water.|$|E
2500|$|In The New Jerusalem, Chesterton made {{it clear}} that he {{believed}} that there was a [...] "Jewish Problem" [...] in Europe, in the sense that he believed that Jewish culture (though not Jewish ethnicity) separated itself from the nationalities of Europe. He argued that he was quite in favour of a Jew becoming Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor, under the condition, though, that [...] "every Jew must be dressed like an Arab [...] The point applies to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him. The point is that we should <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land." [...] He suggested the formation of a Jewish homeland as a solution, and was later invited to Palestine by Jewish Zionists who saw him as an ally in their cause. Later he grew out of the notion of Palestine as a Jewish homeland, and suggested somewhere in Africa instead.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has gotten to the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{suggestion of}} unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area {{appeared in a}} September 17, 1950, article published in The Miami Herald (Associated Press) by Edward Van Winkle Jones. Two years later, Fate magazine published [...] "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door", a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of Flight 19, a group of five US Navy Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers on a training mission. Sand's article {{was the first to}} lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of American Legion magazine. In it, author Allan W. Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, [...] "We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are, the water is green, no white." [...] He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes [...] "flew off to Mars." [...] Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of Argosy, Vincent Gaddis' article [...] "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" [...] argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region. The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, Invisible Horizons.|$|E
2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria".
