Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxii, 149 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmApatite {{is the primary}} exogenic sink of phosphorus (P). The weathering of apatite contained in continental rocks and sediments compensates for the P loss via sediment subduction over geologic time scales. P availability may control marine net ecosystem production over geologic time scales and thus apatite weathering rates may control long-term marine net ecosystem production. It is hypothesized that apatite dissolution rates can be quantified and modeled {{in a manner similar}} to silicate and carbonate minerals and that they are primarily a function of mineral composition, pH, degree of undersaturation, and temperature. This hypothesis is tested by a series of experiments measuring the steady-state dissolution of five apatite compositions over a range of pHs (2 < pH < 8. 5) and temperatures (25 - 55 °C) that are applicable to past earth surface conditions. The dissolution rate of <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> (2 < pH < 8. 5) and marine sedimentary apatite (4 < pH < 7) decreased with increasing pH over the respective pH ranges studied with <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> dissolving faster at comparable pHs. The effect of pH on <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> dissolution was most pronounced in the acidic pH range (2 < pH < 5); after which, the rate was relatively invariant with pH change over 5. 5 < pH < 8. 5. The initial stage of the dissolution reaction is incongruent with calcium being released to solution in stoichiometric excess of P and fluoride. The degree of undersaturation has a significant effect on <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> dissolution rates and was taken into account when determining the apparent activation energy of <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> dissolution (8. 3 kcal mol). Apatite experimental dissolution rate dependency on solution and temperature variation suggests that the long-term P release from apatite weathering is partly a function of global temperature and apatite surface area. This hypothesis was explored by modeling how Phanerozoic variation in temperature and igneous rock surface area influenced apatite weathering rates. Model results show that elevated global average temperature and igneous rock surface area during the mid- to early-Paleozoic resulted in an increased apatite weathering P flux. These results suggest that temperature and rock surface area variation exert control on the dissolved P flux from apatite weathering over geologic time scales...|$|E

In this study, apatite grains from 19 intrusions across northeastern Nevada with varied petrogenetic and metallogenic properties {{were analyzed by}} electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) to obtain major and trace element abundances. Systematic variations in Sr and REE concentrations in apatite grains from granitic host rocks {{are the result of}} competition with pre-existing and coexisting minerals in silicate melts. The presence of zoning in cathodoluminescence colors combined with high Sr concentrations in apatite from many of the Eocene granodiorite rocks suggest magma mixing affected the geochemical evolution in many of the Eocene igneous systems. In addition, high Sr concentrations in apatite grains from Late Cretaceous two-mica granites may reflect significant magmatic input from lower crustal and/or mantle sources despite the felsic nature of these intrusive rocks. A new EPMA analytical routine to measure arsenic down to detection limits of approximately 20 ppm allowed a more extensive characterization of As concentration in <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> than has previously been published. Still, correlations between As and other trace-element concentrations are not evident, which may reflect the simple substitution of As 5 + for P 5 + in the apatite structure. Petrologic controls on As content include redox state, indicated by the high Asapat/Asbulk-rock in relatively oxidized intrusive rocks. An additional control is competition among other magmatic phases, exsolving aqueous fluids, or sulfide melts, indicated by enrichment of As in apatite cores relative to apatite rims. Past studies on redox-sensitive elements in <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite</b> have focused on Mn and S, but with further investigation, As may also prove to be a key redox-sensitive trace element in apatite for interpreting igneous and hydrothermal processes...|$|E

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements can produce accurate and precise measurements of H and other volatiles in many materials including apatite. SIMS standardization generally makes use of empirical linear transfer functions that relate measured ion ratios (i. e., of an element of interest normalized to a reference element) to independently known concentrations or abundance ratios. However, this approach is often limited {{by the lack of}} compositionally diverse, well-characterized, homogeneous standards. In general, SIMS calibrations are developed for minor and trace elements, and any two calibrations are treated as independent of one another.

The data are used to test the hypothesis that S oxidation states other than S 6 + may substitute into the apatite structure. Peak energies corresponding to sulfate S 6 + (~ 2482 eV), sulfite S 4 + (~ 2478 eV), and sulfide S 2 − (~ 2470 eV) were observed in apatite, and the integrated areas of the different sulfur peaks correspond to changes in fO 2 and bulk S content. Here, multiple tests confirmed that the S oxidation state in apatite remains constant when exposed to the synchrotron beam, at least for up to 1 h exposure (i. e., no irradiation damages). To our knowledge, this observation makes apatite the first mineral to incorporate reduced (S 2 −), intermediate (S 4 +), and oxidized (S 6 +) S in variable proportions {{as a function of the}} prevailing fO 2 of the system. Apatites crystallized under oxidizing conditions (FMQ+ 1. 2 and FMQ+ 3), where the S 6 +/STotal peak area ratio in the coexisting glass (i. e., quenched melt) is ~ 1, are dominated by S 6 + with a small contribution of S 4 +, whereas apatites crystallizing at reduced conditions (FMQ) contain predominantly S 2 −, lesser amounts of S 6 +, and possibly traces of S 4 +. A sulfur oxidation state vs. S concentration analytical line transect across hydrothermally altered apatite from the Mina Carmen iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposit (Chile) demonstrates that apatite can become enriched in S 4 + relative to S 6 +, indicating metasomatic overprinting via a SO 2 -bearing fluid or vapor phase.

Helium ages from 79 to 17 Ma are younger than ages obtained by other dating techniques, including apatite fission-track counting, and are consistent with laboratory experiments that indicate this system has a uniquely low closure temperature. Helium ages are strongly correlated with elevation and record the latest low-temperature thermal evolution of the range. They suggest relative tectonic quiescence in the latest Cretaceous through mid-Tertiary and provide no evidence for rapid unroofing of the block during this period.

This ^ 3 He is almost certainly derived from cosmic ray reactions in rocks with high exposure ages at high latitude and elevation. Several samples of fossil tooth enamel fluorapatite from the Turkana Basin of Kenya are similarly rich in ^ 3 He, with up to 1 × 10 ^ 7 atoms ^ 3 He g^(− 1) and ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios up to 4 × 10 ^(− 6). Again, this ^ 3 He is most logically attributed to cosmic ray reactions. Provided that cosmogenic ^ 3 He, like radiogenic ^ 4 He, is quantitatively retained in fluorapatite under Earth surface conditions, routine ^ 3 He exposure dating of this common phase may be possible. Based on its chemical composition, the ^ 3 He production rate in fluorapatite is about 100 atoms g^(− 1) yr^(− 1) at sea level and high latitude. Using this rate the apatites from the Transantarctic Mountains have apparent exposure ages of 0. 5 – 6. 2 Myr, in agreement with values elsewhere in the range. The fossil tooth enamel samples have apparent exposure ages ranging from a few up to 130 kyr. Such high exposure ages suggest some of these fossils may be lag deposits with a very long residence time at or near the Earth’s surface. ^ 3 He exposure ages can provide insights to the depositional and reworking history of enamel-bearing fossils. At present the major limitations to ^ 3 He exposure dating of fluorapatite are purification of sufficient amounts of material and measurement of small amounts of ^ 3 He in the presence of large quantities of ^ 4 He.

40|$|No {{consensus}} {{exists on}} the mechanisms that caused surface uplift and high elevations in the southern Rocky Mountains and High Plains regions. The timing of unroofing and uplift is key to differentiating between mechanisms, but also remains debated. Here I show that low-temperature thermochronometric data from Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas support regional Oligocene surface uplift as well as multiple lithospheric modification events during the Cenozoic. A suite of samples from the southern Sangre de Cristo Range of northern New Mexico allows us to identify distinct signals of Laramide, mid-Tertiary, and middle Miocene cooling, and highlights the significance of climate-driven middle Miocene exhumation in shaping {{the landscape of the}} western High Plains. A transect of High Plains surface samples east of this location shows that a previously identified early Oligocene thermal anomaly extended eastward more than 300 km from the Cordilleran front into the Texas Panhandle, and also indicates westward-deepening Oligocene erosion. Additional High Plains samples from mid-Tertiary intrusions reveal substantial erosion on the southern High Plains synchronous with peak ignimbrite volcanism. Together these data suggest a gradient in early Cenozoic lithospheric hydration across the High Plains that corresponds to the elevation gradient, along with additional lithospheric modification after slab roll-back and regional surface uplift during the Oligocene. Much of the southern High Plains surface is limestone, in which an absence of crystalline apatites limits the extent to which low-temperature thermochronometric techniques can be applied. To address this problem, I investigated the systematics of the conodont apatite (UTh) / He (CAHe) thermochronometer. CAHe dates from the Illinois Basin indicate that temperatures ≤ 90 °C caused He loss in conodonts over geologic timescales, and thus imply that the CAHe closure temperature {{is similar to that of}} <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite.</b> CAHe dates from limestones in both the Illinois Basin and the southern Sangres are highly dispersed, display negative date-eU correlations, and are older than crystalline AHe dates from the same area.

40|$|AbstractStable (C and O) isotope {{data from}} carbonates {{are one of}} the most {{important}} methods used to infer genetic processes in carbonatites. However despite their ubiquitous use in geological studies, it is suspected that carbonates are susceptible to dissolution-reprecipitation and isotopic resetting, especially in shallow intrusions, and may not be the best records of either igneous or hydrothermal processes. Apatite, however, should be much less susceptible to these resetting problems but has not been used for O isotope analysis. In this contribution, a novel bulk-carbonatite method for the analysis of O isotopes in the apatite PO 4 site demonstrates a more robust record of stable isotope values. Analyses of apatite from five carbonatites with magmatic textures establishes a preliminary Primary <b>Igneous</b> <b>Apatite</b> (PIA) field of δ 18 O=+ 2. 5 to + 6. 0 ‰ (VSMOW), comparable to Primary Igneous Carbonatite (PIC) compositions from carbonates. Carbonate and apatite stable isotope data are compared in 10 carbonatite samples from Songwe Hill, Malawi. Apatite is heavy rare earth element (HREE) enriched at Songwe and, therefore, oxygen isotope analyses of this mineral are ideal for understanding HREE-related mineralisation in carbonatites. Carbonate C and O isotope ratios show a general trend, from early to late in the evolution, towards higher δ 18 O values (+ 7. 8 to + 26. 7 ‰, VSMOW), with a slight increase in δ 13 C (− 4. 6 to − 0. 1 ‰, VPDB). Oxygen isotope ratios from apatite show a contrary trend, decreasing from a PIA field towards more negative values (+ 2. 5 to − 0. 7 ‰, VSMOW). The contrasting results are interpreted as the product of the different minerals recording fluid interaction at different temperatures and compositions. Modelling indicates the possibility of both a CO 2 rich fluid and mixing between meteoric and deuteric waters. A model is proposed where brecciation leads to depressurisation and rapid apatite precipitation. Subsequently, a convection cell develops from a carbonatite, interacting with surrounding meteoric water.

40|$|The stable-isotope {{geochemistry}} of sulfate minerals {{that form}} principally in I-type igneous rocks {{and in the}} various related hydrothermal systems that develop from their magmas and evolved fluids is reviewed {{with respect to the}} degree of approach to isotope equilibrium between minerals and their parental aqueous species. Examples illustrate classical stable-isotope systematics and principles of interpretation in terms of fundamental processes that occur in these systems to produce (1) sulfate in <b>igneous</b> <b>apatite,</b> (2) igneous anhydrite, (3) anhydrite in porphyry-type deposits, (4) magmatic-hydrothermal alunite and closely related barites in high-sulfidation mineral deposits, (5) coarse-banded alunite in magmatic-steam systems, (6) alunite and jarosite in steam-heated systems, (7) barite in low-sulfidation systems, (8) all of the above minerals, as well as soluble Al and Fe hydroxysulfates, in the shallow levels and surface of active stratovolcanoes. Although exceptions are easily recognized, frequently, the sulfur in these systems is derived from magmas that evolve fluids with high H 2 S/SO 2. In such cases, the δ 34 S values of the igneous and hydrothermal sulfides vary much less than those of sulfate minerals that precipitate from magmas and from their evolved fluids as they interact with igneous host rocks, meteoric water, oxygen in the atmosphere, and bacteria in surface waters. Hydrogen isotopic equilibrium between alunite and water and jarosite and water is always initially attained, thus permitting reconstruction of fluid history and paleoclimates. However, complications may arise in interpretation of δD values of magmatichydrothermal alunite in high-sulfidation gold deposits because later fluids may effect a postdepositional retrograde hydrogen– isotope exchange in the OH site of the alunite. This retrograde exchange also affects the reliability of the SO 4 –OH oxygen– isotope fractionations in alunite for use as a geothermometer in this environment. In contrast, retrograde exchange with later fluids is not significant in the lower temperature steam-heated environment, for which SO 4 –OH oxygen–isotope fractionations in alunite and jarosite can be an excellent geothermometer. Sulfur isotopic disequilibrium between coexisting (but noncontemporaneous) igneous anhydrite and sulfide may occur because of loss of fluid, assimilation of country-rock sulfur during crystallization of these minerals from a magma, disequilibrium effects related to reactions between sulfur species during fluid exsolution from magma, or because of retrograde isotope exchange in the sulfides. Anhydrite and coexisting sulfide from porphyry deposits commonly closely approach sulfur–isotope equilibrium, as is indicated by the general agreement of sulfur– isotope and filling temperatures (315 to 730 °C) in quartz.

Fragmental quartz occur in the samples and is primary to later forming alteration minerals. Amphiboleis also considered to be primary, but can also been formed during regional metamorphism.
