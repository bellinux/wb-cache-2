50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing {{spiral bevel gears}} {{instead of the usual}} single set. The differential gears are part of the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of parallel indexing cam profile {{was described in}} detail with the calculation of the cam profile data. With VB as the software platform, the parallel indexing cam contour was calculated, the contour mapping was also displayed, and the data was saved as required format. Then a three-dimensional entity of the parallel indexing cam mechanism is drawn up directly in SolidWorks in order to perform the 3 D parameterization design and motion emulation of the parallel indexing cam mechanism. This can help designers to find the problems, such as the rotation difficulties caused by excessive pressure angle, the motion distortion caused by small radius of curvature. So the designer can make modification in time to improve design quality and shorten the product development cycles. The software platform can select type of the interval splitter by calculating and selecting the power motor according to the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> angle and the output shaft such shares. The system could perform the transmission of information and share the information between subsystems, enhancing the degree of integration and automation of parallel indexing cam design and manufacture. A good software platform was developed for parallel indexing cam mechanism’s design, manufacturing and performance studying. Finally, the example of interval paper-feed mechanism in an automatic die-cutting machine was verified the usability and effectiveness of the software platform...|$|E
