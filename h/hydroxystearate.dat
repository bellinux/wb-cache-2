40|$|Oxygen {{can react}} with organic {{substrates}} (RH) to yield hydroperoxides, which {{in many instances}} are the first products of oxidation to be analytically isolated. A study {{of the structure of}} hydroperoxides could elucidate the reaction mechanisms activated during the first steps of oxidation processes. The simplest structural model used in the study of oxidation mechanisms of fats is methyl oleate. In this work the structures of methyl oleate hydroperoxides (MOHPs) were determined by gas chromatography-ion-trap detector mass spectrometry (GC-ITD-MS) of the corresponding <b>hydroxystearates</b> (MSHs). The hydroperoxides were reduced to methyl hydroxyoctadecenoates (MOHs), which were separated into the cis and trans fractions by argentation thin-layer chromatography. By hydrogenation of the double bond the cis- and trans-MOHs were reduced to MSHs for GC-ITD-MS analysis. Methods to isolate and determine the positional isomers of MOHPs were tested. The analytical techniques used were preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and GC-ITD-MS, solid-phase extraction-GC-ITD-MS and direct GC-ITD-MS...|$|R

While the R. rhodochrous ATCC 12674 -mediated hydration of oleic acid gave mixtures of enantiomers 10 (R) -hydroxystearic acid and 10 (S) -hydroxystearic acid, Pseudomonas species strain NRRL-B- 3266 produced optically pure 10 (R) -hydroxystearic acid.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} determination of kolliphor HS 15 and miglyol 812 in microemulsion formulation was developed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography {{coupled with a}} nano quantitation analytical detector (UHPLC–NQAD). All components in kolliphor HS 15 and miglyol 812 were well separated on an Acquity BEH C 18 column. Mobile phase A was 0. 1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. A gradient elution sequence was programed initially with 60 % organic solvent, slowly increased to 100 % within 8  min. The flow rate was 0. 7  mL/min. Good linearity (r> 0. 95) was obtained {{in the range of}} 27. 6 – 1381. 1  μg/mL for polyoxyl 15 <b>hydroxystearate</b> in kolliphor HS 15, 0. 8 – 202. 0  μg/mL for caprylic acid triglyceride and 2. 7 – 221. 9  μg/mL for capric acid triglyceride in miglyol 812. The relative standard deviations (RSD) ranged from 0. 6 % to 1. 7 % for intra-day precision and from 0. 4 % to 2. 7 % for inter-day precision. The overall recoveries (accuracy) were 99. 7 %– 101. 4 % for polyoxyl 15 <b>hydroxystearate</b> in kolliphor HS 15, 96. 7 %– 99. 6 % for caprylic acid triglyceride, and 94. 1 %– 103. 3 % for capric acid triglyceride in miglyol 812. Quantification limits (QL) were determined as 27. 6  μg/mL for polyoxyl 15 <b>hydroxystearate</b> in kolliphor HS 15, 0. 8  μg/mL for caprylic acid triglyceride, and 2. 7  μg/mL for capric acid triglyceride in miglyol 812. No interferences were observed in the retention time ranges of kolliphor HS 15 and miglyol 812. The method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, QL, and robustness. The proposed method has been applied to microemulsion formulation analyses with good recoveries (82. 2 %– 103. 4 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a series that {{examines}} grease lu-brication mechanisms and failure in rolling element bearings. The aim of the work {{was to understand the}} grease condition changes during use and the relationship to lubrication perfor-mance and failure. R 0 F bearing tests were carried out with two lithium <b>hydroxystearate</b> greases and the effects of the temper-ature, the speed, and the additive package on lubrication life was studied. Post-test, one pair of bearings (fail and non-fail) was dismantled and grease distribution and condition assessed. IR spectroscopy was then used to determine the lubricant com-position and the oxidation level of the grease remaining on the shields, the inner raceway, and the cage pockets. The additive package increased the grease life by 100 - 700 % depending on the test condition. Most of the grease remaining in the bearing was found on the shields, with only trace amount...|$|E
40|$|Radioactive 2 -hydroxystearic and cerebronic acids were {{converted}} to the coensyme A thio esters, then tested for reactivity with n-sphingosine. Microsomes from mouse brain were found to catalyze the formation of ceramides containing both hydroxy acids. Both the D- and L-forms of the hydroxy acids reacted. Comparisons of reac-tivity were made with stearoyl and lignoceroyl CoA, the analogous nonhydroxy acids, which also form ceramides. The ratios of activities of the substrates were found to vary with animal age, with various subcellular fractions, with different rat brain cell preparations, and with different mouse organs. Competition experiments with mixtures of thio ester substrates showed that stearate and lignocerate did not interfere {{with each other in}} the formation of ceramide, but hydroxystearoyl CoA inhibited the utilization of the two nonhydroxy substrates and cerebronoyl CoA inhibited the utilization of lignoceroyl CoA. The kinetics of the inhibitions indicated that the effects were noncompetitive. A similar type of inhibition was seen with stearoyl CoA against <b>hydroxystearate</b> incorporation, On the basis of these findings, we suggest that four different enzymes are involved in the acyl transfer reaction: fo...|$|E
40|$|Resting {{cells of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast, type II; Sigma) {{were used to}} convert oleic acid into 10 -hydroxyoctadecanoic acid with a 45 % yield. Nocardia aurantia (ATCC 12674), Nocardia sp. (NRRL 5646), and Mycobacterium fortuitum (UI 53378) all {{converted}} oleic acid into 10 -oxo-octadecanoic acid with 65, 55, and 80 % yields, respectively. Structures of all metabolites were suggested by 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance and by infrared and mass spectrometry. Structures of isomeric <b>hydroxystearate</b> and oxostearate derivatives and the stereochemical purity of hydroxystearates are difficult to prove unambiguously unless authentic standard compounds are available for spectral comparison. We describe {{the use of the}} chemical Baeyer-Villiger oxidation technique with 10 -oxo-octadecanoic acid followed by mass spectral analysis of neutral extracts as a simple method to confirm the position of oxo-functional groups in the structures of fatty acid ketones. We further introduce a simple method based on 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of diastereomeric S-(+) -O-acetylmandelate esters of hydroxystearates as a means of ascertaining stereochemical purities of hydroxy fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|Aim {{of present}} study was to develop a solid nanoemulsion preconcentrate of {{paclitaxel}} (PAC) using oil [propylene glycol monocaprylate/glycerol monooleate, 4 [*]:[*] 1 [*]w/w], surfactant [polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate/polyoxyl 15 <b>hydroxystearate,</b> 1 [*]:[*] 1 [*]w/w], and cosurfactant [diethylene glycol monoethyl ether/polyethylene glycol 300, 1 [*]:[*] 1 [*]w/w] to form stable nanocarrier. The prepared formulation was characterized for droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to assess surface morphology and drug encapsulation and its integrity. Cumulative drug release of prepared formulation through dialysis bag and permeability coefficient through everted gut sac were found to be remarkably higher than the pure drug suspension and commercial intravenous product (Intaxel), respectively. Solid nanoemulsion preconcentrate of PAC exhibited strong inhibitory effect on proliferation of MCF- 7 cells in MTT assay. In vivo systemic exposure of prepared formulation through oral administration was comparable to that of Intaxel in γ scintigraphy imaging. Our findings suggest that the prepared solid nanoemulsion preconcentrate can be used as an effective oral solid dosage form to improve dissolution and bioavailability of PAC...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Recently, {{epoxides}} {{have received}} increased attention {{because they are}} of interest both as end-products and as chemical intermediates; epoxidized oils, mainly High Oleic Sunflower Oil, and their ester derivatives have thus found important applications as plasticizers and additives for polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Epoxidized esters have been produced classically from High Oleic Sunflower Methyl Esters (HOSME) using H 2 O 2 and formic acid. The epoxidation reaches 90 % on pilot scale (5 kg). Epoxidized esters produced from HOSME have respectively hydroxyl values of 0, oxirane values of 5. 2 / 4. 5 and iodine values of 1. 7 / 1. 5. Cleavage trials of the oxirane group of the epoxidized esters with different reactants have been undertaken {{in order to produce}} on pilot scale new derivatives to be characterized and tested in different fields of application (lubrication, detergency and as chemical intermediates). Reaction of Epoxy-HOSME with an excess of oleic acid was conducted under atmospheric pressure without any catalyst and solvent. The oxirane opening leads to complete estolide formation: after neutralization, analytical controls (chemical values, GC and HPLC analysis) indicate that the estolides are composed of a mixture of C 36 (oleate of methyl <b>hydroxystearate)</b> and C 54 (di-oleate of methyl dihydroxystearate).

40|$|Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) are {{biomimetic}} nanocarriers {{used for}} the encapsulation of a broad variety of active ingredients. Similar to surface active compounds, LNCs contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in their structure. Moreover, the components of LNCs, macrogol 15 <b>hydroxystearate</b> (MHS) and lecithin, {{are known for their}} surface active properties. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to investigate the capability of the LNCs to decrease surface tension using two techniques: drop tensiometry and the Wilhelmy plate method. LNCs with diameters ranging from 30 to 100 nm were successfully obtained using a phase inversion technique. The LNCs 2 ̆ 7 properties, such as size and zeta potential, depend on the composition. LNCs exhibit a lower limiting surface tension compared to MHS (34. 8 - 35. 0 mN/m and 37. 7 - 38. 8 mN/m, respectively), as confirmed by both drop tensiometry and the Wilhelmy plate method. LNCs have exhibited a saturated interfacial concentration (SIC) that was 10 -fold higher than the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of MHS or the SIC of binary and ternary mixtures of LNC ingredients. The SIC of the LNC formulations depended on the mass mixing ratio of the MHS/triglycerides but not on the presence of lecithin. The CMC/SIC values measured by the Wilhelmy plate method were higher than those obtained using drop tensiometry because of the longer duration of the tensiometry measurement. In conclusion, the surfactant-like properties of the LNCs offer new possibilities for medical and pharmaceutical applications...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) are a {{new generation}} of biomimetic nanocarriers obtained via a phase inversion temperature method and have an oily core of medium-chain triglycerides that is surrounded by a shelf containing a lipophilic surfactant (lecithin) and a hydrophilic surfactant macrogol 15 -hydroxystearate. The aim {{of the present study was}} to produce LNCs with antibacterial activity by replacing lecithin with other lipophilic surface active compounds, namely medium-chain fatty acids and their 1 -monoglycerides, which are known to have antimicrobial properties. Fatty acids and monoglycerides were found to affect the properties of LNCs, such as particle size and zeta potential. Incorporation of a co-surfactant decreased significantly particle size (p⩽ 0. 0039). Furthermore, incorporation of either lecithin or fatty acids with at least 10 carbon atoms yielded LNCs with the zeta potential significantly more negative than that of LNCs composed solely of triglycerides and macrogol 15 <b>hydroxystearate</b> (p⩽ 0. 0310). Moreover, they were capable of decreasing the phase inversion temperature. The activity of the LCNs against Gram-positive S. aureus, including a methicillin-resistant strain, increased with increases in the length of the hydrocarbon tail. Monoglyceride-LNCs were found to be more active than the corresponding fatty acids. The opposite behaviour was observed for Gram-negative bacteria, whereby only caproic acid- and caprylic acid-LNCs were found to be active against these organisms. The monoglyceride-LNCs were bactericidal, and they killed in a time-dependent manner. Fatty acid-LNCs killed in a concentration-dependent manner. A haemolysis assay was performed to obtain preliminary information on the safety of the tested LNCs. In the case of fatty acid-LNCs, the concentrations at which bacterial growth was inhibited were similar to the haemolytic concentrations. However, monoglyceride-LNCs showed antibacterial action at concentrations much lower than those at which haemolysis was observed. In conclusion, monoglyceride-LNCs are promising candidates as carriers for the encapsulation of antibacterial agents, particularly against S. aureus. </p...|$|E
