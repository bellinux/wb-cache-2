5|$|Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's {{name is not}} {{recorded}} {{in any of the}} early inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E
5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of the Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of the societies and advent of modernity. As {{the number of}} people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

John lost the Duchy of Normandy to King Philip II of France, {{resulting}} in the collapse of most of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the Capetian dynasty during the 13th century.

5|$|Mecoptera {{have special}} {{importance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of the insects. Two {{of the most}} important insect orders, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of horses}} in World War I marked a {{transitional}} period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> of armed conflict. Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive {{elements of a}} military force, but {{over the course of}} the war, the vulnerability of horses to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of tanks, which would ultimately replace cavalry in shock tactics. While the perceived value of the horse in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.|$|E
