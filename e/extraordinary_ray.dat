25|$|When {{the light}} propagates either along or {{orthogonal}} to the optic axis, such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations {{see the same}} effective refractive index, {{so there is no}} <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray.</b> In the second case the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray</b> propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ne) but is not an inhomogeneous wave. A crystal with its optic axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a waveplate, {{in which there is no}} distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For instance, a quarter-wave plate is commonly used to create circular polarization from a linearly polarized source.|$|E
25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray,</b> as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray,</b> to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in second-harmonic generation and other nonlinear optical components, as the crystals used for this purpose are almost always birefringent.

50|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} Canada balsam {{is in the}} construction of the Nicol prism. A Nicol prism consists of a calcite crystal cut into two halves. Canada balsam is placed between the two layers. Calcite is an anisotropic crystal and has different refractive indices for rays polarized along directions parallel and perpendicular to its optic axis. These rays with differing refractive indices are known as the ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>rays.</b> The refractive index for Canada balsam is in between the refractive index for the ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>rays.</b> Hence the ordinary ray will be totally internally reflected. The emergent ray will be linearly polarized, and traditionally this has been one of the popular ways of producing polarized light.|$|R

In this letter, based on Huygen's construction, the refractive indices and effective optical admittances of the forward and backward propagating <b>extraordinary</b> <b>rays</b> are discussed further, and the 2 x 2 characteristic matrix is simplified. Furthermore, the input optical admittance, reflectance and transmittance of assembly is presented, just as an isotropic thin film.

25|$|In a {{birefringent}} material, a wave {{consists of}} two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure {{at the top of}} the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with s polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray)</b> is the slow ray in this case.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of birefringence {{is described}} as uniaxial, meaning {{that there is a}} single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behavior. This special direction is known as the optic axis of the material. Light whose polarization is perpendicular to the optic axis is governed by a refractive index no (for [...] "ordinary"). Light whose polarization is {{in the direction of the}} optic axis sees an optical index ne (for [...] "extraordinary"). For any ray direction there is a linear polarization direction perpendicular to the optic axis, and this is called an ordinary ray.

2500|$|The {{different}} angles of refraction {{for the two}} polarization components are shown in the figure {{at the top of}} the page, with the optic axis along the surface (and perpendicular to the plane of incidence), so that the angle of refraction is different for the p polarization (the [...] "ordinary ray" [...] in this case, having its polarization perpendicular to the optic axis) and the s polarization (the [...] "extraordinary ray" [...] with a polarization component along the optic axis). In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs in cases where the optic axis is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to it); in this case the electric polarization of the birefringent material is not exactly in the direction of the wave's electric field for the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray.</b> The direction of power flow (given by the Poynting vector) for this inhomogenous wave is at a finite angle from the direction of the wave vector resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case of normal incidence, where the angle of refraction is zero (according to Snell's law, regardless of effective index of refraction), the energy of the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>ray</b> may be propagated at an angle. This is commonly observed using a piece of calcite cut appropriately with respect to its optic axis, placed above a paper with writing, as in the above two photographs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{refractive}} index {{varies with the}} direction of propagation of the light, and varies between 1.64 and 1.75. This is quite high, between topaz and ruby. Lavendulan is biaxial (-), and most sources quote values for three refractive indices, for light travelling parallel to the three crystal axes. One source, however, gives lavendulan as nearly uniaxial (-), and quotes only two refractive indices, for the ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In a {{uniaxial}} material, one ray behaves {{according to}} the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface.

25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>rays</b> generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|R

The Joets-Ribotta metric governing propagation of the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>rays</b> is invariant under the simply transitive action of the universal cover Ẽ(2) of the three dimensional Euclidean group of two dimensions. Thus <b>extraordinary</b> light <b>rays</b> are geodesics of a left-invariant metric on this Bianchi type V II 0 group. We are able to solve by separation of variables both the wave equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for this metric. The former reduces to Mathieu’s equation and the later to the quadrantal pendulum equation. We discuss Maxwell’s equations for uniaxial optical materials where the configuration is invariant under a group action and develop a formalism {{to take advantage of}} these symmetries. The material is not assumed to be impedance matched, thus going beyond the usual scope of transformation optics. We show that for a chiral nematic in its helical phase Maxwell’s equations reduce to a generalised Mathieu equation. Our results may also be relevant to helical phases of some magnetic materials and to light propagation in certain cosmological models. ...|$|R
