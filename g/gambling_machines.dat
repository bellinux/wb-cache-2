In return, the state conceded to allowing the operation of a 24-hour bingo hall and casino by the tribe. Former Arizona Attorney General Jack LaSota criticized the decision at the time, due to Arizona's state laws against gambling. Symington later signed legislation in 1993 that reversed this decision, however, outlawing gambling and casinos, including for fundraising purposes for churches and charities. Also in November 1992, Symington was a supporter of a ballot proposal that reinstated Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in Arizona.

Desired properties for probabilistic statecharts {{are expressed in}} the probabilistic logic PCTL, and verified using the model checker Prism. The extension simplifies the verification of critical systems with probabilistic elements, e. g. fault-tolerant systems. The extension is illustrated using a case study: a <b>gambling</b> <b>machine.</b> The theory behind this extension is explained in detail in a paper published recently [9]; this article concentrates on the case study. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{documents}} {{a history}} of the NSW club industry, with particular emphasis on its evolution to a major contemporary operator of gaming machines at state, national and international levels. It argues that three conditions of club registration-their not-for-profit status, membership requirements, and social benefit objectives-have been instrumental for clubs in gaining and maintaining dominant rights to <b>machine</b> <b>gambling</b> in NSW. These three features of clubs traditionally have underpinned their legitimacy as major providers of <b>machine</b> <b>gambling,</b> reflecting prevailing government policy that linked legalised gambling to social benefit. However, the substantial revenues that accrued from <b>machine</b> <b>gambling,</b> amidst an absence of competition, fuelled an expansion of the club sector that was neither predicted nor planned, with many clubs growing dramatically in assets, membership and facilities. The original club goals of promoting and pursuing the social purpose and community benefit for which they were established became superseded by an emphasis on expansion, market share, and profits. More recently, increased competition for the gambling dollar, reflecting a shift in government policy towards economically driven stimulation and expansion of commercial gambling, has further entrenched the commercialisation of clubs in their <b>machine</b> <b>gambling</b> operations, subordinating their social agenda to economic interests. This change in focus by club management has diminished the social contract that exists for clubs to operate gambling for community benefit, the very basis of the clubs 2 ̆ 7 legitimacy as major providers of <b>machine</b> <b>gambling.</b> Indeed, the implicit assumption that social benefit was built into club <b>machine</b> <b>gambling</b> has allowed the clubs to exploit their position of market dominance in a way that exacerbates the negative social impacts of their core product...|$|R
