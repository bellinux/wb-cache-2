40|$|The {{renewal of}} the {{forestry}} codes of {{the countries of the}} Congo Basin in the 90 's has legalized management plans for forest concessions. These plans intend, among other objectives, to ensure the sustainable exploitation of commercial species. Sustainability is assessed using the stock recovery rate, which is defined in national directives as the ratio of the exploitable timber stock {{at the end of a}} <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> over the exploitable timber stock at the beginning of this cycle. Computing this rate requires forecasting the temporal development of each species during a <b>felling</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is usually achieved using the so-called “stock recovery formula”. This paper shows that this formula corresponds to a Leslie model, and then proposes a generalization as a Usher matrix model. Using the data from the M'Baïki experimental plots in the Central African Republic, the stock recovery rate for sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum, Meliaceæ), a major timber species in Central Africa, was estimated. The estimate was completed by its confidence interval using bootstrap methods. Although 225 observations were available for sapelli, the stock recovery rate was estimated with no more than an accuracy of about 45 % at confidence level 95 %. This did not permit to conclude whether the asymptotic stock recovery rate was greater or less than one. This suggested that much more observations than usually acknowledged are required to estimate the stock recovery rate with an acceptable accuracy. Different logging scenarios were finally tested to assess the impact of management parameters on the stock recovery rate of sapelli...|$|E

In this study we use dendrochronology to analyze wood growth patterns of Tabebuia barbata and Vatairea guianensis, two tree species occurring in nutrient-rich white-water (várzea, Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, MSDR) and nutrient-poor black-water (igapó, Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve, ASDR) floodplain forests of Central Amazonia. From 20 trees per species and floodplain system (total of 80 trees) growing under a similar flooding regime with a mean inundation height of about 4 m we measured diameter at breast height (dbh). We sampled two cores per tree with an increment corer {{at the height of}} dbh to determine wood density (WD), tree age and mean radial increment (MRI) rates. The wood samples were macroscopically analyzed. Both tree species show distinct annual tree rings characterized by marginal parenchyma tissues. MRI was measured by a digital measuring device and WD was determined by the ratio dry mass/fresh volume. MRI of both tree species was significantly higher in the várzea than in the igapó, which {{can be traced back to}} the contrasting nutrient status. WD showed no difference comparing both floodplain forest types. Tree ages of a species for the same diameter are more than twofold higher in the igapó than in the várzea.

Sixty tree with a diameter at breat height from 50 to 160 cm were selected at a sample from the stands in north and central Pulau Laut. From the investigation the following conclusions are in order : The logging waste in the natural dipterocarp forest of Pulau Laut is 20 percent, with a standard error of 1, 4 percent. Exploitation factor in the Pulau Laut natural dipterocarp forest ranges from 76, 8 to 82, 4 percent, averaging 80 percent. The volumes of the trees obtained by estimating the diameters at breast height and the heights of the clear boles are consistanly smaller than those obtained by measuring the dimateres and lengths of the clear boles after the trees were cut especially in hilly forests. Both diameter and clear bole length have significant effect on exploitation factor, their relationship being quadratic. Optimum diameter for highest yield is approximately 77 cm.

40|$|Species {{composition}} and diversity in logged and unlogged forests were assesed {{to understand the}} regeneration of the residual stand twenty years after logging in Kudremukh National Park, South India. Relative density, frequency and basal area were measured by Point Centered Quarter method to calculate the diversity and stand quality. The logged forest harbored lower stem density of mature trees (508 ha- 1) than unlogged ones (630 ha- 1). Indeed, logging operations increased the species diversity in the regenerative phase (seedling phase) due {{to the creation of}} larger canopy gaps. The extra radiation reaching the ground, facilitated the colonization of early and late secondary species. Ramakrishanan Index of Stand Quality (RISQ) values in logged forest was higher in comparison with unlogged forest, indicating the dominance of early and late secondary species, especially at sapling phase. The light demanding secondary forest species contribute higher percentage to the overall tree population in logged forest.

Detailed time studies were conducted on manual felling and uphill skyline yarding with small or mid-size yarders. Separate regression equations were developed to predict delay-free <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> time and delay-free yarding cycle time at each site. The three silvicultural treatments had no consistent influence on production rates and costs, because the initial stocking levels varied among treatments and the volume harvested did not necessarily correspond to the silvicultural treatment. Cost differences within sites, where operational methods were uniform, were small. Cost differences among sites for each activity, such as felling or yarding, were larger because of differences in operational methods.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the charcoal potential of the Miombo woodlands of Kitungalo area, near Morogoro, Tanzania. Systematic sampling design used in an inventory in 1996 was repeated in 1999 {{in order to determine}} the general current stand parameters and forest change. A total of 46 sample plots were land out in the forest reserve. In adjacent public lands stratified random sampling was applied where a total of 30 plots were laid out. The layout was meant to study how species richness and wood stocking vary in public lands and forest reserve. Preferred tree species for charcoal making had standing wood volume of 24. 5 m’ ha - 1 and 56. 5 m' ha - 1 in public lands and reserved forest respectively with corresponding basal area of 3. 7 m 2 ha - 1 and 7. 2 m 2 ha - 1. Stem numbers were 909 stems ha - 1 in public lands and 354 stems ha - 1 in the reserved forest. These values indicated more regeneration in public lands following disturbance than in the forest reserve. The weight of charcoal that can be extracted from the woodland at the road side was 56 kg, equivalent to only one bag of charcoal per hectare. Similarly 54 bags may be extracted at 5 km distance while 125 bags may be extracted from beyond 10 km from the highway. With the established stand growth rate of 2. 3 rrr' ha - 1 year - 1 for the re-growth of Miombo woodland at Kitulangalo, it will take about 8 to 15 years for the degraded woodlands to recover for charcoal production.

40|$|The {{critically}} endangered western {{lowland gorilla}} (WLG) disperses {{the seeds of}} many fruits. These seeds are often deposited at gorilla nest sites, in open-canopy habitats favorable for seedling growth and recruitment. However, considering anthropogenic disturbances, such as logging, gorillas and the directed seed dispersal services they provide are at risk. On the other hand, sustainably managed logging concessions are reported to harbor viable gorilla populations. If WLG provide effective dispersal of timber species, it would be of benefit to loggers for these ecological services to be preserved. In order to explore such interactions between the WLG and the timber industry, we (1) assessed {{the status of a}} WLG population in a logging concession, and (2) investigated their seed dispersal effectiveness for timber species. We inferred the long-term viability of a gorilla population in a Gabonese logged forest, and the short-term impact of timber harvesting on this population. Gorilla density was estimated through three successive censuses: (1) 25 years after the first <b>felling</b> <b>cycle,</b> (2) six months and (3) one year after the second <b>felling</b> <b>cycle.</b> Seed dispersal effectiveness for timber species was estimated through gorilla fecal analysis and germination trials in a nursery. The results suggested that a viable population of WLG could be maintained in selectively logged forests (< 2 cut trees ha- 1). Indeed, although gorillas tend to flee areas being actively exploited for timber, their densities in logged forests can regain their initial levels, or even a higher one, within one year post-logging. Over a period of 20 months, the seeds of 59 plant species were found in gorilla feces. Nearly 20 % of the identified species (N= 35) are of economic value because of their exploitation for timber. Analyzed fecal units contained on average 81. 0 ± 107. 8 intact seeds (0 - 566). Specific germination success varied from 0 to 100 %, with an average of 46 ± 36 %. Sustainably-managed logging concessions may host viable populations of WLG. Considering the seed dispersal services provided for timber species and the unique directed-dispersal to open-canopy habitats, gorillas are implicated in the regeneration and maintenance of logged forests. Therefore, the generalization of sustainable logging would be beneficial both to the economical and the environmental value of tropical forests, thus providing an incentive for loggers and governments to prevent illegal hunting in concessions...|$|E
40|$|The Bolivian {{forestry}} {{law requires that}} 10 per cent of areas under forest management must be set aside as 'ecological reserves', serving as protected areas from resource extraction. These guidelines appear to be based largely on reserve design theory from the conservation biology literature including recommendations for large, contiguous blocks of reserves interconnected with other protected areas through corridor networks. Such recommendations, however, are largely applicable to protected areas that are embedded within fragmented landscapes or where there is significant threat of deforestation. In contrast, protected areas within managed forests in Bolivia are surrounded by areas of largely intact forest subjected to low-intensity reduced impact logging and where logging occurs with a <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> not less than 20 years. Following {{an analysis of the}} current Bolivian law, conservation goals, and pertinent literature, we argue that issues of size and connectivity are perhaps less important within landscapes dominated by areas under forest management for timber production compared to protected areas imbedded within fragmented landscapes.

The study of motor-manual tree felling {{was carried out in}} two compartments in the Namkhaneh district of Kheyrud Forest. The objects of this study were as follows: time study of tree felling operations, estimate of chainsaw productivity and costs, development of a regression model in uneven-aged stand using single-tree selection methods. The factors affecting total felling time regression model (increasing order of importance) were DBH of harvested trees, direction of felling regarding the lay and inter-tree distance. The hourly production of chainsaw felling with and without delay time was 56. 4 cubic meters per hour (13 tree/hour) and 80. 7 cubic meters per hour (19 tree/hour), respectively. Productivity of chainsaw felling increased in relation to tree DBH as power relation. The cost of chainsaw felling with and without delay time was 0. 55 and 0. 39 USD/m 3, respectively. The cost of felling increased as simple exponential equation when DBH of harvested trees decreased. However, the unit felling cost for chainsaw operation decreased as the tree size increased.

40|$|Bangladesh faces two {{mangrove}} management challenges: {{the first}} is the management of the resources of the Sundarbans natural mangrove areas on a sustainable basis, while protecting the high levels of biodiversity. The second challenge is to manage the planted mangroves of the Bangladeshi shoreline under competing, and sometimes conflicting, management objectives and expectations. Management of the Sundarbans has been based on selective <b>felling,</b> with <b>felling</b> <b>cycles</b> and minimal DBHs adjusted for each of the main commercial species. The allowable annual cut is determined by ongoing forest inventories to ensure harvesting is equal or lower than the growth and reproduction rate. However, despite the adoption of sustainable yield, some degradation of the mangroves is occurring, the primary causes being human interference (e. g. illegal harvesting and pollution) and changed hydroedaphic conditions (e. g. erosion and accretion, and increased soil salinity due to water abstraction). The protection from cyclone damage afforded by the Sundarbans mangrove forests, led the Forestry Department in 1966 to commence a programme of planting mangroves outside the protective coastal embankments in order to provide greater protection for the other coastal areas. Harvestable size is reached in 15 – 25 years, but prior to harvest, a new crop must be established, so that coastal lands are not unvegetated and liable to erosion. The mangrove greenbelt has brought many obvious benefits, but despite these benefits, there are problems which are not silvicultural, but result from population pressure; illicit felling of trees and unlawful grazing of coastal lands, threaten the mangroves and the encroachment in some areas by shrimp farms comprises a major concern. The protective benefits from the sustainable management of natural and planted mangroves in Bangladesh are beyond dispute – the minimal damage suffered by the coastal areas from the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 Dec 2004 can be ascribed simply to the good condition of the natural and planted mangrove greenbelt of that country. When viewed together with the benefits that mangrove habitats bring to biodiversity conservation, it would seem to be obvious that mangrove greenbelts should be actively promoted.

The model has been suggested as a means of determining the harvest that is sustainable in the sense of maintaining the present forest structure, and uses as inputs the size structure and estimates of size-specific radial growth rate. The model contains a bias because the equations for transition coefficients in the projection matrix assume an inappropriate geometric model for stage duration. The effect is to overestimate population growth by about 22 % over a 15 year <b>felling</b> <b>cycle.</b> Alternative formulae are given for a more realistic model of fixed stage duration. The mortality rates needed to maintain the initial size structure of the population may be inferred from recursive formulae that are derived here separately for the geometric and fixed models of stage duration.

The estimate of sapling recruitment number used in the harvest calculations {{does not appear to be}} well-founded. Even assuming that the forest is in a steady state and natural mortality is known, the assumption that harvest mortality substitutes for natural mortality rather than adding to it appears to be unwarranted.

40|$|Knowledge of wood production, and {{particularly}} of diameter increment of trees, {{is central to}} forest management. This {{is one of the}} parameters contributing to determination of the length of the <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> as well as the maximum allowable cut without impoverishment of forest stands. Two techniques can be used to assess diameter increment of trees: analysis of growth rings and periodical measurements of circumference over a given period. The results obtained with several designs, in which trees have been periodically measured for more than ten years (Mopi, Irobo and La Téné in Cote de Ivoire, Mbaiki in Central African Republic and Oyane in Gabon), provide increments for each species. In the same way, several growth ring counts were carried out for species with visible annual growth rings, especially in Cameroon, Central African Republic and Gabon. This report describes the methodology used for growth ring analysis, the application of such analysis for each tree species, as well as a synthesis of the results obtained for the main species exploited in Central and West Africa. The following species are included: Ayous/Samba (Triplochiton sideroxylon), Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), Limba/Fraké (Terminalia superba), Sipo (Entandrophragma utile), Tali (Erythrophleum ivorense), Tiama (Entandrophragma angolensis), Kosipo (Entandrophragma candollei), Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) and Moabi (Baillonella toxisperma). It appears that the mean diameter increment of Meliaceae (Sapelli, Sipo, Kosipo and Tiama - Entandrophragma spp.) and Iroko (Milicia excelsa) is 4 - 5 mm/year. The increment is 2 - 3 mm/year for slow-growing species, such as Bossé clair (Guarea cedrata) and Kotibé (Nesogordonia papaverifera), while mean annual increment of Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) is slightly under 10 mm/year for trees with diameters from 20 to 100 cm...|$|E
40|$|A cohort {{simulation}} model of forest growth and yield in the Solomon Islands is presented. The model takes stand table information of the 12 common big tree species and simulates recruitment, growth and mortality of cohorts through {{time on the}} basis of basal area increment functions and size-specific mortality estimates derived over 1964 - 1994 from permanent sample plots in natural forest on Kolombangara, Solomon Islands. A cohort is defined as a set of trees on the same plot which are deemed sufficiently similar in size and condition to be grouped for the purpose of simulation. Recruitment is modelled in a two-step process involving the calculation of a total number of new recruits to be added to a plot, followed by partitioning this total according to species-specific probability values. Total recruitment and species-specific probability values are derived from empirical data on recruitment of the 12 species onto the Kolombangara plots following a cyclone in 1967. The model allows harvesting to be simulated according to user-defined logging rules and <b>felling</b> <b>cycle.</b> Post-logging mortality is predicted from functions relating mortality of residual stems on the Kolombangara plots to the degree of disturbance caused by the 1967 cyclone, and both harvesting intensity and post-logging mortality are extrapolated forward into the prediction of recruitment after lag periods of 7 and 10. 5 years. The major limitation of the current model is that cohorts are updated according to parameters and functions obtained from plots in natural forest disturbed by a cyclone and not in managed forests disturbed by logging. Therefore we recommend that the model be used a tool for research and not as a guide to forest management. Future research should concentrate on developments of the framework model presented here, and collecting and analysing data from forests logged at known dates. </p...|$|E

Most of the poplar genotypes used correspond to the Populus × euramericana and Populus × interamericana parental groups, the latter of which is considered less site demanding (Soulères 1984). As a rule, the harvest of SRF considers the whole tree, and thus only the leaves of perennial species are harvested (Sochacki et al. 2013). Debarking is not an option for the small diameter shoots harvested in this case, as the usual method of harvesting entails chipping all the aboveground components (san Miguel et al. 2015; Eufrade et al. 2016). For pulp plantations, which are usually <b>felled</b> in <b>cycles</b> longer than 10  years in Spain, intensive management may lead to negative budgets (Merino et al. 2005). Several management options aiming at minimizing negative nutrient budgets in forest plantations have been proposed: removal of only the wood component, leaving the bark in place; management of logging residues to enable reincorporation of the nutrients into the soil (Achat et al. 2015); and modification of soil preparation techniques (Merino et al. 2003; Viera et al. 2016). Other possible management adaptations include re-definition of rotation length (Viera et al. 2015) and the use of genetically improved materials with enhanced nutrient assimilation index (NAI), defined as the amount of biomass produced per unit of nutrient (Sochacki et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|After {{the change}} of the {{forestry}} laws in six Central African countries in the 1990 s, the stock recovery rate-the ratio of the exploitable timber stock {{at the end of}} a <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> over the initial pre-felling stock-has become the standard index to assess timber yield sustainability. The Dimako formula, that is the legal expression of the stock recovery rate, is not necessarily the best estimate of this index. In particular, it accounts for only a limited knowledge on vital rates, it does not always increase with the diameter cutting limit, and it is negatively sensitive to the number of trees above the cutting limit, which may promote heavy initial logging when assessing forest management over several felling cycles. Here, we show that the Dimako formula can be generalised by using a more detailed model of forest dynamics, or a finer description of logging damage, and we demonstrate that an alternative formula has better properties. We used four species with contrasted initial diameter distribution, inventoried in the Dimako forest, eastern Cameroon, to illustrate the behaviour of alternative formula. If an increased level of details had to be incorporated in the Dimako formula, boosted post-logging growth should be considered at first. Because the stock recovery rate results from the combined influence of the initial dbh distribution of the species, which is a history-dependent feature of the population, and of its vital rates, which is an ecological species-specific feature of the population, its interpretation must at least take account of the autecology of the species. Particular caution must be taken when applying the formula to groups of species rather than to single species. The stock recovery rate alone gives a reductionist insight into yield sustainability.

40|$|We analyse {{data from}} 12 {{permanent}} sample plots (PSPs) in Ghana to determine recovery rates of skid trails and gaps in forest logged 10 – 30 years previously. We examine four key indicators of recovery – basal area, mortality rate, diameter increment {{and changes in the}} balance of tree guilds (Pioneer Index) – to compare the forest directly affected by logging (the apparent extraction network, AEN), with adjacent, less damaged forest. Data are presented on gaps created by felling individuals of different species and diameter, with a view to refining existing yield allocation procedures. Our results indicate that forest recovery is slower than predicted by commonly used yield models. The basal area of AEN forest is below 23 m 2 ha− 1 in all 12 plots, even 30 years after logging, and is not obviously increasing. Initially elevated annual mortality rates return to normal rates of less than 2 % after 15 years in the non-AEN forest, and after 22 years in the AEN forest. Diameter increments peak early for pioneers, and increase linearly for shade-bearers across the 10 – 30 year period, but are not translated into gains in basal area. Only in one plot does the Pioneer Index of the AEN approach that of the less disturbed surrounding forest, implying inertia against canopy closure, as pioneers replace pioneers.

40|$|Selective logging {{applied in}} {{tropical}} forests {{is based on}} one universal criterion: a minimum diameter cutting limit for all commercial timber species. Minimum diameter cutting limits in mixed dipterocarp forests of the Malesia region lead to high felling intensities (10 – 20 + trees per hectare). Such extraction rates create massive stand damage (> 50 % of the remaining tree population), which has {{a negative impact on}} the regeneration and growth of many harvested dipterocarp species. As such, the minimum diameter cutting limit approach is seldom compatible with sustainable forest management. Where basic ecological characteristics of the commercial species are considered in timber harvesting prescriptions, mixed dipterocarp forests appear capable of sustained timber yields, habitat conservation, and providing other goods and services. This paper first presents the main silvicultural systems developed in mixed dipterocarp forests of Western Malesia and then reviews current knowledge of dipterocarp biology to finally develop guidelines aimed at improving the ecological sustainability of production forests of Western Malesia. These guidelines, a pragmatic reflection of science and ‘best guess’ judgement, include: (1) integration of reduced-impact logging practices into normal management operations; (2) cutting of eight trees per hectare or less (with a <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> of 40 – 60 years to be determined according to local conditions); (3) defining minimum diameter cutting limits according to the structure, density and diameter at reproduction of target species; (4) avoiding harvesting species with less than one adult tree per hectare (diameter at breast height [dbh] larger and equal to 50 cm over an area of 50 – 100 ha); (5) minimizing the size and connectivity of gaps (< 600 m 2 whenever possible); (6) refraining from treatments such as understorey clearing; and (7) providing explicit protection for key forest species and the ecological processes they perform.

DTP masks the brownish colour characteristic of irradiated meat, and 6 % DTP gives to the hamburger similar redness (a* parameter), independently of the dose of radiation applied. Sensory characteristics were influenced by irradiation, but the higher lycopene concentration (6 g kg- 1) masked these changes sufficiently to assure an acceptable colour and odour in the final product after the storage period. © 2009 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been much public {{discourse}} on homelessness and its impact on health and quality of life. Housing is a major determinant of health and strategies are sought to get people off the streets. For maximum success it is important to first determine accurately the needs of those to be housed. As they live their own situations, their perspectives should be considered to ensure success. This paper discusses the findings from a research study on perspectives of homeless people regarding their experiences of homelessness. The research question was: What supports are needed for homeless people to get off the street? The study discussed is qualitative, descriptive, exploratory. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with homeless individuals in a large Canadian city in 2005, regarding their needs and possible solutions to end homelessness. A thematic analysis was carried out on the data. Findings show that individuals’ experiences of homelessness deeply impact all aspects of their lives. Many barriers prevent the homeless from escaping the streets. The welfare system in place was often perceived as disabling and dehumanizing rather than helpful. Service provisions were frequently inappropriate and therefore unsuccessful. Those homeless for a long time <b>fell</b> into patterned <b>cycles</b> of shelter / street life, temporary employment / unemployment and sometimes temporary housing. Participants described the fragmented services provided as ineffective. They had many suggestions for strategies to avoid or escape homelessness. For service providers a power with rather than power over model of collaborative advocacy is proposed to serve this population more effectively, preserve / restore their dignity and invest resources wisely...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of rare misfire and partial burn cycles in a spray-guided spark-ignited direct-injection optical engine. Spark discharge energy, discharge duration, flame imaging, velocity and equivalence ratio were measured every crank angle degree. Imaging was performed using high-speed 2 -D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser inducted fluorescence (PLIF). The engine was operated near its optimum but produced rare and random partial burn and misfire cycles. Spark energy and spark duration for the partial burn and misfire <b>cycles</b> <b>fell</b> {{within the range}} of those for the well-burned cycles, with a slight bias toward low-energy, short-duration discharges, indicating no abnormal spark discharge events. PIV and PLIF measurements extracted from a 4 mm _ 4 mm region adjacent to and downstream of the spark plug at spark timing revealed that the partial burn and misfire cycles occur under lean mixtures and low velocities, but still {{within the range of}} values for the well-burned cycles. PIV and PLIF images of partial burn and misfire cycles were compared to well-burned cycles, which had similar velocities and equivalence ratios near the spark plug at the onset of spark. Observations of the fuel distribution and flame areas for the partial burns and misfires showed that an early flame kernel was always formed, but failed to develop sufficiently to propagate to the fuel in the bowl. A flame kernel arriving late within the piston bowl found significantly leaner conditions and the mixture was not fully consumed leading to a partial burn. For misfire cycles, the mixture in the measurement plane was significantly leaner surrounding the flame kernel, which disappeared shortly after the spark discharge. It is concluded that the partial burns and misfires are not the result of failed ignition, but failure during the flame propagation process...|$|R
40|$|Secondary and logged-over {{tropical}} forests cover more than 600 million hectares. An international workshop held in Bogor (Indonesia) in November 1997 provided a forum of {{discussion on the}} research priorities for the sustainable management of secondary forests in Indonesia and more generally in South East Asia. Secondary forests were defined as: "woody vegetation regrowing on land whose previous forest cover was destroyed by at least 90 % by human activities or natural disaster". In these proceedings five papers focus on the use and manipulation of secondary forests as part of smallholders’ resource management strategies, six papers refer to management aspects of logged-over forests for timber production, mainly focusing on the application of silviculture (e. g. conditions for natural regeneration and enrichment techniques). There is also {{an analysis of the}} socio-economic consequences of forest changes in relation to the future economic development of two Indonesian provinces. The workshop concluded that secondary and logged-over forests are complex ecosystems providing a large range of timber and forest products and environmental values but a clear typology of these very different forests is not yet defined. Secondary forests are quite different from logged-over forests in both structure and species composition and {{there is a need to}} develop new silvicultural concepts for their management and silvicultural interventions favouring non-timber forest products. Indonesian forest policy and regulations and their implications for logged-over forests were debated. Socio-economic aspects were also recognised as an important feature, which should retain more attention in forest regulations than in the past. The potential of the Indonesian Selective Logging System (TPTI) in achieving and promoting forest management is now questionable. New rules based on research results from various research and development projects must be defined within TPTI regulations which, with adequate enforcement, have potential to attain many of the criteria associated with sustainable forest management. Logged-over forests will be the main suppliers of the timber industry for the next <b>felling</b> <b>cycle</b> (35 years) so achievement of sustainable forest management in the remaining production forests is both an environmental concern and an important economic issue for Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Large {{areas of}} African moist forests are being logged {{in the context}} of {{supposedly}} sustainable management plans. It remains however controversial whether harvesting a few trees per hectare can be maintained in the long term while preserving other forest services as well. We used a unique 24 year silvicultural experiment, encompassing 10 4 ha plots established in the Central African Republic, to assess the effect of disturbance linked to logging (two to nine trees ha− 1 {{greater than or equal to}} 80 cm DBH) and thinning (11 – 41 trees ha− 1 greater than or equal to 50 cm DBH) on the structure and dynamics of the forest. Before silvicultural treatments, above-ground biomass (AGB) and timber stock (i. e. the volume of commercial trees greater than or equal to 80 cm DBH) in the plots amounted 374. 5 ± 58. 2 Mg ha− 1 and 79. 7 ± 45. 9 m 3 ha− 1, respectively. We found that (i) natural control forest was increasing in AGB (2. 58 ± 1. 73 Mg dry mass ha− 1 yr− 1) and decreasing in timber stock (− 0. 33 ± 1. 57 m 3 ha− 1 yr− 1); (ii) the AGB recovered very quickly after logging and thinning, at a rate proportional to the disturbance intensity (mean recovery after 24 years: 144 %). Compared with controls, the gain almost doubled in the logged plots (4. 82 ± 1. 22 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1) and tripled in the logged + thinned plots (8. 03 ± 1. 41 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1); (iii) the timber stock recovered slowly (mean recovery after 24 years: 41 %), at a rate of 0. 75 ± 0. 51 m 3 ha− 1 yr− 1 in the logged plots, and 0. 81 ± 0. 74 m 3 ha− 1 yr− 1 in the logged + thinned plots. Although thinning significantly increased the gain in biomass, it had no effect on the gain in timber stock. However, thinning did foster the growth and survival of small- and medium-sized timber trees and should have a positive effect over the next <b>felling</b> <b>cycle.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Timber {{exploitation}} {{is rapidly}} expanding throughout the Congo Basin. In Gabon, timber industry {{is currently the}} second working sector and logging concessions cover 45 % of the country forest area, largely overlapping with the range of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla WLG). Logging may negatively impact gorilla because {{of an increase in}} hunting pressure linked to human concentration and easier access to forest. On the other hand, WLG might benefit from forest opening and the associated growth in Terrestrial Herbaceous Vegetation, following timber felling and roads/trails implementation. In the present study, gorilla density and nesting behavior were studied in a 617, 000 -ha logging concession located in Central Gabon. A Standing Crop Nest Count census was realized 25 years after the first timber harvesting cycle, consisting in the assessment of the potentiality of logged forest to hold viable WLG populations. A second census was undertaken four to six months after the second logging wave. Comparing nesting behavior and estimated gorilla density between the two census allows to highlight the short-term effects of logging on gorilla populations. A relatively high WLG density was observed during the first census (2. 1 weaned gorillas/km²). This figure dropped down to 1. 0 weaned gorillas/km² after the second <b>felling</b> <b>cycle.</b> Both density values fall within the range of documented WLG densities documented at other sites. Gorillas consistently nested preferentially in open terra firme forest and built the majority of their nests using herbs of the Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae families. Both these observations underline the importance of Terrestrial Herbaceous Vegetation for nesting. The {{results of this study suggest}} that timber exploitation and WLG conservation are not mutually exclusive. The initial high density might traduce an effective anti-poaching strategy for now. The decline in gorilla density observed directly in the second census is probably linked with the avoidance of the disturbance of logging operations. Monitoring the evolution of WLG density would be important in order to control if the figure will rise over time to reach its initial value, but also to assess if a positive effect of Terrestrial Herbaceous Vegetation growth will be observed...|$|E
40|$|Diameter class {{distribution}} data, {{as well as}} {{diameter increment}} and increased number of trees, {{provide a basis for}} the simulation of stand development. With advances in computer technology, modelling and stand development research has shown increasing importance. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the establishment dynamics of a selection stand structure in mixed beech-fir forest on Papuk. In the past, these forests were managed as even-aged forests. The research was carried out in the Management Unit »Zapadni Papuk Zvečevački«, Kamenska Forest Office. Using the data from forest management plans (plans of 2006, 1996 and 1986), ten stands were selected for which dynamics simulation of conversion into uneven-age stands was performed. The stands were selected on the basis of age, tree diameter distribution, density and mixture. After simulation, sub-compartments 34 b, 42 b and 56 a were selected for display. The data for these stands are shown in Table 1. Theoretical growing stock models for mixed fir and beech stands were designed according to Klepac (1961). Felling dimensions for both species were 60 cm, while the growing stock mixture consisted of 60 % fir and 40 % beech (as set down in the management plan). The theoretical model was designed for both site class combinations: fir II/III – beech II, and fir III – beech II/III, using the original theoretical models by Klepac. To calculate the growing stock, we used local one-entry volume tables by species and site classes from the management plan. Table 2 and 3 show the designed theoretical models. Simulations were carried out with Excel files generated for this purpose. Input data for the simulation consisted of diameter distribution of trees taken from the management plan. Consequently, diameter distribution of trees for all coniferous was displayed as fir and all deciduous trees as beech. Simulation was carried out according to three scenarios, which define the felling volume as follows:Scenario 1 : Felling volume is calculated according to Klepac’s formula. Scenario 2 : Volume of the first three felling is calculated on the basis of maximally allowed felling intensity of 30 % of the growing stock. After this, Scenario 1 is applied. Scenario 3 : Felling volume is calculated as the difference between the actual growing stock before felling and the theoretical growing stock after felling. The simulations were carried out for the time interval of 100 years. The results presented in Fig. 2 show long-lasting establishment of an uneven stand structure in the stands with initially too large growing stock and lack of small diameter trees. In all the three scenarios, the beech approaches the theoretical model more rapidly than the fir, particularly in smaller tree diameter classes. Assumed achievement of mixture ratio to the theoretical one led to the faster decrease of the large firs. According to all the tree scenarios, the growing stock is reduced below the theoretical one (Fig. 3), but after this it begins to increase. In Scenario 1, this decrease is smaller, but longer-lasting than in the other two scenarios, which is the consequence of lower felling intensities in the first 50 years. Scenario 2 assumes the largest reduction in the growing stock, when a total of 30 % of initial growing stock is felled in the first three selection <b>felling</b> <b>cycles.</b> The actual growing stock just before the fourth felling amounts to 87 % of the theoretical one. In our opinion, the growing stock can be reduced so as not to fall below 70 % of the theoretical growing stock. According to Scenario 3, extreme felling intensity in the year 2013 is the consequence of too large growing stock. The mixture ratio approaches more or less linearly the theoretical one. In such stands there should be several intensive fellings, as is the case in Scenario 2, provided that the interval of the actual mixture ratio approaching the theoretical one is longer. This would allow for earlier felling of mature fir trees, especially if the loss of their quality is a matter of concern. This would also intensify the appearance of young trees. According to Scenario 1, a specified volume of the first felling is 151 m 3 /ha, according to Scenario 2 it is 149 m 3 /ha and according to Scenario 3 it amounts to 193 m 3 /ha. For the same stand, Zelić (2003) points out that the felling volume could be 104 m 3 /ha and 107 m 3 /ha, respectively. The ten-year volume increment based on the management plan for this stand is 107 m 3 /ha and the felling quantity is only 73 m 3 /ha (68 % increment), which is 17 % based on the actual growing stock at the moment of measurement. Such low felling volume, if achieved, will cause further decline of the stand structure and slow down the process of its conversion into the selection stand structure. According to the results shown in Fig. 4, the selection stand structure is established much earlier in stands that do not contain too large growing stock and that initially have trees in smaller diameter classes. Considering that the initial growing stock is slightly lower than the theoretical one (Fig. 5), according to Scenario 1 and 3 it begins to rise in proportion with increased felling intensity. Similarly to the stand mentioned above, Scenario 2 leads to a significant reduction in the growing stock in comparison to the theoretical one. For this reason, felling intensity in the fourth felling treatment is significantly lower. Such stands require 2 – 3 more intensive felling treatments in the beginning, as is the case with Scenario 2. This would intensify regeneration and transition of young trees into higher diameter classes. According to the simulation results for sub-compartment 42 b (Fig. 6), the procedure of converting young stands into the selection stand structure is relatively fast. The biggest problem with these stands relates to the low mean diameter of felled trees (about 20 cm for fir and 15 cm for beech). As for the low initial growing stock, it rises in all the three scenarios (Fig. 7). The biggest initial growth is related to Scenario 3 as the consequence of the absence of felling in the year 2015, because the simulated felling volume was less than 0. Scenarios 1 and 3 are appropriate for such stands. The percentage of annual volume increment given in the management plan based on management classes is 2. 76 %, whereas the prescribed ten year felling volume is 20. 2 %. Such low felling volumes will slow down the establishment of the selection stand structure. The results of this research show that the establishment of the selection stand structure is a long process that depends on its initial stage. This is in accordance with earlier results of selection stand simulation in stands with disturbed structure (Čavlović et al. 2006 a, Čavlović et al. 2006 b, Čavlović and Božić 2007 – 08), or in stands which were converted from even-aged (spruce) into uneven-aged stands (Hanewinkel and Pretsch 2000). Relative to the stands on Papuk, Zelić (2003) writes: »a part of the stands intended for selective stand management are over 80 years old; consequently, management of these stands should aim at converting them into selection stand management in short time (30 – 50 years) «. The management plan states that it will take at least 30 years to establish theoretical selection stand structure. The results of this research show that the process will take even longer, which coincides with Šafar’s (1963) writing: »Often it takes more than half a century for a stand to form a new structure. Every conversion from one form into another that occurs too fast is harmful because attempts to rapidly create different structures are detrimental to those trees which provide good increment«. The biggest problem of establishing the selection stand structure in stands that lack small diameter trees is the fact that it takes sometimes more than 40 years for the seedlings to emerge and reach the diameter of 10 cm (see the transition times in Fig. 1). Observing just the part of the stand above 10 cm in diameter with the theoretical model reveals additional degradation of the structure. Considering that the young growth does not occur over the whole area simultaneously, the time needed to achieve the theoretical recruitment is even longer. In order to accelerate the process of natural regeneration, group selection system is recommended wherever possible. Provided that intensive and timely tending treatments are applied in groups of trees below 10 cm diameter, the recruitment will be more intensive (Cestar 1960, Špalj 1962). The size of the tree group depends on site conditions and ecological requirements of particular tree species, especially in terms of their shade tolerance (Šafar 1963, Nyland 1998). We are aware of the fact that, with the passing of time, the actual stand structure in the field will more or less diverge from the simulated and theoretical model, among other things because felling is not predicted for diameter classes with insufficient number of trees. In addition, the prediction of recruitment, particularly for longer periods, is never accurate...|$|R
40|$|The Bicycle Master Plan was {{launched}} in 1990 and concluded in 1996. To mark its conclusion, a study was carried out to assess developments in road safety for cyclists. An overview of future measures was also compiled. Since 1950, {{there have been three}} broad periods: (1) 1950 - 1975 : {{an increase in the number}} of deaths, mainly among young and old cyclists, coinciding with a sharp increase in car-use; (2) 1975 - 1990 : a decline in the number of deaths among cyclists per distance cycled, coinciding with increased bicycle-use; the absolute number of deaths among cyclists either rose or feil depending on age, gender, and injury severity; and (3) 1990 - 1995 : the number of injured cyclists remained stable, with one exception; the number of deaths per distance <b>cycled</b> <b>fell</b> more slowly than before; bicycle use remained more or less constant. In the last few years, road injury registrations have become more complete. They reveal that more than 60, 000 cyclists are injured and require First Aid each year; 6, 500 of these are admitted to hospital and over 250 succumb to their injuries. Serious injuries to cyclists are often caused by collision with another road user; in the case of minor injuries there is often no other party involved. It is not yet known whether the incidence of minor injuries to cyclists is rising or falling; nor is much known about the measures needed to reduce the number of such injuries. The Death Rate (ratio of deaths among cyclists per distance cycled) contains a very high proportion of older people, since the effects of an accident for such individuals are far more serious. The ratio is especially unfavourable for older male cyclists in small municipalities. The ratio of hospital admissions to distance cycled is especially unfavourable for older female cyclists in small municipalities. Measures to prevent serious injury as a result of collisions between bicycles and cars focus mainly on changes to the road system, such as those included in the recent proposals for a structurally safe traffic system. This should in the long term result in a substantial decline in the number of seriously injured cyclists. However, these proposals do not contain enough detailed plans to prevent collisions between bicycles and cars at busy intersections and roads, even though it is here that most deaths and serious injuries occur. Even a structurally safe road system must be backed up by a code of behaviour and supplementary measures in the form of education, instruction and public information campaigns designed to improve road use among drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. A wide range of other measures could also be used, such as measures to improve observational skills, cycling skills and protection from injury. The number of road deaths among young adults undertaking short, daily journeys in urban areas is lower among cyclists than among car users. Bicycle use could thereby compare favourably with other types of transport in more situations, certainly if conditions were made safer for cyclists.
