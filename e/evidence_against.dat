5|$|Mary's brother, William Ashford, {{launched}} an appeal, and Thornton was rearrested.

5|$|The {{trials of}} the three Samlesbury witches were heard before Anne Redferne's first {{appearance}} in court, late in the afternoon, charged {{with the murder of}} Robert Nutter. The <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> her was considered unsatisfactory, and she was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Arguing for {{the defence}} was lawyer Jagmal Singh. He {{asserted}} {{that there was}} no <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> the accused and that it was all contrived by the media, no evidence that the khap panchayat ever met to discuss the fate of the couple, and no evidence indicating that Manoj and Babli were dead. The cremated bodies recovered from the canal were never confirmed to be those of Manoj and Babli.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Manfred Berg {{speculated that}} Washington {{probably}} murdered Fryer, but doubted that he raped her. The same year, Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued that Washington was possibly innocent of both charges. Bernstein notes that Washington's motives {{have never been}} established. She also states that his confession could have been coerced, and that the murder weapon—perhaps the strongest <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him—could have been planted by authorities.|$|E

In 1808 he had printed at Kilmarnock a book titles Conclusive <b>Evidences</b> <b>Against</b> Atheism. [...] His last published work in 1809 was A Treatise upon the Evidences of a Deity. Dougal states that in 1811, aged over ninety and therefore {{just a few years}} before his death {{he published}} his last work <b>Evidences</b> <b>against</b> Atheism. He sadly died before completing his work on a book to be titled A Revise, or Reform of the Present System of Astronomy.|$|R

5|$|On {{the counts}} under {{which he was}} convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but {{received}} credit for the nearly four years during {{which he had been}} in custody awaiting trial.

5|$|Portland, Oregon police {{officers}} searched {{the home of}} James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging telephone communications, but appealed his federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} state police had gathered the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

5|$|The court {{decided that}} the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Thornton was not overwhelming, and that trial by battle was a {{permissible}} option under law; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle. Ashford declined the offer of battle and Thornton was freed from custody. Appeals such as Ashford's were abolished by statute in 1819, and with {{them the right to}} trial by battle. Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E

Judge Roberto Tood Jr. determined that the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Coimbre was insufficient during the hearing and the case was dropped.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> it.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that papillomaviruses generally co-evolve with a particular species of host animal over many years, although there are strong <b>evidences</b> <b>against</b> the hypothesis of coevolution. In a particularly speedy example, HPV-16 has evolved slightly as human populations have expanded across the globe and now varies in different geographic regions {{in a way that}} probably reflects the history of human migration.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>evidences</b> <b>against</b> this {{interpretation}} as the chronicler Jean de Wavrin, contemporary {{of the battle}} of Agincourt, reports that the captured archers would have three fingers cut, and not two.

5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E

The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the {{conclusion}} that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff, and that Tucker, Bentley and Choate had been murdered by Gardstein and others {{in the course of the}} burglary attempt. Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910—with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing—to March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis.|$|E
5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|At {{the trial}} in 1884, {{prosecutors}} implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, {{as well as that}} of Thomas Higgins, with which they were officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> other conspirators for the prosecution in exchange for leniency was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.|$|E
