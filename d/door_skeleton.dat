50|$|The cape {{was built}} about 1715 by Jonathan Sedgley, {{which was the}} first year his wife and he started living on the land. The {{structure}} sits on a granite foundation and has a gable roof. With an attached shed roof screened porch. It has a wood clapboard exterior, with a centrally aligned rectangular brick chimney. The structure is a low posted, Cape Cod-style dwelling, near symmetrical designed front façade. It is an L-shaped structure that stands one and a half stories tall. Entrance into the home can be through the southern façade (which is the near symmetrical aligned façade being referred to) or the eastern faćade. Even the exterior <b>door</b> <b>skeleton</b> keys are still present and functional, which are to the best of the owner's knowledge, original sets. It has open timber ceiling framed interiors with nineteenth-century six-over-six sash windows. The two open fireplaces, one in the Western and one in the Eastern rooms of the first story of the home, which historically would have been best known as the bedroom quarters and the hearth area respectively. The room in the North of the home also features a chimney and fireplace. The Cape is currently a one bedroom, one bathroom home with a second large living area above on the second floor.|$|E

2500|$|On April 12, 1998 he {{boarded the}} train from Genoa to Venice because he [...] "wanted {{to kill a}} woman". [...] Spotting a young woman {{travelling}} alone, he followed her to the toilet, unlocked the <b>door</b> with a <b>skeleton</b> key, shot her {{in the head and}} stole her train ticket.|$|R
50|$|The Chamunda is {{surrounded}} by a host of other smaller size allied deities carved in the lower parts of the walls, each within a niche separate by a pilaster. The figure on the east wall, {{to the right of the}} <b>door,</b> is a <b>skeleton</b> form of Bhairava forming the counterpart of Chamunda.|$|R
5000|$|On April 12, 1998 he {{boarded the}} train from Genoa to Venice because he [...] "wanted {{to kill a}} woman". Spotting a young woman {{travelling}} alone, he followed her to the toilet, unlocked the <b>door</b> with a <b>skeleton</b> key, shot her {{in the head and}} stole her train ticket.Six days later, he boarded the train to San Remo and followed another young woman to the toilet. He used his key to enter, then used her jacket as a silencer and shot her behind the ear. Excited by her black underwear, he masturbated and used her clothes to clean up. The murders of two [...] "respectable" [...] women sparked a public outcry {{and the creation of a}} police task force.|$|R
60|$|The dining-room was clean, but unattractive, {{with its}} {{varnished}} board walls, bare floor, and wire-mesh filling the <b>skeleton</b> <b>door,</b> which a spring banged to before the mosquitoes could get in. There were no curtains or ventilator-fans, {{the room was}} very hot, and the glaring sunshine emphasized its ugliness. Then {{it was full of}} flies that fell upon boards and tables from the poisonous papers, and a big gramophone made a discordant noise. Sadie remembered Keller's pride in the machine and how he had bought it, to amuse the boys, after hearing an electric organ in a Montreal restaurant. Yet she knew her craving for society must be gratified at such places as this; a rare visit to the settlement was the only change from monotonous toil.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} hard to kill me with fright," [...] said John Gayther, [...] "and I'll prove that to you, miss. As I moved on, still looking for the treasure, I came to the door of another cabin, and this was shut and bolted on the outside. I had a hatchet with me, and with this I knocked back the bolts and forced open the door; and there I saw {{something}} to make anybody jump. Sitting on a locker, {{right in front of the}} <b>door,</b> was the <b>skeleton</b> of a man. The room had been shut up so tight that no fish big enough to eat bones could get in; but the little things that live in the water and can get through any crack had eaten all of that man except his bones, his gold buttons, that were lying about on the floor, the golden embroidery of his uniform, that was still hanging about on his skeleton, and the iron fetters on his hands and feet. He was most likely a prisoner of rank who was being taken back to Spain, and he had been shut up there through all the fight.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States Senate, the {{procedure}} {{was used in the}} early morning hours of February 25, 1988. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, then the Senate Majority Leader, moved a call of the house after the minority Republicans walked out in an attempt to deny the Senate a quorum after Senate aides began bringing cots into the Senate cloakrooms in preparation for an all-night session over campaign finance reform for congressional elections. Byrd's motion was approved 45-3 and arrest warrants were signed for all 46 Republicans. Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry K. Giugni and his staff searched the Capitol's corridor and Senate office buildings for absent Senators, and after checking several empty offices, spotted Senator Steve Symms of Idaho, who fled down a hallway and escaped arrest. After a cleaning woman gave a tip that Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon was in his office, Giugni opened the <b>door</b> with a <b>skeleton</b> key. Packwood attempted to shove the door closed, but Giugni and two assistants pushed it open. Packwood was [...] "carried feet-first into the Senate chamber by three plainclothes officers" [...] and sustained bruised knuckles.|$|R
