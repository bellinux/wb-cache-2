5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project. In February 1943, Groves came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the output of some plants as the input for others.|$|E

5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E

5|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, {{the bank}} robber {{was to have}} jumped into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena. After Fox and the studio argued against the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> Mulder in such a way, the producers agreed to make the change. The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one.|$|E
5|$|SNK {{developed}} KOF '94 {{with the}} initial <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> several games from the company {{in order to attract}} gamers who played these games. The characters' designs, as well as its innovative gameplay system based on using teams of three members, were both well received. The success of the game allowed SNK to produce a long collection of sequels in The King of Fighters series.|$|E
5|$|The first volume, Into the Wild, {{was written}} by Kate Cary under the {{pseudonym}} Erin Hunter, and completed in about three months. Holmes continued to act behind the scenes editing and supervising details. Afterwards, Holmes began to like the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> cats since she realized how thoughtful they can be leading private lives without any humans realizing.|$|E

5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> {{anthropomorphic}} furry {{animals as}} protagonists {{in a story}} set in the American West pre-dated Popol Out West by several years. In December 1931, Hergé produced Tim-L'Ésureuil, Héros du Far-West ("Tim the Squirrel, Hero of the Far West") for L'Innovation, a large department store in Brussels. Printed in colour, it was serialised in 16 weekly installments, and was aimed to encourage children's interest in the store.|$|E
5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, {{although it was}} only in the 1930s with the development of Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{went through}} 30 rewrites and four {{separate}} story changes before the BBC {{were satisfied with}} the plot. It would be rewritten again following the September 11 attacks, with the purpose of acknowledging the series premise as battling terrorism. Filming took place mostly in London, England using a long lens camera. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> split screen, regularly used by the series, came from Nalluri after filming wrapped up for the episode, and was not inspired by the American television series 24.|$|E

5|$|The {{termination}} of the Point Loma streetcar line was considered in 1923, but the San Diego Electric Railway decided to keep it running after residents opposed the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> buses instead.

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Adventure was first {{announced}} in early 1982. The planned sequel eventually {{evolved into the}} Swordquest series of games. In 2005, a sequel written by Curt Vendel was released by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 system. In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called Adventure II for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; its name is used with permission from Atari Interactive. Robinett himself took the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> items from Adventure into his next game, Rocky's Boots, but added the ability to combine them to form new items.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5000|$|While {{living in}} England, his <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> {{traditional}} Russian decorative art in a modernist context began to form.

5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> it to draw {{heat from the}} ground in 1912. But {{it was not until}} the late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Arular, the debut album by M.I.A., {{took place during}} 2003 and 2004, and the album was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} September 2004. Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release, however, first to December and then into 2005. During the recording process, M.I.A. met DJ Diplo, and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album. Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless, Diplo conceived the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full-length album. M.I.A. extended her stay in the United States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio.|$|E
5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E
50|$|Although the Samsung Gear VR {{consumer}} edition {{was released}} in November 2015, Samsung had obtained a patent on a HMD (Head Mounted Display) in January 2005. This was one <b>of</b> the first <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> a mobile phone as the display for a HMD. However, mobile phone technology {{at the time the}} patent was submitted limited the degree of quality and performance possible. Samsung continued to research VR and HMD internally.|$|R
25|$|Some Ancient Greek philosophers, such as Plato, {{began to}} develop <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> {{punishment}} to reform offenders instead <b>of</b> simply <b>using</b> it as retribution. Imprisonment as a penalty was used initially for {{those who could not}} afford to pay their fines. Eventually, since impoverished Athenians could not pay their fines, leading to indefinite periods of imprisonment, time limits were set instead. The prison in Ancient Athens was known as the desmoterion ("place of chains").|$|R
