500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers. He {{said that they were}} [...] "here at the invitation of the Bishop to take charge of St Peter's school and to have their part, along with the Marist Brothers and other religious communities, in our Catholic education system. They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe much more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E
