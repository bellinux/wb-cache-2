40|$|Peer <b>influences</b> {{are among}} the most {{powerful}} correlates of adolescent problem behavior. Using a sibling sample and hierarchical linear modeling to control for shared <b>influences</b> on behavior, the role was examined of nonshared parent and peer <b>influences</b> as prospective predictors of adolescent cigarette smoking onset. These results were compared to results from a subsample of nonsiblings. Peer <b>influences</b> were significant predictors of smoking onset when shared <b>influences</b> were controlled, suggesting that peer group characteristics operate, at least partially, as nonshared <b>influences.</b> Furthermore, nonshared peer <b>influences</b> were stronger in more educated families than in less educated families. Results highlight the potential utility of controlling for shared <b>influences,</b> and support the importance of taking into account the broader social context...|$|R

5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends.

The more <b>influence</b> that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of <b>influence</b> a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social <b>influence,</b> the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
