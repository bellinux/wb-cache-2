50|$|One basic {{assumption}} of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation {{of economic growth}} and industrial development. On the basis of enlightened self-interest, economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental productivity, i.e. productive use {{of natural resources and}} environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development {{in the same way as}} labour productivity and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable supply chain management, clean technologies, benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>environment.</b> Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the industrial metabolism. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s carrying capacity, ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns, {{coupled with}} public pressure and stricter regulations, are fundamentally impacting the way companies design and launch new products across the world. Therefore, companies {{are confronted with}} the responsibility of producing products in an environmentally friendly manner. They are recognizing that implementing <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>environment</b> (DFE) in their product development process provides opportunities both for improving the environmental aspects of a product and for enhancing the product 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness. DFE activities and strategies are well-known concepts used in product development processes. Establishing an appropriate DFE strategy for designing an environmentally friendly product is a decisive factor in determining the environmental aspects of the product. The process of establishing a DFE strategy requires consideration of environmental as well as business design factors, and then integrating both factors to prioritize DFE strategies. This research is based on three distinct areas of knowledge: engineering, environment, and strategy. In the past, {{there has been a}} lack of research and methods that link these three together. There are two core parts of this research. First, the proposed methodology determines what <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>environment</b> strategy is possible {{based on the results of}} the product 2 ̆ 7 s environmental assessment. Second, what are the design trade-off issues on integrating environmental strategies into business strategies, and how can the decision be optimized? When a company has a better understanding of the <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>environment</b> strategy appropriate for the product, the company can use the proposed method to develop an appropriate and profitable <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>environment</b> strategies for its systematic design of product systems. The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to help designers and product managers understand possible <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>environment</b> strategies and to identify the strategy appropriate for their product. ...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} higher {{education}} to cultivate deep knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving area of sustainability. This paper explores one strategy for teaching Product Design Engineering students <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Environment.</b> A critical aspect is the connection between an industry partner, MicroHeat Technologies, who have developed water and energy efficient point of use water heating technology, and undergraduate students from Swinburne University with competencies in both design and engineering. This paper documents how students can explore <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Environment</b> strategies in a project based learning environment, verifying and quantifying environmental gains throughout the design process from concept to detailed design proposal. Engineering methods such as whole systems design and life cycle assessment were used to better equip these student designers with the tools to quantify the benefits of proposed designs in relation to sustainability. The student group was introduced to the MicroHeat technology, which has the capacity to be at the forefront of <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Environment,</b> the authenticity of which was used to enhance student engagement levels. The project successes were demonstrated by exceeding the industry partner expectations in terms of the breadth and high resolution of outcomes, detail for manufacture and usability. The student work revealed how higher education tied to industry innovation could prepare students to contribute to curtailing the ecological crisis when based in industry, in this case by integrating credible technology options with effective <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> <b>Environment</b> methodology into the design process and outcomes. These results strengthen the case for educators in sustainability to explore industry-based partnerships for cross-disciplinary student projects, with the course now running for a fourth successive year.
