50|$|Applied {{psychology}} {{is the use}} of psychological methods and findings of scientific psychology to solve practical problems of human and animal behavior and experience. Mental health, organizational psychology, business management, education, health, product <b>design,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> and law {{are just a few of}} the areas that have been influenced by the application of psychological principles and findings. Some of the areas of applied psychology include clinical psychology, counseling psychology, evolutionary psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, legal psychology, neuropsychology, occupational health psychology, human factors, forensic psychology, engineering psychology, school psychology, sports psychology, traffic psychology, community psychology, medical psychology. In addition, a number of specialized areas in the general field of psychology have applied branches (e.g., applied social psychology, applied cognitive psychology). However, the lines between sub-branch specializations and major applied psychology categories are often blurred. For example, a human factors psychologist might use a cognitive psychology theory. This could be described as human factor psychology or as applied cognitive psychology.|$|E

Should courses should be taught in a holistic fashion? For example, when covering the topic of workplace design, should such topics as workstation <b>design,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> and shift work be augmented with organizational topics as fatigue, boredom, morale, teamwork, job enrichment, and safety?

40|$|Abstract:- When {{designing}} a product {{for every day}} use, designer has to consider various influential factors, among them aesthetics and ergonomics are very important. In the group of different products covering the same main function (purpose), those that look more attractive are usually more successful on the market. To {{be able to develop}} successful design solutions, designer has to possess expert knowledge and experience in many fields of engineering <b>design</b> including <b>ergonomics</b> and aesthetics. Such experts are rare. Teams of experts are usually established as alternative, yet it increases development costs of the product. The other possibility is to support designer with expert advices, given by the intelligent computer program. The paper presents a proposal for the intelligent advisory system with expert knowledge in fields of aesthetic and ergonomic design that would be able to offer expert help to the designer regarding of ergonomics and aesthetics of the product.

The first pertains to the various forms of participation in these communities, using work analyses. The second addresses the socio-technical mechanisms that support participation, in particular situation and social awareness support. Finally, the question of product quality is discussed.
