5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
5|$|In January 1884, the {{distinguished}} conductor Hans von Bülow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to Kassel and gave two concerts. Hoping {{to escape from}} his job in the theatre, Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as Bülow's permanent assistant. However, {{in the following year}} his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new employment resulted in a six-year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in August 1886. Unwilling to remain in Kassel for another year, Mahler resigned on 22 June 1885, and applied for, and through good fortune was offered a standby appointment as conductor at the Royal Deutsches Landestheater in Prague by the theatre's newly appointed director, the famous Angelo Neumann.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman {{blockade}} quickly {{reduced the}} inhabitants to near starvation, and led {{many of them}} to flee the city. When coupled with the restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, and the violations of their customary rights and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials, a pro-surrender party was formed and gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's Metropolitan, Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist, but by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace {{on its own terms}} evident, a majority of the local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage accompanying a forcible conquest. Venice's <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> allies against the Ottomans also failed, as the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew {{increasingly}} discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year; Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in 1775 {{when the court}} theater was closed, especially since the other theater in Salzburg was largely reserved for visiting troupes.|$|E

25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members {{may not have a}} common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.|$|E

Isherwood then sailed for her fifth 7th Fleet cruise 1 August 1959. During the next months she operated with carrier Lexington (CV-16) in the South China Sea, helping to limit the fighting in Laos and lending strength to United Nations <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a solution.

25|$|The museum {{began in}} 1883 {{as a simple}} {{collection}} of antiquities. A dedicated building was constructed from 1904 to 1912 at the instigation of two Cretan archaeologists, Iosif Hatzidakis and Stefanos Xanthoudidis. After three destructive earthquakes in 1926, 1930, and 1935, the museum nearly collapsed. The director of the Heraklion Museum was then Spyridon Marinatos, who made great <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> funds and persuade the locals and the central government alike that a new solid building was needed. In 1935, Marinatos succeeded in engaging Patroklos Karantinos to build a sturdy structure that has withstood both natural disasters and the bombing that accompanied the German invasion in 1941. Although the museum was damaged during World War II, the collection survived intact and again became accessible {{to the public in}} 1952. A new wing was added in 1964.|$|E

In 1896 the Woman's Auxiliary of the Cleveland Centennial Commission was organized with her as president for life. She was perhaps the first woman of Cleveland to realize the necessity of women becoming acquainted with parliamentary law. Avery was at the front regarding all the relief work which grew out of the Spanish-American War, serving as vice president of the Spanish War Emergency Relief Board. She was in charge of organization and had under her 181 societies which furnished relief to soldiers in quarters, in camp and in transit.|$|E
