5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> treating {{this with}} diuretics {{to reduce the}} circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E

The research focuses on electric power systems modeling and simulation, power electronics and machines, control systems, thermal management, cyber-security for power systems, high temperature superconductor characterization and electrical insulation research.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to track hostile soldiers, and the Metal Gear series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake can hide under to avoid visual detection.|$|E
5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

5000|$|Lesbian and gay studies {{originated}} in the 1970s {{with the publication of}} several [...] "seminal works of gay history. Inspired by ethnic studies, women's studies, and similar identity-based academic fields influenced by the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, the initial <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> [...] "uncovering the suppressed history of gay and lesbian life;" [...] it also made its way into literature departments, where the <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> literary theory. Queer theory soon developed, challenging the [...] "socially constructed" [...] categories of sexual identity.|$|R
5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed labels {{because the}} music {{itself is not}} considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E
5|$|As the game's <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> stealth, {{players are}} {{encouraged}} to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> characterization through qualitative description. Pupils' progress is primarily evaluated through portfolio work in academic blocks {{and discussion of}} pupils in teacher conferences. Standardized tests are rare, {{with the exception of}} examinations necessary for college entry taken during the secondary school years. Letter grades are generally not given until students enter high school at 14–15 years, as the educational <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> children's holistic development, not solely their academic progress. Pupils are not normally asked to repeat years of elementary or secondary education.|$|E

25|$|Both parkour and {{freerunning}} {{encompass the}} ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> self-expression. Although {{the differences between the}} disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{history of the}} United States is about characteristics of and important developments in the U.S. economy from colonial times to the present. The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> economic performance {{and how it was}} affected by new technologies, the change of size in economic sectors and the effects of legislation and government policy. Specialized business history is covered in American business history.|$|E

25|$|Theravāda orthodoxy {{takes the}} seven stages of {{purification}} {{as the basic}} outline of the path to be followed. This basic outline {{is based on the}} threefold discipline of sīla (ethics or discipline), samādhi (meditative concentration) and paññā (understanding or wisdom). The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> understanding the three marks of existence, which removes ignorance. Understanding destroys the ten fetters and leads to nibbana.|$|E
25|$|Hunting scenes, {{especially}} those {{set in the}} enclosed vista of the reed beds of the Nile Delta from Ancient Egypt, can give {{a strong sense of}} place, but the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. The frescos from the Tomb of Nebamun, now in the British Museum (c. 1350 BC), are a famous example.|$|E
