(Apocynaceae) were investigated to detect size variation in different {{elements of the}} cambium and its derivative tissues. Although these two species were grown under identical climatic and edaphic conditions, <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> dimensions and the elements derived from them were larger in A. venenata than in A. neriifolia. Ray initials are rectangular in A. venenata but isodiametric in A. neriifolia. An appreciable increase in length was observed in the phloem and xylem ray cells {{when compared to the}} mother cells. Maximum elongation was observed in xylem fibers during differentiation from the respective fusiform initials...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} cambium {{development}} was reconstructed {{on the basis}} of serial tangential sections of a woody tumour of Picea excelsa (Lam.) Lk. On the area with whirled arragement of the tracheids intrusive growth was found to occur at the lateral radial and longitudinal edges apart from its normal occurrence at the radial apical edges. Intrusive. growth at the radial lateral edge leads to forking of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> in the cambium plane. The growth which appears on longitudinal lateral edges oocurs between the tangential walls of cells in neighbouring storeys. In such places a drastic reconstruction of the cell arrangement in neighbouring annual rings was observed. Intrusive growth. between the tangential walls leads to a whirled arrangement of tracheids...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of the storeyed pattern of cambium {{in the first two}} years of cambial activity and the structure of mature cambium was examined in Laburnum anagyroides, a decorative shrub growing in temperate climate. A distinct storeyed pattern was observed in two-year-old stems, despite the presence of tall rays. The heterogeneous nature of storeys was revealed by the analysis of i) the number of fusiform initials forming storeys or groups of packets; and ii) the frequency of anticlinal divisions in the examined years of cambial activity and the calculation of the relative increase of the cambial circumference. The results are discussed on the basis of the recent hypothesis of intrusive growth of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial,</b> occurring between the tangential walls of its neighbouring initial and its closest derivative...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{studies of}} the vascular cylinder revealed in tangential longitudinal plane have <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> and ray initials arranged in non-stratified manner like majority of dicots. It is generally believed that <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> constitute more than 90 % of the vascular cambium but contrary to above reports, 60 to 83 % <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> have been observed in different tropical tree and in certain extreme cases their proportion may fall as low as 25 %. Keeping in view the above variations, the present communication aims at presenting the proportions of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> which {{was found to be}} 65 % mean tangential area in the cambial zone of presently investigated species...|$|R
40|$|The {{length and}} breadth of the cambial {{initials}} and their derivatives have been examined in Polyalthia longifolia, a tropical tree possessing non-storied cambium. Taking the average size of the initials and the elements originating from them, most of the sieve-tube elements {{have been found to}} be slightly shorter in length than the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> On the other hand, a few of these are still shorter - almost half of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials,</b> due to transverse or somewhat oblique divisions in the sieve element mother cells. The vessel elements are slightly shorter but 5 - 6 times wider than the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> The parenchyma strands, in phloem comprising cells storing starch or tannin (pps), in xylem accumulating starch only (ssps), are more or less equal to <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> indicating that the xylem and phloem mother cells forming parenchyma cells have not undergone any major change except for transverse divisions. The individual vessel-associated parenchyma cells (v. a. p. cells) are wider but much shorter in length as compared to the starch-storing parenchyma cells (s. s. p. cells) indicating that more transverse divisions have occured in the strands of the former than those of the latter. Among all the cambial derivatives, the fibers exhibit maximum increase in length, due to intrusive growth. The ray parenchyma cells are slightly longer than the ray initials possibly due to the elongation of these initials during their transformation into vascular ray cells...|$|R
40|$|Storied pattern, in the {{arrangement}} of both <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> and the rays in cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides, develops in ontogeny relatively quickly and becomes clearly visible in terminal parenchyma of third and fourth annual ring. At first, anticlinal longitudinal divisions and restricted intrusive growth of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> lead {{to the formation of}} their characteristic horizontal tiers. Then, initiation of secondary rays, taking place rather within such tiers, not between them, makes possible the formation of storied ray pattern. New secondary rays originate most frequently from <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> by their segmentation. This makes the appearance of ray tiers rather quick. However, the high order in the structure of cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides is also due to another, very curious and not known until now mechanism. It operates through limited in its range, thus highly controlled, vertical migration of rays on the cambial surface. This applies to asymmetrically positioned rays either primary, which are often originally sited "out of order" or secondary, initiated off-centre within the existing tiers. Excessively asymmetric rays, lying accidentally on the border between two neighbouring storeys, often undergo splitting and then the derivative rays move toward the centres of the storeys. Ray displacement is due to elimination of one or two of ray initial cells on one edge of the ray and simultaneous, multiple divisions adding new ray cells on the opposite edge...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. (sub-alpine fir) {{trees of}} {{comparable}} vigor growing in eastern British Columbia were studied {{in order to}} determine the effects of cork bark disease on phellogen and vascular cambium activity. Diseased trees form hard deeply fissured rhytidome several inches thick over large areas of the bole when phellogens that produce large increments of phellem form successively deeper in cortical and secondary phloem tissues. Expansion of the secondary xylem cylinder causes cracks to form in the rhytidome. Non-infested trees and areas above and below infested sites may retain their superficial phellogen for nearly 200 years and possess relatively thin layers of cork with a smooth surface texture. Phellem cells from diseased areas contain numerous fungal hyphae. Those from adjacent smooth bark areas and healthy trees are filled with phenolic compounds but are of different dimensions and lack hyphae. In addition infested areas show denser wood, significantly shorter tracheids, sieve cells and fusiform initials, greater frequency of fusiform initials dividing by anticlinical partitions, higher rate of new <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> loss, and greater number of vertical albuminous cells. New ray initials are formed from declining fusiform initials in control and diseased trees...|$|E
40|$|This study {{includes}} {{investigation of}} the effect of pollution (radiations and coal-smoke) on the structure of vascular cambium of Citrus reticulata var. tangelos of family Rutaceae. The results obtained from the observations clearly shows that the plants under investigation shows a retarded radial growth under the influence of radiations as the length of fusiform initials reduces from 240 μm under normal condition to 204 μm under irradiated condition while the width of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> shows a similar decrease from 12 to 9 μm. A similar trend is observed for ray initials where the anticlinal and periclinal diameter decreases from 12 / 10 to 10 / 9 μm, respectively. In case of coal smoke pollution results obtained were almost similar to those under normal condition. The length of fusiform initials decreased considerably from 240 to 216 μm while the width of fusiform initials is almost constant and is 11 μm. Similarly the periclinal diameter shows constancy and is 10 μm while the anticlinal diameter decreases slightly to 11 μm. The ratio of ray to fusiform initials also shows variation from 23 % under normal condition to 28 % under radiations and 24 % under coal smoke pollution...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{aggregate}} rays {{present in the}} xylem of the New Zealand species of Nothofagus, and compares them with those present in other genera, particularly Fagus and Dracophyllum. The ontogeny of aggregate rays is investigated, and {{shown to be a}} feature largely of the 'leaf-gap' in Fagus and Dracophyllum. In Nothofagus, however, aggregate ray ontogeny relates more to the leaf-trace. Neither the 'synthetic' nor the 'dissection' theory is adequate for describing aggregate ray ontogeny. The presence of aggregate rays in Nothofagus is correlated with an irregular (not circular) outline of the pith (TS) and may relate to light and hormonal factors and their effect on cell division and elongation within the elongating internode. Certain regions within the growth increment are dominated by pseudo-transverse anticlinal divisions of cambial fusiform initials, other regions are dominated by <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> elongation. An attempt was made to determine whether these regions could be distinguished based on deviations from the normal distribution recorded for axial element length data. The results are not conclusive, but may merit further investigation. Certain features of the aggregate rays in Nothofagus such as: reduced element length; paucity of vessels; reduction of individual rays; and the formation of 'wound-like' areas, indicate that the fluting may actually be responsible for the presence of these aggregate rays...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Developmental {{changes in}} the storage organ of Brassica campestris L. were {{followed}} from {{the organization of the}} embryonic radicle and hypocotyl to the mature storage organ. Three independent primary meristems gave rise to the cortex, the stele, and the root cap-epidermis. The primary development is typical of the Cruciferae. Cambial activity was followed through serial tangential sections of the phloem from four areas of the storage organ; the crown, the hypocotyl, the upper root and the middle root. The anticlinal divisions of the crown's cambium were primarily longitudinal and transverse. The divisions in the hypocotyl, although greatly oblique had fewer 'longitudinal divisions. The cambium of the upper root had fewer longitudinal and greatly oblique anticlinal divisions. The anticlinal divisions of the middle root showed few greatly oblique divisions with most divisions being oblique to slightly oblique. New ray initials originated by transverse divisions of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> Both ray and <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> that were lost differentiated into parenchyma cells. Decline of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> was rare and in no case did ray initials originate in this fashion. As the storage organ expanded, interxylary phloem strands and vascular bundles appeared. Phloem strands differentiated following longitudinal divisions of the axial xylem parenchyma. As the organ enlarged, parenchyma cells surrounding the phloem strand divided, a cambium was formed, and tertiary phloem and xylem were produced. These interxylary vascular bundles formed a network which in the upper hypocotyl united to form a continuous band between the xylem and the pith. In the crown the vascular bundles of the basal leaves are bicolateral and the internal phloem is continuous with that of the interxylary phloem...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{structure}} of the secondary xylem was studied in the hole, branches and roots of Quercus robur L., Fagus sylvatica L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., and Robinia pseudoacacia L. Attention was paid especially to variation in {{the length of the}} vertical elements, diameters of the vessels and to ray height and volume. Vessel-elements and libriform fibres increased in length from the pith outwards at any one level in the bole, branch and root, at first rapidly and then rather slowly. In a specific growth ring these elements increased in length upwards in the bole up to a certain height and later decreased. It is suggested that the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> of the vascular cambium become larger during the first few years when growth of the tree is most vigorous, thus accounting for increase in length of the derived elements from pith outwards at any one height; further, that successively larger <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> are laid down nearer the apex during the period of greatest vigour so that at this time the longitudinal elements in a ring are longest nearer the apex. After this periodof maximum vigour is past, new <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> are smaller and hence the longitudinal elements of the xylem are smaller above a certain height. Vessel-elements and libriform fibres within one growth ring are longer in the late-formed wood than in the early-formed wood irrespective of whether the vascular cambium is stratified or not. The variation in the length of the vessel-elements is correlated with the diameter of the vessel, those of the spring wood shortening {{as a result of the}} considerable swelling during differentiation. On the other hand, the libriform fibres elongate during differentiation. Variation in vessel diameters, ray height and ray volume show much the same trend as that of the vessel-elements. Apart from certain minor details, wood of different ages and that from different parts of the tree, shows no great histological difference. <p...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{activity}} of cambium {{has been investigated}} in Salvadora persica L., one of the commonest evergrenn tree of northern India, from March, 1974 to February, 1975 in the main stem and the branch. Secondary vascular cambium behaves abnormally on the xylem side, by producing xylem and phloem in succession, resulting {{in the formation of}} interxylary phloem. It has a storied (sitratified) cambium organization, comprising short fusiform and isodiametric ray <b>initials.</b> The <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> show characteristically beaded cell walls due to the presence of primary pit fields and are uninucleate. These are highly vacuolate during the active period. The cambial activity starts in the month of March, reaches the peak in August and finally slows down in the main stem. In an young branch, however, it is initiated in March-April and reaches the peak in July and then declines till November. It once again showed an upward trend gradually. It appears that the initiation of the combial activity in this tree takes place by a hormone produced in the newly formed leaves, coupled with the high rainfall, enhanced relative humidity, optimum temperature, and short-day conditions. Size measurements for the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> showed considerable variations during the span of a year. A comparision of the organization of three types of phloem 'normal', 'included' and 'internal' occurring in this plant has also bean presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{vascular}} cambium is discussed {{and the length of}} the elements in the secondary xylem related to the division and elongation cycles of the cambial fusiform initials. Particular attention is given to the activities of the storeyed cambium. The ontogeny of the storeyed cambium is described for Hoheria angustifolia Raoul. (Malvaceae). The transition from procambium to cambium was found to take place gradually, the meristem acquiring cambial characteristics over a number of internodes, some before and some after internodal elongation had ceased. The cambium is non storeyed at the commencement of secondary growth but later develops a storeyed pattern. Developmental changes in the cambium with radial growth were studied in Aeschynomene hispida Willd. (Papilionaceae). Repeated radial longitudinal divisions in the fusiform cambial initials in this plant produce a highly developed storeyed pattern with radial growth. The frequency of these divisions decreases with increasing distance from the stem centre. The mean length of the fusiform initials decreases slightly with radial growth. Variation {{in the size of the}} fusiform initials and vessel members was also investigated in Hoberia angustifolia. Mean length of the fusiform initials was found to remain constant with increasing distance from the stem centre but a slight decrease was observed with increasing height in the tree. Mean <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> width showed an increase followed by a decrease with increasing height in the tree. The significance of these results is related to the division pattern in the storeyed cambium...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of functionally adaptive diversification of wood {{structure in the}} course of evolution as advanced by Carlquist is critically tested for vessel member length and type of perforation plate. The functional significance of within-tree variation in vessel member morphology is discussed first, and a criticism of Philipson & Butterfield’s theory for explaining classical length-on-age curves for <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> length is given. At the genus and family level examples are cited which contradict the hypothesis that specialization of the perforation plate has a strong selective advantage for the occupation of more xeric environments or for high conductive rates. Other examples, however, seem to support this. The functional interpretation of correlations between vessel member length and ecological conditions is criticised. A comparison is made between whole woody floras or vegetation types with respect to the proportion of genera with scalariform perforation plates (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2). In tropical lowland rain forests the percentage of genera with scalariform plates is rather low. It strongly increases for tropical montane forests and for temperate to arctic floras. It is lowest in seasonally dry to arid regions. These trends support Carlquist’s idea that scalariform plates are, in general, only successful for conditions which require low rates of water conduction. In addition, the role of temperature is stressed. The total evidence presented in this paper is discussed in terms of random ‘patio ludens’ evolution which has to a considerable extent been canalized through selective pressures by environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Cambial {{activity}} in white spruce stems in Alaska was observed from April, 1964 to September, 1965 in over 300 samples taken from 50 - to 60 -year-old natural stands. Mitotic index {{was used as}} a measure of the rate of periclinal division of fusiform cells in the cambial zone. Anticlinal divisions are relatively rare, occurring only about once per 278 periclinal divisions in most stems. Mitotic index, at any given time, is quite uniform throughout the cambial zone of an internode, among internodes of the same tree, and even among trees of a stand growing at markedly different rates. There may be some difference in rate of division across the radial extent of the cambial zone [...] During dormancy, the radial number of fusiform cells in the cambial zone (NCZ) ranges from two to about eight, the number being related to annual growth rate of xylem and phloem. Two to three overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells border the cambial zone in each radial file of cells. They are the last phloem derivatives of the previous year's cambial activity. They undergo rapid radial enlargement just prior to vernal reactivation of mitosis in the cambial zone, and they become the first new conducting phloem elements of the current year. There are three distinct growing season periods: early period, grand period, and late period. Beginning of early period cambial activity is marked by reactivation of periclinal divisions, first near the apex, then at successively lower stem levels. Each cambial zone <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> divides once before any new xylem or phloem derivatives are produced, thus approximately doubling the NCZ. Mitotic activity varies considerably during the early period, and the time required to double the NCZ varies from year to year depending upon weather conditions. Production of the first new xylem and phloem derivatives marks the beginning of the grand period. Rate of cell production in the cambial zone remains about equal to derivative production for the next 45 to 50 days, when about 80 percent of annual xylem and phloem increment is produced. Rate of division is comparatively uniform in all internodes in all trees. Rate of derivative production is, therefore, dependent on NCZ. There is a rather abrupt drop in NCZ {{at the beginning of the}} late period, apparently due to lengthening of the cell division cycle. Rate of derivative production exceeds rate of cambial zone cell production, and NCZ soon drops to about the dormant level. Subsequently, within about ten days, derivative production slows, the zone of developing tracheids begins to narrow, and radial enlargement of developing tracheids and sieve cells declines. In about two more weeks the zone of developing tracheids is almost eliminated, the most recently produced tracheids show little or no radial and there is evidence of partial inception of dormancy in the cambial zone. Complete termination of cambial activity is gradual, extending through late August and, perhaps, into September...|$|E
40|$|The cambium which {{produces}} wavy-grained xylem in spruce differs from normal cambium by a higher frequency of oblique anticlinal divisions {{and a higher}} rate of intrusive growth of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> Since the orientation, either to the left or to the right, of the divisions and the overlaps achieved by the growting tips is uniform within the areas called domains, the domain pattern of the cambium is reflected in the pattern of grain undulations in the xy 1 em.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The balsam {{woolly aphid}} (Adelges piceae Ratz.) feeds by {{inserting}} its stylets intra- and intercellularly into the cortex or outer phloem of the true firs. While feeding, the aphid injects into the bark an unknown stimulatory substance which affects the adjacent cortical parenchyma cells, {{the activity of the}} vascular cambium and the differentiation of the xylem. This study examines non-infested, infested, and aphid-aban doned trees of grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl. ] Lindl.) collected through the year by serial cross, radial, and tangential sections of the cortex, secondary phloem, cambium, and a portion of the xylem. The cortex of grand fir is composed mainly of parenchyma cells filled with resins, tannins, and sometimes crystals. Some of the parenchyma cells differentiate into astrosclereids. After infestation the cortex is characterized by hypertrophy of the nuclei and cortical parenchyma cells. As these cells enlarge into giant cells, there is an increase in density of the cytoplasm. Later a cork cambium is initiated around the pockets of giant cells. Reactivation and cessation of the cambium in infested, non-infested, and aphid-abandoned trees do not differ any more than the natural tree-to-tree variations that are due to location and exposure. The dormant cambium of infested trees maintains a wider radial file of cells in the cambial zone than do the cambiums of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The cambium of infested trees generally produces more cells per year by increases in both periclinal and pseudotransverse divisions spread more or less evenly throughout the year. Pseudotransverse divisions in the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are generally limited to {{the latter half of the}} growing season. The sieve cells of the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are longer than those of the infested trees, but those of the infested trees are larger in radial width. The tangential widths do not vary. Rays are produced by anticlinal divisions of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> and by decline of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> More declining tiers are noted in infested trees than in non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> decline to form one or more ray initials. In the latter case, the segmented initial produces two or more separate ray initials by unequal periclinal divisions and by maturation of some initials in the strand. The phloem rays usually accumulate a greater abundance of resins than do those of non-infested trees. The cambium of infested trees produces more tangential bands of phloem parenchyma cells and fiber sclereids than that of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. Traumatic resin ducts are initiated in the differentiating xylem, especially in heavily-infested trees. In the material examined, these were initiated in the spring, but they can occur at any time during the growing season. After prolonged presence of feeding aphids, phloem ray cells develop abnormalities such as dumbbell-shaped nuclei or a binucleate condition. Astrosclereids and resin cells were noted in all categories of trees studied. The astrosclereids were seen in all samples collected, whereas the resin cells appeared only in certain trees of the various categories...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{changes in}} the cambium {{producing}} interlocked grain wood of Platanus, were determined by an analysis of successive late xylem layers (TLX) at {{the borders of the}} annual rings. Intensive splitting and uniting of rays were observed. These occured by intrusion of fusiform cells into the rays and by loss of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> which formed the strands separating the rays, respectively. Uniting of rays was unidirectional within the large areas of cambium (domain), so was the splitting, too. There were domains of Z and S-type. Orientation of splitting and uniting of rays at a particular locality of the cambium was reversed at irregular time intervals. It appears that the reason for these reversals was slow movement of domain pattern. The occurrence of alternating Z and S domains brought about the alternation of the grain inclination from right to left and back again in the interlocked-grained wood...|$|R

Highly contrasted images of samples extracted at breast height during dormancy were analysed with an automatic image analyser. Between three young (38 years) and three old (147 years) trees, age-related differences were identified by size and shape parameters, at both cell and tissue levels. In the cambial zone, older trees had larger and more rectangular <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> In the phloem, sieve tubes were also larger, but their shape did not change and the area for sap conduction was similar in both categories.

40|$|The {{intrusive}} {{growth of}} <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> was studied in Entandrophragma, This growth makes possible {{a change in}} the position of the cell ends of one storey in respect to those in the neighbouring storey, and this is 'turn leads to changes in the orientation of cambial initials. The growth activities of the oppositely directed ends of the same initial are not the same. Not all cell ends are simultaneously actiye. There are groups of ends distributed alternately in a storey which are active or inactive, so that a pattern of growth activity appears in the cambium. The activity of a particular cell end changes in successive time periods. Owing to this, the rate of creeping of one end past. those of the adjoining storey varies. This phenomenon of changes in the activity of cell ends in time may be referred to the phenomenon of the appearance of the growth activity pattern on the cambium surface under the hypothesis of transverse shifting of the elements of this pattern ("active" and. "inactive" groups) in relation to the cambial initials...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Three growth {{forms of}} the genus Microseris, of the tribe Cichorieae, family Compositae, were {{compared}} {{with respect to their}} anatomical structure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify lines of evolutionary specialization in the genus. Two of the three species studied, M. laciniata and M. borealis, are perennials, while the third, M. lindleyi is an annual. Seedling development and primary growth of the root is essentially similar in all three species. There are two groups of initials in the root apex; the upper group giving rise to the stele and the lower group differentiating into the rootcap, epidermis and cortex. Differences occur in secondary growth of the primary root. The cortex is persistent in all three species. Microseris lindleyi produces a relatively large amount of secondary xylem in relation to secondary phloem. The cambium consists largely of <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> and some non-typical <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials,</b> Definite ray initials were not observed. Outwardly, the cambium derivatives differentiate into storage parenchyma in which phloem strands are embedded. A phloem strand consists of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma and laticifers. The secondary xylem consists of both tracheids and vessels, both with scalariform to pitted lateral walls and the latter with simple perforated end-walls, thick-walled fibers, appearing only in the later part of secondary growth, and xylem parenchyma. The two perennials, M. laciniata and M. borealis have fleshy roots which consist largely of storage parenchyma, in which the phloem strands are arranged in concentric rings. Here also there are connections between most of the phloem strands of each ring by means of anastomosing laticifers but not between those of different rings. The secondary xylem is scanty, and consists of tracheids, vessels and xylem parenchyma. The vessels are arranged more or less in radiating rows which correspond with the location of phloem strands in the storage parenchyma. Both perennials produce adventitious roots that replace the primary root. Their anatomical structure differs from that of the primary root in that there are more than two protoxylem ridges, and there is a pith present. The adventitious roots show transverse wrinkling in the upper regions as a result of contraction. In the primary root, contraction is indicated primarily by folding of the Casparian strips, and is not obvious externally. All three species possess a one-layered tunica in the shoot apex. Aerial stem structure was described only for M. lindleyi and M. laciniata. The rosettes of the perennials form a primary thickening meristem which accounts for much of the increase in diameter of the stem of the rosette stage. In all three species, the stem is a eustele. Vascular bundles are always bordered at their outer margins by laticifers which are the first elements to mature in a procambium strand. In M. laciniata, a ring of phloem strands or medullary bundles develops at the inner periphery of the vascular cylinder. These phloem strands consist of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma and laticifers. Xylem elements may be differentiated at a later stage, and secondary growth may occur also. This work suggests M. lindleyi as the most advanced species because of its woodiness, alternate leaf position, absence of medullary bundles in addition to morphological and chromosomal features described by previous workers. Among the two perennials, M. borealis is more advanced over M. laciniata because of the horizontal rootstock and the absence of medullary bundles. M. laciniata is considered to be closest to the putative common ancestor than any of the two other species...|$|R

Infested and non-infested samples of grand fir were collected near Corvallis during 1968 and 1969. Samples of subalpine fir, noninfested and infested, were collected near Odell Lake, at approximately 5, 000 ft. elevation, during 1969. Light infestations of the aphid were observed in both species. No differences within species between infested and non-infested trees were noted {{in the number of}} overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells or in the dates for reactivation and cessation of mitotic activity in the cambial zone, or in the number of cambial zone cells per radial file. The relative amounts of xylem and phloem present at any given time during the growing season were the same regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} aphids. Significant differences were noted in the lengths of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> in the infested samples when compared to non-infested samples in both species. Xylem production in grand fir, and phloem production in both species was significantly greater in infested samples. A greater number of phloem parenchyma strands were observed in infested samples of grand fir than in non-infested samples. The rate of cell division, as indicated by the mitotic indices, showed no significant differences between samples of infested and non-infested trees of either species. Differences in xylem and phloem production between infested and non-infested trees could not be attributed to either an increased rate of cell division or an increase in the number of cambial zone cells per radial file in infested samples for either species...|$|R
50|$|Auxin hormones {{are proven}} to stimulate mitoses, cell {{production}} and regulate interfascicular and fascicular cambium. Applying auxin {{to the surface}} of a tree stump allowed decapitated shoots to continue secondary growth. The absence of auxin hormones will have a detrimental effect on a plant. It has been shown that mutants without auxin will exhibit increased spacing between the interfascicular cambiums and reduced growth of the vascular bundles. The mutant plant will therefore experience a decreased in water, nutrients, and photosynthates being transported throughout the plant, eventually leading to death. Auxin also regulates the two types of cell in the vascular cambium, ray and <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> Regulation of these initials ensures the connection and communication between xylem and phloem is maintained for the translocation of nourishment and sugars are safely being stored as an energy resource. Ethylene levels are high in plants with an active cambial zone and are still currently being studied. Gibberellin stimulates the cambial cell division and also regulates differentiation of the xylem tissues, with no effect on the rate of phloem differentiation. Differentiation is an essential process that changes these tissues into a more specialized type, leading to an important role in maintaining the life form of a plant. In poplar trees, high concentrations of gibberellin is positively correlated to an increase of cambial cell division and an increase of auxin in the cambial stem cells. Gibberellin is also responsible for the expansion of xylem through a signal traveling from the shoot to the root. Cytokinin hormone is known to regulate the rate of the cell division instead of the direction of cell differentiation. A study demonstrated that the mutants are found to have a reduction in stem and root growth but the secondary vascular pattern of the vascular bundles were not affected with a treatment of cytokinin.|$|R

This morphological and anatomical diversity is arguably {{one of the factors}} explaining how angiosperms dominate many ecosystems worldwide. However, just how such a wide spectrum of growth forms has evolved in angiosperms remains unclear. In this review, we investigate patterns of growth form diversification in Piperales, an early-diverging lineage (with stem age estimated at 201 - 128 Myr ago) and the most morphologically diverse clade among magnoliids. We outline patterns of growth form diversity and architecture as well as the biomechanical significance of developmental characters, such the organization, loss, and gain of woodiness. Asaroideae and Saururaceae are terrestrial as well as semiaquatic to aquatic herbaceous perennials bearing rhizomes. The Aristolochioideae and Piperaceae show higher levels of growth form diversity and biomechanical organization, with complex patterns of increasing or decreasing woodiness and architectural organization. The climbing habit has probably evolved independently in the Aristolochiaceae and Piperaceae, while mechanically unstable shrubs and, less frequently, treelets have evolved several times within these two most species-rich clades. A key developmental character underlying diversity in most Piperales [...] {{with the exception of the}} herbaceous Saruma (Asaroideae) [...] is the conserved development of the wood cylinder, in which <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials</b> are limited to fascicular cambial initials. The resulting large fraction of raylike tissue in the stem [...] a highly characteristic feature of woody species in the Piperales [...] potentially introduced mechanical constraints on the diversification of self-supporting architectures. This was possibly circumvented by the architectural development of repeated, large-diameter meristems in some shrublike habits via sympodial growth. Patterns of growth form evolution within Piperales potentially mirror some of the overall trends observed among early-diverging angiosperms as a whole as well as angiosperms in general. These include profound changes in life form and growth form linked to large-scale transitions in woodiness, diversity of mechanical organization, and shifts in architectural developmen...|$|R

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of ash cambium was studied after glutaraldehyde-osmium tctroxide fixation. The <b>fusiform</b> and ray <b>initials</b> are essentially alike, {{and both have}} the basic complement of organelles and membranes typical of parenchyma cells. The varied behavior of {{the two types of}} initials and the role of cambium in oriented production of the xylem and phloem are still unexplained phenomena. Actively growing cambial cells are highly vacuolate. They are rich in endoplasmic reticulum of the rough cistcrnal form, ribosomes, dictyosomes, and coated vesicles. Micrombules are present in the peripheral cytoplasm. The plasmalemma appears to be continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and produces coated vesicles as well as micropinocytotic vesicles with smooth surfaces. The plastids have varying amounts of an intralamellar inclusion which may be a lipoprotein. The quiescent cambium is deficient in rough ER and coated vesicles and has certain structures which may be condensed proteins...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Inferior pancreatico-duodenal artery (IPDA) aneurysms {{are very}} rare and {{commonly}} associated with coeliac axis stenosis or occlusion due to atherosclerosis, thrombosis or median arcuate ligament syndrome. We present {{a case of a}} surgical repair of an IPDA aneurysm {{with the use of a}} supra-coeliac aorto-hepatic bypass with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, following a failed initial attempt at an endovascular repair. Presentation: A 75 year old female, who was under investigation for night sweats, was referred to our team with an incidental finding of a 19  mm <b>fusiform</b> IPDA aneurysm. <b>Initial</b> attempt at endovascular coiling of the aneurysm was unsuccessful. Elective surgical repair involved excision of the aneurysm and to restore arterial inflow to the hepatic artery, a PTFE bypass graft was used from the supra-coeliac aorta to the hepatic artery. The patient was well 2 months following the procedure with a patent graft shown on contrast enhanced computer tomography (ceCT). Discussion: Management options for IPDA aneurysms include radiologically guided endovascular approach or surgical repair. Given the high mortality of greater than 50 % with ruptured aneurysms intervention is indicated in all detected cases. Conclusion: Surgical excision with bypass grafting from the supra-coeliac aorta, as reported by our team, represents a satisfactory management option in patients where interventional approaches have failed or are not appropriate...|$|R
