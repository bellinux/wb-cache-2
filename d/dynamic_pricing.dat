25|$|Uber fares {{are based}} on a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> model, in which fares are higher during periods of high demand for rides. The same route costs {{different}} amounts at different times as a result of factors such as the supply and demand for Uber drivers at the time the ride is requested. When rides are in high demand in a certain area and there are not enough drivers in such area, Uber fares increase to get more drivers to that area and to reduce demand for rides in that area. The rate quoted to the rider will reflect such <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{high-profile}} failures and faux pas. Amazon.com was criticized for irrational price changes that resulted from a revenue management software bug. The Coca-Cola Company's plans for a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> vending machine were put on hold {{as a result of}} negative consumer reactions. Revenue management is also blamed for much of the financial difficulty currently experienced by legacy carriers. The reliance of the major carriers on high fares in captive markets arguably created the conditions for low cost carriers to thrive.|$|E
25|$|Yield {{management}} {{spread to}} other travel and transportation companies in the early 1990s. Notable was implementation of yield management at National Car Rental. In 1993, General Motors was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of National Car Rental. In response, National's program expanded the definition of yield management to include capacity management, pricing and reservations control. As {{a result of this}} program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. Yield management gave way to the more general practice of revenue management. Whereas revenue management involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, yield management refers specifically to maximizing revenue through inventory control. Some notable revenue management implementations include the NBC which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at UPS, and revenue management at Texas Children's Hospital. Since 2000, much of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing,</b> promotions management and dynamic packaging that underlie ecommerce sites leverage revenue management techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based revenue management in the financial services industry.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the cost-of-living index problem in a general equilibrium multi-sector growth model. Instead of using the utility function as a compensation criterion as Konüs’ (1924) did in his original contribution, we take advantage of the current-value Hamiltonian in constructing our <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> index. Since the Hamiltonian is a constancy-equivalent of future utilities (Weitzman, 1976), the <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> index is defined in terms of the minimum expenditure that, under alternative prices, would support the constancy-equivalent-utility level in the future. We show that, when properly deflated by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> index, the real comprehensive net national product becomes an ideal measure for dynamic welfare comparisons. For some special cases, we show that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> index reduces to the simple static index. Dynamic index theory; Hamiltonian; ideal deflator...|$|R

[...] Uber has defended this [...] "surge pricing" [...] on its website, arguing that without <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing,</b> there would not be enough drivers to enable riders to get a ride immediately upon request. Uber cited an example of the aftermath of a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden when pricing was increased. During this event, the number of people who opened the Uber app increased 400%, but, due to the higher prices, the actual ride requests only rose slightly, enabling ride requests to be completed within the usual timeframe.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} pricing {{decision}} for a monopolist launching a new innovation. At {{the time of}} launch, {{we assume that the}} monopolist has incomplete information about the true demand curve. Despite the lack of objective information the firm must set a retail price to maximize total profits. To model this environment, we develop a novel two-period non-Bayesian framework, where the monopolist sets the price in each period based only on a non-parametric set of all feasible demand curves. Optimal <b>prices</b> are <b>dynamic</b> as <b>prices</b> in any period allow the firm to learn about demand and improve future pricing decisions. Our main results show that the direction of <b>dynamic</b> introductory <b>prices</b> (versus static) depends on the type of heterogeneity in the market. We find (1) when consumers have homogeneous preferences, introductory <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> is higher than the static price (2) when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has no ex-ante information, the introductory <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> {{is the same as the}} static price and (3) when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has ex-ante information, the introductory <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> is lower than the static price.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} differences between open-book accounting (OBA) using static prices and OBA using <b>dynamic</b> <b>prices.</b> The authors identify how these differences influence various aspects of customer–supplier relationships. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a case study involving a builders’ merchant and a wood manufacturer in the UK. The builders’ merchant under discussion has recently outsourced part of its production to the aforementioned wood manufacturer by using OBA with <b>dynamic</b> <b>prices.</b> For this case study, the authors have conducted interviews with multiple people from both parties in the agreement. Additional illustrative cases are provided through a study of other qualitative papers on OBA. Findings The authors find evidence supporting that, when <b>dynamic</b> <b>prices</b> are used in OBA, risk (unpredictability) is shifted from the supplier to the customer. Also, the customer frequently focuses on the supplier’s costs, both parties often aim for a long-term relationship and the customer becomes more dependent on the supplier, causing high interdependence. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that the customer finds price less important, and the reallocation of activities between the customer and supplier is easier in OBA setups in which <b>dynamic</b> <b>prices</b> are used. Originality/value This paper provides the first study of how differences between <b>dynamic</b> and static <b>prices</b> in OBA influence the customer–supplier relationship.

40|$|A {{key issue}} for the {{realization}} of the smart grid vision is the implementation of effective demand-side management. One possible approach involves exposing <b>dynamic</b> energy <b>prices</b> to end-users. In this paper, we consider a resulting problem on the user’s side: how to adaptively heat a home given <b>dynamic</b> <b>prices.</b> The user faces the challenge of having to react to <b>dynamic</b> <b>prices</b> in real time, trading off his comfort with the costs of heating his home to a certain temperature. We propose an active learning approach to adjust the home temperature in a semiautomatic way. Our algorithm learns the user’s preferences over time and automatically adjusts the temperature in real-time as prices change. In addition, the algorithm asks the user for feedback once a day. To find the best query time, the algorithm solves an optimal stopping problem. Via simulations, we show that our algorithm learns users’ preferences quickly, and that using the expected utility loss as the query criterion outperforms standard approaches from the active learning literature. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> {{competition}} in markets {{in which the}} perception of consumers regarding the value of goods depends on the choices of other consumers in the market.

In {{the context of a}} finite horizon model, we show that conformity based behavior creates new channels of dynamic interaction between firms, changing the nature of price competition. As time evolves, both price strategic complementarity and substitutability may arise along the equilibrium trajectory. This leads to V-shaped equilibrium price paths and oscillating trajectories of market shares. We provide also a new rational for the inversion of fashion trends. <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> competition, consumer behavior, conformity, fashion shift...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} demand response (DR) model framework for DR management systems {{in a residential}} premise is proposed. The proposed model consists of <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> signals from load serving entity (LSE), benefit function, and loss of consumer comfort. The conventional approaches generally consider these factors as independent in their formulation. Since these factors have functional relationship, the proposed model points to a holistic approach to capture the relationship. The scheduling model can be integrated with the home energy scheduler coupled to the smart meter, which facilitates the flow of <b>dynamic</b> <b>price</b> and energy consumption information {{to and from the}} household premise. The objective is to maximize net consumer surplus, which is formulated as a function of all aforementioned factors. A method for developing a practical and dynamic consumer benefit model for matured DR programs is proposed in this paper. For the purpose of showing the effectiveness of dynamic benefit function, a set of analytically formulated benefit functions is also considered. The suitability of the dynamic benefit function, as compared with other alternatives, is illustrated with an example.
