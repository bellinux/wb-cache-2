40|$|Almost all climate {{time series}} have {{some degree of}} nonstationarity due to {{external}} <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> perturbing the observed system. Therefore, these external <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> {{should be taken into}} account when constructing the climate dynamics. This paper presents a new technique of obtaining the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> of a time series from the slow feature analysis (SFA) approach, and then introduces them into a predictive model to predict nonstationary time series. The basic theory of the technique is to consider the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> as state variables and to incorporate them into the predictive model. Experiments using a modified logistic time series and winter ozone data in Arosa, Switzerland, were conducted to test the model. The results showed improved prediction skills...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{expansion}} and urbanization have been continuing to grow rapidly, especially in Asian megacities. Greater Jakarta (Jabodetabek) {{has emerged as}} the world’s second largest urban area, with a population of 28 million in 2010, where urban expansion has {{a significant impact on the}} local as well as the global environment. Efforts to control urban expansion must start from a clear understanding of its various <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> at a local, regional, and global level. Studies of the interdependencies between these <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> in the local spatial relationships in emerging Asian megacities remain limited. This study explores the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> of urban expansion in Jabodetabek by considering local spatial dependency and analyzes the spatial characteristics of this urbanized area as well as identifies spatial variations in the relationship between urban {{expansion and}} its <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> by using Geographically Weighted Regression. The presented findings show that the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> affecting urban expansion in the Jabodetabek region vary spatially. Owing to the influence of the global and regional economie...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the most relevant factors and <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> that influence future sustainable road transportations and exemplify how they may influence the development. The research methodology used is explorative scenarios where data collected from workshops, expert panels and surveys lay the foundations for the explanatory models [1]. Several <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> are identified. However, two of them are found to be more important for the study as they have a strong influence on the development of the road transport system; yet it is uncertain how these <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> will develop. The first of these <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> is the ability of the authorities to take an active role when developing a sustainable transport system and the second how actively people will demand and support changes in the vehicles and the transport system. Four different future road transportation scenarios have been created to explore how changes in these two <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> will influence the development of vehicles and road transport system; these scenarios are explained together with characteristics of future road transportation solutions. It is concluded that plans for technology development need to consider the uncertainties of these <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> in order to enable creation of robust development roadmaps...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} is to explain what internally and externally related forces have driven apparel companies sourcing strategies in the past, and outline how these companies could take action in the future. A framework of <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> for having to take outsourcing decisions is generated, and used and further developed into a conceptual model in the analysis and discussion. A theoretical framework is generated from apparel supply chain studies and general literature on outsourcing, supplier relations, manufacturing strategy. Cross-case analysis of three apparel companies with several decades of outsourcing decisions {{is the basis for}} generating the model. A theoretical framework and model of <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> to outsourcing in the apparel industry has been generated. We distinguish between apparel industry and market related and political society external forces, and four internally <b>driving</b> <b>forces.</b> The externally <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> can either push a company from a location or pull it to a new location. The past and potential future importance of individual forces is discussed. The study has focus on the past forces. We have identified some important dimensions that could be driving future sourcing strategies and outsourcing decision. These could be used as dimensions in scenario analysis evaluating the attractiveness of future sourcing locations. The generated framework and model could be used by managers to understand and map their external and internal <b>driving</b> outsourcing <b>forces.</b> The theoretical contributions lies in explaining the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> and their change processes and form a conceptual model of <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> for outsourcing...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale farmers on {{marginal}} {{land in the}} Loess Plateau of China are adapting their livelihood to new situations and changes such as varying climate, new land-use policies, changing employment opportunities and new market situations. To avoid generalising explanations with regard to land-use change, interactions between proximate causes and underlying <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> adopted from a meta-analysis model are explored through 23 in-depth interviews. This was done through collaborative work with farmers in northern Shaanxi Province {{and focused on the}} land-use situation between 1982 and 2005. The result reveals five categories of land-use change. The interaction pattern is broken down into eight proximate causes and four underlying <b>driving</b> <b>forces.</b> The dominant underlying <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> are economic forces with short time horizons arising partly from compensation through policies, changes in crop demand from an expanding nearby market and a need for cash because of an increasingly cash-based lifestyle. The direct proximate causes were vividly described by the farmers as tools or means by which they are adapting to more abstract and indirect factors. These factors were identified as underlying <b>driving</b> <b>forces.</b> Hence, the knowledge and ability to separate the interaction into proximate causes and underlying <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> are crucial in policy-making...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Past {{studies of}} plate <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> have {{concluded}} that the forces due to subducted slabs in the upper mantle and those due to the thickening of the oceanic lithosphere are the principal <b>driving</b> <b>forces.</b> We reexamine the balance of <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> for the present-day and extend our analysis through the Cenozoic, using an analytical torque balance method which accounts for interactions between plates via viscous coupling to the induced mantle flow. We use an evolving mantle density heterogeneity field based on the last 200 Myr. of subduction to drive plate motions, an approach which has proven success-ful in predicting the present-day mantle heterogeneity field. We find that for plausible upper mantle viscosities the forces due to subducted slabs in the Cenozoic and Mesozoic account for in excess of 90 % of plate <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> and those due to lithospheric thickening for less than 10 %...|$|R
40|$|The article compares {{and points}} out {{differences}} in <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> of four main landscape change processes that shaped post-socialist countries and old democratic countries of Central Europe {{during the last two}} centuries. Studying landscape change processes and corresponding <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> helps in understanding patterns of present landscape and can help among others in better prediction of future landscape change trends. Here, the presented results are based on review of scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2014. Driving forces affecting these processes were grouped into four categories. Economic forces drove mainly agricultural intensification; agricultural land abandonment and urbanisation and were pronounced especially {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century and at the beginning of the 21 st century. Technological <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> affected agricultural intensification especially in the 19 th century and the second half of the 20 th century while cultural <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> had the biggest impact on urbanisation at the beginning of the 21 st century. Political <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> affected agricultural intensification, urbanisation as well as agricultural land abandonment and were pronounced mainly during the second half of the 20 th century in the post-socialist countries. Political forces in the form of subsidies drove agricultural extensification at the beginning of the 21 st century. The drivers for the agricultural intensification as well as urbanisation seem to be similar for both old democratic and post-socialist countries. In contrast, agricultural land abandonment in the old democratic countries was driven by technological, cultural and economic <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> while in the post-socialist countries the political <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> were mainly responsible. Changes in systems for subsidies and changes in the agricultural commodity markets are also responsible for different frequencies and rates of extensification of agriculture between the two groups of countries...|$|R
