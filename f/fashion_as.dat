5|$|The Phillies did {{not achieve}} their first three-game series sweep until almost {{the end of}} May, taking two from the San Francisco Giants, the Arizona Diamondbacks (splitting the series 22), the Atlanta Braves, and the Nationals, and {{dropping}} two to the Giants, the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Astros. However, the Phillies' first sweep was achieved in dramatic <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> the offense broke out for 60runs in fivegames, including a 205 win over the Colorado Rockies.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

Sutherland, takes {{nearly the entire}} account of the mutiny, down to the gasket being a source of {{contention}} for Midshipman Carew, {{and puts it in}} a science fiction setting involving a futuristic HMS Hermione under the command of a Captain Neals. In the novel, Carew takes the place of Midshipman Casey. Neals demonstrates his cruelty in the same <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> Pigot. Neals orders Carew to kneel and beg for forgiveness, and he disrates her and has her flogged when she refuses.|$|E
5|$|To try and win {{immediate}} promotion {{during the}} 1983–84 season Bremner signed veteran forward Ernie Moss (who had won three promotions {{out of the}} division), Andy Kowalski, left-back John Breckin, experienced defender Bill Green, and young midfielder Mark Miller. Investment by new director Peter Wetzel allowed Bremner to spend £120,000 on three players in March: £60,000 on Stirling Albion defender John Philliben, £25,000 on young Celtic midfielder Jim Dobbin, and £35,000 on Shrewsbury Town defender Alan Brown. Promotion was secured in comfortable <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> they finished as runners-up to runaway champions York City, ten points above fifth-place Aldershot.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

5|$|Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited is a 1999 {{biography}} of American General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and his associated normal school for freedmen, Hampton Institute, written by Robert Francis Engs {{and published by}} the University of Tennessee Press. The first full {{biography of}} its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and administrator in the postbellum period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the Virginia school: its African American students, Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> either a savior or handicap for freedmen. The book emphasizes Armstrong's upbringing as a missionary in Hawaii {{in the development of}} his educational philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In the west, outnumbered and under-equipped US forces—committed in {{piecemeal}} <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> {{rapidly as}} they could be deployed—were repeatedly defeated and pushed south. The 24th Division, the first US division committed, took heavy losses in the battle for Taejon in mid-July, which they were driven from after heavy fighting. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving open routes to Pusan. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Li Yuan's {{army that}} arrived at Huoyi {{numbered}} less than its original 30,000 men, perhaps {{as few as}} 25,000, due to the detachments left behind. It was predominantly composed of infantry was divided into six divisions under a general (tongjun), but {{it is unclear how}} they were subordinated to Li Yuan and his sons: Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin were named in the traditional <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> commanders of the left and right respectively, but in the accounts of the battle, the army appears formed in van, middle and rear divisions. The cavalry, a few hundred strong, was apparently kept as a strategic reserve. Very little is also known about the Sui army, except that Song Laosheng's troops were considered to be elite warriors. Some sources raise their number to 30,000 from the more typical 20,000; this could be an error, or possibly indicate additional forces recruited at Huoyi.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|On July25, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 120km (75mi) west-southwest of Yap. Satellite imagery {{indicated that}} a low level circulation had developed and was under an area of light to moderate wind shear. The low traveled in a general northwest <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> upper level outflow improved. By July 27, the low deteriorated, becoming elongated, and convection remained disorganized. However, as the low neared Central Luzon, Philippines, shower and thunderstorm activity {{near the center of}} the low increased, and based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression early that morning. Shortly after, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as Tropical Depression Henry. As the depression neared the northern Philippines, wind shear increased, partially exposing the center of the system to the south. At 02:30UTC on June30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 00:00UTC the next morning, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W.|$|E
5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host {{is not an easy}} task though, despite the fact that several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E

5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan <b>fashion,</b> <b>as</b> was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would have had on a pagan site. This would have been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} reflex sight housing with a revised reticle.

The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|Scully later {{runs into}} the author at a church. He admits sending Scully the pendant and {{discusses}} with her the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She leaves, visibly shaken. Scully meets Mulder and relays her most recent encounter with the writer to Mulder. Later, Padgett woos Scully into his apartment with more character revelations. Mulder bursts in and arrests him based on accurate descriptions of the case murders in his novel, which he secretly read after discovering it in the mail. While Padgett is in custody, Maggie is murdered in the same <b>fashion</b> <b>as</b> Kevin. This establishes a de facto alibi for the author. Lacking concrete and connective evidence to the murders, and hoping Padgett might lead them to his partner in crime, Mulder releases Padgett from custody.|$|E

5|$|Stuttgart {{had been}} pitted against English clubs on two {{meetings}} of the same competition, the former over Burnley in the following season.

However, Leeds were awarded an automatic 3–0 win, after Stuttgart were found to have fielded an ineligible player.
