5|$|The first castle on the Thetford {{site was}} Red Castle and was {{probably}} built {{shortly after the}} Norman conquest of England by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey. The castle was a ringwork design and was positioned across {{the line of the}} defensive Saxon ditch, in the process enclosing and cutting off the local church <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the town, and building over part of the local cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 12th century a new city wall began to be built around Worcester, with work {{probably}} continuing until early the next century. Enclosing about 85 acres (34.4 hectares), its design tracked the flow of natural streams to the north and east, and made use of the castle in the south as part of the defences. The walls were constructed of sandstone, and appear to have been surrounded by a flat bottomed, water-filled ditch, more than 30 feet (9 m) wide. The new walls cut across existing parts of the city and would have required the demolition of numerous existing buildings that lay in their way; the new defences also cut off the outlying districts of Sidbury, Lowesmoore, Foregate Street and The Tything <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the walled city. Three main gates were built in the walls– North Gate, St Martin's Gate and Sidbury Gate– protected by gatehouses of paired circular towers and arrowslits for use by crossbowmen. Smaller gates were built between them, such as Friar's Gate.|$|E

25|$|Storing {{bulbs and}} root crops: pour {{vermiculite}} around bulbs placed in container. If clumps are dug, allow to dry {{for a few}} hours in the sun and then place in cartons or bushel baskets and cover with vermiculite. The absorptive power of vermiculite acts as a regulator that prevents mildew and moisture fluctuation during the storage period. It will not absorb moisture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> stored tubers, but it does take up free water from the outside, preventing storage rot.|$|E
25|$|These {{spots are}} often {{followed}} {{within a few}} days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, which blurs the vision.

In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of Boston University of the circulating blood inside a hamster's cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy. His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses polarized light to penetrate certain formations of cell structure and may greatly improve the detail of an image.|$|E

25|$|A second {{consideration}} is the rotational energy {{stored in the}} wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational potential energy into translational kinetic energy (speed) plus rotational energy. Heavier wheels have a greater moment of inertia and their spinning takes away energy that would otherwise contribute to {{the speed of the}} car. A standard wheel has a mass of 2.6 g, but this can be reduced to as little as 1 g by removing material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the wheel. A raised wheel can reduce the rotational energy up to one-quarter, but this advantage is less with a bumpy track.|$|E
25|$|The {{halogen lamp}} reduces uneven {{evaporation}} of the filament and eliminates darkening {{of the envelope}} by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly. The revers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) {{around the end of}} the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière button hole.|$|E

25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the appliance.|$|E
25|$|Diamond turning – This type is cut and {{polished}} on a CNC lathe. The lens starts {{out as a}} cylindrical disk held in the jaws of the lathe that is equipped with an industrial-grade diamond as the cutting tool. The CNC lathe may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens' convex (outer) surface is thus cut {{and polished}} by the same process. This method {{can be used to}} shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of softs, the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced.|$|E

The video screen, resembling an electric mathematical grid, was eventually lifted during the performance. After the song, Gaga strapped a portable silver jeweled keyboard to herself and began to perform [...] "Just Dance" [...] while emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a white cube on a platform. This {{was followed by a}} brief video intermission and Gaga returned onstage in an off-white costume, that resembled an alien ecto-skeleton, while the dancers wore skeletal headgear. She started performing [...] "LoveGame", which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin. Flames appeared on the video screens, as she got out of her ecto-skeleton outfit. After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed [...] "Alejandro", and was carried by her [...] crotch by one of her male dancers, and later lowered onto another one of them.|$|E

500|$|Benjamin Champney was {{a master}} at {{painting}} water and is known for warm autumn colors. William F. Paskell (18661951), in his later style, used broad brushstrokes and bright colors to create an impressionistic feeling. George McConnell (18521929) was known for the velvety pastel look of his paintings. Edward Hill often created a canopy-like depiction of trees to frame and accentuate {{the focus of a}} painting, a technique that gave many of his works a feeling of intimacy and solitude. [...] Many of the works of Samuel Lancaster Gerry (18131891) included dogs, people on horseback, and women and men in red clothing. Francis Seth Frost (18251902) was known to use small figures, wispy clouds, and an oval format. Alfred Thompson Bricher (18371908) was known for his quiet, calm water. Sylvester Phelps Hodgdon (18301906) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch. John White Allen Scott (1815–1907) frequently painted passing storm clouds in his skies. Frank Henry Shapleigh had his own primitive style and used the same [...] "props" [...] {{over and over again in}} his paintings. [...] He is known for painting landscapes as seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a house or barn looking out through an open door or window. [...] Inside the room would be such props as a ladder back chair, a cat, a basket, a straw hat, a broom, and/or a tall clock.|$|E
500|$|During August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B {{tanks were}} {{captured}} by the Soviets near Sandomierz, and were soon moved to the testing grounds at Kubinka. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension {{of one of the}} tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 1015km. The 8.8 cm KwK 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its [...] "colleague", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of spalling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Analysis of the Tiger Ausf B armour plate showed an absence of molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), Some have said it gives the armour low malleability.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A QR code, which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting thing that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E
