40|$|O conceito de qualidade de vida vem sendo amplamente discutido de modo a apontar paradigmas capazes de influenciar pol?ticas e pr?ticas. Investiga??es nesta tem?tica v?m se desenvolvendo desde o emergir da {{medicina}} social com o intuito de subsidiar as pol?ticas p?blicas e movimentos sociais. Com base nesta evid?ncia a Organiza??o Mundial da Sa?de, tem se preocupado em definir e investigar a qualidade de vida de todos os povos. Desde meados do s?culo XX, se percebeu uma eleva??o r?pida no quantitativo de idosos nos pa?ses em desenvolvimento, o que repercutiu na maior concentra??o de pessoas envelhecidas na popula??o. O Brasil ao mesmo tempo em que presenciou a dissemina??o do HIV, proporcionou o tratamento gratuito com antiretrovirais, e estas drogas favoreceram a sobreviv?ncia, at? mesmo da clientela menos expressiva na epidemia, como a popula??o idosa. Segundo o Minist?rio da sa?de, as entidades que prestam atendimento ao idoso tem obriga??o de informar a autoridade competente de sa?de qualquer ocorr?ncia de pessoas idosas com doen?as infecto-contagiosas. O estudo desenvolvido objetivou: Investigar as contribui??es dos estudos cient?ficos publicados em peri?dicos on-line, durante o per?odo de 2000 a 2008, que envolvem as tem?ticas: qualidade de vida, envelhecimento e Aids para a enfermagem; Caracterizar os estudos desenvolvidos pela enfermagem brasileira, frente ?s tem?ticas qualidade de vida, envelhecimento e Aids, quanto aos elementos inerentes ao estudo, como a origem da pesquisa, aspectos metodol?gicos, aspectos ?ticos e o peri?dico de publica??o on-line; Sumarizar as produ??es cient?ficas sobre qualidade de vida, envelhecimento e Aids selecionadas, considerando a categoria na qual foi enquadrado, os dados de identifica??o do estudo, bem como os elementos constituintes do mesmo, conforme o instrumento de coleta de dados empregado. Para o desenvolvimento deste estudo fez-se uso dos pressupostos da revis?o integrativa da literatura, proposta por Ganong na d?cada de 1980. O seu desenvolvimento consiste na possibilidade de propor subs?dio para a implementa??o de mudan?as que promovam qualidade das condutas assistenciais de enfermagem atrav?s de modelos de pesquisa. Ainda admite a constru??o de consider?vel an?lise da literatura, envolvendo tamb?m discuss?es a cerca de m?todos e resultados das publica??es. Foram revisados 46 artigos cient?ficos, que abordaram as tem?ticas qualidade de vida, envelhecimento e Aids. Esses estudos foram categorizados em quatro agrupamentos, que envolveram as tem?ticas de modo correlacionado, as quais foram identificadas pelas letras: QVE, IQVE, EA e IQVA. Ao ordenar a apresenta??o e discuss?o dos dados, foram elencados tr?s grupos. O primeiro chamado Grupo A, abordou as informa??es inerentes as publica??es; O Grupo B, trouxe a discuss?o dos dados inerentes aos autores das pesquisas; e o Grupo C, desdobrou os conte?dos imersos nas v?rias abordagens tem?ticas identificadas. Destaca-se a import?ncia de se buscar a integralidade de saberes entre os profissionais atuantes na assist?ncia e os atuantes nas academias. Acredita-se que o estudo desenvolvido pode contribuir com o desenvolvimento da aten??o a sa?de da pessoa idosa e das pessoas que vivem com o HIV/Aids. Compreende-se a necessidade de instigar o desenvolvimento de outras pesquisas que possam buscar respostas para tantas interrogativas. The {{concept of}} life quality {{has been largely}} discussed {{in such a way}} to point out paradigms able to influence policies and practices. Investigations in this thematic have been developing since the immerging of the social medicine aiming to subsidize the public policies and social movements. Based on this evidence the World Health Organization, has been worried in defining and investigating the life quality of all peoples. Since the mid twentieth century, a fast elevation in the quantity of elderly in developing countries was realized, which have repercussion in the biggest concentration of elderly people in the population. Brazil {{at the same time that}} witnessed the dissemination of the HIV, provided the treatment for free with antiretroviral, and these drugs favored the survival, even by the less expressive clientele of the epidemy, like elderly people. According to the Ministry of Health, the entities which attend elderly have obligation to <b>inform</b> <b>the</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> of health any occurrence of elderly people with infect-contagious diseases. The study developed aimed: Investigate the contributions of the scientific studies published in periodic online, during the period between 2000 and 2008, which involve the thematic: life quality, aging and Aids for nursing; characterize the studies developed by the Brazilian nursing, ahead of the thematics life quality, aging and Aids, about the elements inherent to the study, like the origin of the research, methodological aspects, ethical aspects and the periodic of online publication; Summarize the scientific productions about life quality, aging and Aids selected,, considering the category in which it was framed, the data of identification of the study, as well as the constitutive elements of the same, according to the instrument of data collection used. For the development of this study it was necessary the use of assumptions of the integrative review of the literature, proposed by Ganong in the decade of 1980. Its development consists on the possibility of proposing allowance for the implementation of changes which promote quality in the assistential conductions of nursing through models of research. It yet admits the building of considerable literature analyzes, also involving discussions about the methods and results of the publications. 46 scientific articles which approached the thematic s life quality, aging and Aids were revised. These studies were categhorized in four groups, which invoved the thematic s in a related mode, which were identified by the letters: QVE, IQVE, EA e IQVA. When orderint the presentation and discussion of data, threegroups were cited. The first calld group A, approached the information inherent to publications; the Group B, brought the discussion of data inherent to the authors of the researches; and the Group C, unfolded the contents immerged in several thematic approaches identified. It is high lighted the importance of searchin the integrality of knlowedge among the active professionals in the assistance and the active in the academies. It is believed that the study developed can contribute with the development of the attention to the health of the elderly person and of the people who live with the HIV/Aids. It is comprehended the necessity of instigating the development of other researches that can search answers for so many interrogatives...|$|E

Council of the European Communities Amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality. Brussels 23 rd June]. This paper focuses on the relationships between land use and faecal indicator organism concentrations in surface waters within this very large drainage basin (1583 km 2) containing some extensive urban areas. A geographical information system comprising readily available digital elevation, remotely sensed land cover and digital map data was used to generate the land use variables for subcatchments draining to 41 locations across the study area. Presumptive concentrations of coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci (colony forming unit (cfu) 100 ml? 1) were measured at each location on at least 20 occasions over a 44 -day period within the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme targeted hydrograph events. Hydrometric records were used to allocate results as either base flow or high flow. At each site, geometric mean faecal indicator organism concentrations were significantly elevated at high flow compared to base flow. Stepwise regression modelling produced statistically significant models predicting geometric mean base and high-flow faecal indicator organism concentrations from land use variables (r 2 : 49. 5 ? 68. 1 %). The dominant predictor variable in each case was the proportion of built-up land in subcatchments, suggesting that this land use type, with associated sewage-related inputs, is a critical source of faecal indicator organisms in this drainage basin.

40|$|Abstract The European Directive 98 / 79 /EC on {{in vitro}} {{diagnostic}} medical devices (IVD) stipulates the marketing and post market surveillance of IVD in the European Economic Area. In cases {{of issues and}} field corrective actions, the manufacturers have to <b>inform</b> <b>the</b> responsible <b>Competent</b> <b>Authorities</b> (CA). In Germany, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) is the responsible CA for most IVD, with a small subset of IVD for immune hematological and infectiological testing as well as tissue typing as specified in Annex II of the Directive, being within {{the responsibility of the}} Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI). In this study, all issues regarding laboratory analyzers for infection testing and their consumables, but not reagents, kits and general culture media, reported to the BfArM between begin 1999 and end of 2007 were analyzed in respect to the sources of report, the underlying product failure and the performed corrective actions. Within the observation period a total of 1471 reports for IVD were received of which 73 related to the IVD for infection testing were included in our study. Reports were predominantly received from manufacturers (56) and <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> (15). Affected products were most frequently those for immunological analysis (42) whereas those based on culturing techniques (17) and molecular biological techniques (14) played only minor roles. In all these groups, laboratory analyzers (55) were more frequently affected than their consumables (18). Investigations of the manufacturers were able to identify the underlying root causes of product failures in 62 cases (84. 9 %). In 2 cases (2. 7 %) the root cause remained unclear and in 9 cases (12. 3 %) a product failure was excluded or a user error was the underlying cause. Product failures in laboratory analyzers were most frequently caused by software errors (31) and constructional faults (8) whereas the predominant cause of product failure in consumables were errors in production and quality control (8). Manufacturers issued corrective measures in 66 cases (90. 4 %) from which 49 and 17 were related to laboratory analyzers and their consumables, respectively. Based on the underlying root causes of product failures these were predominantly customer information (48), recalls (40), software-updates (30) and design changes (9) in the product group of laboratory analyzers as well as customer information (16), recalls (12) and modifications of production and quality management (11) in the group of consumables. The results and experiences obtained since 1999 suggest that the system for post marketing surveillance of IVD is an established tool to ensure product safety, even though the current system can be further enhanced. </p...|$|R
