This study aims to address the challenges in linking spatial modelling with assessment of regional energy consumption and renewable energy supply potential.

40|$|Abstract—Emerging technology, {{especially}} robotic technology, {{has been}} shown to be appealing to children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Such interest may be leveraged to provide repeatable, accurate and individualized intervention services to young children with ASD based on quantitative metrics. However, existing robot-mediated systems tend to have limited adaptive capability that may impact individualization. Our current work seeks to bridge this gap by developing an adaptive and individualized robot-mediated technology for children with ASD. The system is composed of a humanoid robot with its vision augmented by a network of cameras for real-time head tracking using a distributed architecture. Based on the cues from the child’s head movement, the robot intelligently adapts itself in an individualized manner to generate prompts and reinforcements with potential to promote skills in the ASD core <b>deficit</b> <b>area</b> of early social orienting. The system was validated for feasibility, accuracy, and performance.

This paper examines how and how well households in pre-modern Japan reallocated land and labor, using a population register covering 150 years from 1720 – 1870 for a village in the Tohoku region. We find that households reacted to equalize their production factors; land-scarce households tended to acquire or rent-in land and out-migrate their kin members, while land-abundant households tended to release or rent-out land, in-migrate kin members, or employ non-kin members. Estimates suggest that more than 80 % of the surplus or <b>deficit</b> <b>area</b> of land was resolved if the household rented or "sold" land. We discuss a potential underlying mechanism; namely, that the village's collective responsibility for tax payment (murauke) motivated both individual households and the village as a whole to reallocate land and labor for the efficient use of resources...|$|E

Because real subsurface structure is not pure elastic space, thus the observed coseismic displacement distribution probably different from the predicted displacement field when we assume the pure elastic medium. By the coseismic strain analysis using dense GNSS network at the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake, a supporting result, which shows that the strain anomaly related to inhomogeneous subsurface structure, is proposed. However, {{there is no other}} previous study. Therefore, we try to detect the same relationship from coseismic displacement at the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake. After an appropriate rectangular coseismic fault is estimated, we obtained difference between observed and predicted dilatation as the strain anomaly field. As a result, the strain anomaly shows excess extension around the Ishikari Plain. There are two possible causes for this region. One is inelastic response by the existence of thick sedimentary layer. Another is different coseismic behavior induced by clear basement boundary around this region. The east side of this excess extension area, extension <b>deficit</b> <b>area</b> is also detected. Around this area, high seismic velocity area corresponds to the Hidaka metamorphic belt is distributed. Therefore, this relatively rigid elastic medium possibly generates the extension deficit.
