40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} {{a set of}} principles, or guidelines, which aim to give practical and useful information {{in the process of}} developing user interfaces on mobile devices. When talking about mobile devices the main focus is on PDAs and Smartphones, but it also incorporates portable PCs (including ultra portable PCs), tablet PCs and other mobile phones. The commonly used platforms, or operating systems, on these devices are Windows Mobile, Palm, Symbian, Linux and the new mobile adapted OS X. The guidelines aim to be platform independent, but most of the examples and illustrations are from the Windows Mobile environment. The problem scope is found in the space between three main axes: user interface categories, user interface challenges and design approaches. The first two have been emphasized more than the latter. Five user interface categories have been defined: form based, icon based, document based, graphic based and repetition based user interfaces. These categories are on an abstraction level above simple components and mechanisms but within the graphical user interface paradigm. As user interface challenges go, a selection of six relatively common and often encountered challenges has been selected: switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation, software keyboard showing/hidden, content larger than its <b>display</b> <b>container,</b> finger optimized user interface, switching between stylus and finger optimized user interface and user interface able to run on equipment with different screen size. These challenges are found within the problems of utilizing screen space, flexible layout at run-time and flexible layout at design-time. For designing and developing user interface four design approaches has been selected: programming, drawing, modeling and marking up a user interface. Each of these has differing pros and cons, which are dependent on the task at hand and where in the development process one might be. Current mobile device applications have been examined. These were grouped under user interface categories and paired up against one or two selected challenges. The challenges where in most case handled in a relatively basic way. In some cases these solutions maintained usability, but far from always. Some challenges were rarely handled at all. The guidelines found and presented conform to some main principles, which are: Facilitating scrolling functionality in one form or another (e. g. Panning and Borders Facilitate Scrolling), adjust or adapt components which the user interface consists of (e. g. Struts and Straps and Simple Adaptation of Existing Components), group content differently (e. g. Group Similar Components in Tab Folders and Partial Tab Folders) and do nothing, or lock the user interface (e. g. Lock User Interface in One Orientation) ...|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} bichrome and polychrome vessels {{have also been}} found at Moundville. Stylistically they closely {{resemble}} pottery found along the Tennessee, Cumberland, the lower Ohio River and the central Mississippi Valleys. This pottery was long {{thought to have been}} imported from these other areas as trade items, and modern chemical analysis has shown that much of it is. The same analysis has also proved that some of the pottery was made locally in the Moundville polity. The polychrome pottery has representational motifs painted with red, white, and black pigments. The red and white are applied as slips of colored clay, while the black was made from carbon and applied with a negative or resist technique. Similar in manufacture to the engraved ceramics, the painted pottery has thin walls, was tempered with finely ground mussel shell and was given a polished exterior. This style comes in two major shapes, a bottle with a spherical body and a narrow curving neck and a terraced rectangular bowl that is a Moundville specialty. The rectangular bowl is a vertical-sided, flat-bottomed, rectangular vessel with an eccentric rim, specifically with one side lower than the other three so as to <b>display</b> the <b>containers</b> contents. The designs painted on the rectangular vessels are similar to motifs found on other locally produced wares and include the oblong emblem with an embedded cross-in-circle motif(thought to be a graphic representation of a scalp stretched on a hoop), the hand, the skull, the ogee, concentric circles, rayed concentric circles, rayed semicircles, and rayed spirals.|$|R

A portion of screen bits from any application or any parts of visible display can be cut, grabbed, send and launched onto a different display surface or device with minimal interaction - merely three mouse/stylus click-select.

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{continuous}} or periodic monitoring of water areas affected by radioactive contamination in the result of scheduled emissions in nuclear power plants or in the result of emergency situations in nuclear fuel cycle plants we need to develop measurement instruments with advanced mathematics and program support to assess the level of radioactive contamination with required accuracy. The aim of theoretical research was to optimize detection device construction, estimate spectrometer metrological parameters in given measurement geometries, and determine effective position of detection device in the process of in situ measurements. This device consists of spectrometric scintillation probe packed into sealed container (detection device) based on NaI(T 1) crystal of Ø 63 × 63 mm or Ø 63 × 160 mm size, cable reel with deep-sea cable and a tablet PC for data processing and <b>displaying.</b> The <b>container</b> withstands static hydraulic pressure up to 5 MPa and can be used for measurements at depths of 500 m maximum. Probe measures energy distribution of gammaradiation with energy from 70 keV to 3000 keV. The implemented three-dimensional system for detection device position and orientation determination allows automatic operation of the device (without operator) for water areas or bottom sediment scanning. The spectrometer can output measurement results with threedimensional geographical coordinates as index maps of distribution with necessary resolution and accuracy. Monte Carlo models of spectrometer and controlled objects are developed in order to determine the detector response functions to given radionuclides in given measurement geometries without use of expensive standard measures of activity. Multifunction gamma-spectrometer for in situ radiation monitoring of water areas and bottom sediments was developed and constructed. In the result of theoretical researches the response functions have been calculated in the form of theoretical spectra of monitored radionuclides in definite measuring geometries. The results of mathematical modeling of the gamma-emitting transfer process allowed to estimate effective position of detection device for in situ measurements of specific activity radionuclides 134 Cs and 137 Cs in bottom sediments.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Degradation {{kinetics}} of carbohydrate {{fraction of}} commercial concentrate feeds for weaned calves, heifers, lactating and dry dairy cattleVariations in composition and disappearance of nutrients in dairy cattle feeds are dictated by ingredients, methods of processing, storage while milk production levels {{depend on the}} animal, environmental factors and largely on pools of available carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals in the concentrate feeds.

Acute induced stress prior to a cognitive test are known to affect the judgement of a stimulus, but personality of an individual could also affect learning of a specific cognitive paradigm. Here, we assessed if adult laying hens’ behaviour and physiological responses, as indicators of their personality, were related to their cognitive performance. We assessed their behavioural responses to a tonic immobility test, an open field test, and a manual restraint test, and measured plasma corticosterone levels after manual restraint. After that, hens (n = 20) were trained in a pre-set training schedule to associate a colour-cue with a reward. In a two-choice go–go test, hens needed to choose between a baited or non-baited food <b>container</b> <b>displayed</b> randomly on {{the left or right}} side of an arena. Success in learning was related to personality, with better performance of hens which showed a reactive personality type by a long latency to walk, struggle or vocalize during the tests. Only eight out of 20 hens reached the training criteria. The non-learners showed a strong side preference during all training days. Side preferences were strong in hens with high levels of plasma corticosterone and with a long duration of tonic immobility, indicating that fearful, stress-sensitive hens are more prone to develop side biases. Our results show that learning can be hindered by side biases, and fearful animals with a more proactive personality type are more sensitive to develop such biases. </p...|$|R
30|$|As {{long as the}} {{acceptance}} of the ‘SVHC right to know’ is not increasing considerably and as long as SVHCs may still be present in consumer articles, additional approaches should be pursued. In this survey, SVHC information on the packaging was by far the most preferred information source at the point of sale (Questions 27). Especially, ingredient lists enjoyed great acceptance. Three quarters of the study participants indicated to use them as information source (Question 8) {{and more than half of}} the study participants trusted them (Question 10) [10]. The full declaration of ingredients of an article on the container or on an instruction leaflet as described previously could be a successful advancement [8, 10, 26]. This was the favourite proposal for improving the ‘SVHC right to know’ given by nearly half of the participants (Question 27) and mentioned by several persons who made comments, while there was no clear favourite among the various other options for information on the packaging (pictograms, names of SVHCs, traffic light system, etc.) (Question 27). Such a full ingredient list should include all ingredients above a concentration of 0.1 % (or below if there are lower thresholds in other regulations) and could be <b>displayed</b> on the <b>containers</b> in a similar way as on cosmetic products [38]. This idea of transparency about ingredients in products is nothing new, but corresponds to the initiative of the Chemicals in products programme (SAICM) pursued by the United Nations [39]. However, ingredient lists as exclusive hazard communication instruments are not consumer-friendly as they burden the consumer with the responsibility to understand the names and assess what the presence of a substance means in a certain product, as shown for personal care products [40]. Ingredient lists are also difficult to implement due to knowledge deficits of article suppliers about all the substances in their articles and due to space limitations on the containers, especially for complex products. Therefore, these suggestions should not replace the best strategy of all: the substitution of SVHCs by less harmful alternatives or non-chemical solutions as soon as possible. Nearly half of the respondents wished that SVHCs should be prohibited (Question 27). In 2018, the European Commission has strengthened the importance of substitution of SVHCs in the comprehensive REACH Review (Action 5 [28]). The ban of SVHCs is also in favour for persons who are not interested in the ingredients in their consumer products, but, of course, have also the right to use consumer products which do not harm their health and the environment without special precautionary efforts.|$|R
40|$|An urgent {{problem for}} {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{is that the}} water solubility of an estimated 40 - 70 % of the newly developed active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are so poor that they cannot be formulated on their own. One interesting topic is to use molecular containers as the solubilizing agents. Supramolecular chemistry {{has always been an}} interesting research area and during the past decades, various new supramolecular host*guest systems have been developed. Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) are very promising molecular containers as drug delivery vehicles due to their outstanding recognition properties. In order to discover the most suitable CB[n]-type containers as solubilizing agents, acyclic CB[n]-type containers have been synthesized and their recognition and formulation properties have been studied. In this thesis, three chapters have been included to investigate the possibility of using CB[n]-type containers as solubilizing agents for pharmaceutical agents. 	Chapter 1 gives an introduction to supramolecular chemistry and formulation techniques using molecular containers. A literature review on the synthesis, functionalization and applications of cucurbit[n]uril is given and the application of cyclodextrins and CB[n] containers in formulation techniques is discussed. 	Chapter 2 describes a series of acyclic CB[n]-type molecular containers (II- 2 a - II- 2 h) with different solubilizing groups bearing different charges for evaluation as potential drug solubilizing agents. The X-ray crystal structures of the negative, positive and neutral hosts (host II- 2 b, II- 2 f, and II- 2 h) are reported. For neutral (II- 2 h) and positively charged (II- 2 f) hosts, intramolecular H-bonds and ion-dipole interactions between the solubilizing arms and the ureidyl C=O portals are observed as well as intrahost &# 960;&# 8722;&# 960; stacking interactions which results in a self-filling of the cavity. 1 H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy are used to measure the Ka values of hosts II- 2 a, II- 2 h, and II- 2 f toward guests with different charge and significant decrease is noted in binding affinities of the neutral (II- 2 h) and positive (II- 2 f). The pKa of 7 H+ alone and in the presence of differently charged hosts II- 2 a, II- 2 h, and II- 2 f are measured and the II- 2 a induces the largest pKa shift. The poor recognition properties of hosts II- 2 h and II- 2 f are reflected in their phase-solubility diagrams with insoluble drugs (tamoxifen, 17 -&# 945;-ethynylestradiol, and indomethacin). In all cases, the anionic host II- 2 a functions more efficiently as a solubilizing agent than either neutral II- 2 h, or cationic host II- 2 f. 	In chapter 3, we compare the ability of III- 1 a - III- 1 e to solubilize insoluble drugs relative to HP-&# 946;-CD. Phase solubility diagrams are created for mixtures of containers III- 1 a - III- 1 e and HP- &# 946;-CD with 19 drugs. We find that the solubilizing ability of the best container (III- 1 a - III- 1 e) is superior to HP-&# 946;-CD in all cases. A notable achievement is the solubilization of the developmental anticancer agent PBS- 1086. The acyclic CB[n]-type <b>containers</b> <b>display</b> an affinity for the steroid ring system, aromatic moieties of insoluble drugs, and cationic ammonium groups. Compound III- 1 b is generally the most potent (Ka up to and exceeding 106 M- 1) container whereas both III- 1 a and III- 1 b display excellent solubility enhancement toward a broad range of insoluble drugs. The broad scope of insoluble drugs that can be formulated with III- 1 a and III- 1 b - in many cases where HP- &# 946;-CD fails completely - makes acyclic CB[n]-type containers particularly attractive alternatives to cyclodextrins as solubilizing excipients for practical applications...|$|R
40|$|AIM The aim of {{the study}} was to assess health hazards posed by {{pesticide}} handling, storage and use on agricultural estates and small farms in Tanzania where coffee, cotton, and other important crops are grown, with a view to developing strategies for the control of pesticide exposure and prevention of pesticide poisoning. METHODS The target population was made up of farmers and other agricultural workers applying pesticides in coffee and cotton farms, as well as of non-agricultural control subjects, health care providers and extension workers in the same areas. -Background data were collected -Focused observations of target farms carried out, -Erythrocyte-acetylcholinesterase and organochlorine residue levels in blood samples determined and -Extensive interviews of agricultural workers, control subjects, health care providers, and extension service workers conducted. RESULTS Background data A total of 104 pesticide chemical names and 179 trade names were compiled in Tanzania. Most of the pesticides were organophosphates, but carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids were also represented. The pesticides included aldrin, endosulfan, DDT, dieldrin, camphechlor and lindane, which are either endocrine disruptors or persistent organic pollutants, and were banned or restricted in their countries of origin. Some were classified by World Health Organization as extremely or highly hazardous. For the period 1989 / 90, a total of 736 pesticide-poisoning cases were reported in the Tanzanian in-patient district hospital medical records with more women than men poisoned, however, the medical records were inadequate as they failed to show the cause or type of poisoning. Focused observations More pesticide formulations were used on coffee compared with cotton, and in individually owned compared with cooperative farms. Coffee farms more often <b>displayed</b> unlabeled pesticide <b>containers</b> and missing instructions, while cotton pesticides were stored in bedrooms, near food, and near open fires, and pesticide leftovers were often present. Hazardous practices were more pronounced at the individually owned than the cooperative farms, with significant differences for pesticide storage areas, unlabeled and non-original containers. Acute health effects Assessment of the extent and intensity of organophosphate exposure showed that erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activities during spraying and non-spraying period were comparable. Similarly, the prevalence of cough, headache, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting did not differ significantly between spraying and non-spraying periods. There was no suggestion of decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in exposed subjects who complained of organophosphate­related symptoms compared to symptomless exposed subjects. Use of boots, head cover, face cover, and coverall was not significantly associated with acetylcholinesterase activity. Pesticide knowledge and practices in health care and agricultural extension services. Eighty per cent of 104 health care providers interviewed reported to have seen pesticide poisoning, nine having seen two to four cases in the preceding three months. Pesticide poisoning was considered a major problem in the community by 63 % of the health care providers, and a third thought that a number of poisoning cases remained unrecognised. Only one percent of the respondents could identify the group of pesticides predominantly used in the study areas. Only every fourth of the agricultural extension workers perceived pesticides as a major health problem in the community they served. Although high proportion claimed knowledge of first aid procedures in case of pesticide poisoning, many procedures described were not appropriate for the treatment of pesticide poisoning. CONCLUSION Pesticide handling-practices on farms increased the risks of exposure of farm workers and their families to pesticides, thus undermining pesticide safety in many small farms in Tanzania. There was no strong indication for adverse effects of organophosphorus pesticides during the study period, either based on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase or on symptoms. However, a great concern over potential long-term effects arising from the use of pesticides in these areas is eminent because pesticides suspected of long-term adverse effects are being used in hazardous work and living conditions. The extensionists were not aware of the health effects of pesticides and did not know what measures should be taken in case of poisoning. The failure of health care providers to distinguish the pesticide class, e. g. organophosphates and organochlorines, reflects a lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of diagnosis and treatment of pesticide poisoning, and may have a great impact on the prognosis. It also undermines the medical recording system especially for pesticide poisoning incidences. Therefore, pesticide exposures need to be reduced. Health care provides and extensionists need empowerment for prevention and treatment of adverse health effects.

RESULTS Background data A total of 104 pesticide chemical names and 179 trade names were compiled in Tanzania. Most of the pesticides were organophosphates, but carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids were also represented. The pesticides included aldrin, endosulfan, DDT, dieldrin, camphechlor and lindane, which are either endocrine disruptors or persistent organic pollutants, and were banned or restricted in their countries of origin. Some were classified by World Health Organization as extremely or highly hazardous. For the period 1989 / 90, a total of 736 pesticide-poisoning cases were reported in the Tanzanian in-patient district hospital medical records with more women than men poisoned, however, the medical records were inadequate as they failed to show the cause or type of poisoning. Focused observations More pesticide formulations were used on coffee compared with cotton, and in individually owned compared with cooperative farms. Coffee farms more often <b>displayed</b> unlabeled pesticide <b>containers</b> and missing instructions, while cotton pesticides were stored in bedrooms, near food, and near open fires, and pesticide leftovers were often present. Hazardous practices were more pronounced at the individually owned than the cooperative farms, with significant differences for pesticide storage areas, unlabeled and non-original containers. Acute health effects Assessment of the extent and intensity of organophosphate exposure showed that erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activities during spraying and non-spraying period were comparable. Similarly, the prevalence of cough, headache, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting did not differ significantly between spraying and non-spraying periods. There was no suggestion of decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in exposed subjects who complained of organophosphate­related symptoms compared to symptomless exposed subjects. Use of boots, head cover, face cover, and coverall was not significantly associated with acetylcholinesterase activity. Pesticide knowledge and practices in health care and agricultural extension services. Eighty per cent of 104 health care providers interviewed reported to have seen pesticide poisoning, nine having seen two to four cases in the preceding three months. Pesticide poisoning was considered a major problem in the community by 63 % of the health care providers, and a third thought that a number of poisoning cases remained unrecognised. Only one percent of the respondents could identify the group of pesticides predominantly used in the study areas. Only every fourth of the agricultural extension workers perceived pesticides as a major health problem in the community they served. Although high proportion claimed knowledge of first aid procedures in case of pesticide poisoning, many procedures described were not appropriate for the treatment of pesticide poisoning. CONCLUSION Pesticide handling-practices on farms increased the risks of exposure of farm workers and their families to pesticides, thus undermining pesticide safety in many small farms in Tanzania. There was no strong indication for adverse effects of organophosphorus pesticides during the study period, either based on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase or on symptoms. However, a great concern over potential long-term effects arising from the use of pesticides in these areas is eminent because pesticides suspected of long-term adverse effects are being used in hazardous work and living conditions. The extensionists were not aware of the health effects of pesticides and did not know what measures should be taken in case of poisoning. The failure of health care providers to distinguish the pesticide class, e. g. organophosphates and organochlorines, reflects a lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of diagnosis and treatment of pesticide poisoning, and may have a great impact on the prognosis. It also undermines the medical recording system especially for pesticide poisoning incidences. Therefore, pesticide exposures need to be reduced. Health care provides and extensionists need empowerment for prevention and treatment of adverse health effects...|$|R
