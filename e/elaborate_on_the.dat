5|$|Verses 1–10 of chapter 8 <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{practice}} of Dharana or meditation {{to train the}} mind in {{the consciousness of the}} self. The five elements in the universe correspond to five body functional systems, and that systems are gods residing within the human body. The next level of meditation is to fix one's undistracted attention to these five, while simultaneously performing the breath exercises mastered in the previous step.|$|E
5|$|The player battles {{through the}} game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by friendly non-player characters. Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. Blue Shift {{also includes a}} substantial section dedicated to keeping a major character in the story safe from enemy characters, and escorting him to a specific location. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts. The player also encounters human opponents {{in the form of}} a detachment of US Marines who have been sent to eliminate the alien threat and silence any witnesses. Blue Shift does not <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> storyline in , the preceding expansion pack, and no enemy characters or weapons introduced in it appear in the game. The player is instead given access to a limited selection of Half-Lifes original weaponry.|$|E

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is one {{of several}} tribute albums for American folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie. Guthrie died in 1967 after an {{extended}} battle with Huntington's disease, but his abbreviated career helped to inspire innumerable musicians during his lifetime {{as well as in the}} 1960s folk revival movement. Initially, this project was announced as a Farrar solo album with Johnson as a contributor. It was intended to follow previous efforts to <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> archives of the Foundation by Billy Bragg and Wilco with the albums Mermaid Avenue (1998) and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II (2000), Blackfire's Woody Guthrie Singles (2003), Jonatha Brooke's The Works (2008), and the various artists compilation Note of Hope: A Celebration of Woody Guthrie (2011). Farrar was initially invited to collaborate with Bragg on the Mermaid Avenue sessions in 1995, but felt uncomfortable working on the material with someone else. Warner Bros. Records wanted all of Son Volt to collaborate with Bragg, but after Farrar declined, he kept the idea in mind. In 2006, he approached Nora Guthrie about returning to her father's lyrics and she agreed.|$|E

25|$|Engels' {{ideas on}} the role of {{property}} {{in the creation of the}} modern family and as such modern civilization begin to become more transparent in the latter part of Chapter 2 as he begins to <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> question of the monogamous relationship and the freedom to enter into (or refuse) such a relationship. Bourgeois law dictates the rules for relationships and inheritances. As such, two partners, even when their marriage is not arranged, will always have the preservation of inheritance in mind and as such will never be entirely free to choose their partner. Engels argues that a relationship based on property rights and forced monogamy will only lead to the proliferation of immorality and prostitution.|$|E

25|$|Guinevere {{has been}} portrayed as {{everything}} from a weak and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous gentlewoman. In Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility, while in Marie de France's Lanval (and Thomas Chestre's Middle English version, Sir Launfal), she is a vindictive adulteress, disliked by the protagonist and all well-bred knights. Early chronicles tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all, while later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who played a larger role. The works of Chrétien {{were some of the}} first to <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien's audience at the time, the court of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, which was composed of courtly ladies who played highly social roles.|$|E
25|$|Foreign (non-US citizen) {{students}} applying {{from another}} country form a large and growing percentage of applicants (including accepted applicants) to American universities. According to Andover counseling director Sean Logan, applications to American universities from foreign students have increased dramatically in the past decade. International applications are typically similar to domestic ones but with additional complications. Most international applicants do not receive a GPA score or transcript from their school. Most will not normally take SAT or ACT exams, so these must be arranged. Most American universities are happy to accept international and foreign qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or IB, or British A Levels, although it is often up to the applicant to <b>elaborate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> meaning of these qualifications. Non-native English speakers {{may be asked to}} provide English language qualifications. If a university requires or offers an interview, these can normally be conducted over the phone or with alumni residing in the applicant's country, according to Uni in the USA, a guide book catering to the growing number of British students seeking to study in the United States. International applicants often must cope with higher tuition fees and less available financial aid, although this varies significantly by college. Further, international applicants also have to apply for a student visa, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.|$|E

Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo.
