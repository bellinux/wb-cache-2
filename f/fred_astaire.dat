This changed at their first paid concert, when an announcer forgot what the band was called and used the song title for the group's name. They decided to keep the moniker, and have largely been billed as such ever since. Prior to that, Butthole Surfers performed under a different name at every live show. Early aliases included The Dick Clark Five, Nine cm Worm Makes Own Food, The Vodka Family Winstons, Ashtray Babyheads, Ed Asner Is Gay, <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> Asshole, The Right To Eat <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> Asshole, The Inalienable Right To Eat <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> Asshole, and many others.|$|R

5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire</b> took a shine to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter by the pool. Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire</b> and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and Citizen Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to Peter Pan in 1953.|$|E

5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire,</b> Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E
5|$|Pandro Bermanâ€”who {{had filled}} in on three {{previous}} occasionsâ€”accepted {{the position of}} production chief on a noninterim basis. As it turned out, he would leave the job before the decade's turn, but his brief tenure resulted {{in some of the}} most notable films in studio history, including Gunga Din, with Grant and McLaglen; Love Affair, starring Dunne and Charles Boyer; and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (all 1939). Charles Laughton, who gave a now fabled performance as Quasimodo in the latter, returned periodically to the studio, headlining six more RKO features. For Maureen O'Hara, who made her American screen debut in the film, it was the first of ten pictures she would make for RKO through 1952. After co-starring with Ginger Rogers for the ninth time in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire</b> departed the studio.|$|E
5|$|Her next {{role was}} as Natasha Rostova in the 1956 film {{adaptation}} of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 1957 Hepburn starred with Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier in Billy Wilder's Love in the Afternoon, and with <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire</b> {{in the musical}} film Funny Face. Two years later she appeared in the romantic adventure film Green Mansions, and played a nun in The Nun's Story. In 1961, Hepburn played cafÃ© society girl Holly Golightly in the romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany's, and as a teacher accused of lesbianism in Wyler's drama The Children's Hour opposite Shirley MacLaine. Two years later she appeared opposite Cary Grant in the romantic mystery film Charade. Hepburn followed this by starring in the romantic comedy Paris When It Sizzles opposite William Holden, and as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the musical film My Fair Lady (both in 1964). In 1967, she played a blind woman menaced by drug dealers {{in her own home}} in the suspense thriller Wait Until Dark which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Nine years later, Hepburn played Maid Marian opposite Sean Connery as Robin Hood in Robin and Marian.|$|E
5000|$|Gay Divorce is {{a musical}} {{with music and}} lyrics by Cole Porter and book by Dwight Taylor, adapted by Kenneth Webb and Samuel Hoffenstein.

500|$|Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene {{gave the}} film a {{generally}} positive review, describing {{the film as}} [...] "a vehicle for <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> genius", and noting that Astaire's performance eliminated any concern {{over the fact that}} [...] "the music and lyrics are bad" [...] or that Astaire [...] "has to act with human beings [...] his freedom, lightness, and happiness".|$|R
5|$|In the 1920s, {{the street}} became a centre for nightclubs, {{attracting}} clientele such as Edward, Prince of Wales, Rudolph Valentino, NoÃ«l Coward, <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire</b> and Charlie Chaplin. The CafÃ© de Paris opened in 1924 {{in the basement}} of the Rialto Cinema (which had opened in 1913) and became a popular club through the rest of the decade because of the owner Martin Poulsen's friendship with the Prince of Wales. On 8 March 1941, the Cafe and much of Coventry Street suffered significant damage from bombing as part of the Blitz, killing 84 people including Poulsen, though former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, visiting the cafe, survived. Owing to a lack of water, a leg wound had to be washed with champagne as it was the only suitable substance to hand. The restaurant was rebuilt after the war and became a private venue in 1957. The Flamingo Club, a jazz nightclub, started on Coventry Street in 1952. It moved in 1957 to Wardour Street, where it became a popular venue for British rhythm and blues.|$|E
5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was at Paramount Pictures for {{producer}} Roger Edens. Funny Face contains {{four of the}} original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical {{of the same name}} that had starred <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire.</b> Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and Audrey Hepburn's Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers â€“ owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp VistaVision. Funny Face was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from critics like Crowther. Sight and Sound, in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.|$|E

50|$|In {{his role}} as adviser to the film, George M. Cohan, who admired <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> work, {{let it be known}} that he {{preferred}} Astaire, who also bore a passing resemblance to him, to star in his life story. Warners first offered him the role but Astaire turned it down because Cohan's eccentric, stiff-legged dancing was far removed from Astaire's own, more fluid, style.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene {{gave the}} film a {{generally}} positive review, describing {{the film as}} [...] "a vehicle for <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> genius", and noting that Astaire's performance eliminated any concern {{over the fact that}} [...] "the music and lyrics are bad" [...] or that Astaire [...] "has to act with human beings cannot match his freedom, lightness, and happiness".|$|R
50|$|Johnson & Johnson's Pop Art print {{approach}} to jackets and shirts earned the label {{a place in}} the V&A's 1974 traveling exhibition The Fabric Of Pop. A jacket featuring a print of <b>Fred</b> <b>Astaire's</b> face from the 1935 film Top Hat attracted the attention of the movie-star's daughter Ava, who obtained one for her father. Astaire subsequently sent Johnson a photograph of himself wearing it.|$|R
