5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich <b>in</b> <b>rhyme.</b> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E

25|$|Arabic {{dictionaries}} {{were compiled}} between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words <b>in</b> <b>rhyme</b> order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical {{order of the}} radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, {{such as those of}} terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the Lisan al-`Arab (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and al-Qamus al-Muhit (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The Qamus al-Muhit is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the Lisan and the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{deceptive}} simplicity <b>in</b> <b>rhyme</b> and meter, [...] "Trees" [...] {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of personification and anthropomorphic imagery: the tree of the poem, which Kilmer depicts as female, is depicted as pressing its mouth to the Earth's breast, looking at God, and raising its [...] "leafy arms" [...] to pray.

500|$|According to {{author and}} poet Kevin Coval, Nas “raise {{the bar for}} MCs” by {{advancing}} his lyricism “from punch lines and hot lines to whole thought pictures manifest <b>in</b> <b>rhyme</b> form.” Together with Paul Beatty’s seminal collection of poems, Joker Joker Deuce (1994) Coval cites the release of Illmatic as a [...] "generational moment" [...] that marked the development of hip hop poetry. Just as hip-hop poetics were being written and published {{for the first time}} on paper, Nas provided a sonic production that definitively captured [...] "the poetic response" [...] to hip hop music. “It is from this point on,” he writes, “that style, technique and craft merge with collage/pastiche, braggadocio, stark portrait-painting from the margins, frenetic, fun and funny wordplay, and the rupture of linear storytelling schemes. These become tropes in a burgeoning school of American letters that's moving toward an aesthetics of hip-hop poetics." ...|$|E

[...] "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts" [...] makes references to Superman, whose fictional hometown of Metropolis was partially modeled after Chicago (the town of Metropolis, Illinois has also capitalized on this association). Jessica Hopper of the Chicago Reader noted that Ray Middleton—who was the first actor to play the comic book superhero—was also born in Chicago. [...] "They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!" [...] makes references to ghost towns of Illinois. Stevens relates experiences from a summer camp he went to {{as a child in}} Michigan for [...] "The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!", but moved the locale to Illinois {{for the sake of the}} album. The track [...] "Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!" [...] includes references to Decatur, Illinois, but Stevens stated the track also acted as [...] "an exercise <b>in</b> <b>rhyme</b> schemes". Some references to Decatur included in the song were alligator sightings in the area, the equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, and a flood that exhumed a graveyard of soldiers from the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Irene {{has never}} been the most admired of Johnson's works. [...] Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and {{beautiful}} language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama. [...] Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [...] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, [...] "Sir, I thought it had been better."' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: [...] "Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is enough to say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama." [...] T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault. [...] The play would be more readable to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech. [...] What would be mellifluous <b>in</b> <b>rhyme,</b> is merely monotonous without it.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia {{released}} its first Three Stooges short, Woman Haters (1934), where their stooge characters were not quite fully formed.
