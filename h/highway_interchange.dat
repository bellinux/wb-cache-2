5|$|Financing of {{the arena}} project was difficult. Terrace had four {{financing}} deals fail. As {{it became clear that}} the Senators could not finance a needed <b>highway</b> <b>interchange</b> without government backing, the Government of Ontario was persuaded successfully to provide a $27 million loan for the <b>highway</b> <b>interchange</b> construction. In the end, the firm of Ogden Entertainment, a New York City facilities management firm, backed the project with a $20 million loan in exchange for a 30-year contract to manage the facility. In addition, American banks loaned $110 million, the federal government gave the Senators $6 million, $10 million from Terrace and $15 million from a Canadian pension fund.|$|E
5|$|South of Mill Point Road to Roe Highway {{the freeway}} has three lanes in each direction, without any bus lanes except for bus-only ramps at the Canning Bridge interchange. At the Roe <b>Highway</b> <b>interchange,</b> an extra {{southbound}} lane is added, providing four lanes southbound and two lanes northbound, until the Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive interchange in Cockburn, where the freeway {{is reduced to}} two lanes in each direction until Pinjarra Road. Works are currently underway to add an extra lane southbound between Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive, and Russell Road in Hammond Park. The median strip of the freeway north of The Spectacles also houses the Mandurah railway line. A shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside the freeway.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{was broken}} for the highway project in April 2006, with major {{construction}} beginning in May. Caltrans estimated completion in late 2009 for {{the completion of}} the four-lane expressway, including a new directional interchange at each end, at which State Route 70 and State Route 99 will exit and enter {{to the right of the}} main Oroville-Chico movement. Most access was closed, with Shippee Road providing the sole at-grade crossing of the expressway, and an overcrossing near State Route 70 giving access to local property. Shippee Road was relocated to the southeast, allowing for the future construction of an interchange. In addition, State Route 70 was relocated to the west between SR 149 and State Route 191, and local access on State Route 99 between SR 149 and the Durham Dayton <b>Highway</b> <b>interchange</b> was replaced by frontage roads. The entire project was completed in November 2008, at a cost of $125 million.|$|E

25|$|Holmes Foundry, Ltd. – AMC's block-casting foundry {{was a major}} AMC factory {{which is}} now {{completely}} obliterated. Holmes had its main office and foundry at 200 Exmouth Street, Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Holmes was established in 1918, by Mr. J. S. Blunt, and was called Holmes Blunt Limited. In the early years, Ford Motor Company contracted the plant for {{a steady supply of}} engine casting blocks. This factory had a reputation locally as a dirty, dangerous place to work. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, AMC contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply AMC with cylinder block castings. American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966. In July 1970, AMC acquired 100% of Holmes Foundry through an exchange of shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. However, it was not until October 1981 that Holmes Foundry finally became a Division of American Motors, Canada. As part of its acquisition of AMC in 1987, Chrysler Corporation took ownership of the Holmes facility and its manufacturing business, but closed the operation on September 16, 1988. The industrial facilities were cleaned of their environmental contaminants in 2005, in preparation for a new <b>highway</b> <b>interchange</b> to be built on the site.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the {{rezoning}} {{was approved}} with conditions.

Only the lands to the south of the 417 were allowed to be developed, and the lands on the north side of the 417 were to remain farmland. According to Firestone, Terrace's investment lost $80 million in value to secure the zoning. Eventually, the strain to complete the payment on the franchise to the NHL and to build the arena led to Firestone's resignation on August 17, 1993, after Terrace missed mortgage and development payments. He was replaced as club president by Bryden, who would lead the franchise for the next ten years.|$|E
