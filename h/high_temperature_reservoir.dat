The low efficiency of solar ponds is usually justified with the argument that the 'collector', being just a plastic-lined pond, might potentially result in a large-scale system that is of lower overall levelised energy cost than a solar concentrating system.|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} decades, CO 2 {{flooding}} {{has been used}} as a successful method for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

In this paper, we present results of investigations on injection of low temperature CO 2 into a high-pressure high-temperature micromodel with injection temperature range from 34 to 75 °F. Effect of temperature and saturation changes of different fluids are measured in each case. The results prove the proposed method.

The modeled system begins as a hot water geothermal reservoir, and evolves through time into a vapor-dominated reservoir with a HTR at depth. This approach taken here to develop a vapor-dominated system {{is similar to that of}} Pruess (1985), and involves induced boiling through venting. The reservoir description is intentionally generic, but serves to describe a means of evolution of conditions observed (in particular) at The Geysers. This study addresses the question of HTR formation numerically. The reservoir model and approach used is similar to that of Pruess (1985); however, vapor pressure lowering effects were included for the rock matrix. Results of this study indicate that a <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>reservoir</b> may occur as a steady state component of a "typical" vapor-dominated reservoir. Fractures within the HTR are dry; however, saturated conditions exists in the rock matrix. Pressures at depth follow a vapor pressure with depth relationship. Temperatures at depth are large (relative to saturated conditions) because of superheat in the fractures and vapor pressure lowering in the matrix. Drying out the fracture network at depth appears to be what drives the system to form a high temperature reservoir; however, adsorption in the rock matrix allows for saturated conditions to prevail...|$|E
