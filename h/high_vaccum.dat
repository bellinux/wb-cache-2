40|$|By 355 nm laser ablating a {{composite}} target prepared from metallic lithium and ZnO in <b>high</b> <b>vaccum,</b> a new hypermetallic oxide LiZnO + ion, {{which consists of}} two heterometal atoms and oxygen atom, was observed by using a time of flight mass spectrometer for the first time. The time of flight positive ion mass spectra at different delay time between the accelerated electric field and laser pulse are investigated. It shows that the formation of LiOZn + depends on the delay time, and the hypervalent ion LiOZn + is observed obviously at the delay time from 7. 5 to 17. 5 μs. These {{results suggest that the}} ion molecular reaction between the ablated Li + ions and ZnO in the laser plasma should be responsible for the formation of hypermetallic LiZnO +...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{association}} of Ultra <b>High</b> <b>Vaccum</b> Chemical Vapor Deposition (UHVCVD) and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) to achieve III-V (GaP) integration on Si/Si(100) substrates. We first demonstrate that a very good flatness (0. 3 nm) can be obtained when growing directly GaP on a chemically prepared Si substrate. X-ray diffraction pole figure however demonstrates that a residual amount of micro-twins originating from the hetero-interface still remains. Silicon homoepitaxial buffer layer is then optimized in the UHVCVD chamber on different Si substrates misorientation (+/- 0. 15 - 6 °-off). A flat, clean and bistepped Si surface is achieved during the homoepitaxial growth on 6 °-off silicon substrates. Samples are then transferred under UHV conditions to the MBE chamber to perform GaP overgrowth. Keeping the same III-V overgrowth conditions, influence of silicon homoepitaxial buffer layer on micro-twins generation is determined quantitatively using Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction. We finally demonstrate that growing a flat, clean and bistepped silicon buffer layer on a 6 °-off substrate, and transferring it under UHV to the MBE chamber for GaP overgrowth reduces significantly the amount of anisotropic defects generated in the GaP epilayers...|$|E
40|$|Because of its novel {{physical}} properties, two-dimensional {{materials have}} attracted great attention. From first-principle calculations and vibration frequenceis analysis, we predict {{a new family}} of two-dimensional materials {{based on the idea}} of octet stability: honeycomb lattices of pnictogens (N, P, As, Sb, Bi). The buckled structures of materials come from the sp 3 hybridization. These materials have indirect band gap ranging from 0. 43 eV to 3. 7 eV. From the analysis of projected density of states, we argue that the s and p orbitals together are sufficient to describe the electronic structure under tight-binding model, and the tight-binding parameters are obtained by fitting the band structures to first-principle results. Surprisingly large on-site spin-orbit coupling is found for all the pnictogen lattices except nitrogen. Investigation on the electronic structures of both zigzag and armchair nanoribbons reveals the possible existence of spin-polarized ferromagnetic edge states in some cases, which are rare in one-dimensional systems. These edge states and magnetism may exist under the condition of <b>high</b> <b>vaccum</b> and low temperature. This new family of materials would have promising applications in electronics, optics, sensors, and solar cells. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{explores the}} {{formation}} of graphene layers on 3 C-SiC(111) epilayers grown on silicon substrates using thermal annealing under Ultra <b>High</b> <b>Vaccum</b> (UHV) environment. The formation of graphene is demonstrated by use of near field microscopy (STM and AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The evolution of the surface stoichiometry of the 3 C-SiC(111) pseudo substrates during the graphitization process {{is similar to that}} of the commonly used Si terminated α-SiC bulk substrates, starting from a Si rich to the C rich surface characterized by a () ° × 30 R 3636 diffraction pattern. Graphitization process leads to a strong modification of the surface at a microscopic scale which is compared to that reported in case of 6 H-SiC substrates. XPS spectra reveal the presence of typical C-C bonds related to a graphitic arrangement. Its high level of ordering is attested by the observation both of (6 × 6) SiC and (1 × 1) graphene surface reconstructions by STM. These results demonstrate {{the formation of}} graphene on 3 C-SiC(111) /Si pseudo substrates. They open perspectives for developing novel C/SiC/Si heterostructures and put light on the ability of 3 C-SiC/Si templates to become a low cost alternative of onerous α-SiC substrates...|$|E
40|$|RF {{electron}} guns with {{a strained}} super lattice GaAs cathode can generate polarized electron beam of higher brightness and lower emittance than do DC guns, {{due to their}} higher field gradient at the cathode's surface. In a normal conducting RF gun, the extremely <b>high</b> <b>vaccum</b> required by these cathodes can not be met. We report on an experiment with a superconducting SRF gun, which can maintain a vacuum of nearly 10 - 12 torr because of cryo-pumping at the temperature of 4. 2 K. With conventional activation, we obtained a QE of 3 % at 532 nm, with lifetime of nearly 3 days in the preparation chamber. We plan to use this cathode in a 1. 3 GHz 1 / 2 cell SRF gun to study its performance. In addition, we studied the multipacting {{at the location of}} cathode. A new model based on the Forkker-Planck equation which can estimate the bunch length of the electron beam is discussed in this paper. Future particle accelerators such as eRHIC and ILC require high brightness, high current polarized electrons Recently, using a superlattice crystal, the maximum polarization of 95 % was reached. Activation with Cs,O lowers the electron affinity and makes it energetically possible for all the electrons excited in to the conduction band and reach the surface to escape into the vacuum. Presently the polarized electron sources are based on DC gun, such as that at the CEBAF at Jlab. In these devices, the life time of the cathode is extended due to the reduced back bombardment in their UHV conditions. However, the low accelerating gradient of the DC guns lead to poor longitudinal emittance. The higher accelerating gradient of the RF gun generates low emittance beams. Superconducting RF guns combine the excellent vacuum conditions of the DC guns with the higher accelerating gradients of the RF guns and provide potentially a long lived cathode with very low transverse and longitudinal emittance. In our work at BNL, we successfully activated the GaAs. The quantum efficient is 3 % at 532 nm and is expected to improve further. In addition, we studied the multipacting at the location of cathode. A new model based on the Forkker-Planck equation which can estimate the bunch length of the electron beam is discussed in this paper...|$|E
