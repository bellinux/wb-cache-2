Conventionally, soil texture has been determined in the laboratory using pipette and <b>hydrometer</b> <b>methods</b> requiring significant amount of time, labor, and cost. Recently, in-situ soil texture classification systems using optical diffuse reflectometry or mechanical resistance have been reported, especially for precision agriculture that needs more data than conventional agriculture.

Issues investigated in this study were effects of sensor travel speed and light source and intensity on image quality. When travel speed of image sensor increased from 0 to 10 mm/s, travel distance and number of pixel were increased to 3. 30 mm and 9. 4, respectively. This travel distances were not negligible even at a speed of 2 mm/s (i. e., 0. 66 mm and 1. 4), and image degradation was significant. Tests for effects of illumination intensity showed that 7 to 11 Lux seemed a good condition minimizing shade and reflection.

Soil texture has traditionally been determined in the laboratory using pipette and <b>hydrometer</b> <b>methods</b> that require {{a considerable amount of}} time, labor, and expense.

This paper is a part of overall research to develop a soil texture classification system using image processing. Application of image processing was motivated by simple traditional approaches such as visual inspection and the “hand–feel” method. In this paper, the potential of soil texture classification using RGB histograms was investigated. Seven sites representing major Korean paddy soil series were selected, 4 – 6 core samples up to a 50 –cm intervals. For each segmented soil sample, four surface images were taken using a miniaturized CCD camera, and texture fractions were determined by the pipette method. Scatter plots showed linear patterns between silt content and histogram variables such as brightness (averaged pixel value), skewness, and difference between mode value and brightness (“mode–brightness”). When 5 %–averaged silt content was linearly regressed with “mode–brightness”, squared correlation coefficient (R 2), root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC), and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) were 0. 96, 2. 2 %, and 6. 3 %, respectively.

It was found that this method might be improved in estimation accuracy if only manure from a single growth stage of pigs was used (e. g., nursery pig manure used here). The total solids (TS) content of the test manure was well correlated with the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the manure, with highly significant correlation coefficients of 0. 9944 and 0. 9873, respectively. Also observed were good linear correlations between the TN and TP contents and the manure specific gravity (correlation coefficients: 0. 9836 and 0. 9843, respectively). These correlations were much better than those reported by past researchers, in which lumped data for pigs at different growing stages were used. It may therefore be inferred that developing different linear equations for pigs at different ages should improve the accuracy in manure nutrient estimation using a hydrometer. Also, the error of using the <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> to estimate manure TN and TP was found to increase, from ± 10 % to ± 50 %, with the decrease in TN (from 700 ppm to 100 ppm) and TP (from 130 ppm to 30 ppm) concentrations in the manure.

40|$|Introduction: As a {{mechanical}} tillage practices on soil preparation improve soil structure, increase in porosity, better distribution of soil aggregates and eventually modify the physical properties of soil. The use of nano-technology in agricultural science and its application in tillage {{for improving the}} physical properties and mechanical issues has grown substantially. Nanotechnology is an appropriate way to reduce soil limitations. However the nanoparticles are very small amounts in soil, due to features such as high surface area, surface charge (appearance) and sometimes porous nano-engineering of physical-chemical properties of soil are affected significantly (Mohammadi & Niazian, 2013). To use of nanomaterials in the territory of a new issue (Taipodia et al., 2011). Small developments {{on the use of}} nanoparticles to improve soil quality and land reform have been taken (Theron et al., 2008). Clay soil was used to enhance the compressive strength (Yonekura & Miwa, 1993). Nanosilica particle effects were examined for increasing resistance against penetration and consolidation (Noll et al., 1992). In 2005, these particles were used to increase adhesion and reduce viscosity. It seemed that the adhesion of the particles was depended on Nanosilica (Mohammadi & Niazian, 2013). The use of nanomaterials showed that the increased pH and soil fertility, improved soil physical structure, and reduced mobility, availability and toxicity of heavy metals and other environmental factors and those that will stabilize the soil components and subsides the erosion in the mining pick, (Lal, 2008). In agriculture, the soil conditioner studies have shown that nanoparticles can mine the soil quality by increasing water-holding capacity, increasing silt and clay and improve levels of nutrients, and eliminate toxins, (Liu and Lal, 2012). In this study, the effect on some physical and mechanical properties of soil contain clay gradation, Atterberg limits, specifications compression and shear parameters of soil were investigated. Materials and Methods: The study was done for 2 years at the Research Institute of Agricultural Engineering Soil Dynamics Laboratory in a completely randomized design with three replications. Soil samples were used for different soil textures. Three types of soil texture, light, medium and heavy were considered. Nanoclay has a mineral base and can improve the properties of the soil. Two levels of the nanoclay containing zero and one percent of the nanoclay, 3 to 6 treatments in different physical and mechanical tests were repeated. The test specimens were prepared in triplicate test and physical, mechanical and chemical testing was performed according to ASTM standard on all models. Mesh test samples were performed by sieve and <b>hydrometer</b> <b>methods</b> according to standard ASTM-D 422 - 98. Plastic soil properties were expressed by the Atterberg Limits, measure the ability to absorb water, soil and to a fine particle adhesion amount and type of fine particles in the soil. Psychological testing was performed to determine the extent and the paste according to ASTM-D 4318 - 98 standard. The maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of the soil compaction characteristics are the most important soil properties such as soil density development projects are in operation. In agricultural applications, in particular for tillage, these two factors are of particular importance. In this study, Praktor standard density testing was performed on the different treatments. In this research, not consolidate Undrained (UU) testing methods were used. The stress tests were done at three levels 100, 200 and 300 kPa respectively. Results and Discussion: Adding nanoparticles of clay significant impact {{on the size of the}} samples did not curve. As well as to determine the impact of nano-clay soil Plastic characteristics as psychological tests and the paste was treated on the results of these tests for different treatments and repeated ANOVA revealed a significant effect of soil type on soil Plastic characteristics. The type of control or significant influence characteristics Plastic application of nano regard. The optimum moisture content and maximum dry density values of each sample was extracted from the respective curves that their results suggest that addition of nanoclay had a considerable impact on the density profile. It was observed that the use of nanoparticles in soil reduced the average amount of cohesion and internal friction angle was large. This means that the increasing the nanoclay reduces the shear parameters and therefore the shear strength of the soil. This is very important in terms of tillage. Reducing the adhesion of soil particles allows the lumps are crushed with less energy. Conclusions: Based on the results of studies and experiments conducted in this study, the following conclusions can be extracted. -	Adding nanoparticles of clay soils affect the grading curve display. -	The effect of nanoclay had more psychological impact than the same amount in the dough. -	The results showed that the addition of nanoclay had a considerable impact on the density profile. -	The use of nanoparticles in soil reduced the average amount of cohesion and internal friction angle is large. -	Due to the increase of nano-clay soil, shear strength decreased as a result of the shear parameters...|$|R

The PSD can be determined by conventional sieve, <b>hydrometer,</b> and pipette <b>methods.</b> However, since the 1980 s, the PSD of soils has also been determined via the laser diffraction method, which is more reliable and faster and which can be used repeatedly. With this method there are two optical theories commonly used for the determination of PSD: the Mie and the Fraunhofer theories. The main difference between these theories is that the Mie theory requires the refractive index (RI) and absorption coefficient (AC) values of the particles and the RI value of the suspending medium, whereas the Fraunhofer theory does not. Although the Mie theory is more appropriate for soil samples, especial-ly for the determination of clay-size fraction, there are not yet agreed-upon values of RI and AC for soils samples that can be used by researchers and practitioners. In this study, acceptable values for RI and AC were investigated extensively by analyzing 35 natural soil samples that were mainly of sedimentary origin. Based on the results obtained, the values of 1. 55 and 0. 1 for RI and AC, respectively, are suggested for laser diffraction analysis of naturally occurring sedimentary soil samples with respect to geotechnical practices. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the pitfalls of using the Fraunhofer theory for the analysis of soil samples, especially for clay-size particles, the PSDs and clay-size fractions obtained from the Mie and Fraunhofer theories were also compared by setting different RI and AC values for the Mie theory...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Soil is a hardly {{renewable}} natural resource. Although soil degradation, {{caused by}} either human activities and natural processes {{is a relatively}} slow procedure, but its effects are long lasting and most often, irreversible in the time scale of man's life. Among the most significant soil contaminants resulting from both natural and human sources, heavy metals are more important due to their long- term toxicity effects. For evaluating soil's enrichment rate by heavy metals, a wide and full study of soils background values, including total and available fractions of heavy metal contents should be done. Zanjan province has some great mines and concentrating industries of lead and zinc especially in Angoran, Mahneshan. Unfortunately produced waste materials of these industries spread over the adjacent areas. Investigations showed that accumulation of some heavy metals in vegetables and crops planted in this region had occurred. Therefore, performing some investigations in these polluted areas and assessing pollution rate and heavy metals distribution in arable lands had prime importance. Our goals were: 1) determining the total and available amounts of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in the soils of arable lands in polluted areas of Zanjan city, 2) producing the distribution map for the metals mentioned above and 3) calculating pollution indices in the soils. Materials and Methods: The study area was in south west of Zanjan city. For soil sampling, a 1 Km by 1 Km grid defined in ArcGIS software on landuse layer and totally 144 points that placed on agricultural lands, due to our goals, were sampled. For sampling, in a 5 m radius around the point we collected some subsamples from depth of 0 - 15 cm, and after mixing the subsamples, finally a 1 Kg soil sample prepared {{and sent to the}} laboratory. Sampled soils were air dried and were passed through a 2 mm sieve. Soils organic matter (OM) content and texture were determined by Walkely-Black and Bouyoucos <b>hydrometer</b> <b>methods,</b> respectively. Soils pH were determined by glass/calomel electrode in saturation paste, EC by EC-meter in saturation paste extract, and calcium carbonate equivalent (lime) by reverse titration method. Total and available amounts of Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb were extracted by Aqua- Regia method (wet oxidation by chloridric acid and nitric acid with the 3 : 1 ratio) and by DTPA extracting solution, respectively. After extracting and filtering liquid samples, metal concentrations were measured by atomic adsorption method using GBC avanta P. Statistical analysis by SPSS and indices calculation by Excel were performed, and distribution maps were prepared by Inverse Distance Weighting method in ArcGIS software. For evaluating pollution rate, Geoaccumulation index, Enrichment factor and Availability Ratio indices were calculated and interpreted. Results and Discussion: The textures of soil samples were loam, clay loam and sandy loam. The OM contents of almost soils were less than 2 percent. Lime was less than 25 percent and acidity of soils were neutral to slightly alkaline. Soils salinity were less than 2 dS/m except a few samples. Accordingly, these soils were suitable for agriculture and there were no limitation due to evaluated properties. Median values for the total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn (extracted by Aqua Regia) were 0. 5, 22. 5, 14 and 82. 3 mg/Kg of soils, respectively, and for available fraction (extracted by DTPA) were 0. 1, 0. 9, 1. 6 and 3. 2 mg/Kg of soils that were much lower than measured total values. According to 90 th percentile of geoaccumulation index, at least 10 percent of samples had been polluted with Zn, Pb and Cd. Enrichment factor revealed no long term pollution. Availability ratios of Pb and Zn were relatively high, showing there exists unique and recent pollution source for them. All pollution indices showed positive correlations with OM content of soils (except for availability ratios of Cd, which had negative correlation). Therefore, OM content of soils were respect to control these indices. Geoaccumulation index of Zn, Cd and Pb, and availability ratios of Zn and Pb showed negative correlations with soil pH. Therefore, in some seasons of the year, their availabilities will increase in soil. Conclusion: The results showed that Cu content in soils were not in the critical limit but Cd, Pb and Zn content in soils were greater than standard levels and reclamation procedures for remedy of these soils must be done. The high values of the heavy metals in available fraction inthe soils increased the risk of bioaccumulation in microbial and biotic tissues. In areas where there are high content of available form of heavy metals in soils, it could be an index of new contamination in soils by heavy metals. According to geoaccumulation index of Cd, Zn and Pb, there are some contaminated points around waste depositition areas near Zanjan city. These points are in the direction that wind could effectively transport the particles of wastes to urban area. Enrichment factor (EF) showed that at least there were a few points polluted by Cd, Zn and Cu, although EF values were generally low. The leaked wastes of Zinc and lead industries had been spread in deposited areas caused difficulties in determining background values for the selected metals...|$|R

First, a metrological competence study of the dynamic gravimetric gas mass flow rate measurement standard of MIKES was carried out. Then, a theoretical and experimental study to clarify the varying shear stress on the cylindrical surfaces and its contribution to the combined standard uncertainty of a dynamic gravimetric gas mass flow rate standard was presented. A new mixing method for establishing a traceability link between air velocity standard and national standards of mass and time was developed. The method for compensating the effect of vertical density gradients in a liquid sample to the reading of a hydrometer was developed. In the dynamic gravimetric gas mass flow rate measurement method, the varying shear stress {{on the wall of}} the gas cylinder was studied by time averaging the instantaneous shear stress, calculated from the numerical similarity solution of laminar boundary layer equations. The model was studied experimentally by a balance combined with temperature measurements. The most commonly used primary standard in air velocity measurements is based on laser anemometry enabling the traceability to the SI base units of length and time. In this study, an alternative method of establishing the traceability link was developed. The method is based on humidification of air in the wind tunnel with the known mass flow rate of water. The air velocity can then be expressed as a function of humidification water mass flow rate enabling the traceability to the SI base units of mass and time. The method was studied in the wind tunnel of MIKES with a Pitot tube. The non-homogeneous vertical temperature distribution in the liquid sample causes errors in the reading of a hydrometer. In this thesis, a mathematical model for compensating for the effect of temperature gradients has been presented. The model was studied experimentally in the hydrometer calibration system at MIKES. The compensation model improves, for example, the accuracy of conversion between the mass and volume flow rate units.

Soil texture of each farm determined using the <b>Hydrometer</b> <b>method.</b> The results showed that weather conditions of sowing areas had no significant effect on emergence of oilseed rape. With increasing the temperature (within the range of 19. 5 to 21. 5 ˚C) emergence percentage was not increased significantly. Rainfall also caused no significant effect on seedling emergence. The percentage of emergence in machine-sowing and hand-sowing were 38. 4 % and 28 %, respectively. Soils with loam silt, silt clay loam and loam texture had emergence of 27. 2 %, 31. 2 % and 47 % respectively. It seems soil texture plays a great roll on the emergence of oilseed rape with epigeal seedlings...|$|E
30|$|Other {{environmental}} {{data were obtained}} either {{in the fall of}} 2010 or 2011. Three soil samples per site (< 5  m from the plots) were collected by cutting soil with a knife and measured the volume. Each sample was dried at 105 °C over 3  days and weighed to calculate a bulk density and water content. Another sample per site was collected for CN, pH, and texture tests. The percentage of C, N contents of soil was analyzed at the Forest Soils Laboratory at the UAF School of Natural Resources and Extension. Soil pH was tested using a pH test indicator (General Hydroponics-USA, Sebastopol, CA, USA). Texture was defined by Bouyoucos <b>Hydrometer</b> <b>Method.</b> In addition to sampling, soil volumetric water content was measured using a Hydrosense soil water measurement system (Cambell Scientific Inc., North Logan, UT, USA).|$|E
40|$|Current Waikato {{sediment}} {{retention pond}} design {{is based on}} guidelines developed by the Auckland Regional Council. As soils in the Auckland and Waikato Regions are different, {{there is a need}} to investigate the effectiveness of sediment retention ponds in retaining sediments from Waikato soil materials. The objectives of this study were to: i) do a comparison between pipette, <b>hydrometer</b> and lasersizer <b>methods</b> for determining soil particle size and to characterise the sand, silt and clay in a range of Waikato soil materials, ii) evaluate turbidity and suspended solid concentration between the inlet and outlet of sediment retention ponds, and iii) investigate the use of chemical treatment (flocculants) in assisting sediment settling. Ten samples representing a range of Waikato soil materials were collected. Particle size was determined using hydrometer, pipette and lasersizer analysis. The pipette and hydrometer gave similar results. Lasersizer analyses were similar to pipette-hydrometer analyses for six samples. The remaining four samples analysed by lasersizer did not give a close agreement to conventional methods. However, error bars showed that between-sample variability was not large. The pipette was found to be the most reliable method for determination of particle size, however the lasersizer gave fast measurements which were easily repeatable. The soil texture of the ten Waikato soil materials tested ranged from sand to clay. A rain gauge connected to an autowater sampler was installed at the inlet of two sediment retention ponds, one at SH 1 in Piarere and the other at a quarry in Ngaruawahia. Water samples were collected when rainfall reached 2 mm in the previous 30 minute period. Samples were analysed for turbidity and suspended solids. The sediment retention ponds at both sites were effective, reducing suspended solids and turbidity by at least 94 %. Water samples collected at Piarere showed a 94 % reduction in turbidity (from 558. 68 NTU to 35. 27 NTU) and a 97 % declination in suspended solids concentrations (from 2365. 63 mg/L to 78. 41 mg/L). Results from water samples collected at Ngaruawahia demonstrated a 97 % reduction in turbidity (from 491. 33 NTU to 14. 46 NTU) and a 95 % drop in suspended solids concentration (from 210. 43 mg/L to 9. 5 mg/L). Flocculants (Polyaluminium Chloride, PAC) were being used at the sediment retention pond at Ngaruawahia. Further investigation into the effectiveness of flocculants in removing sediments from the water column found that samples 1 and 2 collected from the Ngaruawahia study site and allophanic soil materials do not require treatment with flocculants. The recommended dose of 8 ppm/litre of PAC was sufficient to treat sediment runoff without lowering pH level to a point that might induce aluminium toxicity in aquatic life of downstream rivers and streams for Ngaruawahia 3 and coarse materials of Hinuera Formation. PAC doses of 2. 7 ppm in the Hamilton Ash materials and 5. 3 ppm in Hinuera Formation (fine materials) were sufficient to ensure flocculation. For the Piarere soil materials an 8 ppm PAC dose gave reasonable flocculation and 10. 7 ppm PAC further reduced the turbidity after 24 hours...|$|R
30|$|The {{components}} of SPA for our study were SOC, N, SOM, pH values, EC, P, K, Fe, sand, silt, and clay. The chemical analyses of soil attributes were {{performed at the}} “MIT Soil and Water Testing Laboratory”, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. The SPAs were analyzed by standard laboratory methods. Soil particle size (soil textures) distributions were determined by the Bouyoucos <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> (Bouyoucos 1927). The potassium dichromate method {{was used for the}} analysis of SOM content. Soil pH was determined in water with 1 : 2 (soil:water ratio) using a glass electrode pH meter (Eckert and Sims 1995) and EC in soil using a conductivity meter (Jackson 1973). The K concentrations of the soil extracts were calculated by a flame photometer (Jackson 1973). The SOC and N were determined by the Thermo Quest EA 1112 elemental analyzer. P was analyzed by calorimetrically (molybdenum blue) method.|$|E
30|$|The {{soil samples}} were {{analyzed}} for texture (sand, silt, and clay proportions), {{soil organic matter}} (SOM), organic carbon (OC), pH, bulk density, electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorous (P), available potassium (K), and exchangeable bases (K, Ca, Mg, and Na). The pH and texture of the soil were analyzed in 1 : 2.5 soil-to-water ratio suspensions using the Bouyoucos <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> (Bouyoucos 1962). Electrical conductivity was determined using the sodium saturation ratio (Van Reeuwijk 1992). Soil OC concentration was determined according to the Walkley and Black (1934) method, and soil OM concentration was calculated by multiplying the OC concentration {{by a factor of}} 1.724 (Brady 1990). The concentration of TN was determined using the Kjeldahl method (Jackson 1970). Available P and exchangeable K, Ca, and Na were analyzed according to Olsen et al. (1954). CEC was analyzed using an ammonium acetate method (Van Reeuwijk 1992).|$|E
30|$|Soil texture was {{estimated}} using <b>Hydrometer</b> <b>method.</b> Samples were oven dried at 105 (°C) for 24 h, and BD was calculated as oven dried mass per core volume. Gravimetric moisture content was calculated as {{the ratio of}} weight of water to weight of oven dry soil. It is a weight fraction calculated as subtracting weight of oven dried soil from initial fresh sample weight divided by dry weight of the sample. Following the methods described by Hao et al. (2008), for dry aggregate stability estimation, each undisturbed sample was air dried for seven days, and carefully added to nests of sieves, with a pan underneath, having 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.25, and 0.053 mm size arranged from top to bottom, respectively, on the shaker apparatus. Each sample {{was added to the}} top sieve and subjected to shaking for 30 s (Hao et al. 2008). The remained fraction on each sieve was weighed using sensitive digital balance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{particle}} size distribution of a fine portion of soils is usually determined using sedimentation principles and <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method.</b> Some hydrometer test methods, such as South African Standard (SANS 3001, 2014) and Guidelines laid by International Soil Reference and Information centre (ISRIC, 2002) make provision for {{the effect of the}} dispersing agent in the solution on readings recorded during the test. Test methods that do not make such provision may be incorrectly yielding inflated fines (including clay) contents. This paper discusses the results of an investigation into the effect of dispersants when applying TMH 1 (1986) test method. The results have been compared using phosphate dispersants such as Calgon, sodium pyrophos-phate decahydrate and sodium tetra pyrophosphate in various concentrations. The use of dispersants in higher concentrations produced anomalous increases in the hydrometer readings and the results indicated the im-portance of understanding the effect of dispersants on fine soil {{particle size}} distribution analyses...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} firstly {{establish}} the geological profile of an aquifer system, 129 different soil samples were extricated from test holes during an ongoing drilling project. The {{samples were collected}} from the cuttings and {{were sent to the}} laboratory for further analysis. Afterwards, all the samples were tested and experimented for grain-size distribution using the standard procedures of BS 1377. Samples with coarser particles were analysed by using the dry sieve analysis which operated on a series of sorted BS sieves. On the other hand, <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> was utilised to observe the finer samples. This test is important as to pinpoint the percentage of different grain sizes contained from BH 1 to BH 22, TW 1 to TW 4 and riverbed soil (right river, middle river and left river). On that note, it should be mentioned that the methods and analyses performed in this investigation closely followed the British Standard 1377 : Part 2 : 1990. Generally, the sieve analysis or mechanical analysis is commonly performed to ascertain the distribution of the coarser, large-sized particles, while the <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> is employed to identify the distribution of the finer particles. As to get more accurate analysis, the study continued with the measurement of the initial mass of the soil in the container before it was soaked in distilled water for 24  h. After that, the soil was washed using 63 -µm sieve until the water was clear. The remaining soil on that sieve was dried in the oven for 24  h and weighed again before the sieve analysis was employed. In this observation, the sieves were fixed in the order of 114  mm, 10  mm, 6.3  mm, 5.0  mm, 3.35  mm, 2.0  mm, 1, 18  mm, 600  µm, 425  µm, 300  µm, 212  µm, 150  µm and 63  µm. Subsequently, the weight of the retained soil on each sieve was measured after completing the shaking process in 10  min (63  µm). The soil was collected and gone through the hydrometer test, using a 1000 -ml measuring cylinder and sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) as a dispersing agent. The test was performed based on the British Standard 377 : Part 1990 : 9.6.|$|E
30|$|Soil texture was {{measured}} using the <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> [22]. Soil and amendment pH values were determined using 1 : 5 ratio of samples and distilled water, respectively [23]. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of each amendment and initial soil {{was measured}} using 1  M sodium acetate, ethanol 95 %, and 1  M ammonium acetate, respectively [24]. Total concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in soil and inorganic amendments were determined by digesting with aqua regia and analyzed by Atomic Adsorption Spectrometry (AAS; AA 240, Varian, Australia) [25]. Concentration of heavy metals in biochars {{was measured using}} the USA EPA method No. 1311. The specific surface area (SSA) of all sorbents was measured by N 2 adsorption using the BET surface area of sorbents on a Tristar 3000 by BET method [26]. In the current study, five steps (operationally defined) of sequential extraction based on Tessier et al. [27] as an approach to evaluate metal distribution into different chemical forms were investigated before and after mixing soil with amendments.|$|E
30|$|The {{laboratory}} {{analysis of}} crude oil is important to characterize the crude of a particular reservoir {{and to make a}} preliminary assessment of the application of any EOR method. In this study, the crude oils from two selected formation/sands of the oil field were analyzed for their properties. All the samples were separated from water using separating funnel at a temperature of 35  °C before carrying the detailed analysis. The ASTM D 1298 - 67 [IP 150 / 68] <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method</b> was followed for the determination of the density {{of crude oil}} samples. The dead oil viscosity of the oil samples was measured with the GRACE M 3600 Viscometer at the reservoir temperature. The IP 15 / 67 method was followed to determine the pour points of the crude oil samples. The asphaltene content of oil samples was measured by asphaltene precipitation with n-heptane (ASTM D 2007 - 80). Resin content was estimated according to Hubbard and Stanfield (1948) method, and the acid number of the crude oils was determined by titration method.|$|E
40|$|When crude {{petroleum}} is spilled onto soil, the oil’s properties {{have a large}} influence on the toxicity to soil organisms, the biodegradability of the oil, and potential for long term fertility problems in the soil.

Currently, methods do not exist to determine the ºAPI of crude oil in contaminated soil. In this study a novel method is presented for the determination of API gravity in small volumes (< 10 ml) of heavy and extra-heavy petroleum from contaminated soil. Is uses an economical and readily available solvent (diesel + automotive lubricating oil) in a procedure based on the conventional <b>hydrometer</b> <b>method,</b> plus dilution-extrapolation techniques. It was validated with {{crude petroleum}} in the 27. 1 - 15. 0 ºAPI range, obtaining an excellent correlation with the conventional method (R = 0. 996) and an error of less than 0. 4 % based on specific gravity.
