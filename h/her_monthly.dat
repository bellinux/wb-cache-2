25|$|Bernhardt {{was earning}} a {{substantial}} amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from Parc Monceau. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater impresario named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances {{in the homes of}} wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than <b>her</b> <b>monthly</b> salary with the Comédie. When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of Phédre on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, Le Misantrhope and Les Précieuses.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1920s, {{this period}} of Harlem's history has been highly romanticized. [...] With the {{increase}} in a poor population, {{it was also the}} time when the neighborhood began to deteriorate to a slum, and some of the storied traditions of the Harlem Renaissance were driven by poverty, crime, or other social ills. For example, in this period, Harlem became known for [...] "rent parties", informal gatherings in which bootleg alcohol was served and music played. [...] Neighbors paid to attend, and thus enabled the host to make his or <b>her</b> <b>monthly</b> rent. Though picturesque, these parties were thrown out of necessity. Further, over a quarter of black households in Harlem made their monthly rent by taking in lodgers, many of whom were family members, but who sometimes brought bad habits or even crime that disrupted the lives of respectable families.
