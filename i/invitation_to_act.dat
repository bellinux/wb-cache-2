500|$|Horrocks' first task, {{along with}} a party of 13British {{officers}} and 30 other ranks, was to guard a train delivering 27carriages of shells to the White Army in Omsk, [...] away on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The journey {{took more than a}} month, and as the only party member fluent in Russian, Horrocks had to deal with many of the difficulties encountered. At every station, he had to ward off station masters intent on acquiring the cars. While stopped in Manchuli, the British officers' presence provoked a duel between two Cossack officers. Horrocks accepted an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as a second, but the pair were arrested before the duel could take place. He managed to defuse the situation before it came to trial, by claiming his faulty Russian had been the cause of the misunderstanding.|$|E

Polk, who would be elected President in a close-fought race in 1844. Following Polk's inauguration, Appleton accepted an offer from United States Navy Secretary George Bancroft to join the administration as the Navy's Chief Clerk. His closeness to Polk continued while in this role, culminating in an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as the President's personal diarist for a goodwill tour of the northeastern states. Appleton's record of this visit was later published as a 135-page volume entitled North for Union. The book includes Appleton's endorsement of northeastern arts and industry, alongside a studied disapproval of its urban culture. Boston is described as having a [...] "greatness" [...] bestowed by {{its role in the}} American Revolutionary War, which permitted Appleton to [...] "almost forget its meanness" [...] today.

5000|$|Considering liberature anachronistically, it is {{noteworthy}} that writers began experimenting with literary forms as early as in the Baroque period. The unusual structure of the works forces the readers to focus their attention, to choose {{the beginning and the end}} of the text, and - most importantly - form another level of signification. It is an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> play, <b>act,</b> and interact with the text; this enables the text to transcend the boundaries of a given work. Its form “does not only consider a literary text a symbolic expression of a person’s subjectivity but also considered a text as determined by the level of programming and processing of signs.” ...|$|R

In 1896 Fairclough earned his PhD. A year later, in 1897, he was named professor of classical literature at Stanford University, and professor of Latin in 1902. In 1903 he undertook his first educational journey to Europe, more particularly to Italy and Greece.

40|$|Since the {{election}} of Rodrigo Duterte as president, the Philippines have been engulfed in a vicious campaign against drug-related crime. More than 1, 500 suspects {{have been killed by}} police officers in so-called legitimate encounters. An analysis of past patterns of killings by police shows that there are widespread, if less conspicuous, antecedents to the current spate of police-perpetrated vigilante justice. In the past and now, the differences between provinces and regions are attributable to the attitudes of officials in power at the local level. The pressure exerted on local officials by the current national administration reduces their options for resisting the <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> carry out <b>acts</b> of vigilante justice. The current patterns of strongman rule also exhibit disturbing similarities to the ones used by Ferdinand Marcos before the declaration of martial law in 1972 (and should be seen as an ominous portent of what lies ahead).

40|$|Can local markets, {{designed}} as solutions to local problems, ever be generalised for deployment at a global scale? Globalisation processes {{and the spread}} of the tools and discourses of economics suggest they can. The familiar advice <b>to</b> ‘think global <b>act</b> local’ has become a well-rehearsed adage employed for many social and environmental problems, a prevalent mnemonic which translates a single belief: that there is a preferred ‘better way’ of doing things, of solving problems, and of achieving the best possible outcomes. The <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> ‘think global, <b>act</b> local’ encompasses not only a faith in individual cosmopolitanism as a mechanism for tackling some of the world’s most intractable problems, but a belief in the existence of a single set of normative preferences, shared by all in society, and delivered through the same mechanisms everywhere. Markets, in this view, are local solutions to local problems which can – ought to, in fact – expand, unhindered, to deliver the best possible solution everywhere. One of the areas where this is most visible is in discussions about environmental protection...|$|R
