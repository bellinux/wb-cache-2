While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of the spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E

The Buffalo Bills–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a network doubleheader, was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> go to the Jets and Raiders.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and The Great Khali also {{continued}} to feud over the WWE Championship. Following the controversial <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> their match at Judgment Day, where Cena forced Khali to submit while his foot was underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have released the hold, Khali challenged Cena to a Falls Count Anywhere match for One Night Stand. Cena accepted, and Khali attacked him, performing a Chokebomb. At One Night Stand, Cena retained his title by pinning Khali after performing an FU off a crane.|$|E
5|$|Neon Genesis Evangelion gained {{widespread}} {{critical acclaim}} {{as well as}} controversy. Regarded as a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre, the series has become a cultural icon and influenced an artistic and technical revival of the anime industry. Subsequent film, manga, home video and other products in the Evangelion franchise have achieved record sales in Japan and strong sales in overseas markets, and by 2007 gross revenues had reached over 150 billion yen. The 1997 film The End of Evangelion, made by the original team of the series, serves as a complementary <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> the series.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of biomedical sensors with wireless net-work technology may have great potentials in medical ap-plications. In this paper, we investigate {{the use of}} the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard in an ECG monitoring sensor network and study the effects of CSMA/CA mechanism, number of network devices, sampling rates and transmitting cycles. The performance of the network is analyzed in terms of transmission delay, <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency, and packet delivery rate. Both biomedical signal sampling time and transmis-sion delay contribute <b>to</b> the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency, but the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency is mainly introduced by signal sam-pling time, especially for low data rate biomedical sensors. The packet delivery rate increases when the number of pay-load data becomes large due to high channel efficiency and packet coding efficiency, but large size packet suffers high <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency. In our case study, for a full size MAC packet with maximum payload size (114 bytes), the aver-age <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency introduced by sampling and trans-mitting is about 90 ms. For time-critical applications, a payload size between 40 and 60 bytes can be a good choice, due <b>to</b> lower <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency and acceptable packet de-livery rate. In the design and deployment of biomedical sensor networks in time-critical medical care applications, trade-off between <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency and packet delivery rate must be considered...|$|R
5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{professional}} wrestling championship, it was won via a scripted <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> a match or awarded to a wrestler {{because of a}} storyline. All title changes occurred at JCP or WCW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Danny Miller, who defeated Ole Anderson on February 27, 1974, in the finals of a tournament. Booker T holds the record for most reigns, with six. Rick Steamboat's second reign ended due to vacancy for unknown reasons. The day on which the reign ended is also unknown, although {{it is known that}} the reign began on June 10, 1978, and came to a close sometime in 1980. As such, if the reign ended on January 1, 1980, or any later time during 1980, then Steamboat's second reign is the longest in the title's history, at over 570 days. Five different reigns are tied for the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at one day.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{scenarios}} follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly depends on whether an idol passes or fails an audition, though {{this is not always}} the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> the plot. An audition marks the end of a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's stage mode, the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including options for the song, costume, accessories, choreography and camera positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi-Fi in the stage mode by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items.|$|E

Though he {{defeated}} {{him to become}} the new champion, a week later the decision was reversed and Young was forced to relinquish the title belt to Bashir due to a controversial <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> their match. Young and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution, with referee Shane Sewell interfering in the bout like he had done in the previous encounter, which allowed Young to gain the victory. Afterwards, Management Director Jim Cornette stripped Young of the championship. This set up a tournament for the title, ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion.|$|E
