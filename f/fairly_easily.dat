5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person <b>fairly</b> <b>easily.</b> Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|The 48th Battalion {{returned}} to its former positions on the railway embankment {{on the night of}} 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off <b>fairly</b> <b>easily.</b> On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the embankment. He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning.|$|E

50|$|Organisms {{with such}} a {{widespread}} distribution in isolated patches might well be expected to show considerable variation, {{and it is likely}} that the marked similarity between various species of the Tridactylidae reflects their comparatively small numbers and constrained type of habitat. Although their distribution suggests an ancient lineage, the Tridactylidae are a <b>fairly</b> uniform, <b>easily</b> recognised family. Historically however, their affinities have been the occasion for confusion. Originally they were seen as a subfamily, Tridactylinae, of the Gryllidae, the true crickets, closely related to the Gryllotalpidae or Gryllotalpinae, the mole crickets. Other opinions at some times assigned them to the full family Gryllotalpidae.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{technique}} of shape modification and deformation for parametric curves through cosine extension function (CEF) is presented. First, a special extension function is defined, based {{on which a}} shape operator matrix is constructed. Then combining such matrix with the center of extension and principal directions, two kinds of deformation matrices are defined. Finally, curve deformation is achieved through multiplying its position vector in a local coordinate system by deformation matrix or adding the multiplication of a vector field and quasi-deformation matrix to its position vector in the original coordinate system. Since CEF contains several variable parameters, each of which generates a different effect of shape modification such as controlling the degree of continuity of the modified part of curve with the unchanged part, ideal deformation effects can be got <b>fairly</b> and <b>easily.</b> Examples of theoretical analysis show that the method is potentially useful for geometric modeling, computer graphics and so on...|$|R

25|$|A theory {{popular in}} the mid-1990s was that red mercury {{facilitated}} the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with Zippe-type centrifuges, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be <b>fairly</b> <b>easily</b> tracked internationally.

Due to the region's high population, many of these schools are critically understaffed and overcrowded.|$|R
