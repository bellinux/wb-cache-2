40|$|A {{spectrum}} of limb abnormalities ranging from adactyly, syndactyly, acrosyndactyly to nail hypoplasia was encountered in mouse embryos subjected to amniotic sac puncture at the corresponding gestational stage when human chorionic villus sampling (cvs) {{would normally be}} performed clinically. Previous skeletal studies revealed that, apart from the occasional incidence of fusion of 2 distal phalanges, syndactyly usually only affected the soft tissues within the <b>interdigital</b> <b>spaces.</b> A similar situation was also observed in cases of adactyly; while the skeletal elements of the digits were present, the soft tissues in the <b>interdigital</b> <b>spaces</b> failed to separate. A transient period of bradycardia is induced, possibly secondary to compression of the embryo by the extraembryonic membranes and uterine muscles following amniotic sac puncture. These factors, we believe, produce temporary hypoxia/ischaemia of the distal extremities, and {{may lead to the}} modification of the interdigital mesenchymal tissues within the autopods. In order to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying soft tissue syndactyly, limbs recovered at 0. 5, 4, 8, 12, 24, or 36 h following amniotic sac puncture (ASP) were examined histologically. Vascular disruption in the form of localised areas of haemorrhage, vascular dilatation and congestion and the presence of fluid-filled cavities occurred in relation to the marginal vein and vascular plexus in the <b>interdigital</b> <b>spaces.</b> It is hypothesised that this interfered with the normal equilibrium of the preset programs of mitosis/cell death and apoptosis within the mesenchymal cells of the <b>interdigital</b> <b>spaces.</b> Apoptosis in these areas was inhibited in the majority of the experimental limbs analysed 4 h after ASP. Instead of undergoing necrosis/apoptosis, increased mitotic activity was usually observed from 8 h following ASP at the sites where apoptosis would normally be expected to be seen. The aberrant fate of the interdigital mesenchyme following ASP and the underlying mechanism(s) involved are discussed, as is the critical importance of an adequate vascular supply to the <b>interdigital</b> <b>spaces</b> during the morphogenesis of the autopod.

40|$|Fusarium {{species have}} {{emerged as one of}} the more {{outstanding}} groups of clinically important filamentous fungi, causing localized and life-threatening invasive infections with high morbidity and mortality. The ability to produce different types of hydrolytic enzymes is thought to be an important virulence mechanism of fungal pathogens and could be associated with the environment of the microorganism. Here, we have measured the production of two distinct lipolytic enzymes, phospholipase and esterase, by sixteen Fusarium isolates recovered from the hospital environment, immunocompromised patients&# 8217; blood cultures, foot <b>interdigital</b> <b>space</b> scrapings from immunocompromised patients, and foot <b>interdigital</b> <b>space</b> scrapings from immunocompetent patients (4 isolates each). Fourteen of these 16 isolates were identified asFusarium solani species complex (FSSC) and two were identified as F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC). Some relevant genus characteristics were visualized by light and electron microscopy such as curved and multicelled macroconidia with 3 or 4 septa, microconidia, phialides, and abundant chlamydospores. All Fusarium isolates were able to produce esterase and phospholipase under the experimental conditions. However, a negative correlation was observed between these two enzymes, indicating that a Fusarium isolate with high phospholipase activity has low esterase activity and vice versa. In addition, Fusarium isolated from clinical material produced more phospholipases, while environmental strains produced more esterases. These observations may be correlated with the different types of substrates that these fungi need to degrade during their nutrition processes...|$|E

Blood was sampled from all rams and plasma was analysed for reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), biological antioxidant potential (BAP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). The degree of OS was estimated by the ratio of ROMs/BAP (U. Carr. /μmol/L) multiplied by 100 to give an OS index (OSI). Footrot scores were used to stratify the rams in 2 groups: Healthy Group (HG; n= 9) or Foot Lesion (FL; n= 6), if the lesions were recorded as absent or present, respectively. Differences in OS biomarkers and IRT temperatures between the two groups were analysed by a linear mixed model. A significant (P < 0. 05) increase of IRT temperature was observed in rams with foot lesions compared with healthy rams. Rams that presented foot lesions had significantly higher values of ROMs (P < 0. 05) and OSI (P < 0. 001) and lower concentration of BAP than healthy rams (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{environmental}} and hereditary influence on development of pituitary tumors using dermatoglyphic traits. The study was performed on 126 patients of both genders with pituitary tumors (60 non-functional and 66 functional pituitary tumor patients) in comparison to the control group of 400 phenotypically healthy individuals. Statistical analysis of quantitative and qualitative traits of digito-palmar dermatoglyphics was performed, and hormonal status was determined according to the standard protocols. Although we did not find markers that could specifically distinguish functional from non-functional tumors, we have found markers predisposing to the development of tumors in general (a small number of ridges between triradius of both hands, a smaller number of ridges between the triradius of c–d rc R), those for endocrine dysfunction (increased number of arches and reduced number of whorls, difference of pattern distribution in the I 3 and I 4 <b>interdigital</b> <b>space),</b> and some that could potentially be attributed to patients suffering from pituitary tumors (small number of ridges for variables FRR 5, smaller number of ridges in the FRL 4 of both hands and difference of pattern distribution at thenar of I 1 and I 2 <b>interdigital</b> <b>space).</b> The usage of dermatoglyphic traits as markers of predisposition of pituitary tumor development could facilitate the earlier detection of patients in addition to standard methods, and possibly earlier treatment and higher survival rate.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the headquarters of Candida albicans is the alimentary tract of man and other mammals. Although its range includes the skin, it is rarely found {{as a member of}} the normal cutaneous flora of inhabitants of temperate countries and its presence in the cutaneous habitat is usually of pathogenic significance (DROUHET, 1957; WHITTLE and GRESHAM, 1960; WINNER and HURLEY, 1964). It is, however, isolated occasionally from the <b>interdigital</b> <b>spaces</b> of the foot (MARPLES and CHAPMAN, 1959; SOMERVILLE, 1966) and is a not infrequent member of the vaginal flora of pregnant women (DAWKINS et al., 1958; SOMERVILLE, 1964). Other species of yeasts are regularly isolated from the skin and the lipophilic Pityro-sporum ovale appears to be a true member of the normal flora. The resident status of non-lipophilic species is more difficuk to demonstrate since many can be found in the non-living environment, but CONNELL and SglNNER (1953) have provided evidence to show that non-pigmented yeasts are true inhabitants of the moister regions of the human skin. Most of the surveys of the normal flora of the skin have been undertaken i temperat...|$|R
40|$|<b>Interdigital</b> <b>spaces</b> {{could be}} an area of affection of a various {{cutaneous}} conditions, most of them with benign origin. The spectrum of differential diagnosis of pigmented interdigital lesions with a recent occurrence is not so wide, in contrast. When considering pigmented lesions in the interdigital area, the most harmless differential diagnosis is a traumatic hematoma. But {{what would happen if}} we based our therapeutic behaviour or suspicious and unconfirmed harmless diagnosis, instead of considering the real life-threatening once with priority, if we kept in mind that acral lentiginous melanoma has rather an aggressive course and is the main cause of death in skin cancer patients? We present a case of misdiagnosed interdigital melanoma, treated as a hemangioma with curettage, with almost fatal consequences, in regard to uncontrolled tumor progression {{as a result of the}} wrong traumatic procedure in one hand, and the lack of adequate screening and follow up, leading to progress of the disease with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in general. We want to emphasise the importance of acral lentiginous melanoma with an unusual location in the differential diagnostic plan because, despite the early detection, early eradication with simple excision could save a life, or at least could provide a better prognosis...|$|R

The clynodactyly of the thumb has to be corrected as well. The lengthening of the thumb phalanx may be needed, thus increasing the first web space. In both type I and type II, the recurrent syndactyly of the second web space will occur because of a pseudoepiphysis {{at the base of}} the index metacarpal. This should be corrected by later revisions.|$|R
