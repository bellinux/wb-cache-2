25|$|The NAACP {{assisted}} the <b>defendants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>appeals</b> process, raising money {{to hire a}} defense team, which it helped direct. When the cases were remanded to the state court, the six 'Moore' defendants settled with the lower court on lesser charges and were sentenced to time already served. Governor Thomas Chipman McRae freed these six men in 1925 in the closing days of his administration. The NAACP helped them leave the state safely.|$|R
5000|$|Stafford was {{succeeded in}} the state Senate in 1948 by C. H. [...] "Sammy" [...] Downs {{and the return of}} Earl Kemp Long to the governorship. He {{subsequently}} served on the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors in the administration of Long's second successor, Robert F. Kennon. He was a <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> the <b>appeal</b> of a suit brought forth from 1953 to 1955 against LSU by the African-American civil rights attorney A. P. Tureaud of New Orleans.|$|R
5000|$|The CRC succeeded {{particularly}} in raising international awareness about these cases, which sometimes generated protests {{to the president}} and Congress. They also represented <b>defendants</b> <b>in</b> legal <b>appeals</b> to overturn convictions or gain lesser sentences. At that time in the South, when cases were tried by all-white juries, some of the defense team believed that gaining a life sentence instead of capital punishment was akin to acquittal, where social pressure was high for juries to find blacks guilty. The CRC also defended political dissidents, including Communists. The group conducted high-profile protests in Washington, D.C., and at the United Nations. It brought world attention to racism in the United States by presenting the U.N. with a petition titled [...] "We Charge Genocide," [...] detailing the abuses of African Americans in the US, including continuing lynchings in the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>defendants</b> <b>appealed</b> <b>in</b> the Delhi High Court {{against the}} summons {{issued by the}} magistrate. [...] On 1 August 2014, Swamy was served notice to file reply in the High Court. On 28 August 2014, the {{metropolitan}} court fixed 9 December 2014 for the next hearing of the case. On 12 January 2015, the judge of the Delhi High Court recused himself from hearing the case and directed that the petitions be directed before an appropriate bench.|$|R
2500|$|An {{attempt to}} extend Batson to cover {{challenges}} based on sexual orientation failed in 2005. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a <b>defendant's</b> criminal <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> U.S. v. Blaylock, 421 F.3d 758, because it found {{the prosecution had}} [...] "offered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for striking the panel member". The court did not consider whether the Batson challenge rule applied, but its opinion expressed doubt that it did.|$|R
50|$|Although McDonald's won two {{hearings}} of {{the case}} in English court, the partial nature of the victory, the David-vs-Goliath nature {{of the case}}, and the drawn-out litigation embarrassed the company. McDonald's announced {{that it did not}} plan to collect the £40,000 that it was awarded by the courts. Since then, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that the trial violated Articles 6 (right to a fair trial) because the defendants had been refused legal aid and had only been represented by volunteer lawyers, and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the Convention on Human Rights, again because the defendants had been refused legal aid, and awarded a judgment of £57,000 against the UK government. (McDonald's itself was not a <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> this <b>appeal.)</b> On February 15, 2005, the pair's 20-year battle with McDonald's came to an end with this judgment.|$|R
5000|$|Verdict of Izmir State Security Court (SSC) of 29 November 1988: [...] "The <b>defendants</b> <b>appealed</b> <b>in</b> their defence {{for their}} {{statements}} to the police {{to be taken out}} of the files, because they had generally been extracted under torture... In accordance with the legislation {{it was not possible to}} take their {{statements to the}} police out of the files, as these statement have not been assessed as evidence of the defendants' confessions. These statements have been quoted from time to tome, if other evidence and documents existed showing that the defendants committed the alleged crime." ...|$|R
25|$|Thirty <b>defendants</b> <b>appealed.</b> <b>In</b> June 1914, the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals {{reversed}} {{and ordered}} new trials for {{five of the}} convictions, including that of Olaf Tveitmoe. In the case of Tveitmoe, {{the court ruled that}} evidence implicating him in the Los Angeles Times bombing was irrelevant to the federal charges, because that incident did not involve interstate transportation of dynamite. Citing abundant evidence in the trial record, the court upheld the remaining 25 convictions. The following month, the US district attorney announced that, in light of the court of appeals ruling, that the government would not retry the five defendants whose convictions were reversed; the five were released.|$|R
500|$|The wager {{of battle}} {{was not always}} {{available}} to the <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> an <b>appeal</b> of murder. If the <b>defendant</b> was taken <b>in</b> the mainour (that is, {{in the act of}} committing his crime), if he attempted to escape from prison, or if there was such strong evidence of guilt that there could be no effective denial, the defendant could not challenge. Similarly, if the plaintiff was a woman, above 60years of age, a minor, lame or blind, he or she could decline the challenge, and the case would be determined by a jury. Peers of the realm, priests, and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged. If the actual battle took place, it would occur in judicial lists, [...] square, following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery. If the defendant was defeated, and if he was still alive, he was to be hanged on the spot; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him. However, if he defeated his opponent, or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset, he would go free. If the plaintiff said the word craven ("I am vanquished"), and gave up the fight, he was to be , deprived of the privileges of a freeman, and was liable for damages to his successful opponent.|$|R

5000|$|The court {{noted that}} even though they lacked {{interlocutory}} jurisdiction to review the discovery order, a writ of mandamus was still appropriate to prevent the disclosure because of the privacy issues at stake. The court disagreed with the SEC's interpretation of the United States v. Miller ruling, citing {{the fact that in}} the present case, the privacy rights of hundreds of innocent individuals was at risk if the wiretaps were forced to be disclosed—in contrast to United States v. Miller, where the tapes had already been played at trial and consequently, the only issue at stake was the protection against unlawful interception. The court noted that in the present case, [...] "the cat is not yet out of the bag" [...] and a writ was appropriate if the disclosure order was deemed erroneous, since no alternative remedies would be available to the <b>defendants</b> (<b>in</b> particular, an <b>appeal</b> of the ruling after the case would not adequately vindicate the privacy violations). The court explicitly limited the scope of their finding to the present facts, noting that the ruling [...] "does not mean that a writ of mandamus will always be appropriate to remedy an erroneous disclosure order".|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} {{raised by}} the <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> this case was whether a <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> a breach of contract case could {{be held liable for}} damages that the defendant was not aware would be incurred from a breach of the contract.|$|R
5000|$|The narrow issue <b>in</b> these {{consolidated}} <b>appeals</b> {{is whether}} the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution bars prosecution of a <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> an OWI case if the defendant's license has previously been suspended through administrative proceedings. We conclude that it does not.|$|R
5000|$|Appeals by the Guinness four in 1991 and 1995 {{ended in}} partial success, as {{sentences}} were reduced. In 1995 Michael Heseltine, the then President of the Board of Trade, lifted a government [...] "gagging order" [...] preventing disclosure of evidence <b>in</b> the <b>appeals</b> of <b>defendants</b> <b>in</b> the Guinness case. While this procedure was unjust, the court {{felt that it}} did not outweigh the prosecution's arguments.|$|R
50|$|During 15—18 March 2016 Breivik was the {{plaintiff}} {{in a civil}} trial. The Ministry of Justice and Public Security was the <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> court since the Correctional Service (that is being sued) is subordinate to the ministry. The verdict was appealed; <b>in</b> court of <b>appeals</b> a trial is scheduled for January 2017.|$|R
50|$|In early 2001 Jack Loach {{was named}} as a <b>defendant</b> <b>in</b> {{a request for}} an <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> regard to a leasing {{agreement}} dispute with Michael Gerson (Leasing) Limited.

50|$|Gideon v. Wainwright {{was one of}} {{a series}} of Supreme Court {{decisions}} that confirmed the right of <b>defendants</b> <b>in</b> criminal proceedings, upon request, to have counsel appointed both during trial and on <b>appeal.</b> <b>In</b> the subsequent cases of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964) and Miranda v. Arizona 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Supreme Court further extended the rule to apply even during police interrogation.|$|R
2500|$|When George Murphy died {{unexpectedly}} {{after they}} had started the retrial of six of the murder <b>defendants</b> <b>in</b> May 1920, after winning an <b>appeal</b> <b>in</b> the Arkansas Supreme Court, Jones took the lead <b>in</b> guiding the <b>appeals</b> process. [...] After much internal debate, the NAACP temporarily retained Jones as their replacement for Murphy, making him briefly the sole attorney {{for all of the}} 99 defendants. He successfully continued with the Moore et al. defendants, whose cases were reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Jones is credited with having been the author of the brief used before the Court.|$|R
