40|$|International audienceSpike timing-dependent {{plasticity}} (STDP) is {{a learning}} rule that modifies {{the strength of}} a neuron's synapses {{as a function of the}} precise temporal relations between input and output spikes. In many brains areas, temporal aspects of spike trains have been found to be highly reproducible. How will STDP affect a neuron's behavior when <b>it</b> is <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> with the same input spike pattern? We show in this theoretical study that repeated inputs systematically lead to a shaping of the neuron's selectivity, emphasizing its very first input spikes, while steadily decreasing the postsynaptic response latency. This was obtained under various conditions of background noise, and even under conditions where spiking latencies and firing rates, or synchrony, provided conflicting informations. The key role of first spikes demonstrated here provides further support for models using a single wave of spikes to implement rapid neural processing...|$|R
50|$|The first {{automated}} steam-powered foghorn {{was invented}} by Robert Foulis, a Scotsman who emigrated to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Foulis {{is said to have}} heard his daughter playing the piano in the distance on a foggy night, and noticed the low notes were more audible than the higher notes: he then designed a device to produce a low-frequency sound, as well as a code system for use with <b>it.</b> Foulis <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> his concept to the Commissioners of Light Houses for the Bay of Fundy for installation on Partridge Island. While the Commissioners initially rejected Foulis's plan, one commissioner eventually encouraged Foulis to submit detailed plans to the Commission. For reasons unknown, the plans were given to another Canadian engineer, T. T. Vernon Smith, who officially submitted them to the Commissioners as his own. The foghorn was constructed at Partridge Island in 1859 as the Vernon-Smith horn. After protest by Foulis and a legislative inquiry, Foulis was credited as the true inventor. Foulis, however, never patented or profited from his invention.|$|R
40|$|A {{successive}} matching {{procedure was}} used to investigate which aspect of the test-omission procedure is responsible for establishing a postsample stimulus as a cue to forget in pigeons. It was found that a postsample stimulus that reliably followed a sample that was irrelevant to performance functioned as a cue to forget. This result was obtained regardless of whether termination of that postsample stimulus was followed by reinforcement or by the presentation of sample-independent discriminative stimuli. It was also found that a postsample stimulus that functioned as a cue to forget {{at the beginning of}} training lost that function when <b>it</b> was <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> on trials in which the sample was relevant to performance. These findings reveal that (a) neither a reduction in reinforcement rate nor the omission of the opportunity for discriminated responding is necessary to establish an effective cue to forget and (b) irrelevance of the sample to performance is a sufficient condition to establish a cue to forget. These results suggest that a postsample stimulus that is presented on trials in which remembering the sample is not reinforced differentially will come to set the occasion for not remembering the sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{order of}} an auditory sequence {{can be more}} difficult to apprehend when <b>it</b> is <b>presented</b> <b>repeatedly</b> without pause (cycling) than when it is presented once (Warren et al., 1969). We find that this phenomenon, the “midstream order deficit”, can also occur with visual stimuli. The stimuli need not form separate perceptual "streams", and the effect occurs with presentation rates as slow as 5 items/second, even though the identification of individual letters is very accurate at this rate. However, if the first item of the sequence is visually very distinct from the preceding items, relative order reports can be as accurate in the cycling condition as in the single-presentation condition. Our results suggest that the midstream order deficit is not due to masking, an attentional blink, repetition blindness, Reeves & Sperling’s (1986) order illusion, memory limitations, or decision criteria. It may reflect an attentional cost to initiating order encoding, distinct from the allocation of attention required to detect and identify individual items. One’s attention must be set for, or captured by, an initial salient event in order to initiate order encoding successfully...|$|R

40|$|Reinforcers {{lose their}} {{effectiveness}} {{when they are}} <b>presented</b> <b>repeatedly.</b> Early researchers labeled this loss of effectiveness as satiation without conducting an experimental analysis. When such an analysis is conducted, habituation provides a more precise and empirically accurate label for the changes in reinforcer effectiveness. This paper reviews some of the data that suggest that habituation occurs to <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> reinforcers. <b>It</b> also argues that habituation has surprisingly different implications than satiation for theory and practice in behavior analysis. For example, postulating that habituation occurs to <b>repeatedly</b> <b>presented</b> reinforcers suggests ways for maintaining {{the strength of a}}n existing reinforcer and for weakening the strength of a problematic reinforcer that differ from those implied by an account in terms of satiation. An habituation account may also lead to different ways of conceptualizing the regulation of behavior. For example, habituation may be a single-process contributor to the termination of behaviors that are usually attributed to satiation (e. g., ingestive behaviors such as eating and drinking), fatigue (e. g., energetic behaviors such as running), the waning of attention (e. g., cognitive behaviors such as studying), and pharmacodynamic factors (e. g., drug taking) ...|$|R
