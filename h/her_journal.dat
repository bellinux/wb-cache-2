5|$|There {{is no good}} {{biography}} of Trimmer. Many of the same details of her life, drawn primarily from the account of her life attached to <b>her</b> <b>journal,</b> written by one of her children, are repeated in Balfour, Grenby, Rodgers, Schnorrenberg, Wills and Yarde.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E
5|$|Helena, as promised, lived {{close to}} the Queen, and both she and Beatrice {{performed}} duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice {{did not have time}} to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> in the last months of her life.|$|E
50|$|She {{included}} {{topics in}} <b>her</b> <b>journals</b> such as travel, thoughts, lists, dreams, finances, critiques, correspondence, timelines, and relationship with <b>her</b> mother. The <b>journals</b> also include sketches of vacation spots, objects around the house, studies, people. She also let her children sketch in <b>her</b> <b>journals.</b>|$|R
50|$|So far sixteen {{volumes of}} <b>her</b> <b>journals</b> have been published. All {{but the last}} five of <b>her</b> adult <b>journals</b> are in expurgated form.|$|R

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{undertook}} her tour of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{in order}} to retrieve a stolen treasure ship for her lover, Gilbert Imlay. Believing that the journey would restore their strained relationship, she eagerly set off. However, {{over the course of}} the three months she spent in Scandinavia, she realized that Imlay had no intention of renewing the relationship. The letters, which constitute the text, drawn from <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> and from missives she sent to Imlay, reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical memoir.|$|E
5|$|After resting {{for several}} months, Berkman began to recover. He {{remained}} anxious about {{his lack of}} employment. He considered returning to his old job as a printer, but his skills had become obsolete in light of innovations in linotype machines. With Goldman's encouragement, Berkman began to write an account of his prison years, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist, and she invited him to become the editor of <b>her</b> <b>journal,</b> Mother Earth. He served as editor from 1907 to 1915, and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, {{in contrast to the}} more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, Max Baginski. Under Berkman's stewardship, circulation of Mother Earth rose as high as 10,000 and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Over many months, <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> came {{to number}} {{hundreds}} of pages, and Loung continued {{to maintain a}} journal for many years. In retrospect, Loung has stated that untangling her feelings and putting them into words throughout those years was very therapeutic for her.|$|E

50|$|Extracts of <b>her</b> <b>journals</b> were {{published}} during her lifetime such as Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands {{which was published}} in 1868. The first edition sold twenty thousand copies, which was a great success. Further editions were printed and a sequel was published — More Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands. Extracts of <b>her</b> <b>journals</b> also appeared in the Theodore Martin's biography of Prince Albert — The Life of His Royal Highness the Prince Consort — {{which was published in}} five volumes from 1875 to 1880.|$|R
25|$|Once she {{had been}} arrested, the teams in Simi Valley began searching her home and car. In her house they found <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> from the mid-1980s, with {{numerous}} mentions of her love for Ruetten and despondence over his engagement to Rasmussen (and no mentions of her gun having been stolen). Her computer showed that she had searched the Internet for Ruetten's name on several occasions in the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|My December is {{the third}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson.

Clarkson confirmed {{the name of the}} album in <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> on her fanclub website on February 27, 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1775 Frances Burney {{turned down}} a {{marriage}} proposal from one Thomas Barlow, a man whom she had met only once. Her side of the Barlow courtship is amusingly told in <b>her</b> <b>journal.</b> During the period 1782–85 she enjoyed the rewards of her successes as a novelist; she was received at fashionable literary gatherings throughout London. In 1781 Samuel Crisp died. In 1784 Dr Johnson died, and that year also saw the failure of her romance with a clergyman, George Owen Cambridge. She was 33 years old.|$|E
50|$|Losh's {{papers were}} destroyed, {{and none of}} <b>her</b> <b>journals</b> or {{drawings}} survives, but her life was described in The Worthies of Cumberland, first published by Henry Lonsdale in 1867.|$|R
50|$|Roberts was cremated at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. <b>Her</b> <b>journals</b> {{became the}} basis for No Bells on Sunday: The Memoirs of Rachel Roberts (1984).|$|R

25|$|In <b>her</b> <b>journal,</b> Butler {{wrote that}} she had gotten Genie to stop attacking herself when angry and had taught Genie to instead express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler also claimed that, shortly after moving in with her, Genie had become noticeably more talkative and {{that she had}} made {{substantial}} progress with her language acquisition. In an early August letter to Jay Shurley, she wrote that the man she was dating had also noticed and commented on the improvement in her language. Genie's incontinence gradually improved until, by the end of her stay, it had almost entirely gone away.|$|E

The program titled, The Gospel Tradition: In Performance at the White House was {{broadcast}} Friday, June 26, 2015, on PBS stations and simulcast on TV One. On September 30, 2015, Williams premiered her Believe at Home bedding collection on EVINE; she believes <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> entry is proof {{of what she}} dreamed years earlier. Williams is to star {{in the title role}} of The Muny's summer production of Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, presented at the St. Louis venue August 8–14. She played the role previously during the original Broadway run.|$|E

500|$|Trimmer's {{husband died}} in 1792; this {{affected}} her quite deeply, as is evidenced in <b>her</b> <b>journal.</b> In 1800, she {{and some of}} her daughters were forced to move to another house in Brentford. This was painful for Trimmer, who wrote in her diary: ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria Art Gallery and Royal Victoria Park {{are named}} after Queen Victoria, {{who wrote in}} <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> [...] "The people are really too kind to me.". This feeling {{seemed to have been}} {{reciprocated}} by the people of Bath: [...] "Lord James O'Brien brought a drawing of the intended pillar which the people of Bath are so kind as to erect in commemoration of my 18th birthday.".|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{found it}} {{difficult}} to let go of her daughter, confiding in <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> that she [...] "felt painfully the thought of losing her". The new breach in royal tradition caused surprise, especially in Germany, and Queen Victoria wrote to the Queen of Prussia that princes of small impoverished German houses were [...] "very unpopular" [...] in Britain and that Lord Lorne, a [...] "person of distinction at home" [...] with [...] "an independent fortune" [...] was [...] "really no lower in rank than minor German Royalty".|$|E
50|$|After Guiler's {{death in}} 1985, the unexpurgated {{versions}} of <b>her</b> <b>journals</b> were commissioned by Pole. Five volumes have appeared (Henry and June, Fire, Incest, Nearer the Moon, and Mirages). Pole died in July 2006.|$|R

500|$|Cosima's life {{mission was}} total service to Wagner and his works; {{in the words}} of the music critic Eric Salzman she [...] "submitted herself body and soul to the Master". In Wagner's {{lifetime}} she fulfilled this purpose primarily by recording in <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> every facet of his life and ideas. After his death the journal was abandoned; she would henceforth serve the master by perpetuating his artistic heritage through the Bayreuth Festival. Guided by Groß, but also using her own acumen—Werner calls her a [...] "superb business woman"—she succeeded in making the festival first solvent, then profitable.|$|E
500|$|Many {{references}} in Arbuthnot's diary, however, are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent. Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together, and {{a visit to}} Blenheim Palace they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in <b>her</b> <b>journal</b> concerning Wellington's fellow duke the 5th Duke of Marlborough, of whom she wrote: [...] "The family of the great General is, however, gone sadly to decay, and are but a disgrace to the illustrious name of Churchill, which they have chosen this moment to resume. The present Duke is overloaded with debt, is very little better than a common swindler".|$|E
500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in <b>her</b> <b>journal,</b> these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in <b>her</b> <b>journal,</b> [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>her</b> <b>journals,</b> she also accumulated a taxidermy collection of 172 mounted specimens representing {{many of the}} island's bird species. The Block Island School is today {{the home of the}} Elizabeth Dickens Bird Collection.|$|R
