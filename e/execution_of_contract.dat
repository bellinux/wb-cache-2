We {{propose a}} simple event {{calculus}} representation of contracts and a reactive belief-desire-intention agent architecture {{to enable the}} monitoring and <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> terms and conditions. We use the event calculus to deduce current and past obligations, obligation fulfilment and violation. By associating meta-information with the contracts, the agent is able to select which of its contracts with other agents are relevant to solving its goals by outsourcing. The agent is able to handle an extendable set of contract types such as standing contracts, purchase contracts and service contracts {{without the need for}} a firstprinciples planner. ...|$|E

40|$|TreatJS is a {{language}} embedded, higher-order contract system for JavaScript which enforces contracts by run-time monitoring. Beyond providing the standard abstractions for building higher-order contracts (base, function, and object contracts), TreatJS 2 ̆ 7 s novel contributions are its guarantee of non-interfering contract execution, its systematic approach to blame assignment, {{its support for}} contracts {{in the style of}} union and intersection types, and its notion of a parameterized contract scope, which is the building block for composable run-time generated contracts that generalize dependent function contracts. TreatJS is implemented as a library so that all aspects of a contract can be specified using the full JavaScript language. The library relies on JavaScript proxies to guarantee full interposition for contracts. It further exploits JavaScript 2 ̆ 7 s reflective features to run contracts in a sandbox environment, which guarantees that the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> code does not modify the application state. No source code transformation or change in the JavaScript run-time system is required. The impact of contracts on execution speed is evaluated using the Google Octane benchmark...|$|E

40|$|Customer pre-signing of all {{transactional}} {{documents in}} one sitting is a questionable procedure as {{it does not follow}} the required sequence in the Shariah concept of “offer and acceptance”. As “offer and acceptance” or “ijab and qabul” (i. e. sighah) is, according to the vast majority of scholars, an absolute requirement of exchange contracts and can be executed only after the seller possesses the contracted item. Pre-signing in normal circumstances has been seen as either a promise from one party to purchase or to sell, or as an <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> without proper ownership by contracting parties. Hence, the study is integral in order to analyse the permissibility of considering pre-signing as offer and acceptance. Furthermore, it is assumed that any non-compliance issues in the execution of a contract will affect its validity. Therefore, this study aims to explain the Shariah view on the sequence of contract execution in Islamic banking products, and the Islamic banks' practices in executing contracts in vehicle financing, house financing and personal financing. The paper applies the qualitative research method comprising of document analyses, fiqh muqaran and interviews with the stakeholders. This paper suggests that “offer and acceptance” should be done in a proper manner as described by Islamic jurists and that modern technology, especially communication technology, should be used to overcome pre-signing needs. In a nutshell, this study contributes in sharpening the practices of Islamic banks to comply with contractual sequence as required by Islamic law...|$|E
40|$|Academic {{researchers}} in all disciplines {{are now under}} pressure to work more closely with industry and the community through contract research. These alliances are expected to produce increased quantities of research output for both the individual academic and institution, as well as successful and tangible outcomes for the organisation. The design and <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> research, however, is somewhat different to that of funded research. It often involves tight time lines, a strict adherence {{to the requirements of}} the written and verbal contract between all parties concerned, and intensification of research work practices. While permission to publish, access to sites and informants, academic freedom and ownership of intellectual property are challenges that most qualitative researchers face at some stage, those who wish to utilise contract research data with a view to producing rigorous and high quality scholarly work face additional hurdles. Issues concerning rigour and validity may present many particular challenges to the contract qualitative researcher. This paper examines this tension between opportunities to engage in qualitative research via contractual arrangements with organisations and the desire to produce intellectually rigorous outcomes. Two case studies that illustrate the difficulties inherent in conducting contract-based qualitative research will be discussed. The first case study examines the development of qualitative research design {{as part of a larger}} project on innovation, technology and change management within a multinational corporation. The second case study analyses the relationship between length of contract, grounded theory and methodological rigour within a contract based multiple case study project on public sector service delivery...|$|E

Most research on agent-based automated negotiation is focused on models that end their action at the time at which the contract is concluded. However, the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> can be a long process. In this time, the needs and capabilities of both sides are subject to change. In complex negotiations, the negotiation is spread over the entire lifespan <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and includes pre-contract negotiations as well as renegotiations during the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> With this approach, participants can adapt dynamically to changing conditions, and can renegotiate contract conditions which have previously been concluded by both parties...|$|R
