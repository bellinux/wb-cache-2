50|$|A {{letter of}} credit or LC can also {{be the source of}} payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the {{letter of credit}} will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used {{primarily}} in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the advising bank of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and traveler's cheque. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial <b>invoice,</b> <b>bill</b> of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.|$|R

50|$|When an E-commerce system {{requests}} {{a resource}} from a payment gateway, {{like a new}} <b>invoice</b> or <b>bill</b> for goods, the request must contain a URL endpoint representing a script or program to handle returning notifications.

The IPN handler usually performs standard actions like validating the message, updating inventory levels in the E-commerce system, notifying customers of successful or failed payments, etc. Depending on the retailer's business requirements {{and the level of}} sophistication of the E-commerce software, {{some or all of the}} IPN messages can be handled or ignored.|$|R

A variety of complaints by clinicians were recorded, centering on a policy of employing staff who were less experienced and less expensive.
