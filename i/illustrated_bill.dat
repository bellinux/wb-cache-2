50|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the genus name Pinicola by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot is variously dated to 1805, 1.12.1807, or 1808 as the year of publication. The original description was included in Vieillot’s (1807-1809) Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Amérique septentrionale in tome 1 on page iv (and on plate 1 figure 13 but without associated scientific name immediately on the plate for the <b>illustrated</b> <b>bill).</b> The two volumes of this very rare work were printed in 22 consecutive issues {{in the course of}} three years. According to Peterson (2002), 1808 might be the proper publication date of Pinicola. Pinicola Vieillot, 1808 (Aves, Fringillidae) makes the name Pinicola Brébisson, 1818 a junior homonym and therefore unavailable for a genus of Xyelidae (Insecta, Hymenoptera).|$|E
