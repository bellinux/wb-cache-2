5000|$|Hollow Atoms (discovered in 1990 by a French team of {{researchers}} around Jean-Pierre Briand) are short-lived multiply excited neutral atoms which carry {{a large part of}} their Z electrons (Z ... projectile nuclear charge) in high-n levels while inner shells remain (transiently) empty. This population inversion arises for typically 100 femtoseconds during the interaction of a slow highly charged ion (HCI) with a solid surface. Despite this limited lifetime, the formation and decay of a <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> can be conveniently studied from ejected electrons and soft X-rays, and the trajectories, energy loss and final charge state distribution of surface-scattered projectiles. For impact on insulator surfaces the potential energy contained by <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> may also cause the release of target atoms and -ions via potential sputtering and the formation of nanostructures on a surface.|$|E
40|$|Electron {{emission}} {{induced by}} the impact of highly charged ions on metal surfaces is due to different mechanisms. During {{the interaction of the}} ion with the metal surface, hollow atoms are formed above and below the surface. At low impact energies, autoionization processes in front of the surface mostly determine the emission properties. With increasing impact energy, excitation processes from below the surface gain in importance. When the <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> moves inside the metal, empty inner orbitals are successively filled by Auger transitions and collisional charge transfers. The filling dynamics of the <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> determines the strength of the excitation by Auger processes as well as the depth distribution of this excitation. The ion transport process in the first layers of the metal also influences this depth distribution. In this work, electron emission due to the release of K- and L-Auger electrons is calculated by Monte Carlo simulation for Ne 9 + impact on Al. The transport of incident ions and of the excited electrons as well as the filling dynamics of the <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> are taken into account. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

Then the most energetic part (the filling of the K-shell hole) of the de-excitation of hydrogenic <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms</b> is treated in terms of a balance between L-shell filling rates and KLL Auger decay rates.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of multiply charged ions with various surfaces {{gives rise to}} the formation of so-called <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms</b> via multiple electron capture into excited orbitals. The potential energy of the ions is partly converted into photons and kinetic energy of emitted electrons during subsequent decay of these <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms.</b> Also it might give rise to localized surface structure modifications. We have used Auger electron spectroscopy to investigate the various electronic processes which take place at metal- and LiF insulator surfaces as well as a LiF-covered Au(111) surface. The surface sensitivity of these processes is demonstrated by the fact that after a monolayer coverage, the spectra closely resemble those of a pure LiF target...|$|R

Understanding the femtosecond dynamics of such systems is fundamental to achieving atomic resolution in flash diffraction imaging of noncrystallized complex biological samples. We demonstrate the capacity of a correlation method called "partial covariance mapping'' to probe the electron dynamics of neon atoms exposed to intense 8 fs pulses of 1062 eV photons. A complete picture of ionization processes competing in <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> formation and decay is visualized with unprecedented ease and the map reveals hitherto unobserved nonlinear sequences of photoionization and Auger events.

40|$|K-shell {{spectra of}} solid Al excited by petawatt {{picosecond}} laser pulses {{have been investigated}} at the Vulcan PW facility. Laser pulses of ultrahigh contrast with an energy of 160 J on the target allow studies of interactions between the laser field and solid state matter at 1020 W/cm 2. Intense X-ray emission of KK hollow atoms (atoms without n = 1 electrons) from thin aluminum foils is observed from optical laser plasma for the first time. Specifically for 1. 5 μm thin foil targets the <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> yield dominates the resonance line emission. It is suggested that the hollow atoms are predominantly excited by the impact of X-ray photons generated by radiation friction to fast electron currents in solid-density plasma due to Thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung in the transverse plasma fields. Numerical simulations of Al <b>hollow</b> <b>atom</b> spectra using the ATOMIC code confirm {{that the impact of}} keV photons dominates the atom ionization. Our estimates demonstrate that solid-density plasma generated by relativistic optical laser pulses provide the source of a polychromatic keV range X-ray field of 1018 W/cm 2 intensity, and allows the study of excited matter in the radiation-dominated regime.

It was found that, as a result of closing the K h α₁ de-excitation channel in the pure LS coupling scheme, the K h α₁/ K h α₂ intensity ratio changes with the atomic number from small values (for the LS coupling limit at low Z) to about 1. 5 – 1. 6 (for the j– j coupling limit at high Z). However, closing the K h α₁ de-excitation channel (due to the domination of the pure LS coupling for the low- Z atoms) does not enlarge the lifetimes of <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{measured}} the x-ray spectra and their emission yields to studythe <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms</b> produced {{above and below}} the surface from the coincidence measurementwith secondary electrons emitted during the interaction of highly charged ions (HCIs) withvarious solid surfaces. The <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms,</b> which are many planetary-electron-atoms withempty inner shells, are produced by multi-electron capture process of HCIs from the targetatoms. In order to investigate production and decay of the <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms,</b> measurementsof x-ray spectra are important, because the x-ray emission might be one of the importantdecay processes from those exotic atoms produced in the HCI-surface interaction. The HCIs used here are produced in an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), where the highdensity electron beam is used to trap, ionize and excite the ions. Since the intensity andthe quality of the projectile ions extracted from the electron beam ion trap are importantto perform the present experiments, we have studied production and extraction of the HCIswith the Tokyo EBIT to nd the optimum operation conditions by measuring radiativerecombination (RR) x rays emitted in the EBIT and the charge state distributions of theextracted HCIs. In order to see how the EBIT can produce highly charged ions, timeevolution of the extracted ions and that of the RR x-rays from the EBIT with di erentelectron energies and beam currents were observed. X-ray emission yields are de ned as the number of emitted x-ray photons per incident ion. In the rst investigation, the x-ray emission yields from the <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms</b> produced by highlycharged iodine ions incident on a hydrogen terminated silicon surface were measured. It wasfound that the K shell vacancies were lled through x-ray transitions with the probabilityof approximately 100 %, while only about 20 % of L shell vacancies were lled through x-raytransitions and almost all the M shell vacancies were lled nonradiatively. Dissipation ofthe potential energy Ep of an incident ion through x-ray emissions increases gradually withthe number of L shell vacancies and amounts to 10 % of Ep for the He-like I 51 + ion. 30 to 40 % of Ep for I 52 + and I 53 + with K shell vacancies was measured to be dissipated by K x-rayemissions. In the second investigation, the x-ray yields and also dissipated fractions of potentialenergies through x-ray emissions were measured for slow HCIs of I, Pr, Ho, and Bi collidingwith aWsurface to investigate the incident ion-dependence. The amount of potential energydissipated by the x-ray emission increases with increasing the atomic number and the chargestate of incident ions. The present measurements also show that x-ray emission is one ofthe important decay channels of <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms</b> produced in collisions of very highly chargedions of heavy elements. Thirdly, the x-ray spectra and their emission yields were measured in the interactionof H-like and bare HCIs (I 52 + and I 53 +) with di erent target materials (Be, C, Cu andW) to investigate the target element-dependence. K x-ray yields are independent of thematerial, because the K vacancies are also almost lled through K x-ray emissions as is inthe above previous observation. L x-ray yields are a ected by combination of the electronicstates of the targets and the interacting projectiles, because the probability of electron capture strongly depends on the level structures of the projectile and the target, and actuallytheir matching. The possible number of electrons populated in the incident HCIs wouldbe determined by the number of electrons in the target states from which electrons aretransferred through the so-called below-surface neutralization processes. Therefore, thenumber of transferred electrons in the <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms</b> would a ect the rates of decay processessuch as L x-ray emissions. In conclusion, we have performed the systematic investigation for x-ray emission processesin the interaction of various kinds of HCIs and the target materials, which are stronglyrelated to the atomic structure of both projectiles and targets. It is understood that thex-ray emission {{is one of the most}} important processes in the decay of <b>hollow</b> <b>atoms.</b> 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
