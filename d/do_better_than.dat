5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> most winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with Identity Thief even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and word of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. Side Effects finished a distant third with a quarter of Identity Thiefs take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to Box Office Mojo, was the 35% drop in earnings for Silver Linings Playbook, then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.|$|E

5|$|Benfica started November by hosting Beira-Mar on the 2nd in the {{official}} opening of their new stadium. Beira-Mar won 2–1, inflicting Benfica's second league defeat, which opened an 11-point gap to Porto. Camacho blamed the defeat {{on the lack of}} goal opportunities. Four days later, Benfica received Molde for the UEFA Cup, beating them 3–1 and assuring a two-goal lead for the second leg. Camacho recognized the team was struggling to defend against corner-kicks, as both Beira-Mar and Molde had scored in corners. On 9 November, the team visited Alverca and won three-nil, with two goals from Tiago and one from Geovanni. Camacho was pleased with the performance, but said that Benfica should have scored more. On 12 November, Benfica played Marítimo, in a fixture transferred from October. Weakened by injuries in some of the regular players, Benfica could not <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> a one-all draw. Camacho attributed the result to the excessive number of games in short amount of time, something most of the players were not accustomed to. After a 10-day international break, Benfica opened the Portuguese Cup campaign against Estrela da Amadora on the 22nd. They won 3–1 with all of the goals arriving late in the game. Benfica closed the month with a 2–0 win to Molde, on the second leg of the UEFA Cup, with Tiago again scoring twice.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} {{that come from}} being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are doing better than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> their predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{story from}} Tabari on the authory of Ibn Masud and Ibn Abbas, Harut and Marut (Arabic: هاروت وماروت) are fallen angels who asked God to destroy mankind after humans {{committed}} acts of disobience around the world. Consequently, God gave them humanlike urges and made them descend to Earth {{in order to determine}} whether or not Satan would have authority over the angels; they would not <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> humans for long. On Earth, they entertained and acted upon sexual desires and were guilty of idol worship, whereupon they even killed an innocent witness. For their deeds, they were not allowed to ascend to Heaven again. Those who reject the angelic origin of Harut and Marut prefer to view them as kings (malikayn) than angels (malak). Their origin story is not in the Quran.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} {{given for}} the re-use is the short time between the start of construction (late 312 at the earliest) and the dedication (summer 315), so the architects used existing artwork {{to make up for}} the lack of time to create new art. It could be that so many old parts were used because the builders themselves did notfeelthe artists of their time could <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> what had already been done by different people. As yet another possible reason, it has often been suggested that the Romans of the 4th century truly did lack the artistic skill to produce acceptable artwork, and were aware of it, and therefore plundered the ancient buildings to adorn their contemporary monuments. This interpretation has become less prominent in more recent times, as the art of Late Antiquity has been appreciated in its own right. It is possible that a combination of those explanations is correct.|$|E

This study investigated the relationships between the Tests of Basic Skills and the variables race, gender, major, transfer versus native student (admission status), GPA, and ACT composite scores. The sample for this study consisted of 2, 569 students from Northern Illinois University at DeKalb, Illinois. These students had already taken the Tests of Basic Skills, which was administered through the College of Education at N. I. U. between May, 1982 and December, 1983. The data for this study were gathered from student files kept at the Registration and Records Office and the Office of Clinical Education. Results of this study showed that there were statistically significant relationships between gender, admission status, ACT composite score and GPA in relation to the Tests of Basic Skills battery pass/fail. Specifically, females <b>did</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> males and native students <b>did</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> transfer students. A weak and positive correlation was found between ACT composite scores and Tests of Basic Skills battery pass/fail. A correlation coefficient of 0. 29 (p <. 01) was found. Similarly a weak positive correlation was found between GPA and Tests of Basic Skills battery pass/fail. A correlation coefficient of 0. 20 (p <. 01) was obtained. On the sub-tests, Whites <b>did</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Non-Whites on the Reading Test. Elementary Education majors <b>did</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Secondary Education majors on the Spelling Test.

25|$|Now {{entering}} its ninth season, {{the venerable}} B31 was still Götz's car {{of choice for}} the Interserie. In the season opener, held at AVUS, Götz took third overall, and won Division II, for the car's best overall finish since 1979. He was slightly less competitive at the Österreichring, where he finished seventh overall, and fourth in his division; and {{he was unable to}} <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> 14th overall, and sixth in his division, at the Nürburgring. Götz then took another seventh overall, and fourth in his division, at Erding; however, this was followed by a successful race at Most, where he couldn't make the start of the race. The final round of the Interserie season, held again at the Nürburgring, was also unsuccessful; Götz could do no better than 16th, and seventh in Division II. He slipped to joint-sixth in the Driver's standings; level with Henri Pescarolo in a Porsche 956. Gotz switched to a March 832 for 1985, and the B31 would remain unused in that year, and 1986.|$|E
25|$|Colony-level {{inhibitory}} {{strategies can}} also create 'organizational immunity'. For example, social insect workers tend to work initially at {{the centre of}} the nest, nursing the brood, and as they age adopt tasks {{closer and closer to the}} periphery, e.g., foraging. This compartmentalization, termed centrifugal polyethism, means that workers of the same age interact mainly with others of the same age, who are performing the same task in the same spatial compartment: thus if a new disease arises that is transmitted through physical worker-worker contact it is limited to one section of the colony. The spatial structuring of western honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera) privileges young individuals-when colonies are afflicted with diseases that have a short infectious period (the time period during which infected individuals can transmit the disease to susceptible individuals), it is confined only to the older individuals closer to the outside. In the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens), workers who feed larvae tend to remain near {{the centre of the}} nest even when not performing this activity, and the converse is true for workers who forage; 11–13% of workers remain in small zones a particular distance from the nest centre throughout their life. The demographic distribution of a colony can also can be utilized for antiparasite purposes: work on Z. angusticollis has shown that not only are there differences to parasite susceptibility between instars but that the demographic constitution of a group significantly affects survivorship (mixed age groups <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> single-age groups). The effect of colony structuring on disease dynamics and social immunity is also analyzed theoretically using mathematical models.|$|E

Defending champions UCD began their title race with a one-sided victory over Garda. St Judes beat Ballymun Kickhams convincingly and went on to the second round.

Na Fianna had a comfortable five point win over St Marks and St Brigids crushed a lacklustre Round Towers. Kilmacud Crokes beat St Vincents by two goals in what proved to be a disappointing game between two of Dublins highest rated teams. Plunkett's forward line proved too hot to handle for a gutsy Olaf's with solid performances from Alan Brogan and Jason Sherlock. Last years Intermediate champions St Peregrines lost their first senior game to Naomh Barróg. Ballinteer St Johns cruised into the second tound with a victory over Clontarf.

This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated. The metaphor of the [...] "red badge of courage" [...] itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officer Philip Kearny's insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches, which became known as marks of valor and bravery. While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during the Battle of Chancellorsville, have been noted by critics.|$|E
