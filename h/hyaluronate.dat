40|$|In the eldely {{population}} osteoarthritis (OA) is {{the most}} common form of arthritis and a major contributor to functional impairment. The hip and knee are the principal large joints affected by OA. Overall, as many as 40 % of those aged over 65 in the community may have symptomatic OA. The aims of the OA treatment are: reducing joint pain and stiffness, maintaining and improving joint mobility, reducing physical disability and handicap, improving health- related quality of life, limiting the progression of joint damage and educating the patients about the nature of the disorder and its progression. The latest guidelines cover the non-pharmacological modalities as education, regular contact, physical therapy, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. The recommended pharmacological modalities include acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and <b>hyaluronates,</b> symptomatic slow-acting drugs in osteoarthritis and opioid analgesics. The surgical modalities included in the guidelines are: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy, joint-preserving surgical procedures, arthroscopic debridement and joint fusion. Optimal management of patients with hip or knee OA requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities. Turk J Phys Med Rehab 2009; 55 Suppl 2 : 75 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Background Despite {{availability}} of international evidence-based guidelines for osteoarthritis (OA) management, {{agreement on the}} different treatment modalities is lacking. Method A symposium of European and US OA experts was held {{within the framework of}} the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology to discuss and compare guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of knee OA and to reach a consensus for management, particularly for areas in which there is no clear consensus: non-pharmacological therapy; efficacy and safety of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); intra-articular (i. a.) <b>hyaluronates</b> (HA); and the role of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and/or glucosamine sulfate (GS). Results All guidelines reviewed agree that knee OA is a progressive disease of the joint whose management requires non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Discrepancies between guidelines are few and mostly reflect heterogeneity of expert panels involved, geographical differences in the {{availability of}} pharmacotherapies, and heterogeneity of studies included. Panels chosen for guideline development should include experts with real clinical experience in drug use and patient management. Implementation of agreed guidelines can be thwarted by drug availability and reimbursement plans, resulting in optimal OA treatment being jeopardized, HA and symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SySADOAs) being clear examples of drugs whose availability and prescription can greatly vary geographically. In addition, primary care providers, often responsible for OA management (at least in early disease), may not adhere to clinical care guidelines, particularly for non-pharmacological OA treatment. Conclusion Harmonization of the recommendations for knee OA treatment is challenging but feasible, as shown by the step-by-step therapeutic algorithm developed by European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO). More easily disseminated and implemented guidance for OA treatment in the primary care setting is key to improved management of OA. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium <b>hyaluronate</b> and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine.|$|E

40|$|Intercellular {{communication}} via gap junctions, {{as measured}} by dye and electrical coupling, disappears within 12 h in primary rat hepatocytes cultured in serum-supplemented media or within 24 h in cells in a serum- free, hormonally defined medium (HDM) designed for hepatocytes. Glucagon and linoleic acid/BSA were the primary factors in the HDM responsible for the extended life span of the electrical coupling. After 24 h of culture, no hormone or growth factor tested could restore the expression of gap junctions. After 4 - 5 d of culture, the incidence of coupling was undetectable in a serum-supplemented medium and was only 4 - 5 % in HDM alone. However, treatment with glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans of 24 -h cultures, having no detectable gap junction protein, resulted in synthesis of gap junction protein and of reexpression of electrical and dye coupling within 48 h. Most glycosaminoglycans were inactive (heparan sulfates, chondroitin- 6 sulfates) or only weakly active (dermatan sulfates, chondroitin 4 - sulfates, <b>hyaluronates),</b> the weakly active group increasing the incidence of coupling to 10 - 30 % {{with the addition of}} 50 - 100 micrograms/ml of the factor. Treatment of the cells with 50 - 100 micrograms/ml of heparins derived from lung or intestine resulted in cells with intermediate levels of coupling (30 - 50 %). By contrast, 10 - 20 micrograms/ml of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, or liver-derived heparin resulted in dye coupling in 80 - 100 % of the cells, with numerous cells showing dye spread from a single injected cell. Sulfated polysaccharides of glucose (dextran sulfates) or of galactose (carrageenans) were inactive or only weakly active except for lambda-carrageenan, which induced up to 70 % coupling (albeit no multiple coupling in the cultures). The abundance of mRNA (Northern blots) encoding gap junction protein and the amounts of the 27 -kD gap junction polypeptide (Western blots) correlated with the degree of electrical and dye coupling indicating that the active glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans are inducing synthesis and expression of gap junctions. Thus, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, especially those found in abundance in the extracellular matrix of liver cells, are important in the regulation of expression of gap junctions and, thereby, in the regulation of intercellular communication in the liver. The relative potencies of heparins from different tissue sources at inducing gap junction expression are suggestive of functional tissue specificity for these glycosaminoglycans...|$|R
40|$|According {{to current}} concepts, the {{influence}} of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and high molecular <b>hyaluronates</b> (HA) on the repair of hyaline cartilage during its inflammatory and degenerative changes has been insufficiently studied yet. The objective of the work was to evaluate the morphological changes {{in the structure of}} hyaline cartilage in experimental osteoarthritis after intra-articular injection of PRP and/or HA. Material and methods. The authors used 50 adult rats of Wistar line, weighing 250 ± 2, 2 g., distributed into five groups of 10 animals (two control and three experimental groups). An experimental gonarthosis was simulated on four groups of animals. Animals of the first experimental group received intra-articular injection of PRP, the second group – HA, the third – both PRP and HA. Results. No morphological signs of degenerative and inflammatory changes in the first control group were identified. Following osteoarthritis simulation the articular cartilage thinned to 121 ± 20, 4 microns (p< 0, 05) and the volume fraction of chondrocyte decreased to 1, 2 ± 0, 6 % (p< 0, 05). The authors observed an uneven coloration of collagen fibers with severe tinctorial properties disorder of the articular cartilage matrix. After the RPR introduction the authors observed tickening of the articular cartilage up to 275 ± 18, 9 micron (p< 0, 05) and the volume fraction of chondrocytes up to 18, 4 ± 2, 0 % (p< 0, 05). The contour of the cartilage surface became smoother with the formation of a cell-free zone. Collagen fibers demonstrated a uniform distribution, tinctorial properties of cartilage matrix in all areas were preserved, no signs of inflammation were noted. After HA introduction the authors observed thickening of the cartilage plate up to 264 ± 21, 3 microns (p< 0, 05) and the volume fraction of chondrocytes up to 11, 6 ± 1, 2 % (p< 0, 05). The surface of the cartilage featured uneven contours due to multiple areas of pulping. Uneven tinctorial properties of cartilage matrix, thickness and orientation of collagen fibres were retained. No signes of inflammation were observed. After the combined consecutive application of PRP and HA cartilage thickness increased up to 268 ± 15, 3 microns (p< 0, 05) and the volume fraction of chondrocytes increased up to 12, 7 ± 0, 9 % (p< 0, 05). Individual portions of pulping on the cartilage surface were observed. Tinctorial properties of the cartilage matrix were preserved; the focal uneven staining of collagen fibers in the basal zone was observed. No signs of inflammation were noted. Conclusion. During osteoarthritis simulation in knee joints of experimental Wistar line rats the authors observed severe structural changes in articular hyaline cartilage including complete destruction accompanied by vascular proliferation and granulomatous inflammation. Intraarticular injections of PRP, HA as well as PRP in combination with HA during the simulation of osteoarthrosis were accompanied by a decrease in the severity of degenerative and dystrophic processes and improval of tinctorial properties of articular cartilage matrix. Sole application of PRP or consecutive application of PRP followed by HA were observed as having the more significant reparative effect on articular cartilage as compared to HA...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To develop concise, patient-focussed, up to date, evidence-based, expert {{consensus}} {{recommendations for}} the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), which are adaptable and designed to assist physicians and allied health care professionals in general and specialist practise throughout the world. METHODS: Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care, rheumatology, orthopaedics and evidence-based medicine), two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines {{for the management of}} hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was undertaken using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. A core set of management modalities was generated based on the agreement between guidelines. Evidence before 2002 was based on a systematic review conducted by European League Against Rheumatism and evidence after 2002 was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio and cost per quality-adjusted life years gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature search, including six opinion-based, five evidence-based and 12 based on both expert opinion and research evidence. Twenty out of 51 treatment modalities addressed by these guidelines were universally recommended. ES for pain relief varied from treatment to treatment. Overall there was no statistically significant difference between non-pharmacological therapies [0. 25, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 16, 0. 34] and pharmacological therapies (ES= 0. 39, 95 % CI 0. 31, 0. 47). Following feedback from Osteoarthritis Research International members on the draft guidelines and six Delphi rounds consensus was reached on 25 carefully worded recommendations. Optimal management of patients with OA hip or knee requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities of therapy. Recommendations cover the use of 12 non-pharmacological modalities: education and self-management, regular telephone contact, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Eight recommendations cover pharmacological modalities of treatment including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) non-selective and selective oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and <b>hyaluronates,</b> glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate for symptom relief; glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and diacerein for possible structure-modifying effects and the use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of refractory pain. There are recommendations covering five surgical modalities: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy and joint preserving surgical procedures; joint lavage and arthroscopic debridement in knee OA, and joint fusion as a salvage procedure when joint replacement had failed. Strengths of recommendation and 95 % CIs are provided. CONCLUSION: Twenty-five carefully worded recommendations have been generated based on a critical appraisal of existing guidelines, a systematic review of research evidence and the consensus opinions of an international, multidisciplinary group of experts. The recommendations may be adapted for use in different countries or regions according to the availability of treatment modalities and SOR for each modality of therapy. These recommendations will be revised regularly following systematic review of new research evidence as this becomes available...|$|R
