25|$|Voyager 2s closest {{approach}} to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989. Because {{this was the}} last planet of the Solar System that Voyager 2 could visit, the Chief Project Scientist, his staff members, and the flight controllers decided to also perform a close fly-by of Triton, the larger of Neptune's two originally known moons, so as to gather as much information on Neptune and Triton as possible, regardless of Voyager 2's <b>departure</b> <b>angle</b> from the planet.

50|$|Approach and <b>departure</b> <b>angles</b> are {{indicators}} of off-road {{ability of the}} vehicle: they indicate how steep obstacles, such as rocks or logs, the vehicle can negotiate according to its body shape alone.|$|R
50|$|Off-road {{performance}} remains broadly {{similar to}} the Freelander 2 model, ground clearance is 212 mm, {{the same as the}} Freelander 2 and wading depth is 600 mm, an improvement of 100 mm.

The <b>departure</b> <b>angle</b> remains unchanged at 31°. The Discovery Sport features removable components on the lower sections of the front bumper which improves the approach angle.|$|E
5000|$|Approach {{angle is}} the maximum angle of a ramp onto which a vehicle can climb from a {{horizontal}} plane without interference. [...] It {{is defined as}} the angle between the ground and the line drawn between the front tire and the lowest-hanging part of the vehicle at the front overhang. <b>Departure</b> <b>angle</b> is its counterpart {{at the rear of the}} vehicle - the maximum ramp angle from which the car can descend without damage. Approach and departure angles are also referred to as ramp angles.|$|E

50|$|The Advanced Tether Experiment (ATEx), was a follow {{on to the}} TiPS experiment, {{designed}} and built by the Naval Center for Space Technology. ATEx flew {{as part of the}} STEX (Space Technology Experiment) mission. ATEx had two end masses connected by a polyethylene tether that was intended to deploy to a length of 6 km in length, and was intended to test a new tether deployment scheme, new tether material, active control, and survivability. ATEx was deployed on 16 January 1999 and ended 18 minutes later after deploying only 22 m of tether. The jettison was triggered by an automatic protection system designed to save STEX if the tether began to stray from its expected <b>departure</b> <b>angle,</b> which was ultimately caused by excessive slack tether. As a result of the deployment failure, none of the desired ATEx goals were achieved.|$|E

5000|$|Lexus {{introduced}} the GX 470 at the North American International Auto Show in January 2002 as a 2003 model, with sales commencing in November 2002. The GX development program began in 1999 following the J120 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado in 1997, with design work by Shoichi Fujiyoshi concluding {{in the first}} half of 2000. Heavily based on the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (J120), the GX and Prado shared a common platform, mechanicals, and bodyworks (except front-end), so therefore had common basic dimensions. Likewise, the interiors were much the same, with the Lexus receiving further premium touches when compared to the Toyota-badged version. Like the Prado, the GX design incorporated welded steel body-on-frame construction, an electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission, and permanent four-wheel drive with a center locking Torsen differential. The suspension shared its layout with the Toyota 4Runner equipped with the rear air suspension, while adding Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) and Downhill Assist Control (DAC). AVS could adjust damper firmness continuously while DAC modulated descents down slopes. Power came from a 4.7-liter, 32-valve, four-cam 2UZ-FE V8 engine originally rated at [...] at 4,800 rpm and 320 lbft Nm of torque at 3,400 rpm. Towing capacity was rated at 5000 lb for the 2003 model year. Midway through the 2004 model year, the GX received an upgraded towing capacity of 6500 lb with the addition of a much stronger frame-bolted tubular hitch. Ground clearance measured 8.3 in, with an approach angle of 30° and a <b>departure</b> <b>angle</b> of 29° raised (25° normal). The GX 470 carried a drag coefficient of [...]|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the angular distribution of damping coefficient of ablated particle under various ambient gases, nanocrystalline silicon films are systemically deposited on a circular substrate by pulse laser ablation in pure He, Ne, and Ar gases, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy images and Raman and X-ray diffraction spectra {{indicate that the}} average size of Si nanoparticles decreases {{with the increase of}} the <b>departure</b> <b>angle</b> between the film and the plume, and Ne gas induces the smallest and most uniform Si nanoparticles in size among all the three gases. Further theoretical simulation demonstrates the bigger the <b>departure</b> <b>angle,</b> the smaller the damping coefficient of ablated particle, and the damping coefficient in Ne gas is largest for the same angle, implying the most effective energy transfer between Si and ambient atoms...|$|E

40|$|As the Galileo probe relay {{radio link}} (RRL) signal propagates outward through the Jovian {{atmosphere}}, the atmosphere will manifest itself in two ways. First, the geometric path {{length of the}} signal is increased, resulting in a small change of the RRL signal <b>departure</b> <b>angle</b> from the proble (transmitter). Secondly, the velocity of the signal is decreased. For a spherical, static atmosphere with a known profile of refractivity versus altitude the effects of refraction on the RRL frequency can be found using a variation of standard ray-tracing techniques, whereby the ray <b>departure</b> <b>angle</b> is found by an iterative process. From the dispersive characteristics of a mixture of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of methane and ammonia a simple model of the Jovian atmosphere is constructed assuming spherical symmetry and uniform mixing.
