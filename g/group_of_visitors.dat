25|$|On June 24th, 2017, a 14-year-old {{girl from}} Greenwood, Delaware fell {{approximately}} 25 feet from her gondola, striking a tree before {{falling to the}} ground. The girl had slipped under the chair's safety bar while the ride was in motion. The ride was stopped when park visitors alerted the operators to the incident, while other visitors gathered underneath the girl to prepare to catch her. She ultimately fell into the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> below her, with an unidentified 47-year-old man receiving a back injury from the attempt. The passenger received no serious injuries, and {{was taken to a}} local hospital. Park officials stated there {{did not appear to be}} a malfunction of the ride, but closed the ride pending review.|$|E

Despite his obvious distress, Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812. Around 1814 however, {{by the age of}} 44, Beethoven was almost totally deaf, and when a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking, [...] "Ist es nicht schön?" [...] (Is it not beautiful?), they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humour (he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies first).|$|E

But at that time [...] "even the exact {{location}} of Zinat Mahal's grave had been forgotten though some local guides pointed out the sight of the withered lotus tree." [...] In 1905, the Muslims of Rangoon protested and demanded that there should be some measure to demarcate Zafar's grave because [...] "...As a man or as a king, Bahadur Shah was not to be admired, but he should be remembered."

60|$|Joe Crackenthorp's public-house had never, {{since it}} first reared its {{chimneys}} {{on the banks}} of the Solway, been frequented by such a miscellaneous <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> as had that morning become its guests. Several of them were persons whose quality seemed much superior to their dresses and modes of travelling. The servants who attended them contradicted the inferences to be drawn from the garb of their masters, and, according to the custom of the knights of the rainbow, gave many hints that they were not people to serve any but men of first-rate consequence. These gentlemen, who had come thither chiefly for the purpose of meeting with Mr. Redgauntlet, seemed moody and anxious, conversed and walked together apparently in deep conversation, and avoided any communication with the chance travellers whom accident brought that morning to the same place of resort.|$|E

A small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> had {{gathered}} {{at the other end}} of the gallery and had been there overtaken by Henry St. George, who strolled in from a neighbouring room. He stood near them a moment, not falling into the talk but taking up an old miniature from a table and vaguely regarding it. At the end of a minute he became aware of Miss Fancourt and her companion in the distance; whereupon, laying down his miniature, he approached them with the same procrastinating air, his hands in his pockets and his eyes turned, right and left, to the pictures. The gallery was so long that this transit took some little time, especially as there was a moment when he stopped to admire the fine Gainsborough. [...] "He says Mrs. St. George has been the making of him," [...] the girl continued in a voice slightly lowered.|$|E

60|$|Until {{after dinner}} Ethelberta {{felt as if}} she were staying at an hotel. Few of the people whom she had met at the meeting of the Imperial Association greeted her here. The viscount's brother was not present, but Sir Cyril Blandsbury and his wife were there, a lively pair of persons, {{entertaining}} as actors, and friendly as dogs. Beyond these all the faces and figures were new to her, though they were handsome and dashing enough to satisfy a court chronicler. Ethelberta, in a dress sloped about as high over the shoulder as would have drawn approval from Reynolds, and expostulation from Lely, thawed and thawed each friend who came near her, and sent him or her away smiling; yet she felt a little surprise. She had seldom visited at a country-house, and knew little of the ordinary composition of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>visitors</b> within its walls; but the present assemblage seemed to want much of that old-fashioned stability and quaint monumental dignity she had expected to find under this historical roof. Nobody of her entertainer's own rank appeared. Not a single clergyman was there. A tendency to talk Walpolean scandal about foreign courts was particularly manifest. And although tropical travellers, Indian officers and their wives, courteous exiles, and descendants of Irish kings, were infinitely more pleasant than Lord Mountclere's landed neighbours would probably have been, to such a cosmopolite as Ethelberta a calm Tory or old Whig company would have given a greater treat. They would have struck as gratefully upon her senses as sylvan scenery after crags and cliffs, or silence after the roar of a cataract.|$|E
