5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon {{their ability to}} hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) {{to which they are}} exposed. Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not to <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> European and Third World refugees helped {{prepare the}} UNHCR {{for a change}} in the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E

25|$|Criticism of Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{emerges from}} evidence {{which suggests that}} male primates can <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> their own offspring and the offspring of others. In one study, researchers analysed the DNA of 75 juvenile baboons to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or {{a threat to their}} social standing. Evidently, if males can <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring is, or is not, their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> different objects. The bull shark is able to <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is very important because it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} warning time, the CH {{systems were}} built {{close to the}} shore facing out to sea, placing them {{as close to the}} enemy as possible. This meant they provided no information for friendly fighters {{on the way to the}} attack, or of enemy aircraft once they crossed the coast. For these areas, Dowding planned to rely on the existing Observer Corps (OC) system that Fighter Command inherited from ADGB. Using different equipment, the reports from CH and the ROC were sometimes contradictory, and the volume of information supplied by the national network was overwhelming. An added problem was the lack of identification of the aircraft; CH could not <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> friendly and hostile aircraft at that time, and the OC could not <b>discriminate</b> <b>between</b> friendly and enemy fighters when they were flying at high altitude.|$|E
