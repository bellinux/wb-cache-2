40|$|In {{the human}} sciences, a student research-centered {{pedagogy}} is constrained by institutional <b>ethics</b> <b>review,</b> {{yet there is}} little research {{on the impact of}} <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> on research-led teaching. This article documents a range of ways that Australian universities are responding to <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> of undergraduate human research. Forty teachers and administrators were interviewed at 14 universities using purposive sampling to document the range of ways teachers are avoiding <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> or incorporating it into their curriculum. Some reported halting undergraduate research or evading <b>ethics</b> <b>review,</b> regarding it as meaningless bureaucracy divorced from actual ethical thinking. Those who incorporated <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> into student research did so by collaborating with administrators. Institutions can facilitate research-led teaching by designing dedicated forms and decentralized review procedures for student research. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Large scale, {{multisite}} {{clinical research}} trials have been increasing in frequency.

While local (institutional) review may be necessary in some instances, repetitive reviews may require unnecessary changes and not serve to further protect participants.

40|$|Unique {{characteristics}} of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) complicate {{the interpretation of}} standard research ethics guidelines. Variable interpretation by research ethics committees may further complicate review and conduct. An international web-based survey was administered to corresponding authors of 300 randomly sampled CRT publications. We investigated <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> and consent practices, investigator experiences with <b>ethics</b> <b>review,</b> and the perceived need for CRT-specific ethics guidelines. The response rate was 64 %. <b>Ethics</b> <b>review</b> and consent were under-reported in publications. Ethics approval was obtained in 91 %, and consent from individual and cluster level participants in 79 % and 82 % of trials. Consent varied by level of experimental intervention, data collection, and cluster size. Respondents cited variability among ethics committees (46 %), and negative impacts of <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> on their studies (38 %). The majority perceived a need for ethics guidelines (73 %), and guidance for ethics committees (70 %). CRT-specific ethics guidelines are required to ensure practices meet ethical standards...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we examine “ethics creep”, a concept {{developed}} by Haggerty (2004) {{to account for}} the increasing bureaucratization of research ethics boards and institutional review boards (REB/IRBs) and the expanding reach of <b>ethics</b> <b>review.</b> We start with an overview of the recent surge of academic interest in ethics creep and similar arguments about the prohibitive effect of <b>ethics</b> <b>review.</b> We then introduce elements of Michel Foucault's theoretical framework which are used to inform our analysis of empirical data drawn from a multi-phase study exploring the accessibility of community-engaged research within existing <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> structures in Canada. First, we present how ethics creep emerged both explicitly and implicitly in our data. We then present data that demonstrate how REB/IRBs are experiencing their own form of regulation. Finally, we present data that situate <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> alongside other trends affecting the academy. Our results show that <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> is growing in some ways while simultaneously being constrained in others. Drawing on Foucauldian theory we reframe ethics creep as a repressive hypothesis which belies the complexity of the phenomenon it purports to explain. Our discussion complicates ethics creep by proposing an understanding of REB/IRBs that locates them at the intersection of various neoliberal discourses about the role of science, ethics, and knowledge production...|$|R

40|$|To date {{there is}} no {{established}} consensus of assessment criteria for evaluating research <b>ethics</b> <b>review.</b> We conducted a scoping review of empirical research assessing <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> processes {{in order to identify}} common elements assessed, research foci, and research gaps to aid in the development of assessment criteria. Electronic searches of Ovid Medline, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane DSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR, CMR, HTA, and NHSEED, were conducted. After de-duplication, 4234 titles and abstracts were reviewed. Altogether 4036 articles were excluded following screening of titles, abstracts and full text. A total of 198 articles included for final data extraction. Few studies originated from outside North America and Europe. No study reported using an underlying theory or framework of quality/effectiveness to guide study design or analyses. We did not identify any studies that had involved a controlled trial [...] randomised or otherwise [...] of <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> procedures or processes. Studies varied substantially with respect to outcomes assessed, although tended to focus on structure and timeliness of <b>ethics</b> <b>review.</b> Our findings indicate a lack of consensus on appropriate assessment criteria, exemplified by the varied study outcomes identified, but also a fragmented body of research. To date research has been largely quantitative, with little attention given to stakeholder experiences, and is largely cross sectional.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to answer the question, “does the <b>ethics</b> committee <b>review</b> process in Malaysia provide meaningful protection to mentally incapacitated adults who enrol in clinical research trials?” This question is answered by examining three {{important aspects of the}} <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process. First, the quality of the deliberations of ethics committees is examined by looking at the underlying principles that are meant to guide ethics decision-making. Second, the thesis looks at the current regulatory framework under which ethics committees operate and considers the adequacy of these guidelines in protecting human subjects. Finally, this thesis considers the notion of conflicts of interests in the clinical trials arena and calls into question the independence of the <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process and how this impacts on the interests of human subjects in general and mentally incapacitated adults in particular. The conclusion reached {{at the end of this}} thesis is that the <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process in Malaysia fails adequately to provide meaningful protection to mentally incapacitated adults. While the reasons for this are many, several factors are particularly significant, namely, the creation of a globalised clinical trials market, the lack of formal and systematic training of ethics committee members and the institutional structures of ethics committees. Although the main focus of this thesis is the Malaysian <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> process, many of the comments and discussions put forward in this thesis are highly relevant to the <b>ethics</b> <b>review</b> processes in other jurisdictions given the international regulatory scheme that currently governs the conduct of clinical trials in many parts of the world...|$|R
