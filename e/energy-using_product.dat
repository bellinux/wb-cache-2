40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and conservation are considered key means for reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and achieving other energy policy goals, but associated market behavior and policy responses have engendered debates in the economic literature.

In particular, we provide an economic perspective on the range of market barriers, market failures, and behavioral failures that have been cited in the energy efficiency context. We assess {{the extent to which}} these conditions provide a motivation for policy intervention in <b>energy-using</b> <b>product</b> markets, including an examination of the evidence on policy effectiveness and cost.

Subsidies may be provided downstream to energy suppliers and/or upstream to technology suppliers; each has tradeoffs. Subsidies can offset underprovision upstream, but they allow dirty generation to expand when the portfolio standard becomes less binding. Downstream subsidies raise all upstream profits and crowd out foreign emissions. Upstream subsidies increase domestic upstream market share but expand emissions globally. In our two-region model, strategic subsidies chosen noncooperatively can be optimal from a global perspective, if both regions value emissions at the global cost of carbon.

The article describes an original method for environmentally assessing the durability of <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> in order to identify if and to what extent the potential extension of the product's lifetime could have life-cycle benefits. The method is based on the comparison, within a life-cycle perspective, of two scenarios of different lifetimes of a target product and its potential substitution with better performing alternatives. The method considers some key parameters of durability, including the product's lifetime, energy consumptions, impacts of lifetime extension and characteristics of the replacement product. The method can be used for ecodesign purposes by manufacturers or by policy makers. The applicability and robustness of the method are discussed, including limitations, difficulties and possible improvement. A general index and a simplified index have been introduced. The applicability and relevance of the simplified durability index is shown in two case-studies (of washing machines).

A general index and a simplified index have been derived from the method. The applicability and relevance of the simplified durability index is shown in two case studies (of washing machines). The results of the assessment can be used for ecodesign purposes by manufacturers (e. g. for the identification of technical design options for extending the lifetime of products) or by policy makers (e. g. in setting requirements for product policies).

40|$|Does {{technological}} innovation {{to improve the}} efficiency of <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> and systems lead to lower energy consumption and hence reduced environmental impacts? The answer given by economists since the mid nineteenth century is ‘no’. This is because there are direct ‘rebound’ or ‘take-back’ effects caused by energy efficiency improvements that lower the implicit price of energy, often leading to greater consumption. Also there are secondary or indirect effects of reducing energy costs through efficiency in that consumers may buy more products and/or choose, larger, more powerful, more feature laden models. Thus just promoting technical innovation to increase energy efficiency is unlikely to lead to reduced energy consumption and emissions. Other policies such as taxation or regulation are required. As well as setting the theoretical arguments concerning innovation and energy efficiency the paper outlines results from an empirical research project, ‘People-centred eco-design’, which seeks to identify the key influencing factors on consumer adoption and effective use of energy efficient products and systems. In particular it aims to identify how consumers may avoid (or mitigate) rebound effects and how manufacturers, service providers and government might design and promote such products to achieve their optimal environmental benefits...|$|R

40|$|Early {{steps of}} product {{development}} determine essential features in {{all phases of}} the life cycle of a product. Thus design offers the largest degree of freedom in influencing the characteristics of a product. During the recent years the need of environment friendly products lead to the development of eco-design processes.

After a brief review of the policy history surrounding SCP, we organize our discussion and the subsequent collection of articles into two groups.

This work confirms and refines several insights that have been developing over the past several years, namely that food and beverages, mobility, housing, and <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> are the most critical consumption domains from the standpoint of environmental sustainability and that higher household income leads to greater (but less than proportional) impacts. The second subset of articles analyzes the potential for mitigating these impacts through behavioral changes and innovation strategies.

40|$|Abstract—Electronic variable-speed drives (VSDs) {{can produce}} large energy and {{environmental}} savings in variable-load variable-speed applications when compared with other conventional tech-nologies. There are {{a very large number}} of applications (e. g., fluid motion, materials handling, and materials processing) which would benefit, both in terms of process improvement and energy savings, through the use of speed control. Previous studies have shown that the variable-flow fluid motion applications (pumps, fans, and compressors) have the largest savings potential. In this paper, an ecodesign analysis of two different technologies for the flow regulation in pumping systems—constant-speed pump with an output throttle valve (motor directly fed from the line) and variable-speed pump without an output throttle valve (motor fed by a variable-speed drive) —is presented. A European standard methodology for the ecodesign analysis of <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> is used in this paper. This paper includes a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts and life-cycle costs.
