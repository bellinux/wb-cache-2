The {{requirement of the}} lifting application is a motor with high torque and low speed, so that the <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> motor {{seems to be a}} suitable solution. By means of a <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> system, there is the possibility to eliminate the elevator room. The paper includes an analytical approach to the design, a comparison with the ﬁnite element analysis and a test on a ﬁnal realization of this kind of motor...|$|R
40|$|A <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> {{generator}} used in {{wind turbine}} has high energy yield {{compared to other}} drivetrain topologies and low maintenance is expected as the technology matures. On the other hand <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> generator weight and size increases rapidly when scaled up to larger units. This paper will investigate the possibility of weight reduction of large <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> generator using magnetic bearings without compromising maintenance. Three different configurations using magnetic bearings i. e. single magnetic bearing concept, flexible rotor and hybrid concept have been analyzed. The results show {{that a combination of}} magnetic bearings and mechanical bearing with stiff radial structure and axial flexibility i. e. hybrid concept has the possibility to reduce weight of <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> machine significantly compared to conventional design.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} ways that the {{performance}} of <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> serial robots changes as system size is changed. We are {{particularly interested in the}} physical laws for scaling down <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> arms to small sizes. Using theoretical scaling analysis, we show that there is a net physical performance advantage to small <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> arms. A key factor for <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> robot performance is the torque to mass ratio of the actuators,. We show how varies with the scale of DD actuators, and we also calculate how the dynamic U U In Press, International Journal of Robotics Research, 15 : 5, June 96 093 - 2 - performance varies with scale and. We compare our calculations with experimental measurements of actuators of various sizes taken from small hard disk drives and compare them with published data for larger motors. Finally, we describe a prototype, 5 -axis, <b>direct</b> <b>drive,</b> serial arm having a reach of 10 cm and a workvolume of about 136 cm 3. Some potential applications are briefly discussed.

40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind farms. This trend {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared generators and gearless (<b>direct</b> <b>drive)</b> generators have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades. <b>Direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators based on permanent magnet technology have a high efficiency, less components and lower speeds that can translate to high energy yield and less maintenance demand. However, the mass of such <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators can be significantly higher than of other geared generators. This thesis focuses on the issue of mass reduction of large <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators in wind turbines. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate methods of mass reduction in large <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators in wind turbines especially mass reduction by introducing structural flexibility in the generator. This allowance in structural flexibility is enabled by the use of magnetic bearing technology. EPPElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} and analytical {{evidence indicates that}} <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> robots become very practical and economical at miniature and microscopic scales, so {{it is interesting to}} understand quantitatively the properties of <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> robots under scaling transformations. This leads to a study of how screws and their dual co-screws behave under the group of similarity transforms. This group is the group of isometries together with dilations. Several different representations are found on the space of screws and complementary representations are found on the dual space of co-screws. From the electromagnetic theory of the force and torque on a magnet in a magnetic field, we derive the scaling properties of the electromagnetic wrench. Hence, these results can be directly applied to the scaling of <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> motors [1]. We conclude by proposing a scale-invariant measure for <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> actuator performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of wind turbines currently in operation have the conventional Danish concept design-that is, the three-bladed rotor of such turbines is indirectly {{coupled with an}} electrical generator via a gearbox. Recent technological developments have enabled <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> wind turbines to become economically feasible. Potentially, <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> wind turbines may enjoy higher levels of availability due to {{the removal of the}} gearbox from the design. However, this is only a theory: so far not substantiated by detailed analytic calculation.
