However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E

Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits {{that he does not}} care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{books and}} letters written by Bahá'u'lláh cover {{religious}} doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, {{social and moral}} teachings as well as Bahá'í laws; he also wrote many prayers. Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, analyzing Baha'u'llah's writings, states that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings. All of his works are considered by Bahá'ís to be revelation, even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim. Some of his better known works that have been translated into English include Gleanings, the Hidden Words, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-Íqán.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{a number}} of Irish-language poets have come to prominence. These include Máirtín Ó Direáin (19101988), Seán Ó Ríordáin (19161977), Máire Mhac an tSaoi (born 1922), Michael Hartnett (born 1941), Gabriel Rosenstock (born 1949), and Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill (born 1952). While all these poets are {{influenced}} by the Irish poetic tradition, they have also shown the ability to assimilate influences from poetries in other languages. The dramatist and actor Micheál Mac Liammóir (1899–1978) included many poetic verses <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Irish-language in his works.|$|E
25|$|John Mirk, a Lilleshall {{canon of}} the late 14th and early 15th centuries did make a {{literary}} mark. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local West Midland dialect of Middle English {{and at least two}} of his works were widely copied and used. Festial is a collection of homilies for the festivals of the Liturgical year as it was celebrated in his time in Shropshire. Instructions for Parish Priests is in lively vernacular verse, using octosyllabic lines and rhyming couplets throughout. Mirk intended to ensure that priests had the resources to give good counsel to their flock. The existence of such works suggests that the canons were actively engaged with the liturgical and pastoral work of their region, if not at the highest scholarly level.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} farming {{activity in}} the uplands is sheep grazing, using mainly the Wicklow Cheviot breed. Land is also used for forestry and turf cutting. Tourism and recreation are also major activities in the uplands. Glendalough remains the most popular destination, receiving around one million visitors each year. Recreational activities in the mountains include walking, rock climbing,winter climbing, fishing and cycling. Hillwalking in the Wicklow Mountains was first popularised by J. B. Malone through a weekly column <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Evening Herald newspaper. Malone was later instrumental {{in the creation of}} the Wicklow Way, Ireland's first National Waymarked Trail, which opened in 1980 and crosses the Wicklow Mountains. The Wicklow Way has been joined by the Dublin Mountains Way and the Saint Kevin's Way pilgrim path, both of which also traverse parts of the mountains.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Leigh Fermor {{decided to}} walk the length of Europe, from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (Istanbul). He set off on 8 December 1933, {{less than a year}} after Hitler had come to power in Germany, with a few clothes, several letters of introduction, the Oxford Book of English Verse and a Loeb volume of Horace's Odes. He slept in barns and shepherds' huts, but also was invited by landed gentry and {{aristocracy}} into the country houses of Central Europe. He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way. Two of his later travel books, A Time of Gifts (1977) and Between the Woods and the Water (1986), were about this journey. A book on the final part of his journey was unfinished at the time of Leigh Fermor's death, but was published as The Broken Road: Travels from Bulgaria to Mount Athos in September 2013 by John Murray. The book draws on Leigh Fermor's diary at the time and on an early draft <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|E

5000|$|Bagert’s {{life as a}} children’s author {{began when}} his eight-year-old {{daughter}} asked him to write a poem for her to perform in her school elocution program.
