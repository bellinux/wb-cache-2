The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000. It then was donated to the Edison Association of Illuminating Companies. The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The display information for each Case <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years. In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E

Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing {{some of the men}} off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E

In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route.

25|$|The scene changed {{every hour}} as the coup progressed. Here <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> {{unfolded}} {{after the first}} tanks rolled in {{according to the observations}} of Manik Sethisuwan. Manik was one of a few citizens who was forced to spend the night on the street as his car had run out of gas. According to government laws as of September 2006, it was mandatory for all gas and petrol stations in the city to close-down from 22:00–05:00 as a cost-saving measure. Hence he was forced to seek refuge near the international press personnel until it was possible for him to move out, as a result of which he was able to capture most of the event as it unfolded.|$|E
25|$|Cost accounting, {{as a vital}} {{factor of}} {{successful}} business administration, has, {{in the last few}} years, been brought home in various ways to many manufacturers who before had never seriously appreciated its importance.The Federal Trade Commission, working for more stable conditions, has conducted a widespread campaign of education, explaining in detail what a cost accounting system <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is operated, and the resulting business advantages.Various manufacturers' associations have first paid skilled accountants to devise cost-finding methods suited to their special trade conditions, and then have instituted a vigorous propaganda to induce all engaged in their own particular industry to adopt them, thus making these methods uniform in the trade and securing uniformity of selling prices and the end of reckless and ignorant price-cutting.Now the government, with its need to levy war taxes and its consequent necessity for searching investigation into income and excess profits, requires that estimates and approximations as to production costs and profits shall give place to rational accounting systems giving actual figures by uniform methods.|$|E
500|$|Integral to {{the story}} of the origin of the name [...] "Antarctica" [...] <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was not named Terra Australis—this name was given to Australia instead, and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a {{significant}} landmass would not be found farther south than Australia. Explorer Matthew Flinders, in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name Terra Australis to Australia. He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis (1814) by writing in the introduction: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} the activity-based costing (ABC) literature which has been accumulated in the UK and USA accounting journals over the fourteen-year period since the first articles on ABC emerged. This evidence is used both longitudinally and cross-sectionally to gain insights into how ABC started, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> communicated, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> researched, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> constituted, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> has generated attention and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> has developed and changed. From the analysis conclusions are drawn on these issues and on the role of academic research when confronted by a new practical innovation of this type. ...|$|R

500|$|The critic Johan Henric Kellgren, in his {{introduction}} to the first edition, found that the songs could not be known fully only as poems. Never before, he stated, had the art of poetry and the art of music been more fraternally united. They were not, Kellgren argued, verse that had been set to music; not music, set to verse; but the two were so thoroughly melted together into One beauty {{that it was impossible to}} see which would most miss the other for its fulfilment. Quoting this in the final paragraph of his thesis, the musicologist James Massengale commented [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> ought to be said!" ...|$|E

Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates [...] and [...] (This is bad and This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.|$|E

He didn't want to just bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back.

500|$|A {{document}} from 1200 AD mentions a walled garden {{owned by}} the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter, Westminster. A later document, dated between 1250 and 1283, refers to [...] "the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster". By the 13th century this had become a [...] quadrangle of mixed orchard, meadow, pasture and arable land, lying between modern-day St Martin's Lane and Drury Lane, and Floral Street and Maiden Lane. The use of the name [...] "Covent"—an Anglo-French term for a religious community, equivalent to [...] "monastery" [...] or [...] "convent"—appears in a document in 1515, when the Abbey, which had been letting out parcels of land along {{the north side of}} the Strand for inns and market gardens, granted a lease of the walled garden, referring to it as [...] "a garden called Covent Garden".

Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His neurologist prescribed him medication {{that he would have to}} self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini-fridge in their van has become normal routine. The medication has let him continue drumming with the band, as it eliminated his symptoms, and he has stated that [...] "this changes nothing about my band or me." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy Hickman once ran the {{adventure}} as a Dungeon Master.

Sure enough, the vampire was {{up there in the}} castle. To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his friend said, to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is with people who fall from greatness.
