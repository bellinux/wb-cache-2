The effects of various formulation variables on the size and drug release were also investigated...|$|R

Eight batches of ER matrix tablets of Metoprolol succinate were developed by using wet granulation technique and coated with <b>hydroxy</b> <b>propyl</b> methyl cellulose (KM 100) and hydroxyl methyl cellulose for extended release. Compressed tablets were evaluated for weight variation, hardness, friability and in vitro dissolution using paddle (USP type II) method. All formulation showed compliance with pharmacopoeial standards. Among the eight formulations, F 8 showed extended release of drug for 20 hours with 87. 1 % drug release and subjected to stability studies for 3 months at 40 C/ 75 % RH and 60 C/ 80 %RH...|$|R
