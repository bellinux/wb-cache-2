5|$|By 1935, {{unbeknownst to}} the public, Piłsudski had {{for several years}} been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{announcement}} of his death. It was led by military personnel — former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} whether Birago {{received}} compensation for <b>the</b> theft <b>of</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book or what happened to most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stolen pages. It can be ascertained from <b>the</b> current condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book that the pages stolen from Birago included the entire calendar, folios from the Gospel lessons, <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross, <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit, <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin, the Passion according to Saint Luke, three prayers to the Virgin, and <b>the</b> Suffrages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saints.|$|R
50|$|The piece {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} in G major, with vocal assistance in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a recitative which is omitted in the symphonic version.

5|$|During a light {{snow fall}} of December 2009, Basingstoke and the {{surrounding}} area {{was one of the worst}} hit regions in the United Kingdom, where an estimated 3000 motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles around the town and on the ring road during the evening rush <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christmas holidays.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{dominated}} both {{practice sessions}} on the Friday, with Räikkönen fastest {{in the first}} Practice Session and Felipe Massa was fastest in the second Practice Session. Behind the Ferraris, Alonso was third in his McLaren, but seven tenths behind, with his teammate and World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton sixth, but lost nearly an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session due to car trouble. The two McLarens were split by David Coulthard and Nico Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|I had the chills. I had a {{great feeling}} about it when we {{finished}} writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning...

50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} goatskin binding, and is made on parchment folios (202), 19 x 13 cm in size, {{for a total}} of 404 pages. A calendar without artwork contrasts with <b>the</b> many illustrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different chapters: <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin, <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross, and <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit, with full-page miniatures and borders full of plants, monsters or satirical scenes, with applied gold leaf on many illustrations and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lettering.|$|R

5|$|In September 2000, Harries' {{portfolio}} {{was significantly}} expanded {{when he was}} appointed Granada's controller of drama, following the resignations of Sue Hogg and Simon Lewis. 2002 commissions included Doctor Zhivago and Henry VIII. ITV would provide only £750,000 for each <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serials, so Harries approached US broadcaster WGBH {{to make up the}} remaining funds. Following the merging of Granada Films with Granada Productions in 2002, Harries' brief was expanded to include films.|$|E
5|$|The rebuilt Lamborghini of JLOC Isao Noritake was {{the first}} {{retirement}} of the race when the gearbox failed on the Mulsanne during its second lap of the race.

5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used within an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

50|$|The most {{innovative}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manuscript are lavishly illuminated and found {{in two different}} iconographic cycles: <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross and <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin. <b>The</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross contain fourteen miniatures arranged in pairs which depict <b>the</b> Passion <b>of</b> Christ from <b>the</b> entrance into Jerusalem to the holy burial. <b>The</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin contain eight pairs of miniatures, most of which feature an episode from Our Lady’s life from the Annunciation to the Crowning, together with the occasional related episode from the Old Testament. The manuscript’s finest miniatures {{are to be found}} in these two cycles, in which the artist reduces the text inserts to a minimum, sometimes just two lines, to leave as much room as possible for the illumination. <b>The</b> uniform style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> margins helps give these insertions a seamless, visual continuity.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} {{up in the}} stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, ABC {{confirmed}} via a {{press release}} that New Year's Rockin' Eve would return for its 2012–13 edition. Ryan Seacrest, Jenny McCarthy and Fergie reprised their roles as host, Times Square reporter and Hollywood host, respectively. Carly Rae Jepsen, Neon Trees, Psy with MC Hammer, and Taylor Swift performed live in Times Square, while the Hollywood segments of the show included performances by Brandy, Flo Rida, Ellie Goulding, Jason Aldean, Justin Bieber, Karmin, OneRepublic, Pitbull and The Wanted. The primetime <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program was preceded by a two-hour tribute special, New Year's Rockin' Eve Celebrates Dick Clark. Clark's legacy was also recognized by the Times Square Alliance, organizers of the ball drop: a triangular Waterford Crystal panel engraved with Dick Clark's name was presented to his widow Kari Wigton, and installed on the ball.|$|E
5|$|Minimum {{processing}} requirements {{also became}} {{an issue in the}} Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). Dunderdale announced {{in a speech to the}} St. John's Board of Trade in May 2013, that the loan guarantee for the Muskrat Falls project nearly fell apart because of MPRs. She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loan guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee.|$|E

5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 brought ABC's highest {{ratings on}} New Year's Eve since ABC 2000 Today; an average 8.4 million viewers watched the 40th anniversary retrospective, the primetime hour brought in 12.9 million viewers, {{and the first}} <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{broadcast}} peaked at 22.6 million viewers. These numbers excluded viewership from locations such as bars and New Year's Eve parties, as Nielsen ratings do not account for out-of-home viewership (however, the company announced on October 24, 2016 that it would begin to offer out-of-home ratings data to broadcasters in April 2017).|$|E
5|$|Other {{offering}} rituals {{took place}} at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened. Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In {{the cult of the}} sun god Ra, for instance, hymns were sung day and night for every <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god's journey across the sky. Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like Apep or Set, acts that were believed to have a real effect through the principle of heka.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay used as a wildlife sanctuary. Upwards of 300 policemen and fire fighters, including 125 detectives attending a narcotics seminar at the Police Academy, as well as Coast Guard helicopters were mobilized to the crash site within half an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash for rescue operations, only to find there were no survivors. The three-alarm fire was under control by 10:50 AM EST, by which point only wreckage remained. Low tides aided search personnel {{in their attempts to}} recover bodies from the downed aircraft.
