60|$|Now we all, I trust, hold <b>God</b> to <b>be</b> supremely good. We ascribe to Him, in perfection, {{every kind}} of {{goodness}} of which we can conceive in man. We say <b>God</b> <b>is</b> just; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> truthful; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> pure; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> bountiful; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> merciful; and, in one word, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> Love.|$|R
5000|$|God's {{immutability}} defines all God's other attributes: <b>God</b> <b>is</b> immutably wise, merciful, good, and gracious.

Infiniteness and immutability in <b>God</b> <b>are</b> mutually supportive and imply each other.

2500|$|<b>God</b> has <b>been</b> {{conceived}} as either personal or impersonal. In theism, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the creator, {{but not the}} sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the universe itself. In atheism, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> not believed to exist, while <b>God</b> <b>is</b> deemed unknown or unknowable {{within the context of}} agnosticism. <b>God</b> has also <b>been</b> {{conceived as}} the source of all moral obligation, and the [...] "greatest conceivable existent".

5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest <b>god</b> <b>was</b> called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's third book, Arrow of <b>God,</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 1964. Like its predecessors, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set {{in the village}} of Umuaro {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners' secret. As with Okonkwo in Things Fall Apart and Obi in No Longer at Ease, Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting tragedy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the Church of the Holy Mother of <b>God</b> <b>was</b> the {{terminus}} of two rival religious processions organised by the ethnic Greek and Bulgarian communities of Asenovgrad. A Greek procession took place in 1899 and a comparable Bulgarian one was carried out several years later. These processions began after a man claimed to have seen lights and heard chants while passing near the then-abandoned church. Both processions ended with a Divine Liturgy observed at night by the church.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{dominant}} characters within the book of Lamentations <b>is</b> <b>God.</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> spoken about and spoken to, although the voice of <b>God</b> <b>is</b> never heard. Various voices within the text speak of God, describing both God’s actions and God’s attributes. These descriptions give rise to various, and at times conflicting images: <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the violent destroyer {{of the city and}} her inhabitants; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> an absent <b>God,</b> whose presence <b>is</b> longed for; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> a <b>God</b> of steadfast love and mercy; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the one in whom future hope lies. This paper analyses the multifaceted portrayal of the character of God as constructed in the book of Lamentations, exploring the implications of that characterisation for our understanding of the theology of Lamentations...|$|R
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of <b>God</b> <b>was</b> a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because <b>God</b> <b>was</b> first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that <b>God</b> <b>was</b> delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that <b>God</b> <b>was</b> working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E
