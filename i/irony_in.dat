5|$|Freki {{is also a}} name {{applied to}} the monstrous wolf Fenrir in the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá. Folklorist John Lindow sees <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> the fact that Odin feeds one Freki at his dinner table and another—Fenrir—with his flesh during the events of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} see {{the conservative}} readings of Forrest Gump as indicants {{of the death}} of <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience's historical (self-) consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E

25|$|Jonah's passive {{character}} is {{contrasted with the}} other main character: Yahweh. God's {{character is}} altogether active. While Jonah flees, God pursues. While Jonah falls, God lifts up.

After a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail, Dick finds that he has conquered Joanna's lawful guardian, Lord Foxham, who promises to give Joanna to Dick in marriage after contemplated seaside rescue. There is <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> Foxham scolding Dick, who is nobly born, for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in Dick and Foxham's plans to rescue Joanna. Wounded in the failed seaside rescue, Foxham writes letters of recommendation for Dick to Richard Crookback, whom Dick must find {{on the outskirts of}} Shoreby.|$|E
25|$|The LIRR {{and other}} railroads that {{became part of}} the system have always had freight service, though this has diminished. The process of {{shedding}} freight service accelerated with the acquisition of the railroad by New York State. In the 21st century, there has been some appreciation of the need for better railroad freight service in New York City and on Long Island. Both areas are primarily served by trucking for freight haulage, an <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> a region with the most extensive rail transit service in the Americas as well as the worst traffic conditions. Proposals for a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel for freight have languished more than a century.|$|E

25|$|New York City-based Texas Is the Reason bridged the {{gap between}} indie rock and emo in their three-year {{lifespan}} on the East Coast, melding Sunny Day Real Estate's melodies and punk musicianship and singing directly to the listener.

Their 1995 album, Hello Bastards on Jade Tree Records, fused hardcore with emo and eschewed cynicism and <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> favor of love songs.

25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in <b>irony.</b> <b>In</b> 1911 the word Cubism was born {{in the same way as}} the word 'Impressionism' in 1872.|$|E
25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> his {{appearance}} in the above-mentioned episodes, is that 20 years before, LeBlanc left the role of Kirk McColl, the youngest son of Lisa's fifth husband, Whit McColl (played by Wagon Train star Robert Horton, who was killed off shortly before Fulton's return to the show). So, to many long-time fans of both As The World Turns and The Young and the Restless, seeing LeBlanc as the character from the latter show was weird. History was also made during LeBlanc's appearance on As the World Turns, since both shows are made by different production companies (Bell Dramatic Serial Company for The Young and the Restless; Procter and Gamble for As the World Turns), although {{they are on the}} same network.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a public}} outcry was brewing among the London populace who saw a {{sinister}} <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> {{the parallels between}} the conviction of Fisher {{and that of his}} patronal namesake, Saint John the Baptist, who was executed by King Herod Antipas for challenging the validity of Herod's marriage to his brother's divorcée Herodias. For fear of John Fisher's living through his patronal feast day, that of the Nativity of St John the Baptist on 24 June, and of attracting too much public sympathy, King Henry commuted the sentence to that of beheading, to be accomplished before 23 June, the Vigil of the feast of the Nativity of St John the Baptist. He was executed on Tower Hill on 22 June 1535. The execution had the opposite effect from that which King Henry VIII intended as it created yet another parallel with that of the martyrdom of St John the Baptist who was also beheaded; his death also happened on the feast day of Saint Alban, the first martyr of Britain.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{in a deal}} {{brokered}} by the Obama administration, Italian automaker Fiat {{initiated a}} white knight takeover of Chrysler to save the struggling automaker from liquidation. The deal was immediately compared to the AMC-Renault deal; Some commentators noted the <b>irony</b> <b>in</b> that Chrysler now faced the same fate that AMC faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there have been key differences between the two; Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne became CEO of Chrysler {{as part of the}} deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler's assets and product lines; The Fiat-Chrysler merger doesn't face the political opposition the AMC-Renault deal did since Fiat is entirely private and independent and the US Government supported the merger; Most importantly, while AMC proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and has since become an important source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the European debt crisis. The two firms would later fully merge to create Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014.|$|E
