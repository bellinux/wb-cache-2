40|$|Strategies for {{managing}} mixed broadleaf-conifer stands in British Columbia (BC) {{have been under}} review {{in recent years as}} the benefits of mixedwood management have been recognized. More has been learned about the role of broadleaves in forest ecosystems however ecosystem-specific knowledge about the competitive interactions between mixed broadleaf-conifer stands is still scarce. Therefore a competitive interactions study was conducted to facilitate ecosystem-specific management for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud. Var. latifolia Engelm.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in the sub-boreal spruce (SBS) zone of central BC. The experiment was a completely randomized block design with six different aspen densities replicated three times. Each replicate was sampled three times between ages 14 to 19 years. Pine diameter and height growth were influenced by aspen density. Our current quantitative findings suggest that lodgepole pine growth was not impacted when growing with aspen densities up to 2500 stems ha- 1. Considering <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> (FTG) and not <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> (NFTG) pine at the time of trial establishment, an insignificant difference was found for DBH, height and crown volume responses. Leaf area index (LAI) and diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) radiation were also not significantly different between FTG or NFTG trees suggesting our results exceed the current BC’s <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> standard.

This is visible from the continuously increasing size of afforestation of deciduous trees and decreasing size of afforestation.

This dissimilarity as well existed between afforestation of deciduous trees and dry vegetation.

The dissimilarity in distribution pattern of afforestation and deciduous tree afforestation LCTs {{is due to the fact}} that afforestation was made up of a mosaic of <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> pine and deciduous trees (mixed forest), which was gradually cultivated predominantly with deciduous trees and partly with pine trees (Table  4).|$|E

40|$|A new {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} Stefan's flow {{caused by a}} <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> droplet in vapor-gas atmosphere with several condensing components is presented. This analysis, based on the nonstationary heat and material balance and diffusion transport equations, shows {{the appearance of the}} Stefan inflow {{in the vicinity of the}} growing droplet and the outflow at large distances from the droplet as a consequence of nonisothermal condensation. For an ensemble of droplets in the atmospheric cloud, this flow provides an increase of the total volume of the cloud, which can be treated as cloud thermal expansion and leads to floating the cloud as a whole due to buoyancy. We have formulated the self-similar solutions of the nonstationary diffusion and heat conduction equations for a growing multicomponent droplet and have derived analytical expressions for the nonstationary velocity profile of Stefan's flow and the expansion volume of the vapor-gas mixture around the growing droplet. To illustrate the approach, we computed these quantities in the case of droplet of stationary composition in air with several specific vapors (C_ 2 H_ 5 OH/H_ 2 O; H_ 2 SO_ 4 /H_ 2 O; H_ 2 O).

For Pastinaca sativa were selected two populations: Pastinaca sativa - from the propagation crops and Pastinaca sativa - wild.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the evolution of}} foliar surface in different types of annual branches of apple using different methods of foliar surface determination. The investigations were {{carried out in the}} intensive orchard of Didactic Experimental Station “Criuleni”, Moldavia. The observations were made on the cultivar ‘Golden Delicious ’ grafted on an M 4 rootstock, and planted at 5 x 3 m distances, along the main four periods of ontogenetic cycle (growth, growth and fructification, fructification and growth, fructification). The trees were formed by the <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> palmette type. The leaf surface area was determined for all trees considered through measuring and numbering. In order to determine the dimension of the foliar surface, all types of annual shoots were measured. In addition, the quantity of leaves on the annual shoots and on the spurs was determined. Using the existing data, the leaf surface area for tree and area unit was calculated. Leaf area in the trees, during ontogenesis, was 3. 26 - 29. 9 m/tree, respectively 2. 1 - 10. 92 m/tree on the shoots and 1. 16 - 23. 7 m/tree on the spurs, spears and old spur systems...|$|E
30|$|Obviously, {{there is}} a {{constant}} need to improve our ability to predict hazards. One that concerns forest ecosystems in particular, is density-dependent tree mortality which is also known as self-thinning (Yoda et al. [1963]; Gingrich [1967]; Drew and Flewelling [1979]; Zeide [1987]; Hynynen [1993]; Luyssaert et al. [2008]). Observations about the maximum density of a planted forest may be assessed in unthinned and sufficiently large field plots maintained over long periods of time. Ideally, the experiment should include planting densities ranging from very low to very high stocking. High planting densities demonstrate effects of self-thinning while low densities reveal how widely-spaced trees are capable of occupying available <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> space. The study sites should be observed throughout the life of the trees to eliminate age effects, and they should cover an area that will carry a sufficient number of surviving large trees at maturity. Such a design will provide information about the maximum density of a planted forest independent of tree age or average tree size. Accordingly, this contribution presents a study based on long-term observations of maximum density in unthinned Pinus patula, P. elliottii and Eucalyptus grandis field plots based on Correlated Curve Trend (CCT) spacing studies established by O’Connor ([1935]) in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{different}} ecological zones {{impacted by the}} mountain pine beetle (MPB), we have focused on determining the proportion of each zone considered to be in poor condition and hence likely to recover slowly from a timber supply perspective, especially in the short- to mid-term. We did this by setting different threshold levels for the abundance of secondary structure – understory stocking and/or basal area of surviving residual trees – in post beetle attack stands. Understanding the extent of poorly stocked conditions {{is the first step}} in developing a recovery strategy and in properly projecting future yield expectations for MPB impacted landscapes. Unlike a regeneration or <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> survey after logging there are no simple and clear standards for assessing if a MPB impacted stand is in good condition. Because of uncertainty in future performance we provided a range of threshold levels of post-beetle conditions (2 - 10 m 2 ha- 1 of sub-canopy and canopy secondary structure and 400 - 1600 stems ha- 1 of understory) and associated proportions of each ecological unit meeting or exceeding these thresholds by pre-beetle pine composition. In this way, the problem can be bracketed and it is possible to see how changing thresholds affects the extent of the problem.

The abundances based on the crown coverage were compared with the abundances based on the parallel basal area of the tree stand. The canopy coverages and species number for peatland forests were also compared with those for mineral soil forests on the permanent sample plots (n = 1725) in 1995.

40|$|From {{experiments}} {{the following}} conclusions could be drawn: The increase in {{diameter of the}} stems of <b>free</b> <b>growing</b> tea plants is practically proportional to time if the growing conditions of the shrubs do not change. However, tea plants in gardens producing tea leaf are planted so closely, that full development of the bushes is hampered. Pruning and plucking further influences the trees physiologically. Tea shoots have an alternation of periods in which leaves are formed, and periods in which the development of leaves completely stops. Every shoot has its own rhythm not necessarily coinciding with that of other shoots of the same bush. This rhythm is not autonomic but is determined by outward circumstances. The effect of plucking green leaves {{for the production of}} dried tea can be divided into influences of the kind of leaves plucked, the length of the plucking round and the kind of leaves left on the bush on the production, quality of the leaves, and physiological condition of the plant. So nine different influences can be distinguished. Over a long period tea bushes cannot stand such severe plucking that would prevent the plucking level rising. Consequently pruning periodically is essential to keep the tea plantation productive. Pruning of tea gardens is also necessary to keep the plants in a good physiological condition. <p/...|$|E
