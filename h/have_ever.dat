50|$|Johnson’s 80.87 percent {{remains the}} highest vote share {{percentage}} any presidential candidate of either party <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> received in Rhode Island, and his 61.74 percent victory margin remains the widest margin by which any candidate of either party <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> won the state.

5|$|I believe few plays <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> adventured {{into the}} world under greater {{disadvantage}} than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And secondly, as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk and admiration of the town.|$|E

5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

5|$|In retrospect, Don Nelson, who {{had once}} coached the Bucks, had an {{outstanding}} trade instinct, essentially trading future career underachievers Traylor and Garrity for two future NBA MVPs in Nowitzki and Nash; in addition, the new recruits quickly became close friends. Nowitzki became only the fourth German player in NBA history, following pivots Uwe Blab and Christian Welp and All-Star swingman Detlef Schrempf, who was a 35-year-old veteran of the Seattle SuperSonics when his young compatriot arrived. Nowitzki finished his DJK career as the only Würzburg player to <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> made the NBA.|$|E
