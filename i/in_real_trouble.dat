25|$|Somerset were bowled out for 318 on {{the first}} day at New Road, but for the efforts of Malaysian Arul Suppiah (who made 72), wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard (74) and the 18-year-old debutant from Taunton, Robert Woodman (46 not out), it would have been far worse. The Worcestershire bowlers shared out the wickets, and Somerset were <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> at 57 for 5, but Suppiah stayed calm and the lower order made good contributions. Nadeem Malik got the best figures for Worcestershire, with three for 63.|$|E
25|$|The MCC {{played the}} {{combined}} grade teams of Northern New South Wales in a three-day {{game at the}} industrial town of Newcastle. The New South Welshmen batted first and Charlie Barker (101) became only the second player to make a century in a minor game against the MCC since the war. He added 196 for the fourth wicket with Michael Hill (98) as the home team made 334, with Bob Barber taking 4/57 with his leg-spin. The MCC were <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> at 106/5, but M.J.K. Smith (160) and Fred Titmus (114) added 260 runs for the sixth wicket and with Barry Knight hitting a late 35 not out the MCC totalled 449 for a lead of 115. John Scobie (35) and Ian Barton (20) made 57 for the first wicket, but Fred Titmus took 4/24 and they were out for 126, leaving the MCC just 12 runs to make for a 10 wicket victory.|$|E
25|$|February {{featured}} three Premier League encounters. Derby County were <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> in the Premier League, occupying 20th position, with 19th-place Fulham {{well out}} of reach for the East Midlands club. Their visit to St Andrew's also saw the return of Robbie Savage who left the Blues back in 2005. A Larsson goal looked like it had secured a valuable three points for the Blues before an 89th-minute Emanuel Villa goal secured a point for Derby. A trip to West Ham was next up for the Blues. Fredrik Ljungberg scored in the opening encounters for the Hammers, but a penalty from new signing McFadden made sure that the Blues would at least leave with a point. The last game of the month was a home match between the Blues and Arsenal. A 28th-minute free kick from McFadden opened the scoring, before two Theo Walcott goals within five minutes looked to have given the points to Arsenal, before an injury time McFadden penalty stole a point for the Blues. The game became highly controversial as within minutes of the kick off, a badly timed challenge by centre-back Martin Taylor broke the leg of Arsenal striker Eduardo. No one could complain about the automatic red card that referee Mike Dean showed Taylor, but comments after the game by Arsène Wenger campaigned for a much longer ban than the traditional three-match ban. Although Wenger later retracted his comments, his idea gained support with Sepp Blatter in particular, who campaigned for Taylor to be punished with a season-long ban. The defender also received death threats from supporters of the Croatia national team, as Eduardo would miss Euro 2008 in the summer.|$|E

500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble.</b> If what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth. How long does it take before you get angry and fight back?" [...] Their first target became the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which Kramer accused in The New York Times of neglecting badly needed medication for HIV-infected Americans.|$|E

5000|$|In 1964, Ross {{relocated}} to Seattle, having been offered the directorship in late 1963 {{of the new}} opera company being formed there. During his tenure with the Seattle Opera, he gained notice for his attention-grabbing promotional efforts and earned the nickname [...] "the P. T. Barnum of opera". He used skywriting and bumper stickers, among other unusual advertising techniques. In addition, his slogans for his productions were often aimed at the emerging youth culture, such as the irreverent slogans, [...] "La Boheme: Six old-time hippies in Paris" [...] and [...] "Romeo et Juliette: Two kids <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble,</b> with their families." [...] His slogan [...] "Get Ahead with Salome" [...] ruffled the feathers of more traditional operagoers.

2500|$|Bob Willis {{opened the}} bowling {{with a stiff}} breeze behind him, but Peter Lever found it too much going into the wind and Mike Hendrick (2/64) {{replaced}} him after one over. Hendrick got Wally Edwards to mis-hook a short ball to a tumbling Dennis Amiss. At the other end Ian Redpath was backing away to leg to avoid Willis's bouncers, but exposed his off-stump and was yorked for 5, leaving Australia 10/2. The Chappell brothers recovered the innings with a stand of 100 runs in 155 minutes with Denness rotating his bowlers every four overs so they could rest. Ian Chappell was out of form and took 97 minutes to make 11 runs, but after lunch the fast bowlers were replaced by Tony Greig, who suffered as the brothers took advantage of his poor length. In {{the end it was}} Derek Underwood who dismissed Greg Chappell for 58 with the best ball of the day, a leg-spinner which clipped the edge of his bat and was taken by Keith Fletcher at slip. The Australian captain started arguing with Greig as the lanky bowler's footmarks were in line with the stumps and obliterating Chappell's block mark. Greig kept scuffing the block mark to even the ground so he would not trip and Chappell kept re-marking his block until they looked like schoolboys kicking dirt at each other. Chappell built up another partnership of 87 with Ross Edwards until the captain reached 90, decided to attack the bowling in the last hour of play and hooked Willis (4/56) into the hands of Greig, soon followed by Doug Walters who hooked him to Lever. Edwards was caught behind by another deadly delivery from Underwood (2/54) and 197/3 became 205/6 and 216/6 at stumps. The overnight batsmen Rod Marsh and Terry Jenner had to face Willis with the new ball and Jenner mis-hooked him to square-leg, where Lever ran 22 yards to take the catch. Marsh was beaten by Hendrick's swing and was caught by Denness to leave Australia 228/8 and <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> when they were saved by a wagging tail. The 6'4" [...] Max Walker started swinging the bat for 41 not out and added 29 with Dennis Lillee, who fell over trying to hook a medium-paced bouncer from Greig (1/70) and gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, who had missed a chance off Walker at 242/8. After Lillee had given Greig a few words of discouragement and walked off Jeff Thomson hit 23 and added 52 runs for the last wicket until he was run out by a brilliant pick up and throw from the England captain and Australia were all out for 309.|$|E

25|$|Durant scored 22 points, and James {{had eight}} assists while taking only six shots as the USA won their opening game 98–71 over France. The USA was never <b>in</b> any <b>real</b> <b>trouble,</b> but played sloppy in the beginning, missing their first six three-point {{attempts}} and being called for 18 personal fouls {{in the first}} half. Anthony and Westbrook spent the final six minutes of the half on the bench after their third personal fouls. The team led 52–36 at halftime, which expanded to 78–51 after three quarters.
