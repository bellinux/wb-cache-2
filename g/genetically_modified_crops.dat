5|$|Scientific {{advances}} in genetic engineering led to developments in crops. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> introduce new traits to plants {{which they do}} not have naturally. These can bring benefits such as a decrease in the use of harmful pesticides, by building in qualities such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b>|$|E

25|$|Under the UPA {{government}} that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of <b>Genetically</b> <b>Modified</b> <b>crops</b> had essentially put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted.

25|$|Commercial sale {{of genetically}} {{modified}} foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. GM livestock have been developed, although as of November 2013 none were on the market.|$|E
5000|$|Genes from a GMO may pass {{to another}} {{organism}} {{just like an}} endogenous gene. The process is known as outcrossing and can occur in any new open-pollinated crop variety. Introduced traits potentially can cross into neighboring plants of the same or closely related species through three different types of gene flow: crop-to-crop, crop-to-weedy, and crop-to-wild. In crop-to-crop, genetic information from a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop</b> is transferred to a non-genetically <b>modified</b> <b>crop.</b> Crop-to-weedy transfer refers to the transfer of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> material to a weed, and crop-to-wild indicates transfer from a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop</b> to a wild, undomesticated plant and/or crop. There are concerns that the spread of genes from modified organisms to unmodified relatives could produce species of weeds resistant to herbicides that could contaminate nearby non-genetically <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> or could disrupt the ecosystem, This is primarily a concern if the transgenic organism has a significant survival capacity and can increase in frequency and persist in natural populations. This process, whereby genes are transferred from GMOs to wild relatives, {{is different from the}} development of so-called [...] "superweeds" [...] or [...] "superbugs" [...] that develop resistance to pesticides under natural selection.|$|R
40|$|Game {{theory and}} {{numerical}} simulation analyze the host governments role in strategically regulating {{intellectual property rights}} (IPRs) for agricultural biotechnology in a developing country. A foreign monopolist imports and sells a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop</b> variety that will offer the host country both selective productivity gains and a negative externality. In this small open economy, only some heterogeneous producers adopt the new variety. Public policy consists of IPR enforcement and a corrective tax. Effectiveness of the tax depends upon the foreign monopolists ability to alter {{the price of the}} new technology and upon {{whether or not there is}} full enforcement of the IPRs. Whereas some governments may see their key decisions as being whether or not to license and to enforce IPRs on a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop</b> variety, greater gain might be realized through strategic choice of the tax rate to influence the rate of adoption among diverse domestic producers. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{regulation}} {{of genetic engineering}} concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage {{the risks associated with}} the development and release of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> There are differences in the {{regulation of}} GM crops between countries, {{with some of the most}} marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.

25|$|<b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> {{engineered}} to resist herbicides {{are now more}} available than conventionally bred resistant varieties.

25|$|Several tobacco {{plants have}} been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum {{cultivar}} 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology. Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant.

25|$|The genetically {{modified}} foods controversy {{consists of a}} set of disputes over the use of food made from <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> The disputes involve consumers, farmers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, environmental and political activists and scientists. The major disagreements include whether GM foods can be safely consumed, harm the environment and/or are adequately tested and regulated. The objectivity of scientific research and publications has been challenged. Farming-related disputes include the use and impact of pesticides, seed production and use, side effects on non-GMO crops/farms, and potential control of the GM food supply by seed companies.|$|E
25|$|The first genetically {{modified}} food approved for release was the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994.

25|$|Recently, chloroplasts {{have caught}} {{attention}} by developers of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not {{inherited from the}} male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen.

This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism {{has not yet been}} studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, 181.5 million {{hectares}} of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> were planted in 28 countries.
