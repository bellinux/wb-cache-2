40|$|Research {{supports}} {{a positive relationship}} between living-learning communities and students’ academic accomplishments and personal development. Successful communities reflect the institution’s mission, and the institution’s purpose and goals are adapted for the student population the communities serve. Living learning communities provide a sense of belonging, which is critical for students to persist in college to realize their full personal and academic potential. With limited research concerning living-learning communities and <b>honors</b> <b>students,</b> {{it is difficult to determine}} which characteristics of living-learning communities positively affect <b>honors</b> <b>students.</b> This document examines the relationship between the living-learning community (Niemeyer Living Center) and <b>honors</b> <b>students</b> at Grand Valley State University. The findings indicate <b>honors</b> <b>students</b> who participate in the Niemeyer Living Center perceive themselves to be more socially connected to their community and the campus, and are more involved in activities outside the classroom, than <b>honors</b> <b>students</b> living off-campus.

When {{he was hired by}} a railroad in Pike County, he and his wife agreed that she would remain in Fallsburg with the children until they finished school. Patton attended Fallsburg Elementary School, a four-room schoolhouse in his hometown. He was active in the 4-H club, where he began to develop his public speaking ability. In 1951, he enrolled at Louisa High School in Louisa, Kentucky.

40|$|To {{apprehend}} the {{panoply of}} spaces that house honors {{on a national}} scale requires input from administrators and faculty.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the similarities and}} dissimilarities between <b>Honors</b> and NonHonors <b>student</b> offenders in the disciplinary process and identified characteristics of <b>Honors</b> <b>students</b> who violate university policy. Prior research indicates that students who tend to violate university policy have low grade point averages (GPA). The distinguishing feature of the <b>Honors</b> <b>student,</b> however, is high academic achievement. The data consist of 296 disciplinary cases across two distinct academic years involving <b>Honors</b> and NonHonors <b>students.</b> The groups were compared on the following variables: (a) age, (b) gender, (c) ethnicity, (d) resident status, (e) class standing, (f) type of violation, (g) college enrollment, (h) Honors status, and (i) grade point average. Significant differences between <b>Honors</b> and NonHonors <b>student</b> offenders existed in (a) gender, (b) ethnicity, (c) resident status, (d) type of violation, (e) grade point average, and (f) college enrollment. Significant differences also were associated with class standing, gender, and active versus inactive Honors status. In both the Honors and NonHonors groups, males and Caucasians dominated. The NonHonors offenders tend to be nonresident students, violate alcohol and false information policies, obtain 2. 0 - 2. 99 GPAs, and most likely enrolled in the College of Business and Public Administration. In contrast, Honors offenders tend to be resident students, violate alcohol, theft and false information policies, obtain 3. 0 - 3. 99 GPAs, and enrolled in the College of Sciences. Active <b>Honors</b> <b>students</b> held the highest GPA followed by inactive <b>Honors</b> <b>students</b> and NonHonors students. Higher GPA was associated with alcohol policy violations, followed by theft and false information violations. These violations are the same top three violations perpetrated by <b>Honors</b> <b>students.</b> Resident status also was associated with GPA. Resident NonHonors students achieved higher GPAs than nonresident NonHonors students. In contrast, nonresident <b>Honors</b> <b>students</b> have higher GPAs than resident <b>Honors</b> <b>students.</b> Gender analyses reveal female offenders have higher GPAs than male offenders. In addition, among the female offenders more females were <b>Honors</b> <b>students</b> than NonHonors students. Finally, freshman GPA is significantly lower than sophomore and junior GPA...|$|R
