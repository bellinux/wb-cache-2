40|$|Handicapping {{experiments}} on species with biparental care {{show that a}} focal parent increases its contribution when <b>its</b> <b>partner</b> is handicapped. Such results are interpreted as evidence for negotiation, whereby each parent adjusts its amount of care to that of <b>its</b> <b>partner.</b> However, it is currently unclear whether the focal parent responds {{to a change in}} <b>its</b> handicapped <b>partner's</b> behaviour or state. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides where we first generated different-sized males and females by varying the duration of larval development. We then used a 2 × 2 factorial design in which a small or large male was paired with a small or large female. Small females provided less direct care (food provisioning and interactions with larvae) than large females, and both males and females provided less direct care when paired with a small partner. Thus, the focal parent adjusted its contribution towards care based on both its own state and that of <b>its</b> <b>partner.</b> There was also evidence for negotiation between the two parents as the focal parent adjusted its contribution based on the amount of care by <b>its</b> <b>partner.</b> However, {{there was no evidence that}} negotiation accounted for how the focal parent responded to <b>its</b> <b>partner's</b> size. Our results have important implications for our understanding of biparental cooperation as they show that each parent adjusts its contribution not only based on the amount of care provided by <b>its</b> <b>partner</b> but also based on its own state and <b>its</b> <b>partner's</b> state...|$|R

To develop the tower, now called The St. James, P Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, which represented an undisclosed client. With financial backing from <b>its</b> <b>partners</b> and tax breaks for new residential construction passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project. Philadelphia had not seen any residential high-rise development since the 1980s, and The St. James {{was one of the first}} to begin construction in the city, preceded only by the 16-story Residences at the Dockside, which broke ground in 2000.

5|$|The {{agreements}} with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines {{from the country}} of origin or from Spain to fly charter flights. But because of the SAS-cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain {{from any of the}} three Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, {{but on the other hand}} this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter flights from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish–Danish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased charter traffic. The company also started purchasing a larger share of Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used <b>its</b> <b>partners</b> to sell charter flights to Norway, and then continue their flights using scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental flights, as well as flights between the Scandinavian capitals. The rules also forced business travelers to use scheduled flights.|$|E
