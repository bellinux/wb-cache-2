2500|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} against more experienced hurdlers, Faugheen contested the Ascot Hurdle over 2m [...] f on 22 November 2014. As in most of his previous races, he took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by three and three-quarter lengths from the Nicky Henderson-trained Blue Fashion. Mullins later said: [...] "Dan Skelton, who stood in for me on the day, remarked to Ruby (Walsh) that he'd never saddled a horse as fat as that for a big race. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that with that amount of condition on him there must be huge improvement in him". After the race the William Hill made Faugheen 9/4 favourite for the 2015 Champion Hurdle.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Clapton {{made the}} switch to the Fender Stratocaster. [...] "I {{had a lot of}} {{influences}} when I took up the Strat. First there was Buddy Holly, and Buddy Guy. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn't really my kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility, and when he started playing one, I thought, oh, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, I can do it". The first—used during the recording of Eric Clapton—was [...] "Brownie", which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton's guitars, [...] "Blackie". In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos. He gave one each to George Harrison, Steve Winwood, and Pete Townshend.|$|E

Maidana won the WBA tite in December 2013 against Mayweather friend, Adrien Broner. Mayweather tweeted the news the day after his 37th birthday. The Barclays Center in Brooklyn also made a case to showcase the fight. Mayweather explained why he chose Maidana, [...] "Marcos Maidana's last performance immediately brought him to my attention. He is an extremely skilled fighter who brings knockout danger to the ring. I think this is a great fight for me and he deserves the opportunity to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> what 45 others have tried to do before him – beat me."

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{scenes of the}} novel Robots and Empire, R. Giskard Reventlov is the first robot to act {{according}} to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is telepathic, like the robot Herbie in the short story [...] "Liar!", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of [...] "harm" [...] than most robots can grasp. However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure metacognition. Though he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice {{will turn out to}} be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law.

2500|$|Mötley Crüe {{was formed}} on January 17, 1981 when bassist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist Greg Leon. Lee had worked {{previously}} with Leon {{in a band}} called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time with Leon eventually deciding not to continue. Sixx and Lee then began a search for new members and soon met guitarist Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that Mars placed inside The Recycler that read: [...] "Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available". Mars auditioned for Sixx and Lee and was subsequently hired. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. Upon seeing Neil perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in West Hollywood, Mars suggested they have him join the band by stating, [...] "I don't care if he can sing. I don't care <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything. The way he had that crowd going...THAT'S the guy we need." [...] At first Neil refused the offer, but as {{the other members of}} Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else.
