40|$|The reientless {{integration}} of computer technologv into {{all facets of}} society has also profoundly affected the marine industry. Onboard computers not only perform routine oflce work, but are also used {{for a variety of}} functions that extend human capabilities. For instance, global positioning system (GPS), together with <b>electronic</b> <b>charts</b> (ECDIS), <b>has</b> sign$cantly <b>improved</b> the accuracy and ease of navigation. The implementation of sophisticated weather models on fast super computers has allowed oceanographers fo achieve unprecedented accuracy in long range wind and wave forecasting. Advances in digital satellite communication make it possible for vessels to receive the forecast onboardfor planning voyuges and avoiding heavy weather damage. Real time seakeeping analyses, along with modest hull monitoring instrumentation, can supply useful information to the ship’s captain for making better-informed course and speed decisions. Even more sophisticated onboard computer-based applications such as voyage optimization algorithms and hull/propeIler/engine efJiciency monitoring have demonstrated signiJìcant benefits in reducing fuel and repair cost due to he-y weather. The output from such systems can be seamlessly integrated into today’s automated bridge. The data for real-time warning and post voyage analysis can be taken from the voyage data recorder (VDR), soon to become an MO carriage requirement. What all of these applications have in common is their use in providing operational guidance to the ship’s crew as well as shore-side management decision support, an...|$|R

The paradigm shift from paper <b>charts</b> to <b>electronic</b> <b>charts</b> <b>has</b> been a technological leap for mariners, and the Integrated Navigation Systems (INS) are {{getting more and more}} complex. This leads to new challenges for the navigators of today. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS are the primary position sensor input for ECDIS, and it has since its early beginning {{in the middle of the}} 1990 s been very reliable. National and worldwide statistics show that there has been a slight increase in navigational accidents since the introduction of ECDIS, but the reasons for this is not clear. In the literature review it is laid down that position sensors have its potential fault, and GNSS and its augmentation systems is described to better understand its advantageous and limitations. Control of ECDIS with position control methods are explored, and divided into two methods of control: Visual- and Conventional methods. Through field work, simulator tests and interviews the findings are clear. The navigators of today rely too much upon their primary position sensor which normally is a GNSS such as GPS. A questionnaire reveals that the navigators have insufficient deeper system knowledge of the navigation aids in use. This can lead to a potentially serious accident with loss of lives and large environmental damage. To achieve safe navigation it is important to continuously conduct control of primary position sensor input to ECDIS with a secondary position sensor by visual- and/or conventional control methods. The advantages and limitations with the different methods of control are discussed. Position sensors such as GNSS can fail, and navigators of today and tomorrow need to monitor the position sensor input to ECDIS with other means than GNSS...|$|R

As a real-time navigation system, <b>electronic</b> <b>charting</b> provides significant benefits in terms of improvements in navigation safety, efficiency of maritime transportation, and marine environmental protection. In terms of system components, features and functional capability, {{there are two basic}} types of <b>electronic</b> <b>charts.</b> The most advanced form is an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Chart</b> Display and Information System (ECDIS).

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} need for <b>Electronic</b> Navigational <b>Charts</b> (ENC) <b>has</b> led many Hydrographic Offices {{to a situation}} where there are two separate produc-tion lines- and two separate databases- for two products, ENC cells and print-ed charts. The existing modus operandi means that the same updates are done twice in two different databases. This paper starts with a description of the most challenging specific requirements of an application schema and produc-tion system supporting the production of ENC cells and printed charts from one common database. The paper outlines possibilities to expand the S- 57 object catalogue by adding cartographic features and attributes which would enable presentation of the data according to the presentation requirements of printed charts. The paper then introduces the Finnish Maritime Administration's new chart production system, nSector, which uses these cartographic objects and attributes and increases remarkably the level of quality control during the pro-duction process. Advances in navigation technology have set new demands on accuracy, reliability and the form of nautical charts. The positional accuracy of the chart should meet the increased accuracy of the positioning systems. To fully benefit from the dynamics of the modern positioning methods, high quality digital chart products should also be available. This allows real-time tracking of a ship's own position on the <b>electronic</b> <b>chart</b> display and also the development of more and more advanced integrated navigation systems...|$|R
