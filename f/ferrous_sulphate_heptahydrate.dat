Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is not expected to pose an environmental risk. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories. The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the currently authorised maximum iron content in complete feed be reduced for bovines and poultry from 750 to 450 mg Fe/kg, and for pets from 1250 to 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{hexavalent}} chromium and its content in Portland cement is very actual and often discussed topic. The {{goal of this}} study was to observe the influence of different ways of addition of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> on the reduction of {{hexavalent chromium}} at the hydration of Portland clinker. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> was added as crystalline powder and also in an aqueous solution. Obtained experimental results clearly showed higher reduction ability of a liquid form compared to the solid substance. The influence of the grain size on the reduction of hexavalent chromium was investigated immediately after mixing clinker with water and also during the first days of hydration process. New oxidation layer containing Fe 3 + species forms around the non- oxidation part of sulphate species. That is why larger grain size showed lower reduction ability of chromium. In this case the additional chromium reduction effect was observed during the first days of hydration. The results were acquired by UV/VIS method according to STN EN 196 - 10...|$|E

40|$|Iron (Fe) is an {{essential}} element {{but on the other}} hand it could induce changes in reproductive system. The general objective of this in vitro study was at first to examine dose- and time-dependent effects of iron (<b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> - FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) on the spermatozoa motility parameters, secondly expand the knowledge concerning direct action of this metal on the fertilization potential of the spermatozoa. The motility analysis was determined after exposure to concentrations of 3. 9; 7. 8; 15. 6; 31. 2; 62. 5; 125; 250; 500; 1000 µmol. dm- 3 of FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O using the Sperm VisionTM CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer) system during different time periods (Time 0 h, 2 h and 24 h). The highest percentage of motile spermatozoa was detected in the control group (95. 41 ± 1. 32 %) (Time 0 h). After 2 h of cultivation with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> the motility spermatozoa significantly (P< 0. 001) increased at the concentrations ≤ 125 μmol. dm- 3. The experimental administration at the doses ≥ 125 μmol. dm- 3 FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O inhibited the overall percentage of spermatozoa motility during Time 24 h. The identical spermatozoa motility was detected also for the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa during all time periods. Detailed evaluation of spermatozoa distance average (DAP) and velocity average (VAP) path as well as amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) revealed decrease in groups with concentrations ≥ 125 μmol. dm- 3 FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O in comparison with the control group during the long-term cultivation. Based on these results, we can conclude that the iron at the low concentrations maintains the spermatozoa motility parameters.

Optimum conversion temperature of HH to MH was found as 130 °C, for 20 min., by thermal analysis. Minimum amounts of various agents {{to be used as}} additives in cements to reduce Cr(VI) contents under the standard value were determined. Minimum reducing agent amounts of SL, MH and their mixture of 1 : 3 mole fractions were found as 0. 44 %, 0. 14 %, 0. 24 % by weight, respectively for Portland cement (CEM I 42. 5 R), 0. 40 %, 0. 26 %, 0. 24 % for Portland Pozzolanic cement (CEM II/A-P 42. 5 N) and 0. 16 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 04 % for Pozzolanic cement (CEM IV/B (P) 32. 5 N). Minimum amounts of other materials to reduce Cr(VI) content of three type cements under the required value, were found as 0. 24 %, 0. 16 %, 0. 0 9 % (N 2 H 4 ·H 2 O), 0. 10 %, 0. 07 %, 0. 04 % (Na 2 S 2 O 4), 0. 04 %, 0. 025 %, 0. 01 % (SnCl 2 · 2 H 2 O) and 0. 28 %, 0. 27 %, 0. 12 % (NaHSO 3), respectively. It was found that SL, the MH and their mixture of 1 : 3 mole fractions can be used successfully as additives for reducing Cr(VI) contents of cement. There are two advantages of this usage of MH. It converts Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and extends the shelf-life of cement. On the other hand, SL reduces Cr(VI) and increases durability of cements by lowered water/cement ratio...|$|E

The relative colour strength of the dye was determined in terms of K/S value with respect to autoclaved and non-autoclaved extract. Good light fastness, rub fastness and wash fastness was observed in fabrics mordanted with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The relative colour strength of the dye was found to be more in case of cotton clothes mordanted with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} {{on the effect of}} {{different}} combinations of metal mordants on color characteristics and fastness properties of natural dye extracted from Juglan regia L bark powder. The influence of different types of mordant combinations such as alum + <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate,</b> alum + stannous chloride, <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> + stannous chloride, and alum + <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> + stannous chloride on color parameters has been investigated in terms of CIELab (L*, a*, b*, c*, and h°) and K/S values. The fastness properties with respect to light, washing, and crocking of developed shades were determined according to ISO and AATCC test methods. Based on the experimental results, it has been found that 96 shades with novel and fashionable hues were produced by the use of these metal salt combinations. It was also found that all mordanted samples had satisfactory light and wash fastness ratings. Dry rub fastness was found relatively better than wet rub fastness...|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] amendments were tested for their effectiveness in aiding plant growth and immobilising contaminants in pots containing soil from an arsenopyrite mine contaminated with arsenic and heavy metals. Trace element solubility in pore water was monitored using Rhizon samplers for five weeks. Results showed that amendments containing <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> combined with paper mill limited arsenic mobilisation and increased metal solubility. However, <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> in combination with calcium carbonate was effective in reducing arsenic and metal solubilisation. Plant biomass of both the grass species used during the experiment, Arrhenatherum elatius and Festuca curvifolia, was a sensitive indicator of the comparative efficiency of the amendments, although metal(loid) s concentration in pore water did not correlate with plant uptakeThis {{study was supported by}} the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, project COMFITES CTM 2010 - 21922 -C 02 - 02; and by the Comunidad de Madrid, project EIADES S 2009 /AMB- 147...|$|R
40|$|Ferrous fumarate is {{currently}} recommended {{for use in}} the fortification of foods for infants and young children. This recommendation is based on the compound's good sensory properties and on results from isotope studies in adults that reported similar iron absorption values for ferrous fumarate and <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> (relative bioavailability [RBV] of ferrous fumarate, 100). However, later isotope studies conducted on both iron-replete and iron-deficient young children found that iron absorption from ferrous fumarate was only about 30 % of that achieved from <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> (RBV, 30). The reasons for the differences observed in adults compared with children are unclear but could be related to the following factors: lower iron status in children resulting in greater iron absorption via upregulation from <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> but not from ferrous fumarate; reduced gastric acid secretion in children leading to retarded dissolution of ferrous fumarate; or an influence of added ascorbic acid on RBV. Ferrous fumarate-fortified complementary foods have been demonstrated to improve iron status in iron-deficient infants and, more recently, to prevent iron deficiency equally as well as <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> in iron-replete infants. However, current evidence indicates that iron-deficient infants and young children may absorb iron from ferrous fumarate less well than iron from ferrous sulfate and that, for equivalent efficacy, complementary foods targeted at such infants and young children should contain more iron in the form of fumarat...|$|R
