5|$|An unknown {{librettist}} retained four {{of these}} seven combined stanzas, using {{the first and the}} two last unchanged as customary, and expanding the third by adding text for a recitative. He paraphrased the other stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpet, oboe, strings and continuo. The first movement is a chorale fantasia dominated by the trumpet. In the unusual third movement, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice alternate for the recitative, while they sing the lines from the third hymn stanza in a duet. The fourth movement is a dramatic bass aria, accompanied by a restless continuo. Due to the compiled hymns, the melody of the closing two stanzas is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used in movements 1 and 3.|$|E
30|$|It is {{worthwhile}} {{to mention that}} comparing with the results in [2], our blow-up results are new and quite different. There is twofold meaning: firstly, our blow-up criteria and the proof of them are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> in [2]. Then, our blow-up phenomena (see Theorem  4.1) are also <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> in [2], because the conditions of Theorem  4.1 in our paper are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> [2]. When ρ_ 0 (-x)= 0, system (1) is degenerated into μ-version Camassa–Holm equation essentially. So the blow-up phenomena in [2] belong to μ-version Camassa–Holm equation.|$|R

5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living {{during the}} time of the Liao dynasty predicted that the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, was to begin in the year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were also concerned with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, efforts were made to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in the years immediately preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|The final {{development}} in the modern design of the clarinet used {{in most of the}} world today was introduced by Hyacinthe Klosé in 1839. He devised a different arrangement of keys and finger holes, which allow simpler fingering. It was inspired by the Boehm system developed for flutes by Theobald Boehm. Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used on flutes. This new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the Oehler system clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert system clarinets.|$|E
5|$|Tekken series {{producer}} Katsuhiro Harada teased {{an announcement}} on his Twitter feed on September 17, 2010 ("TGS Sep 18(Sat) at Tougeki Booth. I'll announce something :D"). It {{was rumored to}} be something related to Tekken X Street Fighter or Tekken 7. The game was announced to be Tekken Tag Tournament 2, sequel to Tekken Tag Tournament, on September 18, 2010 at the Tougeki event as promised. Producer Katsuhiro Harada stated that the game engine would be <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used in Tekken 6. The release of the arcade version {{of the game in}} Japan was originally planned for summer 2011, but due to complications derived from the Great East Japan earthquake, the arcade release was postponed until Autumn 2011. At the World Cyber Games 2010, Harada stated that the console version would feature additional console-exclusive returning characters and bonus gameplay modes. He also suggested that the release of the console version of the game would take place between the releases of Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.|$|E
