The arcs of the <b>inner</b> <b>circles</b> and the tiny circle are connected by a line.

5|$|The Circle {{line and}} District line share {{tracks in the}} sub-surface station. It was opened as Paddington (Praed Street) by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) on 1 October 1868 when the company opened a branch from its main route between Hammersmith and Moorgate Street. The branch ran southwards to Brompton (Gloucester Road) and was planned {{as part of the}} <b>Inner</b> <b>Circle,</b> a {{circuitous}} route being constructed in conjunction with the District Railway (DR, now the District line) that was intended to link most of the capital's mainline stations. The extension was constructed mostly in shallow tunnels using the cut-and-cover technique. Services were provided by both the MR and the DR, with each company running <b>Inner</b> <b>Circle</b> trains over the other's tracks.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly {{known as}} the District Railway) was a {{passenger}} railway that served London from 1868 to 1933. Established in 1864 to complete the <b>inner</b> <b>circle,</b> an underground railway in London, {{the first part of}} the line opened using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. The Metropolitan Railway operated all services until the District introduced its own trains in 1871. The railway was soon extended westwards through Earl's Court to Fulham, Richmond, Ealing and Hounslow. After completing the <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> and reaching Whitechapel in 1884, it was extended to Upminster in Essex in 1902.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For an arbelos {{with the}} two <b>inner</b> <b>circles</b> {{touching}} at a point O, we give necessary and sufficient conditions that a circle passing through O is Archimedean. Consider an arbelos with two <b>inner</b> <b>circles</b> α and β with radii a and b respec-tively touching externally at a point O. A circle of radius rA = ab/(a+b) is called Archimedean. In [3], we have constructed three infinite sets of Archimedean cir-cles. One of these consists of circles passing through the point O. In this note we give some characterizations of Archimedean circles passing through O. We set up a rectangular coordinate system with origin O and the positive x-axis along a diameter OA of α (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{prompted}} by the persistent paucity {{of women in the}} higher echelons of companies. Extant literature on meritocracy and choice did not offer a complete explanation for this. The study therefore set out to explore and challenge the underlying assumptions that have perpetuated the solidification of gendered hierarchies in organisations. A qualitative research design approach was used. Information was gathered from 12 in-depth interviews with female managers who worked in the greater Johannesburg area. Through the tradition of phenomenological design, the essence of the women’s career progression was analysed through the perceptions and lived experiences of the participants. Structural barriers were identified in the organisations. The higher the visibility of the male dominated <b>inner</b> <b>circles</b> present, the more discernible the barriers were, the more the self-efficacy of the females diminished. The study makes a case for the invisibility of <b>inner</b> <b>circles</b> to be eliminated. When <b>inner</b> <b>circles</b> are more visible, prior assumptions can be challenged. The study also identified pioneering opportunities for women to entrench their own successful outcomes in organisations that can contribute to their sustainable career progression.
