5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} <b>four</b> <b>ways</b> at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are <b>four</b> <b>ways</b> and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Samoa Joe and Booker T ended after Hard Justice. On the August14 {{episode of}} TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette {{announced}} that Joe would defend the championship at TNA's next PPV event No Surrender on September14 in a <b>Four</b> <b>Ways</b> to Glory match. Cornette stated {{that over the}} weeks leading to the show three qualification matches would take place to determine the challengers to Joe. Booker T won the first qualifying match was on the August21 episode of Impact! by defeating Rhino. Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August28 episode of Impact! {{to qualify for the}} contest. The final qualifier was Christian Cage, who defeated A.J. Styles on the September4 episode of Impact!. Booker T could not attend the event due to Hurricane Ike, making the bout a Three Ways to Glory match instead. Joe retained the championship at the show.|$|E

5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are <b>four</b> <b>ways</b> to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{continued}} after Hard Justice leading into No Surrender. On the August14 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Angle in an Olympic Wrestling match for Angle's 1996 Summer Olympics {{gold medal in}} freestyle wrestling. Styles defeated Angle to win the medal on the telecast. Styles and Angle fought a week later on the August 21 episode of Impact! in a ladder match for the medal, with Styles retaining the medal. Styles {{then went on to}} feud with Angle's on-screen bestfriend Frank Trigg, who attacked Styles with a kendo stick during Styles' <b>Four</b> <b>Ways</b> to Glory qualification match with Cage, costing Styles to bout in the process. This led to Styles challenging Trigg to a bout at No Surrender, which Trigg agreed to but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules on the September11 episode of Impact!. Styles and Trigg fought to a no contest at No Surrender due to Styles accidentally hitting Trigg in the groin. Afterwards, Styles beat Trigg with a kendo stick to end their feud. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Styles was ordered to return Angle's gold medal by Jeff Jarrett, who had taken a role as a TNA management authority figure. The medal was returned to Angle on the October9 episode of Impact! by Jarrett.|$|E

25|$|The {{divisions}} became fully exposed {{with the}} 1860 presidential election. The electorate split <b>four</b> <b>ways.</b> The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it.

25|$|The {{northern}} {{frontier of}} this age was also explained in Kojiki as the legend of Shido Shogun's (四道将軍: Shoguns to <b>four</b> <b>ways)</b> expedition. Out of four shoguns, Ōbiko set northward to Koshi and his son Take Nunakawawake set to eastern states. The father moved east from northern Koshi while the son moved north on his way, and they finally met at Aizu (current western Fukushima). Although the legend itself {{is not likely to}} be a historical fact, Aizu is rather close to southern Tōhoku, where the north end of keyhole kofun culture as of the late 4th century is located.|$|E
25|$|The {{conspicuous}} {{wealth of}} Abbas's own sons, Yasser and Tarek, {{has been noted}} in Palestinian society since at least 2009, when Reuters first published {{a series of articles}} tying the sons to several business deals, including a few that had U.S. taxpayer support. In a Foreign Policy article, author Jonathan Schanzer suggested <b>four</b> <b>ways</b> in which the Abbas family has become rich. They include monopolies on American made cigarettes sold in the territories; USAid funding; public works projects, such as road and school construction, on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and special preferences for retail enterprises. It was strongly implied that the sons lineage was the main credential in receiving these contracts.|$|E
25|$|Historian Allan Nevins, for instance, {{writes of}} {{political}} rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women. Voter turnouts even ran {{as high as}} 84% by 1860. An abundance of new parties emerged 1854–56, including the Republicans, People's party men, Anti-Nebraskans, Fusionists, Know-Nothings, Know-Somethings (anti-slavery nativists), Maine Lawites, Temperance men, Rum Democrats, Silver Gray Whigs, Hindus, Hard Shell Democrats, Soft Shells, Half Shells and Adopted Citizens. By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided <b>four</b> <b>ways.</b> Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the Constitutional Union party in 1860.|$|E

25|$|The party {{selected}} its {{presidential candidates}} in a caucus {{of members of}} Congress. They included Thomas Jefferson (nominated 1796; elected 1800–1801, 1804), James Madison (1808, 1812) and James Monroe (1816, 1820). By 1824, the caucus system had practically collapsed. After 1800, the party dominated Congress and most state governments outside New England. By 1824, the party was also split <b>four</b> <b>ways</b> and lacked a center, as the First Party System collapsed. The emergence of the Second Party System in the 1830s realigned the old factions. One remnant followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren into the new Democratic Party by 1828. Another remnant led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay formed the National Republicans in 1828, which developed into the Whig Party by 1835.|$|E
25|$|Fred Astaire {{performed}} {{dance in}} <b>four</b> <b>ways.</b> He performed romantic ballroom duets, tap duets, solos, and solos with props. He also usually danced with a partner, for example Ginger Rogers. A {{very well known}} duet with Rogers that he did was “Cheek to Cheek” which is a beautiful dance that looks almost like they are gliding across the dance floor together. He didn’t just perform romantic duets with Rogers. He also did many tap duet numbers with her, like the dance “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet. Astaire’s tap solos, however, {{seemed to be the}} most popular. People were amazed at the things he could dance with while performing. From coat trees to drum sets, Astaire could do it all.|$|E
25|$|Chinese and Japanese Zen is {{grounded}} on the Chinese {{understanding of the}} Buddha-nature as one true's essence, and the Two truths doctrine as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality. Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or Buddha-nature, thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality. In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and shikan-taza, sitting meditation, is {{the expression of the}} already existing Buddhahood. Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a break-through insight in this Buddha-nature, but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life, as expressed in the Three mysterious Gates, the <b>Four</b> <b>Ways</b> of Knowing of Hakuin, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. The Japanese Zen-scholar D.T. Suzuki noted similarities between Zen-Buddhism and Christian mysticism, especially meister Eckhart.|$|E
