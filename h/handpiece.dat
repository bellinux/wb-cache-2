2500|$|In general, early {{treatment}} is quicker {{and less expensive}} than treatment of extensive decay. Local anesthetics, nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"), or other prescription medications may be required {{in some cases to}} relieve pain during or following treatment or to relieve anxiety during treatment. A dental <b>handpiece</b> ("drill") is used to remove large portions of decayed material from a tooth. [...] A spoon, a dental instrument used to carefully remove decay, is sometimes employed when the decay in dentin reaches near the pulp. Some dentists remove dental caries using a laser rather than the traditional dental drill. A Cochrane review of this technique looked at Er:YAG (erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet), Er,Cr:YSGG (erbium, chromium: yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet) and Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers and found that although people treated with lasers (compared to a conventional dental [...] "drill") experienced less pain and had a lesser need for dental anaesthesia, that overall there was little difference in caries removal. Once the caries is removed, the missing tooth structure requires a dental restoration of some sort to return the tooth to function and aesthetic condition.|$|E

2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a <b>handpiece,</b> which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E

50|$|The modern {{incarnation}} of the dental drill is the air turbine (or air rotor) <b>handpiece,</b> developed by John Patrick Walsh (later knighted) {{and members of the}} staff of the Dominion Physical Laboratory (DPL) Wellington, New Zealand.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDecontaminating {{dental chair}} unit (DCU) suction systems in a convenient, safe and {{effective}} manner is problematic. This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU suction system residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction <b>handpieces,</b> assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated Suction Tube Cleaning System (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction <b>handpieces.</b> ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU suction systems effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU suction systems reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction <b>handpieces</b> could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component <b>handpieces,</b> allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire suction system. ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU suction systems and single component <b>handpieces</b> radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU suction systems become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this. Furthermore, multicomponent suction <b>handpieces</b> cannot be adequately disinfected without disassembly, which is costly in time, staff and resources. The automated STCS DCU suction disinfection system used with single component <b>handpieces</b> provides an effective solution...|$|R

40|$|Dental <b>handpieces</b> {{in daily}} {{practice}} use {{come in contact}} with organic, inorganic and chemical contaminations that may contain potentially dangerous pathogens. Due to their complex structure, because of internal water- and air-channels, <b>handpieces</b> provide high demands on reprocessing. They have to be cleaned, disinfected and possibly sterilized according the KRINKO-recommendation "Hygiene requirements in the reprocessing of medical devices" before using on the next patient. Especially the cleaning is important, because without adequate cleaning the disinfection or sterilization has a reduced or no effect. It should be examined whether dental <b>handpieces</b> can be cleaned standardized and reproducible with a manual method, if the cleaning success with a peroxidase-test-kit is verifiable and whether the discharge volumes of cleaning liquids are reproducible. The investigation took place in test series with seven <b>handpieces,</b> each with a spray-water and spray-air channel. A total number of 120 spray-channels was investigated. After contamination with human blood the <b>handpieces</b> were cleaned with a special adapter (3 x 2 seconds) and dried (1 x 3 seconds) according to the manufacturer. After flushing by SDS they were inserted in SDS and extracted on the shaker. Then the channels were cleaned with dental SuperFloss and this was extracted in SDS. Of all extraction solutions protein determinations were made using the modified OPA-method. In addition, a peroxidase-test was used to verify the results. Also the discharge amount of the cleaning solution has been investigated. The modified OPA-method was suitable for the tests because of the possibility to detect even minimal protein amounts. At 100 % of the investigated channels residual protein could be determined. The values varied depending on the extraction method between 0. 51 mg BSA-equivalent and 2. 06 mg BSA-equivalent, with a concentration increase after each measurement. The peroxidase-test for the detection of blood or its components showed no reaction by 100 % of the tested channels. The values for the discharge amount of the cleaning solution show starting with measurement 106 a decreasing tendency. The question, what nature the protein-containing residues in the spray-water and spray-air channels are could not finally be clarified and has to be subject of following studies. The fact of the continuous negative peroxidase-test indicates that no blood or blood components were present in the rest proteins...|$|R
