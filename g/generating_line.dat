5000|$|A conic is {{the curve}} {{obtained}} as {{the intersection of}} a plane, called the cutting plane, with {{the surface of a}} double cone (a cone with two nappes). We shall assume that the cone is a right circular cone for the purpose of easy description, but this is not required; any double cone with some circular cross-section will suffice. Planes that pass through the vertex of the cone will intersect the cone in a point, a line or a pair of intersecting lines. These are called degenerate conics and some authors do not consider them to be conics at all. Unless otherwise stated, we shall assume that [...] "conic" [...] refers to a non-degenerate conic. There are three types of conics, the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. The circle is a special kind of ellipse, although historically it had been considered as a fourth type (as it was by Apollonius). The circle and the ellipse arise when the intersection of the cone and plane is a closed curve. The circle is obtained when the cutting plane is parallel to the plane of the generating circle of the cone - for a right cone, see diagram, this means that the cutting plane is perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cone. If the cutting plane is parallel to exactly one <b>generating</b> <b>line</b> of the cone, then the conic is unbounded and is called a parabola. In the remaining case, the figure is a hyperbola. In this case, the plane will intersect both halves of the cone, producing two separate unbounded curves.|$|E
40|$|A new formal {{approach}} for representation of polarization states of coherent and partially coherent electromagnetic plane waves is presented. Its basis is a purely geometric construction for the normalised complex-analytic coherent wave as a <b>generating</b> <b>line</b> {{in the sphere}} of wave directions, and whose Stokes vector is determined by the intersection with the conjugate <b>generating</b> <b>line.</b> The Poincare sphere is now located in physical space, simply a coordination of the wave sphere, its axis aligned with the wave vector. Algebraically, the generators representing coherent states are represented by spinors, and this is made consistent with the spinor-tensor representation of electromagnetic theory by means of an explicit reference spinor we call the phase flag. As a faithful unified geometric representation, the new model provides improved formal tools for resolving many of the geometric difficulties and ambiguities that arise in the traditional formalism...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for reconstructing {{the shape of}} a cylindrical object from contour and shading without knowing the surface albedo of the object or the lighting conditions of the scene. The input image is segmented into spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces by analyzing local shading. The cylindrical surface is characterized by the direction of the generating lines, determined from spatial derivatives in the image. The brightest <b>generating</b> <b>line</b> has strong constraints on the shading analysis on the cylindrical surface and leads to a simplification of the equation which represents the relation between the contour shape and the shading. Although there remains one degree of freedom between the surface normal of the base plane and the slant angle of the <b>generating</b> <b>line,</b> we can uniquely recover the cylindrical shape from this solution (up to reflection).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{simulate}} and determine a hydrodynamic pressure distribution in a lubrication gap of slide conical bearing gap, assuming that the lubricating oil has non-Newtonian properties. Investigations were carried out by using the commercial CFD software ANSYS Academic Research for fluid flow phenomenon (Fluent). Calculations were performed for bearings without misalignment, i. e. where the cone <b>generating</b> <b>line</b> of bearing shaft {{is parallel to the}} cone <b>generating</b> <b>line</b> of bearing sleeve. The Ostwald-de Waele model for non-Newtonian fluids was adopted in this simulation. The coefficients of Ostwald-de Waele relationship were determined by application of the least squares approximation method and fitting curves described by this model to the experimental data, obtained for motor oils. The calculated hydrodynamic pressure distributions were compared with the data obtained for corresponding bearings, but assuming that lubricating oil has Newtonian properties. In this research, the Gümbel boundary condition (also known as half-Sommerfeld condition) was imposed. Moreover, there was assumed: a steady-state operating conditions of a bearing, laminar, incompressible flow of lubricating oil, no slip on bearing surfaces, negligible heat conduction effect of bearing material, pressure on the side surfaces of bearing gap is equal to atmospheric pressure, no oil supply and oil outflow from bearing gap. This paper presents results for bearings with different rotational speeds and of different bearing gap heights. The results are presented in the form of contours of hydrodynamic pressure values. The tables contain values of maximum oil pressure generated in bearing gap and also bearing load carrying capacities calculated for investigated bearings...|$|E
