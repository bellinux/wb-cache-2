50|$|<b>Detomidine</b> is an {{imidazole}} derivative and α2-adrenergic agonist, {{used as a}} large animal sedative, primarily used in horses. It {{is usually}} available as the salt <b>detomidine</b> hydrochloride. It is a prescription medication available to veterinarians sold under the trade name Dormosedan.|$|E
50|$|Currently, <b>detomidine</b> is only {{licensed}} {{for use in}} horses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Detomidine</b> is a {{sedative}} with analgesic properties. α2-adrenergic agonists produce dose-dependent sedative and analgesic effects, mediatated by {{activation of}} α2 catecholamine receptors, thus inducing a negative feedback response, reducing production of excitatory neurotransmitters. Due to inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, <b>detomidine</b> also has cardiac and respiratory effects and an antidiuretic action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Detomidine</b> {{is a poor}} {{premedication}} {{when using}} ketamine as an anesthetic in horses.|$|E
50|$|As <b>detomidine</b> is an {{arrhythmogenic}} agent, {{extreme care}} should be exercised in horses with cardiac disease, and in the concurrent administration of other arrhythmogenics. The concurrent use of potentiated sulfonamide antibiotics is considered particularly dangerous.|$|E
50|$|Pentafusion, or the {{administration}} of ketamine, lidocaine, morphine, <b>detomidine,</b> and acepromazine at a constant rate of infusion, may be of particular benefit to horses suffering from laminitis. Epidurals may also be used in hind-limb laminitis.|$|E

50|$|When given intravenously, <b>detomidine</b> {{usually takes}} effect in 2-5 minutes, and {{recovery}} is full within 30-60 minutes. However, this is highly {{dependent upon the}} dosage, environment, and the individual animal; some horses are highly resistant to sedation.|$|E
50|$|Anesthetic {{recoveries}} in {{horses that}} have received ketamine following a <b>detomidine</b> premedication are often violent with the horse having multiple failures to stand resulting in trauma to itself. Xylazine is a superior premedication with ketamine resulting in safer recoveries.|$|E
50|$|In {{veterinary}} anesthesia, butorphanol (trade name: Torbugesic) {{is widely}} used as a sedative and analgesic in dogs, cats and horses. For sedation, it may be combined with tranquilizers such as alpha-2 agonists (medetomidine), benzodiazepines, or acepromazine in dogs, cats and exotic animals. It is frequently combined with xylazine or <b>detomidine</b> in horses.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, a horse {{injected}} with these mixtures may display apparent seizure activity before death. This {{may be due}} to premature cardiac arrest. However, if normal precautions (e.g., sedation with <b>detomidine)</b> are taken, this is rarely a problem. Anecdotal reports that long-term use of phenylbutazone increases the risk of this reaction are unverified.|$|E
50|$|Butorphanol is a {{commonly}} used narcotic for pain relief in horses. It is administered either IM or IV, with its analgesic properties {{beginning to take}} effect about 15 minutes after injection and lasting 4 hours. It is also commonly paired with sedatives, such as xylazine and <b>detomidine,</b> to make the horse easier to handle during veterinary procedures.|$|E
5000|$|The drug is {{normally}} {{administered by the}} intravenous route, and is fastest and most efficient when given intravenously [...] However, in recalcitrant animals, <b>detomidine</b> may be administered by the intramuscular or sublingual routes.

Horses with persistent hyperglycemia may have type II diabetes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of disease, horses with shivers are {{commonly}} used as riding and driving animals. However, the disease is often slowly progressive. Muscle spasms usually increase in frequency and severity, and the animal becomes weak, develops muscle wasting, and may become very uncomfortable. The horse may become unable to hold its feet up for trimming by a farrier, although use of alpha-2 agonist drugs, such as xylazine or <b>detomidine,</b> has proven helpful in reducing signs during farriery visits. Eventually, euthanasia is often elected due to poor quality of life for the animal.|$|E
50|$|A {{profound}} lethargy and characteristic {{lowering of}} the head with reduced sensitivity to environmental stimuli (sound, pain, etc.) are seen with <b>detomidine.</b> A short period of reduced coordination is characteristically followed by immobility and a firm stance with front legs spread. Following administration there is an initial increase in blood pressure, followed by bradycardia and second degree atrioventricular block (this is not pathologic in horses). The horse commonly sweats to excess, especially on the flanks and neck. Other side effects reported include pilo erection (hair standing erect), ataxia, salivation, slight muscle tremors, and (rarely) penile prolapse.|$|E

40|$|Artículo científico publicadoBased on the {{evidence}} of experimental studies, {{the aim of this}} study was to systematically review the safety of the <b>detomidine</b> in horses, the yohimbine effect over pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and behavioral parameters in horses sedated with <b>detomidine.</b> A search was made on Pubmed and SCOPUS for studies evaluating the effects of <b>detomidine</b> or yohimbine in horses on clinics pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics parameters.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>detomidine</b> {{with or without}} atropine sulfate premedication in producing sedation and analgesia for arthrocentesis was studied in 12 horses. The effects were evaluated by monitoring heart and respiratory rates, borborygmi, distance from the lower lip to the floor, systolic blood pressure, and response to needle insertion. Either atropine or saline (as a placebo) was administered immediately prior to <b>detomidine.</b> All drugs were administered intravenously. Measurements were taken prior to drug injection and at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes postinjection. <b>Detomidine</b> with atropine resulted in significantly higher heart rates than <b>detomidine</b> without atropine for the three hours of observation. Borborygmi were significantly decreased for four hours following <b>detomidine</b> with atropine and for three hours following <b>detomidine</b> without atropine, when compared to preinjection levels. Systolic blood pressure was significantly increased for 15 minutes following <b>detomidine</b> and atropine compared to the preinjection level. The head was markedly lowered for 60 minutes with either treatment. Atropine prevented the bradyarrhythmia and bradycardia induced by <b>detomidine,</b> but it induced a tachycardia. A satisfactory response for needle insertion and adequate synovial fluid aspiration was achieved in 95 % of the trials with <b>detomidine,</b> with or without atropine sulfate premedication.

40|$|There are {{approximately}} forty two million donkeys in the world. All developing countries have an expanding population of donkeys, {{which are used}} {{for the provision of}} various services. The most commonly performed procedures in donkeys are castrations, tumour removals, foot care and dental treatments. All of these procedures can be performed in standing donkeys provided sufficient analgesia and sedation are provided. The donkey should be recognised and treated in its own light. Very few analgesics relieve pain without producing side effects. The ideal analgesic would provide good analgesia and sedation without any side effects. Combined with sedation, analgesia aids in the handling of animals and reduces the danger to attendants. Neuroleptanalgesia provides a more potent sedative and analgesic allowing more procedures to be performed. A marked synergistic effect between opioids and alpha 2 adrenergic agonists is reported. Detomidine-butorphanol is used extensively for equine sedation and analgesia in the United States of America and Europe. Currently there is limited information available on effective sedative and analgesic drugs or drug combinations in donkeys. <b>Detomidine</b> and xylazine, which belong to the alpha 2 adrenergic agonist group, have been described for use in donkeys. No information exists on the use of opioid drugs or opioid-sedative combinations in donkeys. <b>Detomidine</b> produces sedation and analgesia of a greater magnitude and a longer duration than xylazine. <b>Detomidine</b> has been used to sedate horses for diagnostic, therapeutic or minor surgical procedures and as part of a premedication or an intravenous anaesthetic protocol. <b>Detomidine</b> is a good analgesic. The duration of sedation and analgesia is dose dependent. The sedation produced by <b>detomidine</b> alone is not always satisfactory and some horses will respond to noxious stimuli with well-directed kicks. For this reason, <b>detomidine</b> and butorphanol are very often combined. Butorphanol is a synthetic mixed agonist-antagonist opioid. The <b>detomidine</b> is given five minutes before the administration of butorphanol or the butorphanol can follow the <b>detomidine.</b> Sedation is easily extended by additional doses of <b>detomidine</b> and/or butorphanol. This combination produces profound sedation in which horses are apparently unaffected by sounds, tactile stimuli and surrounding activity. It has been suggested that donkeys require a higher dose of <b>detomidine</b> for sedation than horses. The recommended dose for donkeys is 20 - 40 µg/kg. The degree and length of analgesia and sedation is dose dependent. A dose of 5 - 10 µg /kg was found effective for sedation and a dose of 20 µg /kg was effective for sedation and analgesia. No recommended doses for butorphanol in donkeys exist. Twelve healthy male donkeys were randomly divided into two groups. One group received 10 µg/kg of <b>detomidine</b> while the other group received 10 µg /kg of <b>detomidine</b> and 25 µg /kg of butorphanol. Sedation was evaluated by a scoring system and characterised by lowering of the head, relaxation of the upper eyelids, drooping of the lower lip and dropping of the ears. Analgesia was evaluated by means of a pinprick method. The average dose for <b>detomidine</b> was 11. 24 µg/kg and that of butorphanol was 28. 0 µg/kg. The onset time to sedation was 4 minutes 21 seconds with <b>detomidine</b> alone and 3 minutes 28 seconds with the combination. The average length of sedation for the <b>detomidine</b> group was 20 minutes, and for the detomidine-butorphanol group was 1 hour and 7 minutes. The analgesia lasted twice as long in combination group compared to the <b>detomidine</b> group. <b>Detomidine</b> did not eliminate coronary band pain. Heart rates dropped significantly in the first minute after the injection in both groups, and this was statistically significant. There was however no statistical difference between the two groups. An atrioventricular and a sinoatrial block were recorded during this trial. The respiratory rates tended to decrease in the first few minutes after which the rate stabilised. Four donkeys receiving butorphanol had Cheyne-Stokes respiratory patterns. It was evident that the combination of <b>detomidine</b> and butorphanol produced a greater sedative and analgesic effect than <b>detomidine</b> alone. The superior sedation is the result of synergistic effects between <b>detomidine</b> and butorphanol. This trial has shown that <b>detomidine</b> in combination with butorphanol in donkeys produces sedation that is superior to <b>detomidine</b> on its own and last at least twice as long. Analgesia was dramatically improved with the combination as compared to <b>detomidine</b> alone. Dissertation (MMed Vet (Anaesthesiology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
