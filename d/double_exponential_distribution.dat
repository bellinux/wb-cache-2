This yields the multinomial logit model (MNL). Daniel McFadden argued that the Weibull had desirable properties compared to other distributions that might be used.

The logit model is simply a log ratio of the probability of choosing a mode to the probability of not choosing a mode.|$|E

40|$|The {{predominant}} Cl− {{channel in}} bovine tracheal epithelial cells has a conductance of ∼ 71 pS and {{accounts for more}} than 80 % of the total chloride conductance. We examined the effects of protein-modifying reagents on channel function and found that amino groups are critically involved in gating. Patch clamp studies showed that lysine-specific reagents, such as dimethyl adipimidate (DMA), significantly increased the channel open probability, but not its conductance. This suggests that modified residues are involved in the gating mechanism, but are distant from the channel permeation pathway. Kinetic analysis of channel activity showed that histograms of open and closed durations could be well fitted by <b>double</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions,</b> suggesting that the channel has at least two open and two closed states. DMA did not change the number of open or closed states, but increased channel mean open time. Since membrane impermeant reagents were effective only from the extracellular side, we conclude that lysine residues in the extracellular domain of the channel are critically involved in gating. These residues may present an important target for site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological activation of Cl− channels in epithelial cells...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fitting a known distribution to the innovation distribution {{in a class of}} stationary and ergodic time series models. The asymptotic null distribution of the usual Kolmogorov [...] Smirnov test based on the residuals generally depends on the underlying model parameters and the error distribution. To overcome the dependence on the underlying model parameters, we propose that tests be based on a vector of certain weighted residual empirical processes. Under the null hypothesis and under minimal moment conditions, this vector of processes is shown to converge weakly to a vector of independent copies of a Gaussian process whose covariance function depends only on the fitted distribution and not on the model. Under certain local alternatives, the proposed test is shown to have nontrivial asymptotic power. The Monte Carlo critical values of this test are tabulated when fitting standard normal and <b>double</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions.</b> The results obtained are shown to be applicable to GARCH and ARMA [...] GARCH models, the often used models in econometrics and finance. A simulation study shows that the test has satisfactory size and power for finite samples at these models.

40|$|ABSTRACT Currents through single {{potassium}} channels {{were studied}} in cellattached or inside-out patches from collagenase-dispersed smooth muscle {{cells of the}} guinea pig taenia coli. Under conditions mimicking the physiological state with [K+]i = 135 raM: [K+]o = 5. 4 mM, three distinct types of K + channel were identified with conductances around 0 mV of 147, 94, and 63 pS. The activities of the 94 - and 63 -pS channel were observed infrequently. The 147 -pS channel was most abundant. It has a reversal potential of ~- 75 mV. It is sensitive to [Ca 2 +] i and to membrane potential. At- 30 mV, {{the probability of a}} channel being open is at a minimum. At more positive voltages, the probability follows Boltzman distribution. A 10 -fold change in [Ca~+]i causes a 25 -mV negative shift of the voltage where half of the channels are open; an 11. 3 -mV change in membrane potential produces an e-fold increase in the probability of the channel being open when P is low. At voltages between- 30 and- 50 mV, the open probability increases in an anomalous manner because of a large decrease of the channel closed time without much change in the channel open time. This anomalous activity may play a regulatory role in maintaining the resting potential. The histograms of channel open and closed time fit well, respectively, with single and <b>double</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions.</b> Upon step depolarizations by 100 -ms pulses, the 147 -pS channel opens with a brief delay.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{review the}} {{properties}} of a univariate probability distribution that is a pos-sible candidate for the description of financial market price changes. This distribution is an “error ” distribution that represents a generalized form of the Normal, possesses a natural multivariate form, has a parametric kurtosis that is unbounded above and possesses special cases that are identical to the Normal and the <b>double</b> <b>exponential</b> (Laplace) <b>distributions.</b> 1. THE UNIVARIATE GENERALIZED ERROR DISTRIBUTION 1. 1. Definition. The Generalized Error Distribution 1 is a symmetrical unimodal member of the exponential family. The domain of the p. d. f. is x ∈ [−∞,∞] and the distribution is defined by three parameters: µ ∈ (−∞,∞), which locates the mode of the distribution; σ ∈ (0,∞), which defines the dispersion of the distribution; and, κ ∈ (0,∞), which controls the skewness. We will use the notation x ∼ G(µ, σ 2, κ) to define x as a variate drawn from this distribution. (A suitable reference for this distribution is [1].) The probability distribution function, F (x), is given by (1) dF (x|µ, σ, κ) = e ¡ 12 | x−µσ | 1 κ 2 κ+ 1 σΓ(κ+ 1) dx. This function is represented in Figure 1, on the following page. It is clear from this definition that the mode of the p. d. f. is µ {{and that it is}} unimodal and symmetrical about the mode. Therefore the median and the mean are also equal to µ. If we choose κ = 12 then Equation 1 is recognized as the p. d. f. for the univariate Normal Distribution, i. e. G(µ, σ 2, 12) = N(µ, σ 2). If we choose κ = 1 then Equa-tion 1 is recognized as the p. d. f. for the <b>Double</b> <b>Exponential,</b> or Laplace, <b>distribution,</b> i. e. G(µ, σ 2, 1) = L(µ, 4 σ 2). In the limit κ → 0 the p. d. f. tends to the uniform distribution U(µ − σ, µ+ σ). 1. 2. The Central Moments. The central moments are defined by Equation 2. (2) µr = E(x − µ) r = 12 κ+ 1 σΓ(κ+ 1) ∫ 1 x=¡ 1 (x − µ) re ¡ 12 | x−µσ | 1 k dx. The odd moments clearly all vanish by symmetry.
