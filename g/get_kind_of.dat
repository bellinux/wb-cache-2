500|$|The Allman Brothers Band placed more {{emphasis}} on their live performances rather than albums. [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> frustrated doing the [...] records," [...] said Duane Allman in 1970. Consequently, this listing includes all studio albums and major live releases (several other live releases have been issued retrospectively).|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of [...] "Box Cutter" [...] {{involves}} Walter's gradual change from an unwitting participant in a drug-dealing enterprise {{into a man}} more comfortable with {{a life of crime}} who embraces his darker side and becomes more proactively violent and dangerous. This development began during the latter episodes of the third season and would continue to be a major theme throughout the fourth season. The episode also introduced the ongoing theme of Jesse's moral decline and self guilt over his killing of Gale. Aaron Paul said of this, [...] "Jesse's much more raw this season. He's very distant, and he's turned to just utter chaos and destruction to keep his mind busy. When he's left alone in his own thoughts, that's when things can <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dangerous and scary for Jesse." ...|$|E

[...] "Until I saw it, you just don't <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> how heartbreaking it can be." [...] During the interview, he talked about how he tries to be emotionally supportive and around as much as he can for Miller's mother. Both he and Miller spoke to Larry King for ALarry King Special, Unthinkable: The Alzheimer's Epidemic, which aired in April 2011. Rogen testified about the disease and his charity before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services on February 26, 2014.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg and the show's staff {{stopped making}} episodes {{to work on}} the film after the show's third season. The film's plot {{originally}} had SpongeBob rescue Patrick from a fisherman in Florida; an obvious reference to the 2003 film, Finding Nemo, this was later said by Tom Kenny (the voice of SpongeBob) to be a [...] "joke" [...] plot to keep fans busy. Hillenburg wrote the film with five other writer-animators from the show (Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne and Tim Hill) over a three-month period in a room of a former Glendale, California bank. Osborne said, [...] "It was hugely fun although it did <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> gamy in there." [...] At the beginning of the series, Hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts (from Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton) and work by two modern comic actors: Jerry Lewis and Pee-wee Herman, both obvious inspirations for SpongeBob. For the film, the writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. Bill Fagerbakke (the voice of Patrick) said about the plot, [...] "It's just nuts. I'm continually dazzled and delighted with what these guys came up with." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{had first}} played Fillmore East in December 1969, opening for Blood, Sweat & Tears for three nights. Promoter Bill Graham enjoyed {{the band and}} promised to have them back soon. In January 1970, the band opened for Buddy Guy and B.B. King at San Francisco's Fillmore West, and one month later at Fillmore East {{supporting}} the Grateful Dead. According to biographer Alan Paul, [...] "these shows were crucial in establishing the band and exposing them to a wider, sympathetic audience on both coasts." [...] Drummer Butch Trucks considered their performances at the Fillmore East to be the launching pad for their success. In 1970, Duane Allman told disc jockey Ed Shane, [...] "You know, we <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> frustrated doing the [...] records, and I think, consequently, our next album will be... a live recording, {{to get some of}} that natural fire on it." [...] "We were not intentionally trying to buck the system, but keeping each song down to 3:14 just didn't work for us," [...] remembered Gregg Allman. [...] "And we realized that the audience {{was a big part of}} what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the studio recordings, Uncle Meat featured live recordings made at the Royal Albert Hall, including a recording of Don Preston playing [...] "Louie Louie" [...] on the Albert Hall pipe organ, {{at the end of}} which Zappa announces it as having been performed by the [...] "London Philharmonic Orchestra". The doo wop-influenced [...] "Electric Aunt Jemima" [...] refers to Zappa's guitar amplifier, equating it with the advertising character Aunt Jemima. Zappa explained, [...] "I <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a laugh out of the fact that other people are going to try to interpret that stuff and come up with some grotesque interpretations of it.

Regarding the album's {{direction}}, Cheng commented, [...] "We've proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, {{and we want to}} <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> heavy on this one". Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band's 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Date to assist with production and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album's tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, Washington and at Larrabee Sound Studios. Overall, the album took 12 months and cost roughly $2.5 million to complete. The band was fined by Maverick for missing deadlines.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

2500|$|The demos {{finalised}} in Malibu {{caught the}} attention of Thom Panunzio, who aside from his production work (Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Ozzy Osbourne), served as an executive for Geffen Records. The band were flattered by Panunzio's interest, immediately agreeing to the collaboration. The quintet had decided against working with Neal Avron, who had produced the band's three previous albums, as they wanted to try something different. The band's frontman, Jordan Pundik explained that, [...] "We love Neal. Neal's amazing and he's one of our really close friends. But after three records with him, after writing those records {{and a lot of other}} bands started to come out and <b>get</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> popular, we kind of wanted to try something different." [...] After hearing a demo of [...] "On My Mind", Panunzio was keen to work on the project. Pundik recalled that, [...] "one of the songs that really got him to say. 'OK, I want to do this' was that song 'On My Mind.' That song really got him. Thom's done everything from like the Go-Go's to Bob Dylan, so he's very well rounded in music." ...|$|E
