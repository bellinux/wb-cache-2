[...] He left home in 1843 to learn {{business}} in Boston, then spent several years in the <b>draying</b> business and managing a hotel in Bartonsville, Vermont. [...] In 1848, he married Harriet Barton, the daughter of his employer. [...] The next year the couple moved to Boston, and in 1850 to Detroit. [...] His original business plans were dashed when his business partner died unexpectedly, and Wright then relocated to the Saginaw Valley {{and got into the}} lumber business. [...] He was actively engaged in lumbering in the 1850s, then purchased a mill in 1859, and in 1871 formed the First National Bank in Saginaw and the Saginaw Barrel Company. [...] He diversified into other business interestes, including banks, manufacturing, railroads, and timber, mining, and ranching properties.|$|E

There was no one inside, they told me, and they invited me to come along with them. They were leaving the city, they said, on Dakon's horses, and there was a spare one for me. Dakon had four magnificent carriage horses that he wanted to save, and General Folsom had given him the tip that next morning all the horses that remained in the city were to be confiscated for food. There were not many horses left, {{for tens of thousands of}} them had been turned loose into the country when the hay and grain gave out during the first days. Birdall, I remember, who had great <b>draying</b> interests, had turned loose three hundred dray horses. At an average value of five hundred dollars, this had amounted to $150,000. He had hoped, at first, to recover most of the horses after the strike was over, but in the end he never recovered one of them. They were all eaten by the people that fled from San Francisco. For that matter, the killing of the army mules and horses for food had already begun.|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} Texas <b>dray</b> {{operations of}} interest to TxDOT planners. Chapter 1 provides background to the study and summarizes an earlier study report. Chapter 2 reports on a large drayage driver survey conducted at the Union Pacific Englewood intermodal terminal in Houston. Chapter 3 moves the study to the southern border and estimates annual <b>dray</b> vehicle miles of travel (VMT) for those <b>dray</b> vehicles that crossed the border in a northbound direction at the McAllen/Pharr, Laredo, and El Paso gateways in 2007. Chapter 4 stays in Laredo but moves to the Union Pacific intermodal terminal where a driver survey was conducted on August 11 and 12, 2008, to gain insight into the origins and destinations of containers coming {{into and out of}} the terminal. Chapter 5 measures <b>dray</b> impacts created by the movement of containers from Port of Houston Authority (POHA) terminals on the Houston highway network. The level of service (LOS) on the network serving the port is determined, using different volumes of <b>dray</b> vehicles. It also reports output from the EPA DrayFLEET emissions and activity model developed by the Tioga Group. Chapter 6 identifies potential strategies to mitigate adverse impacts associated with <b>dray</b> operations. The strategies cover terminal operations, <b>dray</b> fleet technologies, reducing interactions with other highway users, and identifying opportunities to divert <b>dray</b> traffic to other modes.

Daily air humidity on hot days is usually greater in plantations of FGT than in grassland. In the growing season, soil temperatures are lower in plantations of FGT than in the stands under grass cover. Reduction of daily air temperatures and soil temperatures under canopy of FGT is mainly due to the cooling effect of transpiration.
