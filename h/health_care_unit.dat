40|$|Abstract Background Adherence to {{prescribing}} guidelines varies between primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> The aim of {{the present}} study was to investigate correlations between characteristics of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> and adherence to prescribing objectives for rational drug use with focus on drug information from the pharmaceutical industry. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in all 25 primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> in Göteborg, Sweden. A questionnaire on characteristics of practice settings [(i) size of unit, (ii) profession of head, (iii) use of temporary physicians, (iv) drug information from the pharmaceutical industry, (v) producer-independent drug information, and (vi) education on prescribing for newly employed physicians] was sent to the heads of the units. A national sales register for prescribed drugs (Xplain) was used for evaluation of adherence to the six regional prescribing objectives concerning proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), statins and antidepressants. Results Twenty-two out of 25 primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> responded to the questionnaire (response rate 88 %). A physician as head and presence of producer-independent drug information was positively correlated with adherence to the prescribing objectives (median number of prescribing objectives adhered to (25 th - 75 th percentile) : 2. 5 (1 - 3. 25) vs 1 (0 - 2), P = 0. 013; 2 (1 - 3) vs 0, P = 0. 043, respectively. Presence of drug information from the pharmaceutical industry and education on prescribing for newly employed physicians was negatively associated with adherence to the prescribing objectives: 1 (0 - 2) vs 3. 5 (2. 25 - 4. 75), P = 0. 005; 1 (0 - 2) vs 3 (1. 5 - 4), P = 0. 034, respectively. Conclusion Several characteristics of the primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> correlated with adherence to prescribing objectives for rational drug use.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} risk and protection factors for the development of 1 -year-olds assisted at family <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> It is a cross-sectional study involving 65 children of approximately 1 year of age and their mothers attended at two family <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> The development was assessed using a developmental screening test (Denver II). The mothers filled out the SRQ- 20 questionnaire to identify common mental disorder (CMD) indicators. After data collection, descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed. Global development was at risk in 43. 1 % of the children evaluated, and the most affected areas were language and fine motor development; 44. 6 % of mothers had results indicative of CMD when the child was 1 year of age. In bivariate analysis, reported depression, smoking, infections in pregnancy, CMD after birth and working outside the home were significantly associated with the children's development. After full statistical analysis, CMD was revealed as being a risk factor, and working away from home as being a protection factor. In order to increase the chances of success of programs targeted for children at <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> and avoiding the risk of impaired development, it is important to focus on two aspects: children's stimulation and maternal mental health...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} daily smoking among users of three primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> affiliated with a university hospital in the municipality of Pelotas, southern Brazil, and to identify factors associated with daily tobacco consumption. Methods: This cross-sectional study included all individuals over 14 years of age who sought treatment at the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> between June 29, 2009, and February 23, 2010, and lived in the area covered by the unit. Interviews were conducted during home visits {{to collect data on}} sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviors; the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to assess the presence of mood disorders; and a question from the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) on the daily use of tobacco in the past 3 months was used to assess smoking. Results: The total sample comprised 1, 848 individuals, mostly female (72. 9 %), aged between 46 and 60 years (28. 5 %), and belonging to socioeconomic class C (61 %). The prevalence of daily smoking was 23. 4 % (n = 432), and there was a statistically significant difference between men and women: 27 vs. 22. 1 % (p < 0. 050).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} Helicobacter pylori and anemia, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 18 - 45 year old users of the 31 primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> in Pelotas, Southern Brazil. Interviews using a structured questionnaire were carried out in waiting rooms during two work shifts. Anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL among pregnant women, < 12 g/dL among women and < 13 g/dL among men) was diagnosed from capillary blood (HemoCue) and H. pylori {{by means of a}} 13 C-UBT. Information on socio-demographic, behavioral and biological characteristics was collected. Logistic and linear regression analyses were carried out, taking into account aggregated primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> A total of 1, 117 respondents fulfilled the inclusion criteria (losses/refusals: 8. 1 %). Prevalence of anemia was 20. 6 % (18. 2 - 23. 2 %) and of H. pylori, 70. 7 % (68. 0 - 73. 6 %). After allowing for age, sex and skin color the odds ratio for anemia among those who were diagnosed H. pylori positive was 0. 94 (0. 70 - 1. 27). After allowing for sex, skin color, family monthly income, age, and smoking, the reduction in hemoglobin among H. pylori positive respondents was 0. 07 g/dL (- 0. 24 - 0. 11; p = 0. 4).

40|$|The Tanzanian health {{commodity}} {{supply chain}} has gradually improved since the decentralisation {{of the health}} information system began in 1999. As {{a part of the}} decentralisation process, the supply chain management has improved in terms of making information timelier available to decision-makers at lower-level <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> Still, access and use of information are limited at some levels of the health hierarchy. This thesis examines the role of financial information in health commodity procurement processes at the lower-level <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> in the public health system in Tanzania. It does so, by discussing different models of distributing health commodities to study the role of financial information in different supply chain contexts. Further, the thesis considers what the informational needs, within each distribution model, requires of the information system for logistic management to be accessed and used. This is done to define how logistic management information systems can promote the role of financial information in supply chain decision-making. The research is based on a case study in Tanzania, where the supply chain is investigated. The case study involves interviews and observations of 45 participants from the public health system. The focus is to investigate the role of financial information at the lower <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> to understand how to strengthen the role of financial information for supply chain decision-making at this level. The results of the research show that the role of financial information is limited at the lower <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> in Tanzania. The information is by some means accessible, but not in a timely manner, and neither supported by the logistic management information system. The result is ineffective supplies of health commodities to the lower <b>health</b> <b>care</b> levels, where measures must be made to provide good quality <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services. As a contribution to strengthening the supply chain management in developing countries, this thesis provides research {{that can be used to}} define informational needs in different supply chain contexts. These informational needs can be used as a guide for how to improve information systems for logistic management, to promote the role of these informational needs in the supply chain management...|$|R
