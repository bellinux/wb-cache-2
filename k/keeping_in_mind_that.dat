Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, <b>keeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E

Schwartz had completed only two songs for Mulan before his resignation, one of which was entitled [...] "China Doll" [...] which, according to Schwartz, [...] "more or less corresponds to the scene in the film in which Mulan goes to the Matchmaker". Schwartz was eventually replaced with composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who wrote [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] with which to replace Schwartz's [...] "China Doll". Disney cast American singer and actress Marni Nixon, one of Hollywood's most prolific playback singers, as the singing voice of Grandmother Fa, Mulan's paternal grandmother. Nixon received the sheet music for [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] to review prior to auditioning for the role. The filmmakers then showed Nixon a drawing of the character, by whose comedic appearance the singer was immediately [...] "enchanted", telling herself [...] "you've just got to give her a voice... or, in this case, an unvoice." [...] Improvising her performance, Nixon decided to make the character sound as though she was merely attempting to sing as opposed to actually singing, <b>keeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the elderly character is toothless. Nixon also made no effort to sound like the actress who had been cast as Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time, determining that the two performers sound nothing alike upon listening to the actress' recording. Nixon had almost reconsidered auditioning for the role upon realizing how different she sounded from Grandmother Fa's speaking voice actress.|$|E
