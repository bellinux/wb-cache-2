40|$|Abstract— 160 Gb/s all-optical signal {{processing}} is demonstrated exploiting pump depletion {{in addition to}} sum and difference fre-quency generation (SFG/DFG) in a single periodically poled lithium-niobate (PPLN) waveguide. 160 Gb/s time-domain ex-traction and insertion operations of channels are obtained in an optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) system. Moreover, 160 Gb/s digital operations including half-adder, <b>half-subtracter</b> and AND/OR/XOR functions are carried out. The use of pump depletion effect allows to process ultrafast signals due to its high efficiency and ultrafast dynamics. 160 Gb/s bit error rate (BER) measurements confirm the effectiveness of all presented functionalities.
