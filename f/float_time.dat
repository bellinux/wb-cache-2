40|$|In the {{construction}} industry there is an essential requirement for efficient construction schedules that consider the availability of resources as well as constraints. It is standard practice in today’s construction process planning to use the Precedence Diagram Method (PDM), including well-established methods such as the Critical Path Method (CPM). A possible means of improving the mostly manually executed generation process is to apply computer-aided methods such as discrete-event simulation. By combining this method with resource-constrained scheduling methodology it becomes possible to not only verify schedules but also to generate schedules that take resources into consideration. In addition to discrete-event simulation CPM is able to analyse <b>float</b> <b>times,</b> but {{is not able to}} consider resources. Discrete-event simulation on the other hand can consider resources, but is unable to calculate <b>float</b> <b>times.</b> The calculation of <b>float</b> <b>times</b> for construction tasks is an important task. An awareness of <b>float</b> <b>times</b> makes it possible to identify whether a delayed task can be compensated for or if the entire construction project will be late. In this paper we propose using Backward Simulation methodology to develop an elaborated approach that extends discrete-event simulation by the ability to calculate <b>float</b> <b>times.</b> Here, the simulation starts at the virtual completion date of {{the construction}} project and runs backwards in time until the start date. To determine <b>float</b> <b>times</b> {{it is important that the}} task execution sequence is in the same order for forward and backward simulation.

The present paper aims at investigating the role of watercourses in the dispersal of the knotweed due to its frequent occurrence on riverbanks and production of fertile achenes (type of fruit of the Japanese knotweed). This dispersal occurs along two steps after the fruits deposit on the water surface: floatation first and then sinking towards {{the bottom of the}} watercourse.

The criticality index of a path is the probability that the duration of the path is greater than or equal to the duration of every other path in the network. Clearly, the criticality index of an activity can be obtained by determining the criticality indices of the paths, which requires identifying all the paths, determining their criticality indices, then identifying the paths containing the activity. In this paper we develop a theory which leads to a procedure to approximate the criticality indices of all the activities without going through the above three steps. The procedure has been applied to large size PERT networks generated at random, and the results are found to be very close to those obtained by extensive Monte Carlo sampling. project management: PERT...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop an {{optimized}} gastric floating drug delivery system (GFDDS) containing metoprolol tartrate (MT) as a model drug by the optimization technique. A 23 factorial design was employed in formulating the GFDDS with total polymer content-to-drug ratio (X 1), polymer-to-polymer ratio (X 2), and different viscosity grades of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) (X 3) as independent variables. Four dependent variables were considered: percentage of MT release at 8 hours, T 50 %, diffusion coefficient, and <b>floating</b> <b>time.</b> The main effect and interaction terms were quantitatively evaluated using a mathematical model. The results indicate that X 1 and X 2 significantly affected the <b>floating</b> <b>time</b> and release properties, but the effect of different viscosity grades of HPMC (K 4 M and K 10 M) was nonsignificant. Regression analysis and numerical optimization were performed to identify the best formulation. Fickian release transport was confirmed as the release mechanism from the optimized formulation. The predicted values agreed well with the experimental values, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the model in the development of GFDDS...|$|R

Purpose. Effective Helicobacter pylori eradication requires delivery of the antibiotic locally in the stomach. High dose of amoxicillin (750 to 1000 mg) is difficult to incorporate in floating tablets but can easily be given in liquid dosage form. Keeping the above facts in mind, we made an attempt {{to develop a new}} floating in situ gelling system of amoxicillin with increased residence time using sodium alginate as gelling polymer to eradicate H. pylori. Methods. Floating in situ gelling formulations were prepared using sodium alginate, calcium chloride, sodium citrate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose K 100, and sodium bicarbonate. The prepared formulations were evaluated for solution viscosity, <b>floating</b> lag <b>time,</b> total <b>floating</b> <b>time,</b> and in vitro drug release. The formulation was optimized using a 3 2 full factorial design. Dissolution data were fitted to various models to ascertain kinetic of drug release. Regression analysis and analysis of variance were performed for dependent variables. Results. All formulations (F 1 –F 9) showed floating within 30 s and had total <b>floating</b> <b>time</b> of more than 24 h. All the formulations showed good pourability. It was observed that concentration of sodium alginate and HPMC K 100 had significant influence on <b>floating</b> lag <b>time,</b> cumulative percentage drug release in 6 h and 10 h. The batch F 8 was considered optimum since it showed more similarity in drug release (f 2 = 74. 38) to the theoretical release profile. Conclusion. Floating in situ gelling system of amoxicillin can be formulated using sodium alginate as...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is optimization of losartan floating tablet formulation by 23 factorial design. Floating tablets of losartan (100 mg) were formulated employing Cross linked starch-urea, a new modified starch (50 %) as matrix forming polymer, sodium bicarbonate as gas generating agent and beeswax and starch acetate as floating enhancers. Losartan potassium is an orally active anti-hypertensive drug, majorly absorbed from stomach and upper small intestine. Formulation of sustained release floating tablets of losartan is needed because of its poor oral bioavailability and short biological half-life. Losartan floating tablets were formulated as per 23 factorial design and were evaluated. The individual effects of sodium bicarbonate (Factor A) and starch acetate (Factor C) and their combined effect (AC) on the <b>floating</b> lag <b>time</b> were significant (P < 0. 05). Whereas the individual effect of bees wax (Factor B) and all other combined effects of the three factors involved were not significant in influencing <b>floating</b> lag <b>time</b> of the tablets. Formulations Fab, Fac and Fabc exhibited excellent floating over 12 - 14 h with a <b>floating</b> lag <b>time</b> in the range 15 - 35 seconds. Higher levels (20 %) of sodium bicarbonate gave shorter <b>floating</b> lag <b>time.</b> Losartan release from the floating tablets prepared except formulation Fa was slow and spread over 12 h and dependent on the composition of the tablets. Drug release from formulation Fa was very rapid. Losartan release from the floating tablets was by nonfickian diffusion mechanism in all the cases except Fa. In the case of formulation Fa that gave rapid release of drug fickian diffusion was the drug release mechanism. Optimization of losartan floating tablet formulation was done taking <b>floating</b> lag <b>time</b> as the parameter for optimization. The polynomial equation describing the relationship between the response, Y and the variables, X 1, X 2 and X 3 based on the observed data was found to be Y = 11. 59 - 11. 18 (X 1) + 4. 36 (X 2) – 4. 37 (X 1 X 2) - 1. 08 (X 3) + 0. 895 (X 1 X 3) – 0. 735 (X 2 X 3) + 0. 79 (X 1 X 2 X 3). Based on the polynomial equation developed, the optimized losartan floating tablet formulation with a <b>floating</b> lag <b>time</b> of 20 seconds could be formulated employing sodium bicarbonate (160 mg/tablet), beeswax (28 mg/tablet) and starch acetate (60 mg/tablet). The optimized formulation (Fopt) exhibited a <b>floating</b> <b>time</b> of 12 - 14 h with a lag time of 19 - 20 seconds fulfilling the target <b>floating</b> lag <b>time</b> set indicating validity of the optimization technique employed.
