He opened a number of schools including the first school in Latin America for teachers in Santiago in 1842: La Escuela Normal Preceptores de Chile. He proceeded to open 18 more schools and had mostly female teachers from the USA come to Argentina to instruct graduates how to be effective when teaching. Sarmiento's belief was that education was the key to happiness and success, and that a nation could not be democratic if it was not educated. [...] "We must <b>educate</b> <b>our</b> rulers," [...] he said. [...] "An ignorant people will always choose Rosas." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1859, Lowe {{went to the}} Education Office as Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education in Lord Palmerston's ministry; {{there he}} pursued a {{vigorous}} policy, insisting on payment by results, and bringing in the revised code (1862), which embodied this principle and made an examination in [...] "the three R's" [...] the test for grants of public money. He felt then, and still more after the Reform Act of 1867, that [...] "we must <b>educate</b> <b>our</b> masters," [...] and he rather scandalized his old university friends by the stress he laid on physical science as opposed to classical studies. Considerable opposition was aroused by the new regime at the Education Office, and in 1864 Lowe was driven to resign by an adverse vote in Parliament {{with reference to the}} way in which inspectors' reports were [...] "edited." [...] This was the result of the strong feelings that had been aroused against Lingen's administration of the Education Office.|$|E

[...] One questioner said that Duke University hospital must have tampered with the DNA sample for it to come back negative, while another suggested that the accuser {{ought to have been}} helicoptered to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center for treatment since Duke had a conflict of interest.

The triumphant North in America was the land of the common school. The victory of Prussians over Austrians at Sadowa in 1866 was called the victory of the elementary school teacher. Even the nonconformists had come round. Up {{to the middle of the}} sixties opinion among them was hostile to the intervention of the state in education. They had resisted Graham’s proposals in 1843, and Lord John Russell’s in 1847; but a younger generation, eager for progress, saw the new necessity that change of social and political circumstance imposed. The business in 1870 was to provide schools, and to get the children into them.(191) ...|$|E

The successive generations of men, are days in this man's life. The discoveries and inventions which characterize the different epochs of the world, are this man's works. The creeds and doctrines, the opinions and principles of the successive ages, are his thoughts. The state of society at different times, are his manners. He grows in knowledge, in self-control, in visible size, just as we do.' Suppose all this; and suppose too, that God is educating this his colossal child, as we <b>educate</b> <b>our</b> own children; it will hardly follow from thence that his education would be, as Dr. Temple says it is, precisely similar to ours.|$|E

I married, as soon as I could, a dancer at Milan. We had no capital, but our united talents found success. We loved our children; it was necessary to act with decision, or we should have been separated and trampled into the mud. Then I devised this house and wandering life, and we exist in general as you see us. In the winter, if our funds permit it, we reside in some city, where we <b>educate</b> <b>our</b> children in the arts which they pursue. The mother can still dance, sings prettily, and has some knowledge of music. For myself, I can play in some fashion upon every instrument, and have almost taught them as much; I can paint, too, a scene, compose a group, and with the aid of my portfolio of prints, have picked up more knowledge of the costume, of different centuries than you would imagine.

60|$|The usual {{answer is}} that we must <b>educate</b> <b>our</b> masters: that is, ourselves. We must teach {{citizenship}} and political science at school. But must we? There is no must about it, the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school. The schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils, if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters. Our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism, and hold up the military conqueror, the robber baron, and the profiteer, as models of the illustrious and the successful. In vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel: the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years; and the new generations are dragged back in the schools to the morality of the fifteenth century, and think themselves Liberal when they are defending the ideas of Henry VII, and gentlemanly when they are opposing to them the ideas of Richard III. Thus the educated man is a greater nuisance than the uneducated one: indeed it is the inefficiency and sham of the educational side of our schools (to which, except under compulsion, children would not be sent by their parents at all {{if they did not}} act as prisons in which the immature are kept from worrying the mature) that save us from being dashed on the rocks of false doctrine instead of drifting down the midstream of mere ignorance.
