5000|$|Commonly used fire {{retardant}} additives include mixtures of huntite and <b>hydromagnesite,</b> aluminium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide. When heated, aluminium hydroxide dehydrates to form aluminum oxide (alumina, Al2O3), releasing water vapor in the process.

50|$|Huntite often {{occurs in}} {{combination}} with other Mg/Ca carbonates such as dolomite, magnesite, and <b>hydromagnesite.</b> Large deposits of huntite occur in Turkey and Greece and these are commercially exploited because of its fire retardant properties. Huntite thermally decomposes over a temperature range of about 450-800 °C, releasing carbon dioxide and leaving a residue of magnesium and calcium oxides.|$|E
5000|$|Brucite is {{the mineral}} form of {{magnesium}} hydroxide, with the chemical formula Mg(OH)2.

50|$|Some {{compounds}} {{break down}} endothermically when subjected to high temperatures. Magnesium and aluminium hydroxides are an example, together with various carbonates and hydrates such as mixtures of huntite and <b>hydromagnesite.</b> The reaction removes {{heat from the}} substrate, thereby cooling the material. The use of hydroxides and hydrates is limited by their relatively low decomposition temperature, which limits the maximum processing temperature of the polymers (typically used in polyolefins for wire and cable applications).|$|E
5000|$|The {{individual}} crystals of anthodites {{develop in}} a form described as “acicular” (needle-like) and often branch out as they grow. They usually grow downward from a cave's ceiling. Aragonite crystals are contrasted with those made of calcite (another variety of calcium carbonate) in that the latter tend to be stubby or dog-tooth-like (“rhombohedral”, rather than acicular). Anthodites often have a solid core of aragonite and may have huntite or <b>hydromagnesite</b> deposited near {{the ends of the}} branches.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{hydroxide}} {{also finds}} {{use as a}} fire retardant filler for polymer applications {{in a similar way}} to magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and <b>hydromagnesite.</b> It decomposes at about 180 C, absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. In addition to behaving as a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant {{in a wide range of}} polymers, most especially in polyesters, acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, epoxies, PVC and rubber.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a popular}} {{excursion}} spot across the region or from beyond, the more so due to the <b>hydromagnesite</b> mineral found along its coasts which are believed to offer remedies for certain dermatological diseases. The shoreline surrounded by black pine forests are also popular among hunters, {{the game and the}} fowl available including quails, hares, foxes, boars and wild ducks, aside from the lake's fish. White sandy beaches, limpid water and seven crystal-white islets within the lake complete the scenery.|$|E
50|$|The heat {{absorbed by}} the {{reaction}} retards the fire by delaying ignition of the associated substance. The water released dilutes combustible gases. Common uses of magnesium hydroxide as a flame retardant include additives to cable insulation (i.e. cables for high quality cars, submarines, the Airbus A380, the Playstation 4, etc.), insulation plastics, roofing (e.g. London Olympic Stadium), and various flame retardant coatings. Other mineral mixtures {{that are used in}} similar fire retardant applications are natural mixtures of huntite and <b>hydromagnesite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{industrial}} use of huntite is {{as a natural}} mixture with <b>hydromagnesite</b> as a flame retardant or fire retardant additive for polymers. [...] The heat of a fire will cause huntite to decompose releasing carbon dioxide into the flames. This helps to slow {{the spread of the}} fire. The release of carbon dioxide is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat, this action helps to cool the burning material, again slowing the spread of the fire. These types of mixtures are used as alternatives to the more commonly used aluminium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|After {{the water}} that formed the cave drained, speleothems (cave formations) began to form. Jewel Cave {{contains}} all the common types of calcite formations, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, and frostwork, although {{not in the same}} abundance as other well-known caves. The dry parts of the cave contain some formations created by the deposition of gypsum, such as gypsum needles, beards, flowers, and spiders. Finally, Jewel Cave contains a very rare formation called a <b>hydromagnesite</b> balloon. Those are created when gas of an unknown source inflates a pasty substance formed by the precipitation of the magnesium carbonate hydroxide mineral.|$|E
50|$|Both {{calcium and}} {{magnesium}} go into solution when dolomite rock is dissolved. The speleothem precipitation sequence is: calcite, Mg-calcite, aragonite, huntite and <b>hydromagnesite.</b> Hence, {{the most common}} speleothem (secondary deposit) in caves within dolomite rock karst, is calcium carbonate in the most stable polymorph form of calcite. Speleothem types known to have a dolomite constituent include: coatings, crusts, moonmilk, flowstone, coralloids, powder, spar and rafts. Although {{there are reports of}} dolomite speleothems known to exist in a number of cave around the world, they are usually in relatively small quantities and form in very fine-grained deposits.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the largest}} {{deposits}} of <b>hydromagnesite</b> exists in Greece. [...] It consists of a natural mixture with huntite. Local people have used the white mineral {{as a source of}} material for whitewashing buildings for centuries. In the mid 20th century the minerals, ground to a fine powder, found use as a filler for rubber shoe soles. The locals used the granite mills designed for grinding wheat. Commercial exploitation of the minerals began in the late 70s and early 80s with the mineral being exported worldwide. The Greek deposit is still operated commercially, although the world’s largest commercially operated reserves are in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|Widgiemoolthalite is a nickel(II) {{carbonate}} {{that has}} undergone mineral hydration. Tests by Nickel, Robinson, and Mumme yielded the chemical formula (Ni,Mg)5.00(CO3)4.15-(OH)1.70·5.12H2O. The researchers observed that widgiemoolthalite is the nickel structural analog to the hydrated magnesium carbonate <b>hydromagnesite</b> and considering this relationship, determined that widgiemoolthalite's ideal makeup is Ni5(CO3)4(OH)2·4-5H2O though {{because it may}} contain either nickel or magnesium, widgiemoolthalite's makeup may also be written (Ni,Mg)5(CO3)4(OH)2·5H2O.

50|$|His focus {{shifted to}} coral reefs after meeting Dr. Thomas J. Goreau in the 1980s. They formed a long-standing partnership, with Goreau {{continuing}} work on biorock technologies and coral reef restoration after Hilbertz' death in 2007. Because the biorock process uses such simple materials, electrode forms {{can be constructed}} {{in a variety of}} shapes to mimic natural reefs. Since the combined hydrated magnesium oxychloride, brucite (magnesium hydroxide) - later <b>hydromagnesite</b> (magnesium chlorocarbonate) and aragonite (calcium carbonate) coating that forms is so similar to natural reef substrate, corals take to biorock reefs very readily. Countless projects over the years have demonstrated that coral thrive on the electrified and oxygenated reef environment. One prominent example was in the Maldives during the 1998 warming, during which fewer than 5% of the natural reef corals survived. On biorock reefs in the area, 80% of corals not only survived, they flourished.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHydromagnesite Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 4 H 2 O is {{the most}} {{widespread}} form of hydrated Mg-carbonate minerals. To better understand the factors controlling the precipitation of hydrated Mg-carbonates, we measured <b>hydromagnesite</b> solubility product at 25 and 50 °C and its growth rate between 25 and 75 °C, using natural <b>hydromagnesite</b> from a cave as seed material. The solubility products values derived in this study, Ksp-Hmgs=- 37. 08 ± 0. 50 and - 38. 90 ± 0. 54 at 25 and 50 °C, respectively, are in the upper range of published values. <b>Hydromagnesite</b> growth rate normalized to the BET surface area at 8 ≤pH≤ 10 {{is consistent with the}} direct and reversible attachment of the reactants at the solid surface being rate-limiting. It may be described by:RHmgs=A 0 ·e-Ea/RT(ΩHmgs 1 / 5 - 1) where A 0, the pre-exponential factor, and Ea, the activation energy, are equal to 5. 12 × 10 - 7 mol/cm 2 /s and 45. 5 ± 9 kJ/mol, respectively, and ΩHmgs stands for the saturation state of the solution with respect to <b>hydromagnesite.</b> Comparison of <b>hydromagnesite</b> growth rates with recently published magnesite growth rates (Saldi et al., 2009, 2012) show that: (1) <b>hydromagnesite</b> apparent growth activation energy is lower by more than 100 kJ/mol compared to the activation energy for magnesite obtuse step advancement, and (2) <b>hydromagnesite</b> growth rate constant extrapolated to 90 °C is 2. 5 orders of magnitude higher than corresponding magnesite growth rate constant. Thus, our results confirm the long-standing hypothesis that the slow dehydration kinetics of the Mg 2 + cation is responsible for the sluggish magnesite formation at low temperature, and that the kinetic barrier for <b>hydromagnesite</b> growth is much lower. Nevertheless, simulation of <b>hydromagnesite</b> and magnesite growth rates as a function of solution composition at 50 and 90 °C, and pH 7 and 9 reveal that, because of its much higher solubility, <b>hydromagnesite</b> would grow more quickly than magnesite in natural or industrial environments only at 50 °C and pH 9. This is consistent with the formation of <b>hydromagnesite</b> during the surface alteration of ultramafic rocks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
