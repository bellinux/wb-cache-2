50|$|Throwback Semi-Auto: The {{mechanism}} of the marker is cycled using <b>gasses</b> <b>released</b> by the <b>valve</b> which reset the firing mechanism between each shot, {{similar to the way}} some semi-automatic rifles such as the AK-47 operates. The internals of blow-back operated markers can be either inline, with the bolt, valve and hammer all aligned along the same axis such as the Tippman 98, or stacked tube with the bolt in a separate tube from the hammer and valve such as the King-man Spider.|$|R
50|$|Some diving watches {{intended}} for saturation diving at great depths are {{fitted with a}} helium or mixed breathing <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> or escape <b>valve</b> to prevent the crystal from being blown off by an internal pressure build up caused by helium that has seeped into the watch case in helium enriched environments (helium atoms are the smallest natural gas particles found in nature) as the watch and diver adjust to normal atmospheric conditions. Other helium safe/for mixed-gas rated diving watches can withstand the helium used in certain diving situations by using gaskets that simply do not allow helium gas to enter the watch case in a harmful way in the first place.|$|R
5000|$|In {{mechanical}} designs, {{the trigger}} manipulates a sear, which {{is holding a}} hammer, ram, or sealed gas chamber in its resting state. Pulling the trigger releases the sear, allowing the marker's action to cycle. There {{are a variety of}} mechanical designs, the most common being the [...] "blow-back" [...] marker, which utilizes a spring-loaded ram released by the sear to open a pin valve; the pressurized <b>gas</b> <b>released</b> through the <b>valve</b> is directed through the bolt to fire the marker, and also pushes the ram back where it is caught again by the sear, resetting the action for the next shot. There are other systems that saw success in earlier days of the sport, such as blow-forward (AGD Automag) and pneumatically actuated recocking (WorrGames Autococker); elements of these designs were carried forward into modern electropneumatic designs but the original examples of these mechanisms are rarely seen today.|$|R

50|$|It {{released}} the first publicly available dive watch with helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> named the Conquistador. In certain diving situations, helium can penetrate the watch seals and cause a pressure buildup in the watch, eventually blowing the crystal off the watch face. Rolex invented and introduced the first dive watches with a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> in 1969, which prevented this helium buildup. While {{this was a}} major advance at the time, few actual watches with this feature were produced. Doxa introduced the Sub300t Conquistador in 1969 featuring a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> According to the sales brochures and advertisements in Skin diver magazine, DOXA was the first watch company to introduce this device {{to the public for}} general sale. Rolex was manufacturing watches with the Helium <b>Release</b> <b>Valve</b> at the same time, but was only selling them to Commercial Diving Companies such as COMEX. Rolex offered the Sea Dweller with Helium Escape Valve to the public in 1972. Omega also eventually introduced a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> in its Seamaster watch.|$|R

50|$|Automatic helium <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> usually don't {{need any}} manual operation. There are however helium <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> {{featuring}} an additional screw-down crown {{at the side}} of the watch. When the diver starts to ascend, the diver simply unscrews the valve's crown to the full open position, allowing any breathing gas that may have been trapped inside the watch to escape during decompression.|$|R
50|$|These {{suits are}} {{typically}} constructed of several layers and, being airtight, include a <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> so the suit does not overinflate from air exhaled by the SCBA.

As noted, such suits are usually limited to just 15-20 minutes of use by their mobile air supply.|$|R
50|$|Gallant Journey had its {{beginnings}} with the San Diego Junior Chamber of Commerce which had obtained the film {{rights to a}} biography on John Montgomery. A number of realistic gliders and balloons were built for the film. A total of 11 gliders that reproduced Montgomery's original three gliders were built. In an attempt to duplicate the balloon launch of a glider at altitude, the stunt nearly was disastrous when the balloon suddenly flew uncontrollably up to 16,000 ft before the test pilot was {{able to control the}} <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> and bring the balloon back down to the intended 4,000 ft.

5000|$|The second airship {{was tested}} with partial success at Tempelhof near Berlin, Germany, on 3 November 1897. Airship Battalion {{mechanic}} Ernst Jägels {{climbed into the}} gondola and lifted off at 3 p.m. However, the airship broke free of the ground crew, and because it rose quickly Jägels disengaged the vertical axis 'lift' propeller. At an altitude of about 130 m the drive belt slipped off the left propeller, resulting in the ship [...] "...turning broadside to the wind, {{with the result that}} the forward tether broke free." [...] As the ship rose to 510 m the drive belt slipped off the right propeller, the airship thus losing all propulsion. Jägels then opened the newly fitted <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> and landed safely, but the ship turned over and collapsed and was damaged beyond repair.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the current understanding of flammable <b>gas</b> retention and <b>release</b> in Hanford single-shell waste tanks based on theory, experimental results, and observations of tank behavior. The single-shell tanks likely {{to pose a}} flammable gas hazard are listed and described, and photographs of core extrusions and the waste surface are included. The credible mechanisms for significant flammable <b>gas</b> <b>releases</b> are described, and release volumes and rates are quantified as much as possible. The only mechanism demonstrably capable of producing large ({approximately} 100 m{sup 3 }) spontaneous <b>gas</b> <b>releases</b> is the buoyant displacement, which occurs only in tanks with a relatively deep layer of supernatant liquid. Only the double-shell tanks currently satisfy this condition. All release mechanisms believed plausible in single-shell tanks have been investigated, and none {{have the potential for}} large spontaneous <b>gas</b> <b>releases.</b> Only small spontaneous <b>gas</b> <b>releases</b> of several cubic meters are likely by these mechanisms.

50|$|Helium <b>release</b> <b>valves</b> can {{primarily}} {{be found}} on mechanical diving watches featuring a water/pressure resistance greater than 300 m (1000 ft) and therefore positioned as more extreme dive watches. Models that feature a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> include most of the Omega Seamaster series, Rolex Sea Dweller, some dive watches from the Citizen Watch Co., Ltd, Breitling, Girard-Perregaux, Panerai, Mühle Rasmus by Nautische Instrumente Mühle Glashütte, all watches produced by Enzo Mechana, Aegir Watches and selected Doxa, selected Victorinox models, Oris models and TAG Heuer Aquaracer models, {{as well as the}} DEL MAR Professional Dive 1000 watch. Other watch manufacturers such as Seiko still offer high-level dive watches that are guaranteed safe against the effects of helium gas without needing an additional opening in the case in form of a <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> The most extreme mechanical diving watch equipped with a helium relief valve is the 20,000 foot by CX Swiss Military Watch, the current world record holder for mechanical diving watches and featured in the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> {{model was}} examined {{to determine if}} it could provide a physically realistic and accurate model for fission <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> under Prometheus conditions. The single-stage Booth model [1], which {{is often used to}} calculate fission <b>gas</b> <b>release,</b> is considered to be oversimplified and not representative of the mechanisms that occur during fission <b>gas</b> <b>release.</b> Two-stage <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> models require saturation at the grain boundaries before <b>gas</b> is <b>release,</b> leading to a time delay in <b>release</b> of <b>gases</b> generated in the fuel. Two versions of a two-stage model developed by Forsberg and Massih [2] were implemented using Mathcad [3]. The original Forsbers and Massih model [2] and {{a modified version of the}} Forsberg and Massih model that is used in a commercially available fuel performance code (FRAPCON- 3) [4] were examined. After an examination of these models, it is apparent that without further development and validation neither of these models should be used to calculate fission <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> under Prometheus-type conditions. There is too much uncertainty in the input parameters used in the models. In addition. the data used to tune the modified Forsberg and Massih model (FRAPCON- 3) was collected under commercial reactor conditions, which will have higher fission rates relative to Prometheus conditions [4]...|$|R

40|$|To {{analyze the}} effect of an inhomogeneous mixture of an PuO 2 powder on fission <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> in MOX fuel, a model has been {{developed}} using the assumption that <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> mechanism in Pu-rich particles is identical with that in UO 2 fuel. A parametric study was performed to see the respective effect of the number density, size and fraction of Pu retained in the Pu-rich particles on <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> in MOX fuel. The model shows that, for the condition {{of all the other}} remaining parameters being fixed, more <b>gas</b> is <b>released</b> in a MOX fuel for lower number density of, smaller size of, and larger fraction of Pu retained in, the Pu-rich particles. However, there exists some condition or combination of parameters for which {{the effect of}} inhomogeneity on <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> is negligible depending on the characteristics of MOX fuel. Comparison with measured data for OCOM MOX fuel shows that the present model can predict the level of <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> in MOX fuel once the release mechanism in the Pu-rich particles is known. close 4...|$|R
