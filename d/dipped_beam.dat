In-depth accident {{studies have shown}} that perceptual errors made by other vehicle drivers are a very frequent cause of motorcyclists' accidents and fatalities. Two kinds of perceptual errors can be distinguished. The first one is no or late detection of the motorcycle, which is mainly due to its low visual conspicuity (especially because of their small size). The principal safety measure in the past has been the use of daytime running lights (DRLs) by motorcycles, which became compulsory in the seventies in many countries. This conspicuity advantage of motorcycles as the only vehicles with DRLs is presently getting lost by the growing use of DRLs by cars as well. In an earlier study we have shown that car DRLs are actually competing light patterns that create visual noise and decrease the detectability of motorcycles. The second kind of perceptual error, less well known, is the misperception of the approaching motorcycle's speed (which is underestimated) and time-to-arrival (which is overestimated) that also contributes to accident occurrence. In order to reduce motorcycle accidents, and especially to improve motorcycle perceptibility (both detection and speed perception) by other vehicle drivers, ITS based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication will probably provide effective long-term solutions (> 15 years). But until then, other solutions have to be found and could quite easily be implemented, by considering innovative headlight configurations for motorcycles. In two simulator studies, we tested various motorcycle headlight configurations, intended for remedying simultaneously the two perceptual errors made by other vehicle drivers. The impact of different headlight configurations (using colour coding and additional lights) was studied in the presence of visual distractors (car front lights: only DRLs, only <b>dipped</b> <b>beams,</b> DRLs and <b>dipped</b> <b>beams)</b> and in different illumination conditions (nighttime, dusk and daytime conditions). The results of the first study on motorcycle motion perception indicated that headlight configurations that accentuate the vertical dimension of the motorcycle (additional lights on the fork and on the rider's helmet) led automobilists to adopt larger safety margins towards motorcycles. The advantage provided by the innovative headlight configuration showed up especially at low illumination conditions (night and dusk) where the motorcycle outline was not visible or difficult to perceive. On the contrary, a triangular design (with two additional lights on the handlebars) showed no significant improvement. The findings of the second study on motorcycle detection showed that additional yellow lights (on the motorcyclist's helmet and the motorcycle fork) significantly improved motorcycle conspicuity and produced the best motorcycle detection performance, even {{in the presence of a}} great number of competing car headlights (when LEDs and <b>dipped</b> <b>beams</b> were lit at the same time). The findings also show that motorcycle detection was hampered when cars simultaneously lit their DRLs and <b>dipped</b> <b>beams.</b> The great number of competing light sources thus constitues visual noise detrimental to motocycle detectability. When combining the results of our studies, we suggest a motorcycle headlight configuration that consists in one white central headlamp, an additional yellow light on the helmet and two additional yellow lights on the fork. This ergonomic solution has the potential of successfully counteracting the two kinds of perceptual errors made by other vehicles drivers. La communication a porté sur le projet Avimoto qui s'est intéressé à la perceptibilité des motocyclistes.

The car's principle demerits were its [...] "bland" [...] "inappropriately conservative styling" [...] and the dashboard which was [...] "diabolical to use." [...] The front seats were considered as lacking in lumbar support. CAR's opinion was favourable concerning the performance which it described as being due to the evenly-spread close ratios which had [...] "a fairly low first and a top which allows the engine to go past peak power at maximum speed." [...] This gave the Lancia [...] "a distinct edge in terms of lower overall gearing." [...] This helped because the Lancia had more torque and a lower weight than the cars to which it was being compared. Also relative to the test cars, the Lancia had a gearchange [...] "as slick as silk with well-judged spring loading into the third/fourth plane, and appeared to need {{no more than a}} quick dip of the clutch to snatch changes". The Lancia came second to the Citroen in fuel consumption. The Lancia's test consumption was 24 mpg to the Citroën CX 2.0 litre's 27.9 mpg. Under the heading of comfort, the Lancia's springing and damping were praised for their gentle firmness though it was bested by the Saab 900 GLs. The driver's seat received commendation for its general comfort, being softer than the Saab and allowing more freedom to change position than the Citroën CX. The seats was felt to lack lumbar support. Under accommodation the Trevi's rear passenger room was viewed as being sufficient, {{on a par with the}} Saab. Only comparatively did the luggage volume lose points, due the other two tested cars being [...] "exceptional". Under the heading of driver appeal the Trevi was [...] "badly let down by the gimmicky and over-styled fascia design".

The main beam was good but the <b>dipped</b> <b>beam</b> described as [...] "miserable" [...] and [...] "falling short of the point of safety if the car is being driven fast." [...] Due to the chassis layout, steering characteristics and the choice of tyre, CAR's view was that the handling was very consistent with high levels of grip and a readiness to hold the required line of driving during cornering. Lifting off the throttle during cornering caused slight over-steer by [...] "a few degrees." ...|$|E

In addition to detection errors, the misperception of the approaching motorcycle's speed and time-to-arrival also contributes to accident occurrence and severity. In order to reduce motorcycle accidents, and especially to improve motorcycle perceptibility (both detection and motion perception) by other vehicle drivers, ITSs based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication are likely to provide effective long-term solutions (> 15 years). In the meantime, other solutions have to be found and could quite easily be implemented, such as innovative headlight configurations for motorcycles. In two simulator studies, we tested various motorcycle headlight configurations, intended to remedy simultaneously the two perceptual errors made by other vehicle drivers. The impact of different headlight configurations (using color coding and additional lights) was studied in the presence of visual distractors (car front light configurations).

Media concentrations of CTX fell significantly at 15 wt% ATA indicating that ATA inhibits capthesins. <b>Beams</b> <b>dipped</b> in increasing concentrations of MDPB lost progressively less mass, showing that MDPB is a protease-inhibitor. ICTP released from controls or beams exposed to low concentrations were the same, while 5 or 10 % MDPB significantly lowered ICTP production. CTX levels were strongly inhibited by 2. 5 - 10 % MDPB, indicating that MDPB is a potent inhibitor of both MMPs and cathepsin K. Significance. CTX seems to be released from dentin matrix only by cathepsin K. MMPs and cathepsin K and B may all contribute to matrix degradation. (C) 2014 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|On, for instance, the {{miniaturized}} submersible explorer, Deeper Access, Deeper Understanding (DADU), only 20 cm {{in length}} and 5 cm in diameter, the sidescan sonar needs to be tightly mounted in the hull. Finite element analysis (FEA) {{as well as physical}} measurements were used to investigate the effects of beam interaction with acoustically nearby rigid boundaries. Computer simulations showed the first major <b>dip</b> in the <b>beam</b> shape to vary in strength, size, and position with the enclosure wall height, from a position of 47 degrees at 0. 0 -mm wall height to 32 degrees at 3. 0 -mm wall height. Hydrophonic measurements on the manufactured test device confirmed these values to within 9 %, varying between 47 and 29 degrees. In addition, Schlieren imaging was proposed and used as a noninvasive means of qualitative beam shape characterization. A field test was performed with the enclosure height set to 0 and 3 mm. With the latter height, a dark band, corresponding to a sonar sensitivity dip at about 30 in the beam, appeared in the sonar image. It was found that the beam shape is sensitive to small mounting errors, in this case where the wavelength of the sonar is on the same size scale as the enclosure. Furthermore, it was found that FEA models can be used to accurately predict enclosure effects on sonar beam shapes, and Schlieren imaging can be used to visually detect the shape deformations in mounted sonar devices...|$|R
