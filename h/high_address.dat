The control information comprises two types of entry: a control interval descriptor field (CIDF) which is always present, and record descriptor fields (RDF) which are present when there are records within the control interval and describe the length of the associated record.

These have to be read back out again and written to the color port for them to change, when an image containing a footer of color info gets loaded. A method used with this was to have a global palette, and match the colors from an old color palette, to a new color palette. This meant changing the index of each pixel, where it would point to a near perfect match of one color from old to new color set. This also had drawbacks, as sometimes there were not enough gradients, and artifacts and such would appear.|$|E

2500|$|In big-endian format, {{whenever}} addressing {{memory or}} sending/storing words bytewise, {{the most significant}} byte — the byte containing the most significant bit — is stored first (has the lowest address) or sent first, then the following bytes are stored or sent in decreasing significance order, with the least significant byte — the one containing the least significant bit — stored last (having the <b>highest</b> <b>address)</b> or sent last. Little-endian format reverses this order: the sequence addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (lowest address) and the most significant byte last (<b>highest</b> <b>address).</b> Most computer systems prefer a single format for all its data; using the system's native format is automatic. But when reading memory or receiving transmitted data from a different computer system, it is often required to process and translate data between the preferred native endianness format to the opposite format.|$|R

It has several shortcomings which are unavoidable and complicate such exhausted address space, security issues, non-availability of auto-configuration and in some cases present a obstacle to, the advance improvement of the Internet.

30|$|I/O {{ports of}} the entity allow the FPGA {{communicating}} with outside signals in every transaction. A logic controller {{is responsible for}} the exchange of the question-response signals between MCD and ADC. When DR (data ready) gives MCD a ready status to collect data, MCD returns two pulses (ACC (accepted) and ECON (enable conversion)) to ADC with variable thresholds establishing differentiated window for carrying out data acquisition. As the track signal (peak detection) appears, dead-time (DT) pulse allows the logic controller sending a pulse to the FPGA for timestamp (as a percentage). In parallel with the signal recognition logic and the question-and-response interface, the memory read/write function, living time (LT), dead time (DT) and real-time (RT) are done via other control logic pulses. To locate the address for SRAM write cycle, ADC pulse opens two byte buffers of 13 -bit address. Peak amplitude content (reflecting energy information) existing in DR will be written on each cell of SRAM memory when OE (open enable) is low and RW (read-write) is high. Existing data on the local exchange line MIO [D 0 - D 7] written by each byte data via a series of internal logic control pulses ADCL (ADC latch), CI (Carry input), CO (Carry output) and ADC* (ADC ative low). To download the content contained in the SRAM, a memory read cycle is carried out by detecting low and <b>high</b> <b>address</b> with the decoded signal CS 3. When two bytes of address read cycle have positioned SRAM, then contents will be read out via CS 2.

50|$|Endianness {{refers to}} the {{sequential}} order used to numerically interpret a range of bytes in computer memory as a larger, composed word value. It also describes the order of byte transmission over a digital link. Words may be represented in big-endian or little-endian format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are numbered from the big end (most significant bit) or the little end (least significant bit). When addressing memory or sending/storing words bytewise, in big-endian format, the most significant byte, which is the byte containing the most significant bit, is sent first (has the lowest address) and the following bytes are sent (or addressed) in decreasing significance order with the least significant byte, which is the byte containing the least significant bit, thus being sent in last place (and having the <b>highest</b> <b>address).</b> Little-endian format reverses {{the order of the}} sequence and addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (lowest address) and the most significant byte last (<b>highest</b> <b>address).</b> The order of bits within a byte or word can also have endianness (as discussed later); however, a byte is typically handled as a numerical value or character symbol and so bit sequence order is obviated.|$|R
