50|$|The bus {{used in the}} {{original}} PC became very popular, and it was subsequently named ISA.

The XT-bus was then retroactively named 8-bit ISA or XT ISA, while the unqualified term ISA usually refers to the 16-bit AT-bus (as better defined in the ISA specifications.) The AT-bus is an extension of the PC-/XT-bus and is in use to this day in computers for industrial use, where its relatively low speed, 5 volt signals, and relatively simple, straightforward design (all by year 2011 standards) give <b>it</b> <b>technical</b> advantages (e.g. noise immunity for reliability).|$|E

5000|$|An {{exercise}} long used among Christians for acquiring contemplation, one [...] "available to everyone, {{whether he}} {{be of the}} clergy or of any secular occupation", involves focusing the mind by constant repetition of a phrase or word.

Another formula for repetition {{is the name of}} Jesus. or the Jesus Prayer, which has been called [...] "the mantra of the Orthodox Church", although the term [...] "Jesus Prayer" [...] is not found in the Fathers of the Church. The author of The Cloud of Unknowing recommended use of a monosyllabic word, such as [...] "God" [...] or [...] "Love". This exercise, which for the early Fathers represented just a training for repose, the later Byzantines developed into a spiritual work of its own, attaching to <b>it</b> <b>technical</b> requirements and various stipulations that became a matter of serious theological controversy (see below), and remain of great interest to Byzantine, Russian and other eastern churches.|$|E
