40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> structure for efficient distribution network pricing. The <b>dispatch</b> coordination {{problem in the}} context of hierarchical network operators are addressed. We formulate decentralized generation <b>dispatch</b> into a bilevel optimization problem in which main network operator and the connected distribution network operator optimize their costs in two levels. By using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and Fortuny-Amat McCarl linearization, the bilevel optimization problem is reduced into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Equivalence between proposed hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> and centralized <b>dispatch</b> is proved. The model is solved in GAMS platform. IEEE 14 -bus meshed network and IEEE 13 -node radial network are connected to be an illustrative example offering numerical <b>dispatch</b> results. Three scenarios representing distributed generation (DGs) successive development stages are analyzed. Hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> achieves same results as traditional centralized <b>dispatch</b> in the three considered scenarios. Distribution network nodal prices are obtained. Intrinsic advantages of the proposed hierarchical <b>dispatch</b> are to reduce the <b>dispatch</b> complexity with increasing DGs penetration and provide distribution locational marginal prices (DLMP).
