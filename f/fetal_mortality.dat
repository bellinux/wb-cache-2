40|$|Abstract: Pregnancy {{diagnosis}} {{plays an}} important role in the reproduction management of ruminants since embryonic mortality has a substantial impact on the fertility of a herd. Most of the embryonic losses occur during the first days after fertilization and during the process of implantation. So it is very important to discriminate, with an early pregnancy diagnosis, non-pregnant from pregnant animals. Hormone analysis to detect pregnancy may be utilize as a more simple technique as an alternative of rectal palpation or ultrasound. In the last years, a large polymorphic family of placenta-expressed proteins has been discovered in ruminant species and used for pregnancy diagnosis. Members of this family are named pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG), being synthesized in the mono-and binucleate cells of the ruminant’s trophectoderm. Part of them is released in the maternal blood circulation where they can be assayed by different laboratory techniques.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{technology}} of reproduction progressed considerably leading to a certain availability of in vitro methods for fertilization, maturation of the oocyte and culture system for the embryos. The most spectacular manipulations are cloning and transgenesis… This review focuses on the early appearance of the germinal cells precursors and the longstanding destiny of the gametes in mammals. The evident complexity and long-term programmation of events in gametes and early embryo explain the difficulties to succeed in in-vitro methods and the occurrence of unexpected alterations of development, e. g. embryonic or <b>fetal</b> <b>mortalities,</b> large weight newborn syndrome and other dys-regulations in imprinting or DNA transmission. “Studying and teaching the reproductive physiology in mammals, we sometimes imagine that a newborn animal survived two pregnancies: the first one would be a high risk pregnancy that represents the oocyte development and survival inside the follicle with a tetraploïd genome and the zona pellucida & cumulus cells as placenta-like structures. Around the first birth (ovulation), oocytes (individuals) accept in vitro conditions for maturation, fertilization and culture. Afterwards, a second pregnancy will be necessary in the mother or in the recipient uterus; a low risk pregnancy depending on the oocyte competence acquisition and on the conditions or length of exposure in vitro. “Peer reviewe...|$|R

The study samples included all <b>fetal</b> <b>mortalities</b> occurring between 22 weeks of gestation and birth. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 18 at the significance level of 0. 05. Results: Stillbirth rate was estimated to be 11. 7 per 1000 cases. The age of mothers of stillborn babies ranged between 15 and 35 years with a mean of 26. 94 ± 5. 995 years.

50|$|The {{importance}} of perlecan to mammalian development {{is demonstrated by}} perlecan gene knockout experiments. Nearly half of all mice in which the perlecan gene has been knocked out (perlecan null mice) die at embryonic day 10.5, when the perlecan gene normally starts to be expressed. Others die just after birth with severe defects such as abnormal basement membrane formation, defective cephalic and long bone development and achondroplasia. The knockout strategy employed for the first perlecan knockout mouse was a floxing of exon 6 by insertion of a neomycin cassette, and subsequent CRE expression for removal of exon 6 from the genome. This resulted in the cartilage-compromised phenotype previously discussed and loss of basement membrane integrity {{in a variety of}} tissues. The <b>fetal</b> <b>mortality</b> rate is high and the mouse that survive die soon after birth. A separately developed perlecan knockout mouse model was created by insertion of a neomycin cassette into exon 7 of the pln gene. These knockout mice were also 40% embryonic lethal, {{with the rest of the}} mice dying soon after birth due to severe skeletal abnormalities. In yet another mouse knock-in model, the perlecan gene was mutated by homologous recombination of the endogenous perlecan gene with a construct containing 2 and 5 kb arms of homology surrounding a deleted exon 3, which is only 45 base pairs in length. This deletion abolished heparan sulfate chain attachment to the resulting core protein in vivo. The ensuing study showed that mice lacking heparan sulfate additions on perlecan had collapse of lens capsule integrity by postnatal week 3, indicating a role for heparan sulfate in maintaining lens capsule basement membrane integrity, similar to the TGF-β knockout mouse model. Exon 3 knockout mice also showed decreased wound healing and angiogenesis capabilities when challenged by either epidermal injury or FGF-2 addition to the cornea. In the epidermal injury study, a wound spanning the depth of the epidermis was created in exon 3-negative mice and control mice, and in the knockout mice angiogenesis and the hallmarks of wound healing were slow to develop possibly due to decreased growth factor sequestration by the heparan sulfate-negative perlecan. A similar result was produced in the corneal micropocket assay, where FGF-2 is implanted into the cornea of mice and in normal mice angiogenesis is induced. In the knockout mice this angiogenic effect was impaired, although not completely.|$|E
