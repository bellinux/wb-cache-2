But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about those Germans who grappled with its legacy: it's about making the audience feel good about a historical catastrophe that grows fainter with each new tasteful interpolation.|$|E

Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> about the people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{described}} as [...] "porn-tastic" [...] in a review for Now! Christmas 4 by Eye Weekly reviewer Chris Bilton, quoting the lyric [...] "My Christmas tree is delicious". Bilton also called it one of few tracks on the album that make it a [...] "worthy stocking stuffer". Also in a review for Now! Christmas 4, Charlottetown Guardian reviewer Doug Gallant called [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] a [...] "dreadful offering". Beverley Lunney, a reviewer for Winnipeg Free Press, gave the song a negative review, commenting that listeners would be [...] "offended" [...] by the song's [...] "truly unfestive metaphors" [...] and called it one of a [...] "sea of unbearable original tunes" [...] on Now! Christmas 4. Darryl Sterdan of the Ottawa Sun called the song [...] "the only reason to buy" [...] Now! Christmas 4 and recommended downloading it. In a review of Now! Christmas 4, John Lucas of The Georgia Straight described the song as a [...] "filthy electro banger" [...] and [...] "so blatantly about [...] that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> how in the hell it got past the usually vigilant Now! gatekeepers", calling it the [...] "single exception" [...] to an otherwise bland album. In a review for It's Christmas Time, Chester Chronicle reviewer Polly Weeks called the song something that [...] "will keep teenagers happy". In a review for Now That's What I Call Christmas! 4, J Matthew Cobb of HiFi Magazine called [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] part of a [...] "good list" [...] of new material and described it as [...] "naughty, but nice".|$|E
500|$|After McCoy led the Longhorns to {{a victory}} over rival, unranked Texas A (a team he had lost to twice in the past), Sports Illustrated analyst Stewart Mandel said the quarterback took a big step towards {{claiming}} the Heisman Trophy. Mandel wrote, [...] "From the Longhorns' opening touchdown drive, in which he accounted for 67 of Texas' 80 yards, McCoy was very much the one-man wrecking crew he's been all season long...His final numbers in just over three quarters of work Thursday night: 23-of-28 passing for 311 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and 11 rushes for 49 yards, with touchdown runs of 16 and 14 yards. For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands out to me. Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. With all due respect to Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right back in there the next series." [...] Bradford and Harrell each had one regular-season game left, against Oklahoma State and Baylor, respectively. Tebow had games remaining against Florida State and Alabama.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} 101 Albums that Changed Popular Music (2009), Pet Sounds is {{evaluated}} as [...] "one {{of the most}} innovative recordings in rock"; that it [...] "elevated Brian Wilson from talented bandleader to studio genius". Dominique Leone wrote a 9.4 review of its 40th Anniversary edition for Pitchfork stating: [...] "Certainly, regardless of what I write here, the impact and 'influence' of the record will have been in turn hardly influenced at all. I can't even get my dad to talk about Pet Sounds anymore.... The hymnal aspect {{of many of these}} songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any of it will be returned are still affecting to the point of distraction." [...] Music journalist Robert Christgau felt that Pet Sounds was a good record, but believed it had become looked upon as a [...] Composer Atticus Ross explains that the album has [...] "an element of cliché that's grown around it". He references a sketch from the television show Portlandia in which [...] "your classic hipster musicians... are building a studio and everything is like 'this is the mike they used in Pet Sounds.' This is exactly the same as Pet Sounds.'" [...] Commentator C.W. Maloney mused: [...] "The songs on Pet Sounds are great, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> given all the hype and mythology and our love of shallow nostalgia, what we mean when we call it a classic or Wilson a genius. Consider what [...] Zappa was doing in 1966, to say nothing of Miles [...] Wilson's high reputation is evidence of our obsession with childlike innocence and the victory of boring poptimism." ...|$|E

50|$|One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> if {{politics}} {{played a}} significant role in this decision.

In 1935 Albatros was reclassified as a second-line ship, and was assigned to Regia Marina's naval experimental unit at La Spezia.|$|R
