5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate.

Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time of possession was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> its jurisprudence {{is very close}} to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court has {{eventually}} adopted {{some elements}} of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number of}} rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third Amendment, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, the excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had even begun. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war.

5|$|In 836, Ceolnoth presided, with Wiglaf of Mercia, over {{a council}} held at Croft {{attended}} by the clergy {{of the southern}} part of Britain. This was the last time that the archbishop worked in concert with a Mercian king as, after this, he was an attendee at the Wessex royal court instead of the Mercian. In 838 a council was held at Kingston upon Thames where Ceolnoth made an alliance with the West Saxon kings Egbert and Æthelwulf. This agreement gave control of all of the free minsters under Canterbury's authority to the king in return for protection from Viking raids. Ceolnoth also ceded the right to influence the election of abbots within Kent to the king. In return, Egbert received the support of Ceolnoth for the succession of Egbert's son Æthelwulf as king. When Egbert died shortly after this, Æthelwulf succeeded his father and became the first son to follow his father as king of Wessex in almost two centuries. Ceolnoth also recovered control of some lands that had been lost by Canterbury. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this agreement was that the Wessex kings became the secular protectors of the churches and monasteries of the archdiocese of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|The {{assembled}} warbands of the Alamanni frequently {{crossed the}} limes, attacking Germania Superior {{such that they}} were almost continually engaged in conflicts with the Roman Empire, whilst Goths attacked across the Danube in battles such as the Battle of Beroa and Battle of Philippopolis in 250 AD and the Battle of Abrittus in 251 AD, and both Goths and Heruli ravaged the Aegean and, later, Greece, Thrace and Macedonia. However, their first major assault deep into Roman territory came in 268 AD. In that year the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops {{in response to a}} massive invasion by another new Germanic tribal confederacy, the Goths, from the east. The pressure of tribal groups pushing into the Empire was the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a chain of migrations with its roots far to the east: Huns from the Russian steppe attacked the Goths, who in turn attacked the Dacians, Alans and Sarmatians at or within Rome's borders. The Goths first appeared in history as a distinct people in this invasion of 268 AD when they swarmed over the Balkan peninsula and overran the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Illyricum and even threatened Italia itself.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To review {{published}} evidence {{regarding the}} cost effectiveness of multi-component COPD programs and {{to illustrate how}} potentially cost effective programs can be identified. Methods: Systematic search of Medline and Cochrane databases for evaluations of multi-component disease management or chronic care programs for adults with COPD, describing process, intermediate, and <b>end</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> care. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers and descriptively summarized. Results: Twenty articles describing 17 unique COPD programs were included. There is little evidence for significant improvements in process and intermediate outcomes, except for increased provision of patient self-management education and improved disease-specific knowledge. Overall, the COPD programs generate <b>end</b> <b>results</b> equivalent to usual care, but programs containing ≥ 3 components show lower relative risks for hospitalization. There is limited scope for programs to break-even or save money. Conclusion: Identifying cost effective multi-component COPD programs remains a challenge due to scarce methodologically sound studies that demonstrate significant improvements on process, intermediate and <b>end</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> care. Estimations of potential cost effectiveness of specific programs illustrated in this paper can, {{in the absence of}} ‘perfect data’, support timely decision-making regarding these programs. Nevertheless, well-designed health economic studies are needed to decrease the current decision uncertainty. ...|$|R
