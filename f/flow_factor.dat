This is where his flow-fund model of production comes into play (see above). Georgescu's point is that only material resources can be transformed into man-made capital. Energy resources, on the other hand, cannot be so transformed, as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter, and matter is what man-made capital is made up of physically. The only possible role to be performed by energy resources is to assist — usually as fuel or electricity — in the process of transforming material resources into man-made capital. In Georgescu's own terminology, energy may have the form of either a stock factor (mineral deposits in nature), or a <b>flow</b> <b>factor</b> (resources transformed in the economy); but never that of a fund factor (man-made capital in the economy).

In this paper, the geometry and flow variables, which effectively affect the <b>flow</b> <b>factor,</b> are proposed, analyzed and determined.

The accuracies of models created by different approaches are compared and the performances of model approaches are analyzed. The influences of chosen variables and the combination of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and model approaches are also studied.

40|$|Supersonic vortex {{plane and}} {{axisymmetric}} flows of non-viscous non-heatconductive gas with arbitrary thermodynamic {{properties in the}} vicinity of a steady shock wave are studied. The differential equations describing the gas flow exterior to the discontinuity surface and the dynamic compatibility conditions at this discontinuity are used. The gas flow nonuniformity in the shock vicinity is described by the space derivatives of the gasdynamic parameters at a point on the shock surface. The parameters are the gas pressure, density, velocity vector. The derivatives with respect to the directions of the streamline and normal to it, and of the shock surface and normal to it are considered. Space derivatives of all gasdynamic parameters are expressed through the <b>flow</b> nonisobaric <b>factor</b> along the streamline, the streamline curvature, and the flow vorticity and non-isoenthalpy factors. An algorithm for these factors of the gas flow downstream a shock wave determination is developed. Examples of these factors calculation for imperfect oxygen and thermodynamically perfect gas are presented. The influence coefficients of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> on the downstream <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated. As an illustration for flows with upstream Mach number 5 it is shown that the <b>flow</b> vorticity <b>factor</b> is the most influenced by the thermodynamical gas properties.

Analysis of operating data indicates that the effective <b>flow</b> <b>factor</b> is a measure of the quality of agreement between the reactor physics and the thermal hydraulic {{analysis of}} the core. The methods given are also used for the evaluation of the uncertainties associated with the peaking factors, including the results of a sensitivity analysis developed with the code INCORE. Flow calculations have been performed with the code COBRA III C. The original version of the code COBRA III C has been expanded and a method is given to easily handle any further change in the code. A sensitivity a! nalysis, using the code COBRA III C shows the weak sensitivity of the exit conditions of the coolant on most input parameters and on the inlet flow distribution of the coolant selected for the calculation.
