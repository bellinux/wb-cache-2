40|$|Background: The current typical <b>drying</b> {{methods for}} red ginseng are sun <b>drying</b> and hot-air <b>drying.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study was to {{investigate}} <b>drying</b> characteristics of red ginseng by using far-infrared <b>drying.</b> Methods: The far-infrared <b>drying</b> tests on red ginseng were conducted at two <b>drying</b> stages: (1) high temperature for 24  h <b>drying</b> and (2) low temperature <b>drying</b> until the final moisture content was 13  ±  0. 5 % (wet basis). The high temperature <b>drying</b> stage included three <b>drying</b> chamber temperature conditions of 60 °C, 65 °C, and 70 °C. The low temperature <b>drying</b> stage was conducted at temperatures of 45 °C and 50 °C. <b>Drying</b> characteristics were analyzed based on factors such as <b>drying</b> rate, color changes, energy consumption, and saponin content. The results were compared with those of the hot-air and sun <b>drying</b> methods. Results: The results revealed that increases in <b>drying</b> temperature caused a decrease in <b>drying</b> time and energy consumption for far-infrared <b>drying.</b> The saponin content decreased under all <b>drying</b> conditions after <b>drying,</b> the highest value (11. 34  mg/g) was observed at <b>drying</b> conditions of 60 ∼ 50 °C. The sun <b>drying</b> condition showed the lowest color difference value when compared with far-infrared and hot-air <b>drying.</b> Conclusion: The far-infrared <b>drying</b> showed a faster <b>drying</b> rate, higher saponin content, lower color difference value, and a decrease in energy consumption than seen in hot-air <b>drying...</b>|$|R

5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was <b>drier</b> than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following <b>drier</b> glacial periods until the current more favourable climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap. This suggests the original split was only very recent as the forms had insufficient time to speciate. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E

The <b>drying</b> time of microwave <b>drying</b> process to reduce the moisture content of red curry paste from 2. 58 to 0. 08 g water/g <b>dry</b> matter was much shorter than that of the hot-air <b>drying</b> process.
