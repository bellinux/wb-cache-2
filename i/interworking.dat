25|$|The City Loop {{consists}} of four single-track underground lines, one for each group, allowing trains arriving in the city from each group to circle the central business district then head out again to a destination on the same group. Trains generally operate within {{one of the four}} groups, although there is some <b>interworking</b> between the Burnley and Clifton Hill groups and between the Caulfield and Northern Groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{internet}} layer {{provides an}} unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the <b>interworking</b> of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol {{is the principal}} component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.|$|E
