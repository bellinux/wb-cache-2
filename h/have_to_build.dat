5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|When Larry Schmittou {{decided to}} bring {{professional}} baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, {{he knew he would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new ballpark for his team. He negotiated a lease with the city for a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (three km) south of downtown. At the time, this was the site of a city-owned softball complex that the city planned to relocate. The city was prepared to lease him the land, but Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, and paying the city a portion of the team's total revenue.|$|E

25|$|The IOC has {{stressed}} that the main goal of these games is not competition, but education based on Olympic values. The host city, therefore, should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> new venues for the occasion, but rather use existing infrastructure for the games. Still, the games would include an Olympic village and protocols which would prepare young athletes for future Olympic competition.|$|E
25|$|The fearful stayed home. The actual {{migrants}} looked beyond {{fears of}} the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west {{was to find a}} better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to face many challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and tornadoes that rain down snakes, fish and frogs, as well as the occasional range disputes. Homesteaders <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> their homes with sod, which were called as Sod Houses. One of the greatest plague that hit the homesteaders was the 1874 Locust Plague which devastated the Great Plains. These challenges hardened these settlers in taming the frontier.|$|E
25|$|Emmet, Wyldstyle, and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's {{forces with}} the aid of Batman, Wyldstyle's boyfriend. They go to the hidden Cloud Cuckoo Land, a realm where minifigures can create {{whatever}} they desire, to attend a council of Master Builders, all of whom are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack, having placed a tracking device on Emmett, and capture everyone except Emmet and a small team of Master Builders. Escaping, Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's office tower and disarm the Kragle, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where all the Master Builders are forced to make instructions. Trying to retaliate, Vitruvius is decapitated by Business, who sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop. As he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and tells him that his belief makes him the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet jumps into the abyss outside the tower and severs the connection, saving his friends. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> machines and weapons to fight against Lord Business' forces.|$|E

Hewie can be told to sniff out items, check suspicious areas or items, attack an enemy, or called back to Fiona's side. The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him, both which can heal his vitality. Likewise, he can be scolded when he won't listen to commands. He can be told to [...] "stand ready" [...] before attacking, which will increase his attack power.|$|E

500|$|Coon {{suggested}} that Gerrold should {{wait until the}} following February {{to see if the}} show was renewed for a second season. They also discussed several story ideas, including some small furry creatures that bred too quickly. Coon thought it was a cute idea but would be too expensive as they'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> each creature. In preparation for the second series submission, by January, Gerrold had put together five premises to pitch. He had his best hopes on two treatments called [...] "Bandi" [...] and [...] "The Protracted Man", but decided to submit his fifth story despite Coon's earlier dismissal of the idea. It was called [...] "The Fuzzies". The idea was based on the introduction of rabbits in Australia in 1859, who reproduced at a vastly increased rate owing to the lack of predators.|$|E

500|$|In March 2014, Brian Tyler {{signed on}} to compose the film's score, {{replacing}} the composer for the first film, Alan Silvestri, while also marking his third film collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013. Tyler stated that the score pays homage to John Williams' scores for Star Wars, Superman, and Raiders of the Lost Ark and references the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films {{in order to create}} a similar musical universe, saying, [...] "That's the goal for sure. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." [...] Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score, using Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme. Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19.|$|E
500|$|Lenin {{presented}} many of {{his ideas}} in the pamphlet Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, published in August 1905. Here, he predicted that the liberal bourgeoisie would be sated by a constitutional monarchy and thus betray the revolution; instead {{he argued that the}} proletariat would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an alliance with the peasantry to overthrow the Tsarist regime and establish a republic which he called [...] the [...] "provisional revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry". He began to use a number of slogans– [...] "armed insurrection", [...] "mass terror", and [...] "the expropriation of gentry land"– which were influenced by both the Russian agrarian-socialists and the Jacobins of the French Revolution. This shocked the Mensheviks, who believed that Lenin had departed from orthodox Marxism. From Geneva, Lenin continued to monitor the revolutionary situation in Russia, and met with the exiled Father Georgy Gapon, who had led the protest that was crushed in Bloody Sunday.|$|E
500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing. You have to rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A 6m/s (20ft/s) velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the impactor at a window in space about [...] wide.|$|E

500|$|In January 1905, the Bloody Sunday {{massacre}} of protesters in St. Petersburg sparked {{a spate of}} civil unrest known as the Revolution of 1905. Lenin urged Bolsheviks to take {{a greater role in}} the events, encouraging violent insurrection. In doing so, he adopted SR slogans regarding [...] "armed insurrection", [...] "mass terror", and [...] "the expropriation of gentry land", resulting in Menshevik accusations that he had deviated from orthodox Marxism. In turn, he insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks; many Bolsheviks refused, and both groups attended the Third RSDLP Congress, held in London in April 1905. Lenin presented many of his ideas in the pamphlet Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, published in August 1905. Here, he predicted that Russia's liberal bourgeoisie would be sated by a transition to constitutional monarchy and thus betray the revolution; instead he argued that the proletariat would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an alliance with the peasantry to overthrow the Tsarist regime and establish the [...] "provisional revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry".|$|E
500|$|The Anasazi ruins were {{constructed}} in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, {{due to the}} presence of a rare [...] "spiny black horned toad" [...] in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, [...] "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and [...] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I said we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> Indian ruins and then blow it up." [...] However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox. Manners noted that Davis had [...] "a hell of a time" [...] trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, because the hole was fake. The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a [...] "great sequence".|$|E
500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's nice to get three points, but now we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{these plans}} were {{hampered}} by the Metropolitan's continual delays to hold out for a more favorable lease.

Rockefeller later stated, [...] "It was clear that there were only two courses open to me. One was to abandon the entire development.

2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. Maybe it is because they are the easiest and yet the hardest things for me to do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach this in my first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if I fail, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself.
