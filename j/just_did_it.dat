[...] For the Swinging Star hall sequence, all the visual elements except Alan and Lady Penelope are displayed in black and white, with background characters appearing in the form of enlarged still photographs.

[...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances.

500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> you know.

500|$|The {{almost entirely}} sampled nature of Endtroducing..... was {{considered}} groundbreaking {{at the time}} of its release, and Guinness World Records has cited the album as being the first to be created entirely from sampled sources. The album was a driving force in the development of instrumental hip hop music, inspiring several other disc jockeys and producers to create sample-based works. Tim Stelloh of PopMatters cited it as the [...] "benchmark" [...] for the genre. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood of English alternative rock band Radiohead has cited Endtroducing..... as an influence on his band's critically acclaimed album OK Computer (1997), saying that they [...] "liked how he was cutting up beats quite minutely." [...] Several of the artists sampled on Endtroducing..... – including British progressive rock band Nirvana and American musician David Axelrod – have praised the album. DJ Shadow has expressed his surprise at the album's influence and high regard amongst other musicians, saying: [...] "After the record, I'd always bump into these world-class producers who'd say, 'Yeah, Endtroducing..... – what a great piece of production.'

500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> on 4 track".|$|E

They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. His reason to his young son for doing this was, [...] "I wrote some books. I <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for the money, and my name didn't go on them.

2500|$|It was {{announced}} in April 2008 {{that all of the}} original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) would be replaced for series 3.

[...] Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would stick to its pattern of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. [...] "The first year is about getting to know the kids, and the second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more," [...] said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight.

The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and it takes a while to fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK.

[...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997.

But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work.

Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I <b>just</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
