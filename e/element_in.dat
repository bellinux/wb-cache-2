5|$|Carbon is the 15th most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's crust, {{and the fourth}} {{most abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather {{more common than}} copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the <b>element</b> <b>in</b> commercially significant quantities.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its great}} reactivity, all {{chlorine}} in the Earth's crust {{is in the}} form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt.

It is the twentieth most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum is the 54th most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's crust and the 25th {{most abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> its oceans, {{with an average}} of 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E
