Yet physicians who practice in communities with Superfund sites are no more knowledgeable about environmental health hazards than those who practice in communities without Superfund sites. Physi-cians specializing in occupational/preventive medicine are the most knowledgeable about environmental health hazards, whereas obstetri-cian/gynecologists are the least knowledgeable. Self-rated knowledge of environmental health hazards {{was found to be}} strongly related to knowledge about the Right-to-Know law and also to the likelihood of asking questions about workplace and nonworkplace environmental exposures. Physicians who perceive that nonworkplace environmental hazards are very important are more knowledgeable about medical interviewing, diagnostic criteria, and the Right-to-Know law than those who rate environmental health hazard information as "irrelevant to my practice.

40|$|Formaldehyde {{is but one}} of many {{chemicals}} {{capable of}} causing the tight building syndrome or <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>illness</b> (EI). The spectrum of symptoms it may induce includes attacks of headache, flushing, laryngitis, dizziness, nausea, extreme weakness, arthralgia, unwarranted depression, dysphonia, exhaustion, inability to think clearly, arrhythmia or muscle spasms. The nonspecificity of such symptoms can baffle physicians from many specialties. Presented herein is a simple office method for demonstrating that formaldehyde is among the etiologic agents triggering these symptoms. The very symptoms that patients complain of can be provoked within minutes, and subsequently abolished, with an intradermal injection of the appropriate strength of formaldehyde. This injection aids in convincing the patient of the cause of the symptoms so he can initiate measures to bring his disease under control...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} {{environmental}} migrants occurs {{frequently in the}} policy debate, in particular with regard to climate change and the incidence of such migration in low-income countries. This article reviews the economic studies of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration. It includes recent empirical analyses that try to link environmental change to migration flows and the spatial distribution of population. A consensus seems to emerge {{that there is little}} likelihood of large increases in international migration flows due to climate variability. The evidence to date shows that regional migration will be affected, however, either on the African continent or internally, within country borders. Theoretically, <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration can be analyzed using different frameworks: the classical Harris-Todaro model of rural-urban migration, new economic geography models, models grounded in environmental economics of pollution externalities with free factor mobility, and the new economics of labor migration.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} gene p 53 {{has been identified as}} the most frequent target of genetic alterations in human cancers. A considerable number of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced,</b> cancer-related p 53 mutations in human tumors have been found in a highly conserved proline-rich sequence of the p 53 protein encompassed by amino acid residues 147 - 158. Using conformational energy analysis based on ECEPP (Empirical Conformational Energy for Peptides Program), we have determined the low-energy three-dimensional structures for this dodecapeptide sequence for the human wild-type p 53 protein and three <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced,</b> cancer-related mutant p 53 proteins with His- 151, Ser- 152, and Val- 154, respectively. The results suggest that the wild-type sequence adopts a well-defined low-energy conformation and that the mutant peptides adopt well-defined conformations that are distinctly different from the conformation of the wild-type peptide. These results are consistent with experimental conformational studies demonstrating altered detectability of antigenic epitopes in wild-type and mutant p 53 proteins. These results suggest that the oncogenic effects of these <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced,</b> cancer-related, mutant p 53 proteins may be mediated by distinct local conformational changes in the protein...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{local expert}} {{perceptions}} {{of the role of}} environmental factors, especially in terms of contemporary climate change, in population movements from Bangladesh to India. The aim is to delve into locally held understandings of the phenomenon and {{to gain a better understanding}} of these migration processes, which are actively intertwined with local experiences. Both Indian and Bangladeshi experts were interviewed using semi-structured, in-depth interviews in order to explore insights from locally held perceptions and understandings of contextual factors. In total, 10 Bangladeshi and 15 Indian experts were interviewed, covering different disciplines, sectors, regions and job types, together providing a more complete and grounded picture of views of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration in Bangladesh and India. The results show that climate change is perceived by local experts as one of the key factors influencing migration in Bangladesh, both internally and externally. The interviewees, however, placed <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration in a broader context of labour and economic migration. In particular, migration for environmental reasons in Bangladesh was evident long before the emergence of climate change as an issue.

40|$|Abstract—The migration-environment nexus {{has gained}} {{increased}} interest {{from the social}} research field over the last years. While straightly connected to human security issues, this theme has pervaded through the media to the public sphere.

To achieve this purpose, the analysis of the press entries between 2004 and 2010 in three of the main Portuguese newspapers shall be presented, specially reflecting upon the events, protagonists, topics, geographical attributions and terms/expressions used to define those who migrate due to environmental degradation or disasters.

40|$|Around the world, we {{increasingly}} see the often-deemed incongruent {{activities of}} ecotourism, associated environmental conservation {{and natural resource}} or fossil fuel extraction happening in the same spaces, often supported by the same institutions. Rather than being incongruent, however, these seemingly uncomfortable bedfellows are transforming spaces, livelihoods and social, political and environmental geographies in tandem through {{what we call the}} 'ecotourism-extraction nexus'. Drawing on case studies from around the world, we show that physical, symbolic and historical aspects of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> displacements {{are an integral part of}} these transformations, though often in less than straightforward ways. The paper concludes that <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> displacements are a key mechanism to understand why these seemingly uncomfortable bedfellows in empirical reality and within a broader context of capitalist modernity go together surprisingly well. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} in individual responses to exogenous agents {{has been shown}} to be exceptionally wide. It is because of this large diversity of responsiveness that risk factors to <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> diseases have been difficult to pinpoint, particularly at low exposure levels. Opportunities now exist for studies of host factors in <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> cancer or other diseases in which an environmental component can be presumed. Many of the studies have shown an elevated disease proneness for individuals carrying the potential at-risk alleles of metabolic genes, but a number of controversial results have also been reported. One possible explanation for the divergent findings is lack of knowledge of the other potentially relevant genotypes for a given exposure. This paper gives an overview of the published data on combinations of metabolic genotypes in relation to individual susceptibility to environmental toxicants. Environ Healt...|$|R

A trait is innate, I argue, iff it is not <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced.</b> I augment this definition with a novel analysis of environmental induction that draws on the contrastive nature of causal explanation.

40|$|A {{phenocopy}} {{is defined}} as an <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> phenotype of one individual which {{is identical to the}} genotype-determined phenotype of another individual. The phenocopy phenomenon has been translated to the drug discovery process as phenotypes produced by the treatment of biological systems with new chemical entities (NCE) may resemble <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> phenotypic modifications. Various new chemical entities exerting inhibition of the kinase activity of Transforming Growth Factor b Receptor I (TGF-bR 1) were qualified by high-throughput RNA expression profiling. This chemical genomics approach resulted in a precise time-dependent insight to the TGF-b biology and allowed furthermore a comprehensive analysis of each NCE’s off-target effects. The evaluation of off-target effects by the phenocopy approach allows a more accurate and integrated view on optimized compounds, supplementing classical biological evaluation parameters such as potency and selectivity.

40|$|A {{scenario}} for {{the evolution of}} a simple spherical multicel-lular organism from a single eukaryotic cell is proposed. Its evolution is based on <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> alterations in the cell cycle, which then, by the Baldwin effect, become autonomous. Further patterning of this primitive organism- a Blastaea, could again involve <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> signals like contact with the substratum, which could then become autonomous, by, perhaps, cytoplasmic localization and asymmetric cell division. Generating differences between cells based on positional information is probably very primitive, and is well conserved; its relation to asym- 79 metric cell division is still unclear. Differentiation of new cell types can arise from non equivalence and gene dupli-cation. Periodicity also evolved very early on. The origin of gastrulation may be related to mechanisms of feeding. The embryo may be evolutionarily privileged and this may facilitate the evolution of novel forms.

40|$|Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} can {{be influenced}} by environmental cues and thus evoke phenotypic variation. This plasticity can be advantageous for adaptation but also detrimental if not tightly controlled. Although having attracted considerable interest, it remains largely unknown if and how environmental cues such as temperature trigger epigenetic alterations. Using fission yeast, we demonstrate that <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> discontinuous phenotypic variation is buffered by a negative feedback loop that involves the RNase Dicer and the protein disaggregase Hsp 104. In the absence of Hsp 104, Dicer accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions and heterochromatin becomes unstable at elevated temperatures, an epigenetic state inherited for many cell divisions after the heat stress. Loss of Dicer leads to toxic aggregation of an exogenous prionogenic protein. Our results highlight the importance of feedback regulation in building epigenetic memory and uncover Hsp 104 and Dicer as homeostatic controllers that buffer <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> stochastic epigenetic variation and toxic aggregation of prionogenic proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> superselection {{and of the}} process of {{decoherence}} was originally motivated by the search for the emergence of classical behavior out of the quantum substrate, in the macroscopic limit. This limit, and other simplifying assumptions, have allowed the derivation of several simple results characterizing the onset of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> superselection; but these results are increasingly often regarded as a complete phenomenological characterization of decoherence in any regime. This is not necessarily the case: The examples presented in this paper counteract this impression by violating several of the simple ``rules of thumb''.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{strategic}} {{environmental costs}} and expenditures {{can be measured}} and disclosed as information and should be reported in the annual report of an economically sensitive corporation based on a survey conducted on top 100 companies in Australia. The results indicate that strategic environmental managers and accountants believe that <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> costs and expenses should be reported as notes to financial statements, rather than only in the {{profit and loss statement}} in the corporate annual report. However, results are inconclusive as to whether certain strategic <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> expenditure should be capitalized and amortized separately in the balance sheet, while there is some support <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> end- of-pipe and integrated technologies being recognized separately as assets in the balance sheet. The study also found that there was a correlation between the awareness and understanding of ISO standards and this may affect decisions to employ internal environmental auditors with a knowledge and understanding of environmental management systems (EMS) audits under ISO 14000. Finally the paper investigates, through library search, the position of strategic environmental costs management and disclosure in the USA, EU, and Canada. The findings reveal that there is much awareness in reporting environmental costs in the annual report with the enactment of regulations internationally, as in Australia. But the measurement and disclosure of strategic environmental costs and expenditures is still in its infancy, as in Australia, with some improvement in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA, and Canada.

40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 <b>Environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> {{migration}} {{has been}} a contentious topic {{over the last two}} decades. Estimates show that over 30 million people worldwide are annually forced to migrate due to serious environmental degradation, natural disasters and depletion of natural resources. Thus the environment is irrefutably changing, and clear linkages can be drawn between environmental change and human mobility. Africa‘s developing status and its vulnerability in the context of environmental shocks compels research on prospective impacts and outcomes in order to develop proper mitigation and adaptation strategies, especially in Southern African Development Community (SADC) where the likelihood of protection measures being successfully implemented is relatively low. This dissertation is aimed at providing the reader with a detailed analysis of the regional normative framework regulating the issue of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration in SADC. Because environmental migrants are not considered to be ―refugees‖ in international law and on account of the fact that many policy makers and practitioners have their reservations as regards even acknowledging the existence of environmental migrants, protection and regulation in this regard is understandably lacking. A comprehensive framework is nonetheless required to regulate this phenomenon as it prompts serious security and sovereignty concerns. Until quite recently, most African countries had not even put in place national migration policies. Although many states have policies in place now, most have not yet been fully and effectively implemented. The normative framework governing specifically <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration in SADC similarly renders rather disappointing results. Most of the applicable instruments do not directly raise the issue and the provisions indirectly touching upon the subject matter are subject to interpretation. A binding protocol must therefore be adopted by SADC Member States embracing elements contained in the instruments comprising the current framework. Such a protocol will however have to be liberal enough to acknowledge and provide for <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> migration in its entirety whilst conservative enough so as not to undermine protection regimes for refugees in the true sense of the word. Conflicting interests and sovereignty considerations will, however, undoubtedly continue to hinder progress in this regard. The way forward is therefore away from ultimate sovereignty preservation and toward a regionalised approach where human rights no longer take a backseat. Master...|$|R
