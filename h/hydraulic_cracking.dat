40|$|Although {{spectacular}} {{advances in}} hydraulic fracturing, {{also known as}} fracking, have taken place and many aspects are well understood by now, the topology, geometry, and evolution of the crack system remain an enigma and mechanicians wonder: Why fracking works? Fracture mechanics of individual fluid-pressurized cracks has been clarified but the vital problem of stability of interacting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cracks</b> escaped attention. First, based on the known shale permeability, on the known percentage of gas extraction from shale stratum, and on two key features of the measured gas outflow which are (1) the time to peak flux and (2) the halftime of flux decay, it is shown that the crack spacing must be only about 0. 1 m. Attainment of such a small crack spacing requires preventing localiza-tion in parallel crack systems. Therefore, attention is subsequently focused on the classi-cal solutions of the critical states of localization instability {{in a system of}} cooling or shrinkage cracks.

40|$|Although {{spectacular}} {{advances in}} hydraulic fracturing, aka fracking, {{have taken place}} and many aspects are well understood by now, the topology, geometry and evolution of the crack system hydraulically produced in the shale still remains an enigma. Expert opinions differ widely and fracture mechanicians must wonder why fracking works. Fracture mechanics of individual pressurized cracks has recently been clarified but the vital problem of stability of interacting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cracks</b> escaped attention. Progress in this regard would likely allow optimization of fracking and reduction of environmental footprint. The present article first focuses on the classical solutions of the critical states of localization instability {{of a system of}} cooling or shrinkage cracks and shows that these solutions can be transferred to the system of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cracks.</b> It is concluded that if the profile of hydraulic pressure along the cracks can be made almost uniform, with a steep pressure drop at the front, the localization instability can be avoided. To achieve this kind of profile the pumping rate (corrected for the leak rate) must not be too high. Subsequently, numerical solutions are presented to show that an idealized system of circular equidistant vertical cracks propagating from a horizontal borehole behaves similarly. It is pointed out that one important role of proppants, as well as acids that promote creation debris in the new cracks, is that they partially help to limit crack closings and thus localization. Based on the extremely low permeability of gas shale, one must imagine a hierarchical progressively refined crack systems in which the finest cracks have spacing in the sub-centimeter range. The overall conclusion is that what makes fracking work is the suppression or mitigation of localization instabilities of crack systems, which requires achieving uniform pressure profiles along the cracks...|$|R

40|$|Rail seat {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the rail seat, a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>cracking,</b> hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory rail seat using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>cracking,</b> a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie rail seat was developed to estimate the water pressures on the rail seat surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water pressures, <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>cracking</b> appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high rail seat loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie rail seat. However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>cracking</b> are using a tie pad or pad assembly that does not seal water, reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, air-entrained, low-permeability concrete. Care should be exercised when using pads that do not seal water, as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|R

40|$|Shales or mudstones {{are fine}} grained and layered reservoirs, {{which leads to}} strong shale {{permeability}} anisotropy. Shale has a wide pore-size distribution, and pores with different diameters contribute differently to the apparent permeability of shales.

40|$|Shales are {{ubiquitous}} {{rocks in}} sedimentary basins, where their low permeability makes them efficient seals for conventional {{oil and gas}} reservoirs and underground waste storage repositories (waste waters, CO 2, nuclear fuels). Moreover, when they contain organic matter, they form source rocks for hydrocarbons that may escape towards a more porous reservoir during burial, a process referred to as primary migration. And when the hydrocarbons cannot escape, these rocks can be exploited as oil or shale gas reservoirs. While the presence of fractures at the outcrop scale has been described, the existence of fractures at smaller scales, their link with microporosity, the mechanisms that created them, their persistence over geological times, and their effect on the petrophysical properties of shales represent scientific challenges for which drillings in various sedimentary basins over the past decades may hold timely key data. Here, we review and synthetize the current knowledge on how microfractures and micropores in shales can be imaged and characterized and how they control their anisotropic mechanical properties and permeability. One question is whether such microfractures, when observed in outcrops or in drilled core samples extracted from boreholes, are related to decompaction and do not exist at depth. Another question is whether veins observed in shales represent microfractures that were open {{long enough to have}} acted as flow paths across the formation. The mechanisms of microfracture development are described. Some have an internal origin (fracturing by maturation of organic matter, dehydration of clays) while others are caused by external factors (tectonic loading). Importantly, the amount of microfracturing in shales is shown to depend strongly on the content in 1) organic matter, and 2) strong minerals. The nucleation of microfractures depends on the existence of mechanical heterogeneities down to the nanometer scale. Their propagation and linkage to create a percolating network will depend on the presence of heterogeneities at the meso- to macro-scales. Such percolating microfracture networks could control both the long-term sealing capabilities of cap rocks and the further propagation of <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing <b>cracks.</b> Finally, possible areas of research for describing the mechanism of microfracture formation in greater detail and how this impacts the transport and mechanical properties of shales are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Organic shales {{generally}} have low permeability unless fractures are present. However, how gas, {{oil and water}} flows into these fractures remains enigmatic. The alignment of clay minerals and the alignment of fractures and cracks are effective means to produce seismic anisotropy. Thus the detection and characterization of this anisotropy {{can be used to}} infer details about lithology, rock fabric, and fracture and crack properties within the subsurface. We present a study characterizing anisotropy using S-wave splitting from microseismic sources in a highly anisotropic shale. We observe very strong anisotropy (up to 30 %) with predominantly VTI symmetry (vertical transverse isotropy), but with evidence of an HTI (horizontal transverse isotropy) overprint due to a NE striking vertical fracture set parallel to the maximum horizontal compressive stress. We observe clear evidence of a shear-wave triplication due to anisotropy, which to our knowledge is one of only a very few observations of such triplications in field-scale data. We use modal proportions of minerals derived from X-ray fluorescence data combined with realistic textures to estimate the contribution of intrinsic anisotropy as well as possible contributions of horizontally aligned cracks. We find that aligned clays can explain much of the observed anisotropy and that any cracks contributing to the VTI must have a low ratio of normal to tangential compliance (ZN�ZT), typical of isolated <b>cracks</b> with low <b>hydraulic</b> connectivity.

Calculations show that shear assisted melt extraction had a time interval recurrence in the 10 - 100 Kyr range, leading to sill thicknesses of 1 - 30 m. Yet, melts falling {{at the low end of}} the viscosity range when coupled to high shear velocities may lead to veins several hundred meters thick. The deepest structural levels (eg: central Zanskar range) show that in situ melts formed where pure shear compaction was greatest and where simple shear was also operative. Magma extracted from migmatite leucosomes was injected along planes of weakness parallel to the ductile shear fabric probably by some sort of <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing <b>crack</b> propagation mechanism. Large HHL (eg: c 5 km thick sills at Manaslu, Makalu, and northern Bhutan) may thus represent inflated laccoliths assembled via dykes that tapped a 100 - 300 m melt layer produced by compaction of GHS. Thermal simulations show that such melt layers may have incubation times of several m. y. Although transport time for magmas associated with the HHL is short, the time for assembly may take several m. y for the largest HHL, as geochronological data indicate (up to 5 m. y. for Manaslu, Shisha Pangma). Transport of leucogranite melt from mid-crust levels towards the surface was concomitant with active low-angle normal faulting along the South Tibetan detachment normal fault, a structure that effectively formed the lid to the extrusion of a partially molten layer of mid-crustal rocks (Channel Flow). Rapid cooling of the granites emplaced on top of GHS implies rapid extrusion and lateral flow of Greater Himalayan sequence rocks beneath the STD during the period ~ 20 - 17 Ma. Weakening of the crust by partial melting is thus likely to be pulsatory in time, and future thermomechanical models should incorporate such aspects to model tectonic evolution of hot orogens...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{a process}} that is used to release and extract natural gas from the pores of shale rocks. The process involves drilling vertical and horizontal wells through shale formation beds. After which, a mixture of fluid and sand is pumped into the rock formation through the horizontal well, pressurizing the shale around the well, causing multiple permeable cracks to form. Studying hydraulic fracturing helps Oil and Gas companies to improve the efficiency and productivity of this process. Because the hydraulic fracturing process takes place hundreds of meters below the ground’s surface, its behavior is difficult to physically assessed. Computer modeling is an efficient and economical way to study and analyze the behavior of the process. Finite element modeling, as a numerical tool, can be used to solve such non-linear fracture problems. In this thesis, finite element modeling is used to study two-dimensional, single, and multiple crack propagation problems that occur during fluid injection. The single fracture problem is compared with a well known analytic model (KGD model) in order to verify the efficiency of the numerical finite element model. The effects that rock and fluid material properties have on the fracture propagation, crack width, and fluid pressure is studied. As a result, the finite element numerical model is found to be in good agreement with the KGD analytical solution. Moreover, the analysis revealed that small changes in the material properties (e. g., rock elasticity modulus, permeability, and fluid viscosity) have significant effects on fracture propagation. Multiple crack problems, using three parallel cracks, are also investigated. The effects of the fracture spacing and type of fluid control (flow rate or pressure control) are studied. Stress shadowing (induced stresses from the adjacent fracture) between multiple fractures is evaluated. For the edge cracks, it is found that as the fracture spacing decreases, the crack length increases. While, for the middle crack, as the fracture spacing decreases, the crack length decreases. It is shown that fluid flow controlled injection leads to stable crack injection, while pressure control injection leads to unstable crack propagation. In summary, this thesis finds that an optimal spacing for three <b>crack</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing is between equal fracture spacing and two-third the distance between the middle and any of the edge cracks. It is recommended that future engineers extend this research to simulate a three-dimensional problem with randomly oriented fractures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{is to improve the}} geotechnical properties of dispersive soil by reducing their dispersivity after elucidating the important mechanisms controlling the dispersivity of the soils. Dispersive soils have unique properties, which under certain conditions deflocculate and are rapidly eroded and carried away by water flow. These soils are found extensively in the United States, Australia, Greece, India, Latin America, South Africa and Thailand. The mechanism of dispersivity of soils is a subject matter of great interest for geotechnical engineers. In the earlier days clays were considered to be non erosive and highly resistant to water erosion. However, recently it was found that highly erosive clay soils do exist in nature. Apart from clayey soil, dispersivity is also observed in silty soils. The tendency of the clays to disperse or deflocculate depends upon the mineralogy and soil chemistry and also on the dissolved salts in the pore water and the eroding water. Such natural dispersive soils are problematic for geotechnical engineers. They are clayey soils which are highly susceptible to erosion in nature and contain a high percentage of exchangeable sodium ions, (Na+). It is considered that the soil dispersivity is mainly due to the presence of exchangeable sodium present in the structure. When dispersive clay soil is immersed in water, the clay fraction behaves like single-grained particles; that is, the clay particles have a minimum of electrochemical attraction and fail to closely adhere to, or bond with, other soil particles. This implies that the attractive forces are less than the repulsive forces thus leading to deflocculation (in saturated condition). This weakens the aggregates in the soil causing structural collapse. Such erosion may start in a drying <b>crack,</b> settlement <b>crack,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fracture <b>crack,</b> or other channel of high permeability in a soil mass. Total failure of slopes in natural deposits is initiated by dispersion of clay particles along cracks, fissures and root holes, accelerated by seepage water. For dispersive clay soils to erode, a concentrated leakage channel such as a crack (even a very small crack) must exist through an earth embankment. Erosion of the walls of the channel then occurs along the entire length at the same time. Many slope and earth dam failures have occurred due to the presence of dispersive soils. Unlike erosion in cohesionless soils, erosion in dispersive clay is not a result of seepage through the pores of clay mass. However, the role of type of clay and its Cation exchange capacity in the dispersion of soil is not well understood. Data on the presence, properties, and tests for identification of dispersive clays is scarce. Hence, an attempt is made, in this thesis, to develop reliable methods to identify these soils and understand the extent of their dispersivity as well as to develop methods to control their dispersivity. The present study deals with the characterization of a local dispersive soil collected from southern part of Karnataka State. This study has focused on comprehensive tests to assess the dispersivity of the soils by different methods and to methods to improve geotechnical properties by reducing the dispersivity of the soil. An attempt is made to reduce the dispersivity of soil by using calcium based stabilizers such as lime, cement and fly ash. The mechanism of improvement in reducing the dispersivity of the soil with calcium based stabilizers has been studied. One of the important mechanism by which the dispersivity of the soil is reduced is by inducing cementation of soil particles. The differences in effectiveness of different additives are due to their differences in abilities to produce cementitious compounds. Although all the additives increased the strength of the soil and reduced the dispersivity of the soil, cement was found to significantly reduce the dispersivity of the soil, compared to the other two additives lime and fly ash. Cement is more effective as sufficient cementitious compounds are produced on hydration without depending on their formation. A detailed review of literature on all aspects connected with the present study is given in Chapter 2. A comprehensive description of dispersive soils present worldwide has been brought out in this section. Based on this survey, the scope of the present investigation has been elaborated {{at the end of the}} chapter. To understand the reasons for dispersivity of the soil and to estimate its degree of dispersivity, it is essential to assess standard methods to characterize the soil. Chapter 3 presents a summary of material properties and testing programs. The results of geotechnical characterization of the soil, the index properties of the soilspecific gravity, sieve analysis, Atterberg’s limits are discussed in Chapter 4. The physico chemical characteristics play an important role in determining the amount of dispersivity of the soil. Dispersive soils have two main characteristics which define its dispersivity chemically. These are Sodium Adsorption Ratio (S. A. R) and Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (E. S. P). The two characteristics are determined from the Cation exchange capacity of the soil. Exchangeable Sodium Percentage is defined as the concentration of sodium ions present in the soil with respect to the Cat ion exchange capacity of the soil. And Sodium Adsorption Ratio is used to quantify the free salts present in the pore water. Since Atterberg’s limits and grain size analysis do not help in identifying dispersive soils or in quantifying its dispersivity, two other tests- Emerson Crumb test and double hydrometer test were carried out on the soil. Emerson crumb test is a simple way for identification of dispersive soils. In this test, a crumb of soil measuring about 1 mm diameter is immersed in a beaker containing distilled water and the subsequent reaction is observed for 5 minutes. It is solely based on direct qualitative observations. Depending on the degree of turbidity of the cloud formed in the beaker, the soil is classified in one of the four levels of dispersion in accordance with ASTM-D 6572. Since this test is mainly a qualitative test and does not help in quantifying the dispersivity, it cannot be depended upon completely in identifying a dispersive soil. Another test double hydrometer test, which helps in quantifying the dispersivity of the soil, was also conducted on the soil. This test involves in conducting the particle size distribution using the standard hydrometer test in which the soil specimen was dispersed in distilled water with a chemical dispersant. A parallel hydrometer test was conducted on another soil specimen, but without a chemical dispersant. The dispersing agent used for the experiment was sodium hexametaphosphate. The percent dispersion is the ratio of the dry mass of particles smaller than 0. 005 mm diameter of the test without dispersing agent to the test with dispersing agent expressed as a percentage. The double hydrometer test was carried out according to Double Hydrometer Test (ASTM D 4221). Apart from the conventional tests, attempts are made to consider shrinkage limit test and unconfined compression test to determine the dispersivity of the soil. For this purpose, the shrinkage limit of the soil was determined with and without dispersing agent. The initial shrinkage limit of the untreated soil reduced on treating it with dispersing agent, thus indicating that the soil had further dispersed on addition of dispersing agent. In order to carry out the unconfined compression strength, the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content was determined through the compaction test. The soil was then treated with dispersing agent and compacted at the optimum moisture content. The soil exhibited high degree of dispersion through the strength test. Hence it is necessary to stabilize the soil with additives. Detailed experimental program has been drawn to find methods to improve the geotechnical properties and to reduce the dispersivity of the soil. Chapter 5 presents the investigations carried out on the dispersive soil with lime. The importance of lime stabilization and the mechanism of lime stabilization have been discussed initially. Commercially obtained hydrated lime was used in the present study. The soil was treated with three different percentages of lime 3, 5 and 8. The curing period was varied from one day to twenty eight days. The effect of addition of lime on various properties of the soil such as pH, Atterberg’s limits, compaction test and unconfined compression test is elaborated in chapter 5. The pH of the soil was maximum on addition of 3 % lime. On further addition, the pH decreased and remained constant. The liquid limit of the soil increased on adding 3 % lime and decreased with further lime content. The compaction test conducted on the soil showed an increase in maximum dry density of the soil and reduction in optimum moisture content with 3 % lime content. On further increase in the lime content, the soil showed a decrease in the maximum dry density and increase in optimum moisture content. The unconfined compressive strength of the soil also increased on increasing lime content upto 5 %. The variation in strength of the soil with respect to curing period was also compared. Optimum lime content arrived at based on the above conducted tests was 3 %. The effect of lime in reducing the dispersivity of the soil through shrinkage limit test and unconfined compression test is also presented in this chapter. Details of the efforts made on the soil with fly ash are presented in Chapter 6. The fly ash used for stabilization of Suddha soil was of Class F type. This type of fly ash contains low reactive silica and lime. The effect of varying fly ash content on the properties of Suddha soil by varying the percentage of fly ash from 3 to 10 percentages is discussed in this chapter. The tests conducted on fly ash treated Suddha soil were pH test, compaction test, Atterberg’s limits and unconfined compression test with varying curing period. The fly ash treated Suddha soil was cured from one day to twenty eight days for the unconfined compressive strength analysis. The pH of the soil system increased with increasing percentage of fly ash. The increase in liquid limit was marginal on addition of fly ash. The maximum dry density of fly ash treated Suddha soil decreased continuously and the optimum moisture content of the treated soil increased with increasing fly ash content. The unconfined compressive strength of Suddha soil increased with increase in fly ash content upto 8 % and then decreased for fly ash content of 10 %. For all the percentages of fly ash added, the strength of the soil increased with increase in the curing period. The effect of fly ash in reducing the dispersivity of the soil was carried out using shrinkage limit and unconfined compression test. It was seen that on increasing the fly ash content, the soil treated with dispersing agent showed an increase in the shrinkage limit. Also, the same trend was observed for the unconfined compression strength to determine dispersivity. Optimum fly ash was determined as 8 % with the help of all the tests conducted on the soil. Since the improvement in the properties of the soil with lime and fly ash was not very high, Cement was also considered as another additive used for stabilization of Suddha soil. It is known that soil with lesser amount of clay content will respond well with cement. The effect of cement addition on various properties of Suddha soil has been brought out in Chapter 7. It was found that addition of cement had positive effects on all the properties of Suddha soil. The pH of the soil increased for all the percentages of cement addition. The liquid limit of the soil increased on increasing the cement content. The shrinkage limit also showed a similar trend. The optimum moisture content of the soil decreased on increasing the cement content for Suddha soil and the maximum dry density increased for cement treated Suddha soil. The soil showed the maximum dry density at 8 % cement content. The unconfined compression strength conducted on cement treated Suddha soil increased significantly for higher cement contents and also with curing period. Suddha soil when treated with 8 % cement content exhibited maximum strength in comparison to other percentages. Also, the effect of cement in reducing the dispersivity of the soil was carried out using shrinkage limit and unconfined compression test. The shrinkage limit of the soil increased for all percentages of cement content, even in the presence of dispersing agent. Through the unconfined compression strength for dispersivity, it could be seen that 8 % cement treated Suddha soil had the least dispersion. Optimum cement content was derived as 8 % with the help of the tests conducted on the soil. A comparison of effect of all the additives on the strength of the soil as well as effect of the additives in reducing the dispersivity of the soil is discussed in Chapter 8. The effect of additives on the shrinkage limit of the soil with and without dispersing agent has been compared. The variation in shrinkage limit of the soil when treated with the additives was due to the different mechanisms involved in reducing the dispersivity by each additive. The effect on the unconfined compression strength of the soil treated with the additives with and without dispersing agent is also brought out in this chapter. It was noted that the dispersion exhibited through shrinkage limit test was lesser as compared to the percentage dispersivity exhibited through unconfined compression test. Hence it could be said that dispersion of the soil is due to loss of cohesion than volume change behavior. Also, the unconfined compression strength of the soils with respect to curing period is compared. The percentage dispersivity calculated through these tests is summarized and compared. With the help of this it could be said that to control the dispersivity of the soil, it is necessary to enhance the strength of the soil. The general summary and major conclusions drawn from the thesis are presented in Chapter 9...|$|R
40|$|Soils often {{exhibit a}} variety of {{small-scale}} heterogeneities such as cracks, inter-aggregate (or structural) pores, decayed root channels {{and other types of}} macro- and coarse micropores. Due to these local-scale heterogeneities, a non-ideality known as ‘Preferential Flow’ generally occurs, creating localscale non-equilibrium conditions in pressure head and solute concentrations between regions of faster and slower flow. According to Gerke (2006), “preferential flow comprises all phenomena where water and solutes move along certain pathways, while bypassing other volume fractions of the porous soil matrix. ” Preferential flow is not only a theoretical challenge, but also has practical significance in that it enhances the leaching of pollutants from the surface to deeper layers and into the saturated groundwater zone. The reason is that the buffer capacity, as well as biological activity, that are found in the organic-rich upper soil horizons and that are vital to the degradation of pollutants, are generally weaker or absent altogether in the deeper layers. Thus the danger of groundwater contamination is increased due to preferential flow. The theoretical foundation for the phenomenon of preferential flow was laid half a century ago by Barenblatt et al. (1960). The theory was initially formulated in terms of the seepage of liquids in fissured rocks. The profound importance of cracks and fissures was highlighted by Freeze and Cherry (1979), who found that “the <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity through <b>crack</b> network is often 10 to 104 times higher than that of the adjacent rock matrix. ” The theory was later expanded by soil physicists to apply to porous media containing cracks or macropores. The first step was the introduction of the concept of mobile and immobile water in a porous medium by Gaudet et al. (1977). This was followed by Beven and Germann (1981, 1982), who formulated the theory of flow in soils containing macropores. The fundamental problem of disequilibrium due to macroporosity was discussed by Baveye and Sposito (1984). The theorywas later extended, using numerical approaches, to the concept of dual porosity (Moench, 1984; Arbogast, 1987), and specialized for soils by Gerke and van Genuchten (1993). Nkedi-Kizza et al. (1983) studied ion-exchange and miscible displacement in aggregated soils. Othmer et al. (1991) demonstrated that for soils with bimodal porosity, the numerical simulation improved when both hydraulic functions, soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, were included into separate pore domains of the model. Another advance was the dual permeability concept by Šimůnek et al. (2003). Recent advances in preferential flow research were reviewed by Jarvis (1998) and Gerke (2006). Accounting for themechanismsinvolved,we distinguish the following types of preferential flowat the ‘pedon scale’ (i. e. the scale of larger units of soil particles formed by aggregation) : 1. Preferential flowin realmacropores (or non-capillary pores). At least in principle, Richards' equation is not applicable. Instead, the kinematic wave equation or the simple Hagen– Poiseuille equation can be applied. Fluxes are significantly accelerated compared to those in the pores. 2. Preferential flow in inter-aggregate pores, denoted also as interpedal or structural pores. Sometimes inter-aggregate pores are described as macropores, but this terminology neglects the principal difference between non-capillary and capillary pores. Richards' equation is applicable since the pores are in the category of capillary pores. The fluxes are accelerated compared to those in the intrapedal pores of the matrix when infiltration and redistribution are considered, but less accelerated compared to the fluxes in Type 1. Some authors question the applicability of Richards' equation in those coarser micropores. 3. Fingering due to the instability on the wetting front. This occurs most frequently at the interface of a less permeable layer above a more permeable one. In numerical models, apparent fingering can be induced by numerical instabilities. Fluxes are comparable to those of Type 2. 4. Preferential flow due to spatial irregularities or temporal dynamics in soil wettability (or water repellency). This type of preferential flow is often assumed to occur when the initial soilwater content is belowa critical value. Fluxes are comparable to those of Type 2. Local-scale heterogeneities and non-equilibrium preferential flow are obviously expected to be strongly related, but the quantification of this relationship remains a challenge. Given the important effects of preferential flow on water and solute transport, a large body of literature can be found dealing with the description of preferential-flow pore networks and the mechanisms of macropore flow, especially at the pedon scale. The use of morphometric data in combination with soil physical characteristics is recognized as particularly relevant. Recent advances allow the complex geometry of the pore space to be quantified by means of tomography, magnetic resonance and image analysis. New devices and measurement techniques are now available, such as time domain reflectometry and disc permeametry, allowing better observations of preferential flow at the pedon scale. Additionally, insight into the physical influence of local-scale heterogeneities on soil processes can now be gained by appropriately modelling water and solute transport behavior in natural soils with different structures. Accordingly, the body of knowledge on preferential flow available at present, both theoretical and experimental, is extensive. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps still exist. The purpose of this Special Issue is to fill some of these gaps. The papers selected for the Special Issue address a range of issues, from the basic principles governing the generation of preferential flow at the pore scale, to the flow mechanisms and the microscale properties of the porous soil system, and to the problem of upscaling. The papers show that better observations using new devices, and analyzed using innovative analytical and predictive approaches, may bring us toward a better understanding and prediction of preferential flow in structured soils. The Special Issue starts with a comprehensive two-paper overviewon model applications in preferential flow/transport in structured soils by Koehne et al., one paper on water flow and tracer transport, and the other on pesticide transport. These papers describe the present state of the art. Preferential flow in real macropores (or non-capillary pores), and preferential flow in interpedal (inter-aggregate) pores is investigated in two papers, one by Kutílek and Germann, and another by Hincapié and Germann. The limits of applicability of Richards' equation as a function of pore size, and the fluxes involved, are investigated in these papers. Recent mechanistic approaches for interpreting transport in heterogeneous soils are presented in four papers: Coppola, Comegna et al.; Kutílek et al.; Gerke and Badorrek; and Kodešová et al. All of these authors make use of experimental evidence for testing the validity and assessing {{the pros and cons of}} the various alternative approaches. In the papers by Coppola, Comegna et al. and by Kutílek et al., the simpler but approximate composite porosity (bimodal porosity) approaches are discussed. Although composite porosity approaches can account for a fast propagation of the wetting front, they implicitly assume instantaneous equilibrium between pore systems. Non-equilibrium flow is accounted for in the paper by Gerke and Badorrek, as well as in that by Kodešová et al., where the more complex double-permeability models are applied. The first paper analyzes the effects of local heterogeneities on preferential flow in a lignitic mine. The second paper investigates the relationships between preferential flow and soil properties at the soil profile scale, as well as the influence of solute characteristics and soil management practices on preferential pore flow. Two papers, one by Sander and Gerke, and the other by Rosenbom et al., present new advances in the understanding of preferential flow that have resulted from the use of novel experimental techniques, as well as two-dimensional modelling that also takes horizontal flow/transport into account. The latter uses a powerful 3 D model for variably saturated flow and transport. Finally, in the last paper, Coppola, Basile et al. consider the important applied research issue of upscaling by investigating the influence of physical heterogeneities and preferential pathways on flow and transport processes across spatial scales and related scale-dependent parameterizations in laband field-scale transport experiments. Although the work presented here is far from comprehensive, and although many more questions remain, we hope the reader will enjoy reading this modest volume and will agree that it has advanced the general understanding of preferential flow in a significant way...|$|R
