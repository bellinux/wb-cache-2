5|$|Researchers found {{evidence}} that significant deviations from CIRP during {{the onset of the}} global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and financial institutions in Europe and the US in the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swap market. The European Central Bank's efforts to provide US dollar liquidity in the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swap market, along with similar efforts by the Federal Reserve, had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro. Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their creditworthiness.|$|E

Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E

5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange,</b> borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
