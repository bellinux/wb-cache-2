40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} was to develop an {{experimental}} test based on combination of fluidization and stirring in the perspective of its use for dustiness assessment. A parametric study on various factors that influence the release of <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> (considered as dust) from a fluidized bed of binary mixtures of coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> is presented. The emission of <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> is found to be lower when the density of <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> is high, and when the fluidization gas velocity, the mean size and the relative amount of <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> in the mixture are low. Different binary mixtures with various fine/coarse fractions were tested in a classical fluidized bed as well as in a stirred fluidized bed. The experiments show that the total recovery of <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> obtained by the combined test exceeds 80 % whereas for the same aeration conditions and test duration, the classical fluidized bed releases only about 20 % of the total mass...|$|R
