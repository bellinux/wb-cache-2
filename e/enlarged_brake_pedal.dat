The first experiment tested {{the accuracy of}} recall of drivers for the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> location of the vehicle {{with which they were}} very familiar. The second experiment examined the accuracy of recall for a <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> location with which they had recent practice. The last experiment attempted to determine if practice with one <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> location would interfere with the accuracy of reproduction of a newly learned pedal location. The results of the experiments indicate that subject drivers have difficulty in reproducing the location of <b>brake</b> <b>pedals.</b> This difficulty exists for familiar <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> locations as well as newly learned <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> location?. Further there is an indication that practice with one <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> location may influence the accuracy of reproducing the location one newly learned...|$|R

To produce a better performance car {{it is important to}} design vehicles with optimum weight. In order to reduce the weight of vehicle without sacrificing its integrity, this project aims to employ topology optimization technique to propose an optimal design of an automotive component in early phase of product development. In this project the material used for an existing <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> is unchanged as this study focuses on reducing weight of existing <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> without material substitution. The digital model of an existing <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> was generated using CATIA V 5 solid modelling software. Topology optimization was performed by using Altair Optistruct software under linear static stress analysis. Finally, a new light weight design <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> is proposed.

A passenger car hydraulic brake system simulation model incorporating the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal,</b> booster, master cylinder, brake lines and calipers has been developed to predict brake system response {{to assist in the}} design of braking systems with the desired <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> force / travel characteristic characteristics to create good <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> `feel¿.

50|$|The {{vacuum booster}} or vacuum servo {{is used in}} most modern {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The vacuum booster is attached between the master cylinder and the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> and assists the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the intake manifold of the engine or the vacuum pump, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> is applied.|$|R

40|$|Customer {{perception}} of <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> feel quality, {{as related to}} the {{perception of}} the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> feeling soft or mushy, depends on both the customer's subjective judgment of quality and the actual build quality of the brake system. This project analyzed the different factors contributing to the soft brake condition using a fishbone diagram. A low cost tool to objectively measure <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> feel was developed and tested. Using this tool we found a negative linear correlation between residual air in the brake system and <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> feel. Even in the worst-case, a residual air level of 0. 9 mL or greater is required before the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> force drops 10 %. The air evacuation step in the brake fluid filling process was investigated by the addition of a vacuum accumulator tank, and we found the air evacuation to depend on the brake system cross-sectional area (i. e. tube diameter) and not on the vacuum pressure. Organizational process issues were analyzed, and we found that greater cross-functional communication and collaboration are needed between manufacturing and external groups such as design and marketing. by Jeffrey T.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} braking system characteristics, brake system performance and brake system component design parameters that influence <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> force / displacement characteristics as ‘felt’ by the driver in a passenger car. It includes detailed studies of individual brake system component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> system simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual brake system component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole brake system {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> ‘feel’ improvement. A full brake system simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict brake system performance and to design a system with better <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> ‘feel’. Each of the brake system component design parameters was validated to ensure that the braking system performance was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of brake booster air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for brake system engineers to design a braking system with improved pedal ‘feel’.
