50|$|Welding {{processes}} can {{generally be}} grouped into two categories: fusion and <b>diffusion</b> <b>welding.</b> Fusion welding involves localized melting of the metals at the weld interfaces, and {{is common in}} electric or gas welding techniques. This requires temperatures {{much higher than the}} melting point of the metal in order to cause localized melting before the heat can thermally conduct away from the weld, and often a filler metal is used to keep the weld from segregating. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>welding</b> consists of joining the metals without melting them, welding the surfaces together while in the solid state. In <b>diffusion</b> <b>welding,</b> the heat source is often lower than the melting point of the metal, allowing more even heat-distribution thus reducing thermal stresses at the weld. In this method a filler metal is typically not used, but the weld occurs directly between the metals at the weld interface. This includes methods such as cold welding, explosion welding, and forge welding. Unlike other diffusion methods, in forge welding the metals are heated to a high temperature before forcing them together, usually resulting in greater plasticity at the weld surfaces. This generally makes forge welding more versatile than cold-diffusion techniques, which are usually performed on soft metals like copper or aluminum. In forge welding, the entire welding areas are heated evenly. Forge welding can be used for a much wider range of harder metals and alloys, like steel and titanium.|$|E

Work on the project went on for over 6 months in Zhukov studio in Karelia.

This can {{be found}} in the form of [...] "filled gold," [...] a {{technique}} used to bond gold and copper for use in jewelry and other applications. In order to create filled gold, smiths would begin by hammering out an amount of solid gold into a thin sheet of gold foil. This film was then placed on top of a copper substrate and weighted down.

Well bonded joint could be obtained by two original CP-Ti samples welded directly at the conditions of 950 °C welding temperature and 5 MPa pressure. Excellent bonding between nanocrystalline Ti and cooper substrate was achieved at 850 °C but lots of cavities were observed on the interface when welded at the same temperature as that for two Ti substrates. Surface nanocrystallite utilization could {{play a role in}} promoting interface diffusion procedure by surface atoms activation and large amount of diffusion channels.

5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion <b>welding,</b> cold <b>welding,</b> <b>diffusion</b> bonding, exothermic <b>welding,</b> high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|R
5000|$|Diffusion bonding or <b>diffusion</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{solid-state}} {{welding technique}} used in metalworking, capable of joining similar and dissimilar metals. It operates {{on the principle}} of solid-state diffusion, wherein the atoms of two solid, metallic surfaces intersperse themselves over time. This is typically accomplished at an elevated temperature, approximately 50-70% of the absolute melting temperature of the materials. Diffusion bonding is usually implemented by applying high pressure, in conjunction with necessarily high temperature, to the materials to be welded; the technique is most commonly used to weld [...] "sandwiches" [...] of alternating layers of thin metal foil, and metal wires or filaments. Currently, the diffusion bonding method is widely used in the joining of high-strength and refractory metals within the aerospace and nuclear industries.|$|E

50|$|Galling occurs {{initially}} {{with material}} transfer from individual grains, on a microscopic scale, which become stuck or even <b>diffusion</b> <b>welded</b> to the adjacent surface. This transfer {{can be enhanced}} if one or both metals form {{a thin layer of}} hard oxides with high coefficients of friction, such as those found on aluminum or stainless-steel. As the lump grows it pushes against the adjacent material and begins forcing them apart, concentrating a majority of the friction heat-energy into a very small area. This in turn causes more adhesion and material build-up. The localized heat increases the plasticity of the galled surface, deforming the metal, until the lump breaks through the surface and begins plowing up large amounts of material from the galled surface. Methods of preventing galling include the use of lubricants like grease and oil, low-friction coatings and thin-film deposits like molybdenum disulfide or titanium nitride, and increasing the surface hardness of the metals using processes such as case hardening and induction hardening.|$|R
