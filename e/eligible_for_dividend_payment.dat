40|$|We empirically {{investigate}} dividend {{and share}} repurchase policies of Canadian firms. Our analysis contains two {{features that are}} uncommon in finance, while they are encountered in other fields of science. First, we use standard, simultaneous and nested logit models. The non-standard logit models are often used in recreational economics and marketing. By examining different model specifications, we test alternative descriptions {{of the behavior of}} decision- makers. Second, we use questionnaire data on firm characteristics. Collecting data by questionnaires is hardly ever done in finance, while it is the mainstream approach in sociology and organization. We have sent a questionnaire to the 500 largest non-financial Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, of which 191 usable responses were returned. Our results are consistent with a structure in which the company first decides whether it wants to pay out cash to its shareholders or not. In the second stage the firm decides on the form of the payout: dividends, share repurchases or both. Payout is determined by free cash flow. The choice <b>for</b> <b>dividends</b> and repurchases depends on behavioral and tax preferences. Furthermore, the payout is less likely to be dividends if the company has executive stock option plans. Finally, we find evidence for the Brennan and Thakor (1990) model.

Then, using financial ratios, other accounting based measures and the risk neutral distance metric from our structural model as explanatory variables we estimate the hybrid model with an ordered probit regression method. Using the same econometric method, we estimate a model using financial ratios and accounting variables as explanatory variables and a model using our risk neutral distance to default metric as unique explanatory variable. We have found that by enriching the risk-neutral distance to default metric with financial ratios and accounting variables into the hybrid model, we can improve both in sample fit of credit ratings and out of sample predictability of defaults. Our main conclusion is that financial ratios and accounting variables contain significant and incremental information, thus the risk neutral distance to default metric does not reflect all available information regarding the credit quality of a firm. credit risk, distance to default, financial ratios, accounting variables...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, in {{the context}} of ruin theory, most judgements are made on an {{immediate}} sense. An example would be the determination of ruin, in which a business is declared broke right away when it attains a negative surplus. Another example would be the decision on <b>dividend</b> <b>payment,</b> in which a business pays dividends whenever the surplus level overshoots certain threshold. Such scheme of decision making is generally being criticized as unrealistic from a practical point of view. The Parisian concept is therefore invoked to handle this issue. This idea is deemed more realistic since it allows certain delay in the execution of decisions. In this thesis, such Parisian concept is utilized on two different aspects. The first one is to incorporate this concept on defining ruin, leading to the introduction of Parisian ruin time. Under such a setting, a business is considered ruined only when the surplus level stays negative continuously for a prescribed length of time. The case for a fixed delay is considered. Both the renewal risk model and the dual renewal risk model are studied. Under a mild distributional assumption that either the inter arrival time or the claim size is exponentially distributed (while keeping the other arbitrary), the Laplace transform to the Parisian ruin time is derived. Numerical example is performed to confirm the reasonableness of the results. The methodology in obtaining the Laplace transform to the Parisian ruin time is also demonstrated to be useful in deriving the joint distribution to the number of negative surplus causing or without causing Parisian ruin. The second contribution is to incorporate this concept on the decision <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> <b>payment.</b> Specifically, a business only pays lump-sum dividends when the surplus level stays above certain threshold continuously for a prescribed length of time. The case for a fixed and an Erlang(n) delay are considered. The dual compound Poisson risk model is studied. Laplace transform to the ordinary ruin time is derived.

40|$|This {{research}} examines whether quarterly CFRCs {{of major}} CF components and their subcomponents vary with firm-specific and industry conditions, and across fiscal quarter. ^ This study finds that variation in operating CFRC is {{positively related to}} growth, length of operating cycle, financial leverage, quality of investment opportunities (free CF; book-value q), and operating CF persistence, and negatively related to macroeconomic conditions and firm size; and that financing CFRC is positively related to growth and quality of investment opportunities (book-value q). Investing CFRC is positively related to growth, but negatively associated with quality of investment opportunities. CFRCs for debt issuance, stock issuance, capital expenditure, and long-term investment are positively related to quality of investment opportunities, but CFRCs <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> and acquisition are negatively related to quality of investment opportunities. The negative change in CFRC with acquisition so dominates the effect of other investing CF components that investing CFRC becomes negative with good investment opportunities. ^ Another notable finding {{in this study is}} that variations in all CFRCs influenced by firm-specific conditions are nonlinear with respect to the relative size of operating CF to market value. The positive change in operating CFRC depends not only on the quality of investment opportunities but also on relative size of operating CF. Changes in CFRC across industry also reveal that CFRC of certain industries behave differently relative to various firm-specific factors. For example, the service and manufacturing industries have highly positive operating, financing, and investing CFRC; mining, and retail/wholesale industries, and public utilities have highly negative CFRC. Operating CFRC and ERC behave differently across fiscal quarters. ERC in the fourth fiscal quarter is smaller than {{in the second and third}} quarters, and operating CFRC is greater than ERC in the corresponding third and fourth quarters.

Conflicts between the founding family and non-family controlling shareholders and tensions within the founding family are important determinants of payout policy.

Finally, we find that common action problems and conflicts among a multitude of family members and/or generations in "real family firms" lead to a higher taste <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> payments' if compared to firms dominated by the founder ("founder-controlled firms").

40|$|Are {{financial}} markets efficient? One proposition {{that seems to}} contradict this is Shiller’s finding of excess volatility in asset prices and its resulting rejection of the discounted cash flow model. This paper replicates Shiller’s approach for a different data set and extends his analysis by testing for a long-run relationship {{by means of a}} cointegration analysis. Contrary to previous studies, monthly data for an integrated European stock market is being used, with special attention to equity style investment strategies. On the basis of this analysis’ results, Shiller’s findings seem questionable. While a long-run relationship between prices and dividends can be observed for all equity styles, a certain degree, but to a much smaller extent than in Shiller’s approach, of excess volatility cannot be rejected. But it seems that a further relaxation of Shiller’s assumptions would completely eliminate the finding of an overly strong reaction of prices to changes in dividends. Two interesting side results are, that all three investment styles seem to have equal performance when adjusting for risk, which by itself is an indication for efficiency and that market participants seem to use current <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> from one company as an indication <b>for</b> future <b>dividend</b> <b>payments</b> by other firms.
