Methods: Seventeen male subjects divided randomly into two groups performed deadlift and deadlift <b>high</b> <b>pull,</b> both with increasing weights up to maximal power, prior to and after the training programs (three sessions per week). Results: Their mean power increased significantly during the deadlift at 20 kg (14. 3 %, p = 0. 026), 30 kg (17. 7 %, p = 0. 008), 40 kg (16. 5 %, p = 0. 011), 50 kg (14. 5 %, p = 0. 020), and 60 kg (14. 3 %, p = 0. 021) and during the deadlift <b>high</b> <b>pull</b> at 30 kg (9. 9 %, p = 0. 037), 40 kg (10. 1 %, p = 0. 035), and 50 kg (8. 2 %, p = 0. 044) after the resistance training.

Materials and Methods: The study group was composed of 10 subjects with a mean age of 15. 8 ± 2. 5 years and 3. 05 ± 0. 07 mm moderate open bite. All the patients rejected orthognathic surgery. The treatment included extraction of upper and lower second premolars followed by leveling, banding, bonding, posterior space closure, and anterior retraction.

40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} previous weightlifting literature {{and provides a}} rationale {{for the use of}} weightlifting pulling derivatives that eliminate the catch phase for athletes who are not competitive weightlifters. Practitioners should emphasize the completion of the triple extension movement during the second pull phase that is characteristic of weightlifting movements as this is likely to have the greatest transference to athletic performance that is dependent on hip, knee, and ankle extension. The clean pull, snatch pull, hang <b>high</b> <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh pull are weightlifting pulling derivatives {{that can be used in}} the teaching progression of the full weightlifting movements and are thus less complex with regard to exercise technique. Previous literature suggests that the clean pull, snatch pull, hang <b>high</b> <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh pull may provide a training stimulus that is as good as, if not better than, weightlifting movements that include the catch phase. Weightlifting pulling derivatives can be implemented throughout the training year, but an emphasis and de-emphasis should be used in order to meet the goals of particular training phases. When implementing weightlifting pulling derivatives, athletes must make a maximum effort, understand that pulling derivatives can be used for both technique work and building strength–power characteristics, and be coached with proper exercise technique. Future research should consider examining the effect of various loads on kinetic and kinematic characteristics of weightlifting pulling derivatives, training with full weightlifting movements as compared to training with weightlifting pulling derivatives, and how kinetic and kinematic variables vary between derivatives of the snatch...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} design of a ROV with <b>high</b> <b>pull</b> force. The focus is the {{hydrodynamic}} design, but several other aspects had to be included to set feasible boundaries for the hydrodynamic design. The work is divided in three parts. The first focuses on general design, setting limits for power supply and pull force and discussing general arrangements and stability. The second part focuses on propeller design, describing different applicable methods and starts the design of a propeller for a <b>high</b> <b>pull</b> ROV. The third part puts the results together and presents a temporary ROV design and presents the solutions. This part also includes discussion of the work and suggestions for further work. The first part, General design, completes a feasibility study by concluding that a reasonable maximum pull force for a <b>high</b> <b>pull</b> ROV is approximately 82 tonnes at a maximum operational depth of 800 meters. Here estimations of power-thrust relations are made and limitations regarding power flow and physical size are discussed. A ducted contra-rotating propeller is considered suitable considering the ROV’s main goal. Further two systems for manoeuvring are suggested. One system for manoeuvring in loaded condition and one for manoeuvring in unloaded condition is presented and assumed feasible and adequate. The general arrangement, including positioning and weights of the main components of the ROV, has been proposed with a solution resulting in neutral buoyancy and a stable submerged ROV. External shape and resistance have been discussed. The total resistance of a streamlined ROV is estimated to approximately 4 tonnes. Issues concerning practical handling of the ROV have been mentioned. The second part, Propeller design, attempts a design of a ducted contra-rotating propeller. First different aspects considering propeller design is described and special concerns regarding design of a ducted contra-rotating propeller are discussed. A thorough review of the program AKPA which is used for the propeller design is given. The process of making the propeller design of a ducte contra-rotating propeller has been started, but due to some difficulties it has not been completed. The third part of the paper presents the work done and the ROV design made. The result is a ROV with a pull force of 77. 8 tonnes, a total dry weight of 114 tonnes, an overall length of 18. 8 meters and a propeller diameter of 5 meters. The necessary power supply is 2. 2 MW delivered to the ROV. Several aspects of this design are still uncertain and needs further exploration. The propeller design should be completed and especially structural concerns and power supply should be taken into account. Stability and external shape could be explored further, particularly stability in floating condition and during surface operations. </p...|$|E
