5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> failure of his love affair that defines the character.|$|E
50|$|Regarding of a tandem-queue roadway having 3 BNs with μ1<μ2, if μ1<μ2<μ3, {{similarly}} as the 2-BN case, D3(t) will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> {{departure of}} this 3-BN tandem-queue roadway. If, however, μ1<μ3<μ2, D2(t) will then still <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> departure of <b>the</b> 3-BN tandem-queue roadway. Thus, it can <b>be</b> summarized that, <b>the</b> {{departure of the}} bottleneck with the minimum capacity will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> departure of <b>the</b> entire system, regardless of the other capacities {{and the number of}} bottlenecks. Figure 16 shows a general case with n BNs.|$|R

5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect {{is a man with}} an unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate,</b> undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E

Kira <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Coordinator; his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother's womb and his genetic enhancements {{were intended to}} be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until {{the latter half of}} the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to believe they were his biological parents.

5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into {{everyday life and}} to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells are unaware of Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy {{as the key to}} unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's parents to be killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Power.|$|E
