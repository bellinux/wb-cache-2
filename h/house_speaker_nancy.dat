50|$|In July 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee {{approved}} {{an amendment}} authored by Kucinich to {{its version of}} the unsuccessful America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 {{by a vote of}} 27-19, with 14 Democrats and 13 Republicans voting for it. The amendment empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive the federal law that pre-empts state law on employee-related health care, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in response to state requests. It has been speculated that the amendment's bipartisan support was for its appeal to states' rights in supporting progressive legislation. In the past, states attempting to enact single-payer reforms have been successfully sued and stopped under ERISA. It has also been speculated that this law's passage would open up vital new avenues for promoting, and actually implementing a single-payer system for the United States, as newly unbound states would show single-payer's success, just as Saskatchewan did for Canada. However, the Kucinich Amendment was stripped from the merged <b>House</b> bill. <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi said that it would have violated President Obama's promise that Americans who liked their health insurance could keep it.|$|R
2500|$|The 2010 Massachusetts Senate special {{election}} victory of Scott Brown seriously imperiled {{the prospects of}} a health care reform bill, as Democrats lost their 60-seat Senate super-majority. The White <b>House</b> and <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi engaged in an extensive campaign to convince both centrists and liberals in the House to pass the Senate's health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, after Obama announced an executive order reinforcing the current law against spending federal funds for elective abortion services, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill, which had passed the Senate in December 2009, did not receive a single Republican vote in either house. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the PPACA into law. The New York Times described the PPACA as [...] "the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades," [...] while the Washington Post noted {{that it was the}} biggest expansion of health insurance coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Both houses of Congress also passed a reconciliation measure to make significant changes and corrections to the PPACA; this second bill was signed into law on March 30, 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became widely known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or [...] "Obamacare." ...|$|R
25|$|During 2000–2010, the Virginia League of Conservation Voters gave Hurt {{an average}} {{approval}} rating of 40%. However, in 2010, when Hurt was running against incumbent Tom Perriello, the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters released {{television and radio}} ads against Hurt, attacking him on an alleged conflict of interest regarding uranium mining. However, the ads were deemed to be false by independent fact checkers {{due to the fact}} Robert Hurt had no personal investment in uranium mining. Hurt strongly opposed <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi’s 2009 proposed “Cap-and Trade” climate control legislation. Hurt called on the Virginia Department of Interior secretary Ken Salazar to remove bans on off-shore drilling and development.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 2007, he {{introduced}} H. J. Res. 14: Concerning {{the use of}} military force by the United States against Iran in the 110th congress. According to Jones on his web site, the resolution requires that – absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces – the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran. This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi (D–CA) on March 13, 2007.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 2010 Obama {{signed the}} Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, 7 {{days after he}} had signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. At the end of 2009, each house of Congress passed its own health care reform bill, but neither house passed the other bill. The Senate bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, became the most viable avenue to reform {{following}} the death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and his replacement by Republican Scott Brown. Lacking a filibuster-proof super-majority in the Senate, the Obama administration and <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi began encouraging the House to pass the Senate bill, then pass a new bill to amend it using the reconciliation process.|$|E
5000|$|After the 2010 elections, the Democrats {{lost their}} {{majority}} in the <b>House.</b> The departing <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi ran for the Minority Leader position {{in order to remain}} the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House and the outgoing Majority Leader, for the Minority Whip post. Clyburn had the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs. On November 13, Pelosi announced a deal whereby Hoyer would stand as Minority Whip, while a [...] "number three" [...] leadership position styled Assistant Leader would be created for Clyburn. The exact responsibilities of Clyburn's assistant leader office remain unclear, though it is said to replace the Assistant to the Leader post previously held by Chris Van Hollen. He had attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership hierarchy.|$|R

Katrina vanden Heuvel, publisher of the The Nation magazine, called the plan [...] "responsible", saying [...] "there are no military solutions". However, Political commentator Cokie Roberts stated that withdrawal from Iraq, {{one of the goals of}} the plan, would be [...] "an irresponsible thing to do", claiming [...] "Americans would prefer to win". [...] There were also indications that, within the Democratic Party, the plan had some influence in the debate, with the plan cited on the House floor in 2008. and [...] "helped focus" [...] actions in the <b>House</b> according to <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi speaking about the plan and Burner's efforts in a June 2008 interview.|$|R

25|$|As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd {{served as}} President pro tempore four times when his party {{was in the}} majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and {{outgoing}} Vice President Al Gore broke the tie {{in favor of the}} Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, {{as a result of the}} 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi.|$|E
25|$|As {{the race}} {{continued}} to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates. Even {{if she were}} to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, the window of opportunity for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E

500|$|Tierney, {{described}} as [...] "an unwavering liberal" [...] by CQ's Politics in America, has consistently high approval ratings from Democratic and liberal interest {{groups such as}} Americans for Democratic Action, and low approval ratings from conservative {{groups such as the}} American Conservative Union.

Described as [...] "a favorite of the House Democratic leadership," [...] he maintains a close relationship with former <b>House</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi; her daughter Christine Pelosi served as his chief of staff from 2001 to 2005. Tierney was speculated as a candidate to succeed United States Senator Ted Kennedy in a special election after Kennedy's death in 2009, but he decided not to run. In 2010 Washington paper The Hill published a speculation that Tierney, with a $1.3 million war chest, was a likely candidate to run against Kennedy's successor Scott Brown in the 2012 election.
