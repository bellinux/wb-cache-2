50|$|The {{first true}} {{circular}} dividing engine was probably constructed by Henry Hindley, a clockmaker, around 1739. This {{was reported to}} the Royal Society by John Smeaton in 1785. It was based directly on a <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> for clockworks. It used a toothed index plate and a worm gear to advance the mechanism. Duc de Chaulnes created two dividing engines between 1765 and 1768 for dividing circular arcs and linear scales. He desired to improve on the graduation of instruments by removing the skill of the maker from the technique where possible. While beam compass use was critically dependent on the skill of the user, his machine produced more regular divisions {{by virtue of its}} design. His machines were also inspired by the prior work of the clockmakers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the deeply}} study on VERICUT, the {{generating}} process of {{spiral bevel gear}} surface is simulated in this paper. A certain surface generation process of spiral bevel gear is analyzed as an example. First the 3 D solid models of <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> cutter and gear blank are built. Then the NC program is compiled based on the generating principle of tooth surface. Finally the surface generating movement of spiral bevel gear is realized through selecting control system and importing the NC program. It can be indicated that the simulation analysis of surface generation can optimize the cutting movement and provide theoretical basis for the movement analysis of gear cutting...|$|E

French mathematician and engineer Desargues designed and constructed the first mill with epicycloidal teeth ca. 1650. In the 18th century involute gears, another mathematical derived design, came into use. Involute gears are better for meshing gears of different sizes than epicycloidal.

50|$|Prior {{work on the}} {{development}} of <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> had prepared the way. Such devices were required to cut a circular plate with uniform gear teeth. Clockmakers were familiar with these methods and they were important in developing dividing engines. George Graham devised a process of using geometric methods to divide the limb of an instrument. He developed a sophisticated beam compass to aid marking of the graduations. John Bird and Jeremiah Sisson followed on with these techniques. These beam compass techniques were used into the 19th century, as the dividing engines that followed did not scale up to the largest instruments being constructed.|$|R

50|$|The general {{pattern of}} {{development}} for wealthy nations was {{a transition from}} a primary industry based economy to a manufacturing based one, {{and then to a}} service based economy. Romania did not follow this pattern, manufacturing has always been secondary, though certainly not unimportant. In part because of this, Romania did not suffer as greatly from the pains of deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturers have been attracted to Romania due to the highly educated population with lower labour costs than the EU. Romania's government-run healthcare system is also an important attraction, as it exempts companies from the high health insurance costs they must pay in the EU. Romania is also perceived as a dynamic market for machine tools, especially in the backdrop of growth in the domestic automobile and mechanical engineering sectors. Romanian machine tool exports abroad have been growing at double digit figure since 2002. Moreover, Romanian exports saw an increase of 23 percent {{in the first half of}} 2007 compared to the same period last year. The exports comprised mainly machining centres, grinding, honing, lapping <b>machines,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines,</b> lathes and milling machines, presses and other metal forming machine tools.|$|R

50|$|As of 2014, an {{estimated}} 80% of all gearing produced worldwide {{is produced by}} net shape molding.Molded gearing is usually either powder metallurgy or plastic. Many gears are done when they leave the mold (including injection molded plastic and die cast metal gears), but powdered metal gears require sintering and sand castings or investment castings require <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> or other <b>machining</b> to finish them. The {{most common form of}} <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> is hobbing, but gear shaping, milling, and broaching also exist. 3D printing as a production method is expanding rapidly.

40|$|Purpose. Classification of {{different}} machining strategies underlying the known methods for <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> with disc-shaped milling tools {{as well as}} preliminary determination of their advantages and disadvantages before profound studies by simulations and experiments. Design/methodology/approach. This paper {{is concerned with the}} analysis of the different methods for <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> with disc-shaped milling tools in order to determine their advantages or disadvantages in terms of flexibility, productivity and machining quality as well as to make a classification of the machining strategies underlying these methods. Findings. By analyzing the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> methods, it was found that they differ in strategies for material removal, tool movement and tool engagement. These strategies define advantages or disadvantages of the machining methods as well as their optimal application areas. Further, it was shown that some of the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> methods are based on similar or even the same machining strategies. Originality/value. The results of the analysis show that none of the known methods for <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> with disc-shaped milling tools is universally applicable. Some of them provide a higher productivity and flexibility, and the others ? a better machining quality. It means that, in order to select a perfectly suitable machining method with the optimal process parameters for each individual manufacturing task and thereby to increase the efficiency of the gear manufacturing, the profound knowledge about achievable productivity, flexibility and quality parameters are required. The proposed classification of the machining strategies underlying the <b>gear</b> <b>cutting</b> methods creates a basis for further theoretical and experimental studies of the mentioned parameters. ?????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????? ????????? ??????? ? ????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ????????, ?????????????????? ? ???????? ?????????. ????? ????, ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????????, ??????? ????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ???? ???????????????? ? ???? ?? ???????...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting.
