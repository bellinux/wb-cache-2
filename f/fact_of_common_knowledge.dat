We {{propose that}} {{intentionally}} produced humor {{is a form}} of communication that evolved to broadcast information about the self and to obtain information about others by honestly signaling the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> shared <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> According to this model, humorous utterances and acts are encrypted in the sense that what makes the joke funny is not merely its surface content, but a relationship between the surface content and one or more unstated implicatures which are known by both the sender and the receiver. It is the non-random nature of the match between this unstated knowledge and the surface content which provides evidence that the producer possesses that knowledge, and that those who appreciate the joke do as well, thus rendering humor a means of assessing shared underlying knowledge, attitudes, and preferences. We present evidence from two experimental studies of humor evaluation in support of the encryption theory...|$|R

40|$|Coordinating {{activities}} at different sites of a multi-agent system typically imposes epistemic {{constraints on the}} par-ticipants. Specifying explicit bounds on the relative times at which actions are performed induces combined tempo-ral and epistemic constraints on when agents can perform their actions. This paper characterises the interactive epis-temic state that arises when actions must meet particular temporal constraints. The new state, called timely <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> generalizes <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> {{as well as other}} variants <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> While known variants <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> are defined in terms of a fixed point of an epistemic formula, timely <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is defined in terms of a vectorial fixed point of temporal-epistemic for-mulae. A general class of coordination tasks with timing constraints is defined, and timely <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is used to characterise both solvability and optimal solutions of such tasks. Moreover, it is shown that under natural conditions, timely <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is equivalent to an infinite con-junction of temporal-epistemic formulae, in analogy to the popular definition <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Categories and Subject Descriptors [Artificial intelligence]: Knowledge representation and reasoning — Reasoning about belief and knowledge, Tempo-ral reasoning, Causal reasoning and diagnostics; [Artificial intelligence]: Distributed artificial intelligence — Cooper-ation and coordination, multi-agent systems; [Real-time systems]: Real-time system specification; [Distributed computing methodologies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the motivation behind <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Common</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{has been argued}} to be necessary for joint action in general and for language use as {{a particular kind of}} joint action. However, this term has been broadly interpreted. Two major issues must be addressed: (1) What mental state corresponds to <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> i. e., is knowledge, belief or supposition the appropriate mental attitude? (2) What inference process allows agents to achieve <b>common</b> <b>knowledge?</b> Most generally, <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is used to describe the knowledge that is evidenced in reflexive reasoning. The term has also been used to refer to facts or objects which are mutually salient. One of the main problems for a theory <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is whether knowledge is the appropriate mental attitude. It seems as though probabilistic beliefs might approximate the cognitive phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> more closely than knowledge. The main problem with a usable notion <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> is that inference must {{play a critical role in}} what becomes <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> I discuss the nature of conversational inference. It has a number of properties that distinguish it from other inferential systems, such as being apparently abductive and probabilistic, but a precise characterization of it is an unsolved problem.

The changes are described by dynamic logic. To describe knowledge changes, dynamic logic should be combined with logic <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In this paper we describe experiments which we have made about the integration in a unique framework <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> logic and dynamic logic in the proof assistant COQ.
