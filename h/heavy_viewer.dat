40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1994 This study explores {{cognitive}} {{processes involved in}} cultivation by examining recall and meaning of visual images in local television crime news and their relation to concern about crime. Data were gathered through a content analysis, viewing experiment, and survey. The content analysis documented visual patterns found {{in a sample of}} local television crime news in six U. S. cities, and provided data used to construct the study's viewing experiment. Free recall and meanings of visuals were measured in three crime news viewing treatments. The survey measured television exposure (including news and local news), concern about crime (through 15 measures and four indexes), criminal victimization, and general demographic data. A sample of 118 University of Washington students participated in the study. Results show significant differences between <b>heavier</b> and lighter <b>viewers</b> in their constructed meanings of television crime news visuals. The differences appear to be linked to higher concern about crime for the <b>heavier</b> <b>viewers.</b> <b>Heavier</b> news <b>viewers,</b> more often than lighter viewers, interpret crime-specific visuals (i. e. a body on a stretcher) with meanings that go far beyond what is evident in the pictures. Their interpretations also focus on crime. Viewers who remember crime-specific shots are more likely to express greater concern about crime than viewers who recall more general visuals. Results imply that specific content viewing, particularly the visual aspects of television news, play an integral role in cultivation. The findings further our understanding of the cultivation process by suggesting that cognitive differences in visual processing between <b>heavier</b> and lighter <b>viewers</b> contribute to greater concern about crime for <b>heavier</b> <b>viewers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a two-study inquiry into a particular type of consumer socialization: the construction of consumer social reality via exposure to television. In study 1, estimates of the prevalence of products and activities associated with an affluent lifestyle were positively related to the total amount of television respondents watched. The amount of television viewing was shown to function as a mediating variable between the demographic variables income and education and the affluence estimates. In study 2, which consisted of student participants who were either very heavy or very light soap opera <b>viewers,</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>viewers</b> again provided higher estimates of the prevalence of the same types of products and behaviors measured in study 1. In addition, <b>heavy</b> soap opera <b>viewers</b> constructed their estimates significantly faster than light viewers, which suggests that relevant information is more accessible in memory for <b>heavy</b> <b>viewers</b> than light viewers. The results are consistent with heuristic processing strategies, particularly the availability heuristic, in which individuals infer prevalence from the ease of retrieval of relevant examples (Tversky and Kahneman 1973).

It was conducted within a cultivation analysis framework that necessitated {{the collection of}} data {{about the nature of}} television output and about young people's perceptions of aspects of social reality. A detailed review and critique of the cultural indicators research literature identified both its relevance to this research and the limitations of early studies in this area. The main focus of this study was placed on TV drama representation and adolescents' social reality perceptions. The content analysis was used to extract the most frequent occurring of 416 TV male and female characters depicted on TV dramas containing relevant material in informational terms to the perceptions being explored. Audience survey was conducted using questionnaire methodology about their television viewing habits and gender-related perceptions. It obtained data from 962 male and female 10 -to- 19 years-of-age young adolescents in 15 secondary schools of Bangkok. This thesis argues that firstly, the stereotypes of gender-related social attributes, marriage, family or domestic, and occupational roles are evident in TV drama programmes. Secondly, <b>heavy</b> TV <b>viewers</b> adopt TV views of the world in some attributes and roles more than light viewers because of the effect of cumulative exposure to the depictions of gender-related roles. The original contribution to this thesis is based on Gerbner's cultivation indicator project of message system analysis and cultivation analysis. Message system analysis was referred to in order to assess the most representative, stable, and recurrent aggregate patterns of messages to which total communities are exposed over long periods of time.

This point is addressed by Horace Newcomb (1978) who argues that violence is not presented as uniformly on television as the theory assumes; therefore, television cannot be responsible for cultivating the same sense of reality for all viewers. When considering different programs that are on television, it makes sense that scholars would criticize Gerbner's lack of categories.

For years, debates have raged among scholars, politicians, and concerned parents about the effects of media violence on viewers. Too often these debates have descended into simplistic battles between those who claim that media messages directly cause violence and those who argue that activists exaggerate the impact of media exposure altogether. The Mean World Syndrome, based on the groundbreaking work of media scholar George Gerbner, urges us to think about media effects in more nuanced ways. Ranging from Hollywood movies and prime-time dramas to reality programming and the local news, the film examines how media violence forms a pervasive cultural environment that cultivates in <b>heavy</b> <b>viewers,</b> especially, a heightened state of insecurity, exaggerated perceptions of risk and danger, and a fear-driven propensity for hard-line political solutions to social problems. A provocative and accessible introduction to cultivation analysis, media effects research, and the subject of media influence and media violence more generally...|$|R

Seven hundred and eighty-seven non-industrial private forest landowners ??? owners of at least one acre of forestland as determined by geographic information systems (GIS) analysis ??? completed questionnaires measuring media use, environmental concern, attitudes on government regulation, pro-environmental behavior, environmental communication, forest ownership objectives, and land management. In addition to demographics such as age, education, political orientation, income, location of forest, size of acreage, and length of ownership, a fictionalized narrative measure was included to assess the effectiveness of narratives in determining levels of environmental concern. Results indicated that weekly TV viewing was positively correlated with support for private property-related variables, and this was significant using both traditional and narrative measures. Perception of environmental media coverage was also correlated to other measures of environmental attitude. University of Delaware, Department of CommunicationsM. A...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{economic}} {{theory suggests that}} more choice is usually better. We address this claim and investigate whether people can cope with {{the increasing number of}} television programs and watch the amount of TV they find optimal for themselves or whether they are prone to over-consumption. We find that <b>heavy</b> TV <b>viewers</b> do not benefit but instead report lower life satisfaction with access to more TV channels. This finding suggests that an identifiable group of individuals experiences a self-control problem when it comes to TV viewing. ...|$|R
