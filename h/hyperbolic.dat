5|$|Cannon's conjecture: Every Gromov <b>hyperbolic</b> {{group with}} a 2-sphere at {{infinity}} acts geometrically on <b>hyperbolic</b> 3-space.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry. A uniform tiling in the <b>hyperbolic</b> plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the <b>hyperbolic</b> plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E
5|$|A uniform {{honeycomb}} in <b>hyperbolic</b> {{space is}} a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells. In 3-dimensional <b>hyperbolic</b> space {{there are nine}} Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.|$|E
5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely <b>hyperbolic</b> (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely <b>hyperbolic</b> trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four <b>hyperbolic</b> comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} stack of <b>hyperbolic</b> disks where each disk {{represents}} {{the state of the}} universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the <b>hyperbolic</b> disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the <b>hyperbolic</b> plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with <b>hyperbolic</b> orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are <b>hyperbolic</b> due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces {{allow for}} many {{elliptic}} partial differential equations to be formulated {{in a similar}} way, and the Lax–Milgram theorem is then a basic tool in their analysis. With suitable modifications, similar techniques {{can be applied to}} parabolic partial differential equations and certain <b>hyperbolic</b> partial differential equations.|$|E
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} hyperbola, and as such they are called <b>hyperbolic</b> comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around the Sun, to a <b>hyperbolic</b> trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} applications, the {{influence}} {{has also been}} reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, geometric group theory employs geometric concepts, for example {{in the study of}} <b>hyperbolic</b> groups. Further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory.|$|E
5|$|The quasi-isometry {{properties}} of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to <b>hyperbolic</b> space exactly when the subdivision rule is conformal, {{as described in the}} combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem.|$|E
5|$|The Peace Plaza is the {{backdrop}} for the museum. The plaza was designed to allow 50 thousand people to gather around the peace monument in the centre. Tange also designed the monument as an arch composed of two <b>hyperbolic</b> paraboloids, said {{to be based on}} traditional Japanese ceremonial tombs from the Kofun Period.|$|E
25|$|The set of {{compact and}} noncompact <b>hyperbolic</b> Dynkin graphs has been enumerated. All rank 3 <b>hyperbolic</b> graphs are compact. Compact <b>hyperbolic</b> Dynkin {{diagrams}} exist up to rank 5, and noncompact <b>hyperbolic</b> graphs exist up to rank 10.|$|E
25|$|There are {{infinitely}} many <b>hyperbolic</b> Coxeter groups describing reflection {{groups in}} <b>hyperbolic</b> space, notably including the <b>hyperbolic</b> triangle groups.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperbolic</b> sectors are {{the basis}} for the <b>hyperbolic</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|Osin gave {{a version}} of small {{cancellation}} theory for quotiens of relatively <b>hyperbolic</b> groups {{and used it to}} obtain a relatively <b>hyperbolic</b> generalization of Thurston's <b>hyperbolic</b> Dehn surgery theorem.|$|E
25|$|Convex uniform {{honeycombs}} in <b>hyperbolic</b> space - related infinite 4-polytopes in <b>Hyperbolic</b> 3-space.|$|E
25|$|Möbius transformations {{are also}} isometries of the <b>hyperbolic</b> plane, so in <b>hyperbolic</b> {{geometry}} all Apollonian gaskets are congruent. In a sense, there is therefore only one Apollonian gasket, up to (<b>hyperbolic)</b> isometry.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hyperbolic</b> {{angle is}} an {{argument}} of a <b>hyperbolic</b> function just as the circular angle is the argument of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as {{the size of the}} openings of a <b>hyperbolic</b> sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the <b>hyperbolic</b> angle is unbounded. When the circular and <b>hyperbolic</b> functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the <b>hyperbolic</b> functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently, all quadric {{surfaces}} contain circles except parabolic and <b>hyperbolic</b> cylinders and <b>hyperbolic</b> paraboloids.|$|E
25|$|The {{extending}} {{process can}} define a limited series of Coxeter graphs that progress from finite to affine to <b>hyperbolic</b> to Lorentzian. The determinant of the Cartan matrices determine where the series changes from finite (positive) to affine (zero) to <b>hyperbolic</b> (negative), and ending as a Lorentzian group, containing {{at least one}} <b>hyperbolic</b> subgroup. The noncrystalographic Hn groups forms an extended series where H4 is extended as a compact <b>hyperbolic</b> and over-extended into a lorentzian group.|$|E
25|$|Dehn's result {{continues}} to be valid for spherical geometry and <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry. In both of those geometries, two polyhedra that can be cut and reassembled into each other must have the same Dehn invariant. However, as Jessen observed, the extension of Sydler's result to spherical or <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry remains open: {{it is not known}} whether two spherical or <b>hyperbolic</b> polyhedra with the same volume and the same Dehn invariant can always be cut and reassembled into each other. Every <b>hyperbolic</b> manifold with finite volume can be cut along geodesic surfaces into a <b>hyperbolic</b> polyhedron, which necessarily has zero Dehn invariant.|$|E
25|$|Related to {{the subject}} of finite uniform polytopes are uniform {{honeycombs}} in Euclidean and <b>hyperbolic</b> spaces. Euclidean uniform honeycombs are generated by affine Coxeter groups and <b>hyperbolic</b> honeycombs are generated by the <b>hyperbolic</b> Coxeter groups. Two affine Coxeter groups can be multiplied together.|$|E
25|$|The Möbius {{group is}} {{isomorphic}} {{to the group}} of orientation-preserving isometries of <b>hyperbolic</b> 3-space and therefore plays an important role when studying <b>hyperbolic</b> 3-manifolds.|$|E
25|$|Osin used a {{generalization}} of small cancellation theory {{to obtain an}} analog of Thurston's <b>hyperbolic</b> Dehn surgery theorem for relatively <b>hyperbolic</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the concept}} of circles and spheres can be {{extended}} to <b>hyperbolic</b> space, finding the densest packing becomes much more difficult. In a <b>hyperbolic</b> space there is no limit {{to the number of}} spheres that can surround another sphere (for example, Ford circles {{can be thought of as}} an arrangement of identical <b>hyperbolic</b> circles in which each circle is surrounded by an infinite number of other circles). The concept of average density also becomes much more difficult to define accurately. The densest packings in any <b>hyperbolic</b> space are almost always irregular.|$|E
25|$|An {{isomorphism}} of the Möbius {{group with}} the Lorentz group was noted by several authors: Based on previous work of Felix Klein (1893, 1897) on automorphic functions related to <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry and Möbius geometry, Gustav Herglotz (1909) showed that <b>hyperbolic</b> motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a <b>hyperbolic</b> space) transforming the unit sphere into itself correspond to Lorentz transformations, by which Herglotz was able to classify the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, elliptic, <b>hyperbolic</b> and parabolic groups. Other authors include Emil Artin (1957), H. S. M. Coxeter (1965) and by Roger Penrose and Wolfgang Rindler (1984).|$|E
25|$|When in {{standard}} position, a <b>hyperbolic</b> sector {{corresponds to a}} positive <b>hyperbolic</b> angle at the origin, with {{the measure of the}} latter being defined as the area of the former.|$|E
25|$|There are 5 compact <b>hyperbolic</b> Coxeter {{groups of}} rank 5, each {{generating}} uniform honeycombs in <b>hyperbolic</b> 4-space as permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams. There are also 9 paracompact <b>hyperbolic</b> Coxeter groups of rank 5, each generating uniform honeycombs in 4-space as permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams. Paracompact groups generate honeycombs with infinite facets or vertex figures.|$|E
25|$|A {{classical}} theorem of Henri Poincaré constructs Fuchsian {{groups as}} <b>hyperbolic</b> reflection groups generated by reflections in {{the edges of}} a geodesic triangle in the <b>hyperbolic</b> plane for the Poincaré metric. If the triangle has angles π / n'i for positive integers n'i, the triangle is a fundamental domain and naturally a 2-dimensional orbifold. The corresponding group {{is an example of}} a <b>hyperbolic</b> triangle group. Poincaré also gave a 3-dimensional version of this result for Kleinian groups: in this case the Kleinian group Γ is generated by <b>hyperbolic</b> reflections and the orbifold is H3 / Γ.|$|E
25|$|A non-planar {{triangle}} is {{a triangle}} {{which is not}} contained in a (flat) plane. Some examples of non-planar triangles in non-Euclidean geometries are spherical triangles in spherical geometry and <b>hyperbolic</b> triangles in <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} word-hyperbolic and {{relatively}} <b>hyperbolic</b> groups. A particularly important development {{here is the}} work of Sela in 1990s resulting in the solution of the isomorphism problem for word-hyperbolic groups. The notion of a relatively <b>hyperbolic</b> groups was originally introduced by Gromov in 1987 and refined by Farb and Bowditch, in the 1990s. The study of relatively <b>hyperbolic</b> groups gained prominence in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Zeno Rogue's HyperRogue is a roguelike game {{set on the}} <b>hyperbolic</b> plane, {{allowing}} the player to experience many properties of this geometry. Many mechanics, quests, and locations are strongly dependent on the features of <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|Finite and affine {{groups are}} also called {{elliptical}} and parabolic respectively. <b>Hyperbolic</b> groups are also called Lannér, after F. Lannér who enumerated the compact <b>hyperbolic</b> groups in 1950, and Koszul (or quasi-Lannér) for the paracompact groups.|$|E
25|$|When Felix Klein {{wrote his}} book on non-Euclidean {{geometry}} in 1928, he provided a foundation for the subject by reference to projective geometry. To establish <b>hyperbolic</b> measure on a line, {{he noted that the}} area of a <b>hyperbolic</b> sector provided visual illustration of the concept.|$|E
25|$|Hyperbolas {{share many}} of the ellipses' {{analytical}} properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence {{can be made with}} nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as <b>hyperbolic</b> paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids ("wastebaskets"), <b>hyperbolic</b> geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), <b>hyperbolic</b> functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).|$|E
25|$|Coxeter {{used the}} fact that circles of the inversive plane {{represent}} planes of <b>hyperbolic</b> space, and the general homography {{is the product of}} inversions in two or four circles, corresponding to the general <b>hyperbolic</b> displacement which is the product of inversions in two or four planes.|$|E
