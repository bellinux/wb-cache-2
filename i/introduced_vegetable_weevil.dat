40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze {{management}} of group farming on upland fields at vegetable introduction. Therefore, this paper, in Abashiri City, investigates the actual conditions of group farming, and clears a characteristic and correspondence at in-troduction on a vegetable production by group farming. The main conclusions of this paper are the following. First, the characteristic of <b>introducing</b> <b>vegetables</b> on group farming are (1) selection of a list of items, (2) what all farmhouses that take part produce it, (3) two situations of cooperative work and cooperative utilization, and (4) a restriction of area to do planting. Second, a management of group farming at <b>introducing</b> <b>vegetables</b> applies a method against upland field crops. It is possible for Group farming to <b>introduce</b> <b>vegetables</b> by such a method. However, there is possibility that differentials of the vegetables area under cultivation bring about a difficulty for impartiality of a role more than upland fields. In order to solve the problem, it is thought that set up a restriction of a severe vegetable area under cultivation. Third, individual correspondence of a vegetable production is expanded by a small-scale farmhouse, and a principal worker is parents and woman. This is correspondence for that a competition of individual work and cooperative work occurs. The group farming accepts that with a condition that make a cooperative work take priority. By this, a farmhouse can make sure of an income, and the group farming maintains by making sure of cooperative worker...|$|R

The {{main source}} for {{lubricant}} oils is mineral oils, but {{the source of}} mineral oils are depleting {{from day to day}} and it is also a major cause for environmental pollution in the world. This aim of research is to <b>introduce</b> <b>vegetable</b> oil as an alternative source of lubricant oil in industrial applications. In this study, we measured the physical properties of Jatropha, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and empty fruit bunches. All experiment were done according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) condition, method B and with the use of four-ball tribotester, CCD camera, microscope and viscometer to obtain results. The test oils were measured of their coefficient of friction, wear, viscosity and flash temperature parameter. To evaluate the results, the same conditions were applied for all experiments with the use of engine and hydraulic mineral oil. The results showed that the anti-friction ability of Jatropha oil and PFAD was higher than the engine and hydraulic mineral oils...|$|R
40|$|Cucurbit crops host a {{range of}} serious sap-sucking insect pests, {{including}} silverleaf whitefly (SLW) and aphids, which potentially represent considerable risk to the Australian horticulture industry. These pests are extremely polyphagous with a wide host range. Chemical control is made difficult due to resistance and pollution, and other side-effects are associated with insecticide use. Consequently, there is much interest in maximising the role of biological control {{in the management of}} these sap-sucking insect pests. This study aimed to evaluate companion cropping alongside cucurbit crops in a tropical setting as a means to increase the populations of beneficial insects and spiders so as to control the major sap-sucking insect pests. The Population of beneficial and harmful insects, with a focus on SLW and aphids, and other invertebrates were sampled weekly oil four different crops which could be used for habitat manipulation: Goodbug Mix (GBM; a proprietary seed Mixture including self-sowing annual and perennial herbaceous flower species); lablab (Lablab purpureus L. Sweet); lucerne (Medicago sativa L.); and niger (Guizotia abyssinica (L. f.) Cass.). Lablab hosted the highest numbers of beneficial insects (larvae and adults of lacewing (Mallada signata (Schneider)), ladybird beetles (Coccinella transversalis Fabricius) and spiders) while GBM hosted the highest numbers of European bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) and spiders. Lucerne and niger showed little promise in hosting beneficial insects, but lucerne hosted significantly more spiders (double the numbers) than niger. Lucerne hosted significantly more of the harmful insect species of aphids (Aphis gossypii (Glover)) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer)) and heliothis (Heliothis armigera Hubner). Niger hosted significantly more <b>vegetable</b> <b>weevils</b> (Listroderes difficillis (Germar)) than the other three species. Therefore, lablab and GBM appear to be viable options to grow within cucurbits or as field boundary crops to attract and increase beneficial insects and spiders for the control of sap-sucking insect pests. Use of these bio-control strategies affords the opportunity to minimise pesticide usage and the risks associated with pollution...|$|R

25|$|Along {{with the}} Italian queen Bona Sforza (second wife of Sigismund I of Poland) many Italian cooks came to Poland after 1518.

The properties of these oils can be compared favorably with the characteristics required for internal combustion engine fuels. Fuel-related properties are reviewed and compared with those of conventional diesel fuel. Peak pressure development, heat release rate analysis, and vibration analysis of the engine are discussed in relation with the use of bio-diesel and conventional diesel fuel. Optimization of alkali-catalyzed transesterification of Pungamia pinnata oil for the production of bio-diesel is discussed. Use of bio-diesel in a conventional diesel engine results in substantial reduction in unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matters (PM) emission and oxide of nitrogen.
