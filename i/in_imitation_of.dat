5|$|After 1261, {{new church}} {{architecture}} in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches, {{such as the}} Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, {{and as a result}} the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs. This effect may have been <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the earlier triple-church Pantokrator monastic complex.|$|E
5|$|Spirituals were {{primarily}} expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations. In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, spirituals spread out of the U.S. South. In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country. <b>In</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> this group, gospel quartets arose, followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th-century rise of jackleg and singing preachers, from whence came the popular style of gospel music.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the sky. It was {{reported}} in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
50|$|In {{his works}} at Cambridge (except for the altarpiece at King's College), Essex used the Italianate style {{which he had}} learnt from Burrough; but he was an admirer of the then despised Gothic style, and was a pioneer {{professional}} architect <b>in</b> <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> medieval English architecture.|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (<b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had {{motivated}} Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic {{objects such as}} brooches, crowns or buckles, <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E
5|$|Potter had {{maintained}} {{contact with her}} last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish. Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901.|$|E

The Vincennes porcelain factory continued until 1756, when the production was transferred to new buildings at Sèvres, initiating the career of world-famous Sèvres porcelain.|$|R

5|$|The Eraser cover art {{was created}} by {{longtime}} Radiohead artist Stanley Donwood. The artwork, a linocut titled London Views, depicts a figure standing before London destroyed by flood <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> King Canute failing to command the ocean. It {{was inspired by the}} 2004 Boscastle flood and an article by the environmentalist Jonathan Porritt comparing the British government's attitude to climate change to the Canute legend. The album is packaged as a single large foldout containing the CD; Donwood and Yorke wanted to avoid using plastic.|$|E
5|$|When a Catholic {{priest is}} burnt {{at the stake}} in Lander, Wyoming, private investigative {{organisation}} the Millennium Group despatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Ardis Cohen (Lindsay Crouse) who had previously worked together on a case involving the murders of three clerics several years earlier. Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> another ritual torture. At {{the scene of the}} drowning, two wedding rings are found—a man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of Sasanian rule, a number of buffer states existed between the empires. These were absorbed by the central state over time, and by the 7th century the last buffer state, the Arab Lakhmids, was annexed to the Sasanian Empire. Frye notes that in the 3rd centuryAD such client states {{played an important role}} in RomanSasanian relations, but both empires gradually replaced them by an organized defense system run by the central government and based on a line of fortifications (the limes) and the fortified frontier cities, such as Dara. Towards the end of the 1st centuryAD, Rome organized the protection of its eastern frontiers through the limes system, which lasted until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century after improvements by Diocletian. Like the Romans, the Sasanians constructed defensive walls opposite the territory of their opponents. According to R. N. Frye, it was under Shapur II that the Persian system was extended, probably <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Diocletian's construction of the limes of the Syrian and Mesopotamian frontiers of the Roman Empire. The Roman and Persian border units were known as limitanei and marzobans, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} the {{coronation}} has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 {{and may have been}} intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised. HaroldII was crowned on the day {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, WilliamI, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25December 1066, but three weeks since the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. EdwardI was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. EdwardII's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. HenryVI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost, WilliamI's on Christmas Day, possibly <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine emperors, and John's was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a disabled state at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena <b>in</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a noose around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the Batavian Republic Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors. Lucas did not survive to see {{the conclusion of the}} trial, dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797, but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797.|$|E
