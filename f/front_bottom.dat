5|$|The {{skull of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{is low and}} narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla {{compared}} to those of Tanystropheus. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla meet at the anteroventral (<b>front</b> <b>bottom)</b> corner {{and contribute to the}} border of the nostril, which is located at the anterior (front) end of a long recess that extends along the snout in front of the eye socket (the antorbital depression). The bottom margins of the two snout bones are respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw has fifteen preserved teeth, with three of them being fang-like. By comparison, the teeth in adult Tanystropheus are sharp pegs, while they are tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.|$|E

Prior to the [...] "Eurowhite" [...] livery, Air France aircraft had a bare-metal underside, extending up to a blue cheat-line that ran across the cabin windows. Above the cheat-line the fuselage was again white, with Air France titles and a French flag. The tail was white with two thick blue lines, which tapered {{from the rear of the}} tail and met at point towards the <b>front</b> <b>bottom.</b> This basic livery, with minor variations, would appear on all post-war Air France aircraft until the late 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Multiple jugals {{are known}} from Europasaurus, {{which are more}} similar in {{morphology}} to basal sauropodomorphs than other macronarians. It forms part of {{the border of the}} orbit, infratemporal fenestra and the bottom edge of the skull, but does not reach the antorbital fenestra. The posterior process of the jugal are very fragile and narrow, showing a bone scar from the articulation with the quadratojugal. There are two prominences projecting {{from the back of the}} jugal body, which diverge at 75ยบ and form the bottom and front edges of the infratemporal fenestra. Like in Riojasaurus and Massospondylus, two non-sauropod sauropodomorphs, the jugal forms a large part of the orbit edge, from the back to the <b>front</b> <b>bottom</b> corner. This feature has been seen in embryos of titanosaurs, but no adult individuals. The quadratojugal bone is an elongate element that has two projecting arms, one anterior and one dorsal. Like in other sauropods, the anterior process is longer than the dorsal, but in Europasaurus the arms are more similar lengths. The horizontal process is parallel to the tooth row of Europasaurus, similar to in Camarasaurus but unlike in Giraffatitan and Abydosaurus. There is a prominent ventral flange on the anterior arm of the bone, which is a possibly synapomorphy of Brachiosauridae, although it is also found in some Camarasaurus individuals. The two quadratojugal processes diverge at a nearly right angle (90ยบ), although the dorsal process curves as it follows the shape of the quadrate. Squamosals found from Europasaurus show the same approximate shape in lateral view as Camarasaurus, ...|$|E

50|$|Crossing a crest or ridge-line is a {{dangerous}} manoeuvre for AFVs, as they are particularly exposed to enemy fire while silhouetted against the sky (sky-lined). While cresting a steep slope, the thin armour on the <b>front</b> <b>bottom</b> of a tank's hull (below the thick glacis plate) can be exposed to fire. After cresting, the thin top armour may be exposed while it moves down the forward slope.
