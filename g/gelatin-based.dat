50|$|One {{feature of}} SX-70 {{integral}} print film {{is its ability}} to be manipulated while developing, and for some days after. Because the emulsion is <b>gelatin-based,</b> and the Mylar covering does not allow water vapor to readily pass, the emulsion stays soft for several days, allowing artists to press and manipulate the emulsion to produce effects somewhat like impressionist paintings. An example of this technique was used on the cover of Peter Gabriel's third album, Peter Gabriel.

5000|$|Jellies and gums:Jellies and gums are thick {{liquid sugar}} candies. [...] Gums, such as wine gums, are drier than jellies. They {{are made from}} sugar syrup plus a gelling agent. They are cooked to the lowest {{temperature}} of all sugar candies and consequently have the highest water content of sugar candies, about 20 to 25% water. Their stiffness depends on the type and amount of gelling agent, the final concentration, the pH of the product, and other factors. The most popular forms of gelling agent are gelatin, agar-agar, starch (more typical of American jelly candies), and pectin (more typical of European candies). These produce different effects. For example, starch produces cloudy jellies, while high-methoxyl pectin produces clear ones. Agar-based jellies are harder to dissolve, and <b>gelatin-based</b> jellies have a more rubbery texture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cell {{assembly}} technology {{adopting the}} <b>gelatin-based</b> composite materials has found broad application {{in the field}} of disease mechanism research, drug development and organ reconstruction etc. But there are still several troublesome problems, such as the necessaries of high forming concentration of <b>gelatin-based</b> materials and the cell damage produced during extrusion. In view of existing situation, a modified <b>gelatin-based</b> cell assembling process using glycerin was brought forward. The results showed that adding 10 % (v/v) glycerin to the existing <b>gelatin-based</b> composite materials, the cells inactivation effect under 4 ℃ or lower temperature environment can be reduced obviously, meanwhile, the glycerin has a compensatory effect of gelatin. It can significantly improve the forming temperature and the cell survival rate, get high cell survival rate even when the scanning speed is on 40 mm/s. In addition, the glycerin is easier to dissolve in culture medium in the tissue analog training process; it is more conducive to the rapid materials degradation, as well as cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, modified <b>gelatin-based</b> cell assembly process with glycerin will be more widely used in tissue or organ in vitro assembly process...|$|E
40|$|Identification of Salmonella serotypes {{is based}} on flagellar and somatic antigens. The absence of flagella may {{consequently}} affect complete identification of the serotype; here it is shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium exhibits morphological differences dependent on the peptone constituents of the culture medium. Aflagellate salmonella were produced in certain media where the nutritional ingredient was casein-based peptone or <b>gelatin-based</b> peptone; in <b>gelatin-based</b> peptone, aggregates of salmonella were observed. However, in media containing soy-based peptone as the primary nutrient, salmonella displayed a normal flagellated morphology. Transfer of aflagellate salmonella from nutritionally poor media, with casein- or <b>gelatin-based</b> peptone, into rich nutrient broth allowed flagella synthesis, indicating that the aflagellate form is still able to produce flagella. Amino acid sequencing of the peptones producing aflagellate organisms showed a relatively low tyrosine concentration: only 0 · 03 ± 0 · 01  g l− 1 for <b>gelatin-based</b> buffered peptone water, compared to 0 · 21 ± 0 · 01 for soy-based buffered peptone water. Tyrosine is essential for flagellin, which is the subunit of the salmonella flagellar filament. The addition of 200  μM tyrosine to casein-based peptone media produced flagellate salmonella; 2  mM glucose was needed in addition to tyrosine to achieve a similar morphology in <b>gelatin-based</b> media. Therefore, culture media containing less than 1 · 20  g tyrosine l− 1, and of limited carbohydrate source, when used for serological testing of clinical isolates, may result in an incomplete serological identification...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of a composite vascular graft constituting polyurethane (PU) and gelatin to support cell growth was investigated using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). <b>Gelatin-based</b> polyurethane grafts were fabricated by co-spraying polyurethane and gelatin using a spray, phase-inversion technique. Graft microstructure was investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to assess the grafts' mechanical properties in longitudinal and circumferential directions. hMSCs obtained from bone marrow aspirate were seeded onto flat graft samples. After 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation, cell morphology was evaluated by Giemsa staining and cell viability was calculated by XTT assay. SEM analysis evidenced that PU samples display a microporous structure, whereas the <b>gelatin-based</b> PU samples show a fibrillar appearance. The presence of cross-linked gelatin produced a significant increase of ultimate tensile strength and ultimate elongation in circumferential directions compared to PU material. Qualitative analysis of hMSC adhesion onto the grafts revealed remarkable differences between <b>gelatin-based</b> PU and control graft. hMSCs grown onto <b>gelatin-based</b> PU graft form a monolayer that reached confluence at 72 h, whereas cells seeded onto the control graft {{were not able to}} undergo appropriate spreading. hMSCs grown onto <b>gelatin-based</b> PU graft showed significantly higher viability than cells seeded onto bare PU at all time points. In conclusion, a composite vascular graft was successfully manufactured by simultaneous co-spraying of a synthetic polymer and a protein to obtain a scaffold that combines the mechanical characteristics of polyurethanes with the favorable cell interaction features of gelatin...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the effect of Thunnus obesus skin <b>gelatin-based</b> EC containing Codium spp. or Fucus vesiculosus extracts on raw tuna preservation. Three <b>gelatin-based</b> EC (gelatin (5 %) + glycerol (25 %); gelatin (5 %) + Codium spp. (1 %) + glycerol (25 %); gelatin (5 %) + Fucus vesiculosus (1 %) + glycerol (25 %)) were applied directly {{on the surface of}} tuna fillets. Functional properties of gelatin and <b>gelatin-based</b> EC containing seaweed extracts were also studied. The gelatin was extracted by an acid-swelling process in the presence/absence of pepsin, followed by subsequent heating/refrigeration, after a pre-treatment with NaOH. The type of acid, temperature and concentration of NaOH greatly influence the process yield. The higher extraction yield was achieved using acetic acid in the presence of pepsin by subsequent refrigeration, especially when skins were previously treated with NaOH (0. 2 M). Tuna quality was assessed over 12 days of storage at 4 ± 1 °C in terms of chemical and microbial indices. Results showed that tuna skin <b>gelatin-based</b> EC avoids tuna deterioration.

After the incorporation of low levels of ZnO NR fillers, significant differences were observed in the film properties, particularly in electrical, mechanical, and UV protection activities.
