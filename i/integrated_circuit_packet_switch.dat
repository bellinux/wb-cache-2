40|$|We study {{a scheme}} for {{approximate}} calculation of mean end-to-end packet delay {{in a network}} that <b>integrates</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> and <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> traffic, using the movable boundary traffic integration scheme on each link. Numerical results obtained from the approximation are compared with simulation results. We analyse the discrepancies between the simulation and the approximation. The analysis reveals an important phenomenon that occurs when <b>packets</b> and <b>circuits</b> are <b>integrated</b> in a network. When a link is shared between <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> and <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> traffic, using the movable boundary scheme, then the packet departure process is burstier than Poisson. In a network of such links, at light circuit switched loads, the active calls occupy multiple hops, hence bursts of packets departing from a link {{are likely to find}} the next link available. Thus at light circuit loads there is a positive correlation between packet bursts and link availability, yielding packet delays less than what would be expected on the grounds of burstiness, and causing the Poisson process based approximation to overestimate mean packet delay. At higher circuit loads the active circuits occupy fewer hops, and the correlation is diminished; the Poisson approximation then underestimates the delay of the bursty packet arrivals...|$|R

One approach to reduce the {{energy consumption}} of the data center is to use on-chip data centers, which are <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> chips that perform the tasks in a data center. On-chip data centers are constructed of cores and the network between cores. Because the tasks in the data center are performed by the cooperation between servers, the network between cores in the on-chip data center may have a large impact {{on the performance of}} the chip. In this paper, we investigate the network structures for the on-chip data centers.

40|$|Techniques were {{examined}} that trade communication bandwidth for decreased transmission delays. When {{the network is}} lightly used, these schemes attempt to use additional network resources to decrease communication delays. As the network utilization rises, the schemes degrade gracefully, still providing service but with minimal use of the network.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the routing problem for traffic restoration after a failure in a virtual <b>circuit</b> <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> wide area network. We assume source node routing of virtual circuits. A major factor on network performance after a failure is the transient congestion period that results from restored virtual circuits attempting to send out the backlog of packets accumulated for retransmission since the failure. Standard routing algorithms based on minimizing the steady state network delay may not be appropriate for rerouting the calls after a failure, {{in view of the}} transient congestion resulting from the packet backlog. Here we study alternative routing schemes to control the congestion after a failure. One approach is to use Minimum Hop routing to restore connections {{in order to ensure that}} the number of nodes directly effected by the rerouting is limited to a minimum.
