5000|$|Fisher was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} stereo receivers with Four Channels. These innovations were brief and occurred in the Mid-1970's which some consider The Second Golden Age of High Fidelity. Like many new concepts of the time such as Beta Format and VHS, there were two competing four channel formats. One was CD-4 and the other was SQ. Neither was successful as the purist found separation from highly defined loudspeakers and low distortion receivers and amplifiers. At the time the concept of a sub-woofer was in its infancy. Now, it is common to see 5+1 systems which had their heritage in the [...] "confrontation" [...] of <b>four-channel</b> and <b>stereo</b> high fidelity coupled with a sub woofer.|$|R

50|$|The {{story was}} {{prepared}} in two formats: the ninety-minute version and a four-part version, the latter designed for international distribution or repeat broadcasting {{in the ordinary}} series run. The episode breaks were, respectively: Sarah falling down the slope; the Cybermen placing their bomb outside the TARDIS while Susan and Turlough watch; and the Master appearing behind the First Doctor and Tegan while in the Dark Tower. This is the only programme from the classic series of Doctor Who for which all recorded and filmed material, including alternate and unused takes, fluffed scenes and so forth, still exists in broadcast-quality format. This allowed {{for the creation of}} the 1995 version of the story. The Five Doctors was recorded in <b>four-channel</b> <b>stereo,</b> but broadcast in mono. The later DVD releases had a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.|$|E
