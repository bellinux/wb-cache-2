5|$|O'Neill founded O'Neill Communications in Princeton in 1986. He {{introduced}} his Local Area Wireless Networking, or LAWN, {{system at the}} PC Expo in New York in 1989. The LAWN system allowed two computers to exchange messages over a range of a couple hundred <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> {{a cost of about}} $500 per node. O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.|$|E
40|$|Place kicking {{accuracy}} has {{a significant}} impact rugby match outcomes. This project investigated the variability of the kicking leg kinematics and the consistency on the stance and kicking <b>foot</b> positions <b>at</b> ball contact {{in a group of}} seven highly proficiency kickers. Kinematic data were collected using a high speed motion capture system (500 Hz) during six simulated attempts on goal. Movement variability was assessed using Normalised Root Mean Square of the swing leg pelvis, hip and knee kinematics, and the standard deviation of the stance <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> opposite plant and kicking <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> ball contact (BC). Results suggest a strong relationship between stance foot placement, swing leg movement variability and the orientation of the kicking <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> BC. This pilot study highlighted the importance of movement variability in determining consistent <b>foot</b> placement <b>at</b> BC in place kicking...|$|R

5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval {{was described as}} Wisden as {{the best of the}} year. He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Madre de Deus entered Dartmouth harbor on 7 September, {{towering over}} the other ships and the town's small houses as it sailed by. The only vessel {{guarding}} the great ship was Roebuck, as the other vessels had slipped off to Portsmouth to sell {{off some of the}} plunder. Nothing like Madre had ever been seen in England - the frame from the beakhead to the stern was 165 feet long. The breadth at the broadest deck, was just over 46 feet and her draft was twenty-six <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> her arrival in Dartmouth. Her several decks; consisted of a main orlop, three main decks, and a forecastle and a spar deck of two floors each. The length of the keel was 100 feet, the main-mast was 121 feet, and its circumference at the partners was just over ten feet. The main-yard was 106 feet long.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 1941 Cunningham nearly added a third. The Germans {{attacked}} Cardiff in the city's heaviest raid of the war. Cunningham engaged an He 111 {{with an even}} {{spread of}} three aerial masts along its rear fuselage—indicative of a pathfinder. He expended all the Beaufighter's ammunition against it from the working cannons—one cannon jammed. It dived into clouds at 10,000 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> an angle of 50 degrees. A 2./KGr 100 machine returned to France with a wounded gunner and Cunningham received credit for a probable victory. On 12 January he claimed a damaged He 111—his first with operator Jimmy Rawnsley. Cunningham was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 28 January 1941 for his achievements, including 25 night sorties.|$|E

The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the Brooklyn Bridge. During the bridge of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing on her <b>feet.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the video, the band meet up and walk to the beach where they walk into the sea. The final shot shows the band walking in the sea as the video fades out.|$|E
5|$|The AI sets {{added to}} Beaufighters {{were the first}} to be mass-produced. The {{operating}} frequency was 190 to 195 MHz with a wavelength of 1.5 metres. The equipment consisted of a receiver, transmitter, control panel, modulator, indicator unit and a system of fixed dipole aerials. On the nose the aerial was a double arrowhead shape with a pair of azimuth aerials protruding above and below the leading edge of each wing between the cannon and the wingtip. A pair of elevation aerials were located above and below the wing surfaces near the RAF roundel on the starboard side. The indicator display consisted of two cathode ray tubes. They displayed elevation and azimuth bearing. The set had a range-limitation of four miles (circa 20,000 feet). The minimum range of detection was usually around 400 <b>feet.</b> <b>At</b> closer ranges the target merged with the transmission pulse and was obscured. At altitudes below 1,000 feet, the returns from ground objects would swamp the tubes. Operators like Rawnsley were left to do a fair amount of guesswork. No scales or calibration markings were put on early sets. The position and heading of the enemy in the azimuth plane, its height, and its range had to be guessed. At least the GCI could bring the Beaufighter well within range of the target, usually a mile or so behind the bomber.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their <b>feet.</b> <b>At</b> first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E

25|$|August 15–17, 1915: A {{hurricane}} made landfall {{just west}} of Galveston. Gales howled throughout Cameron and Vermilion Parishes and as far east as Mobile. It produced storm surge of 11 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> Cameron (called Leesburg at the time), 10 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> Grand Cheniere, and 9.5 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> Marsh Island; Grand Isle reported water 6 feet deep across the city. The lightkeeper at the Sabine Pass lighthouse had to turn the lens by hand, as vibrations caused by the wave action put the clockwork out of order. At Sabine Bank, 17 miles offshore the Mouth of the Sabine, damage was noted. Damage estimates for Louisiana and Texas totaled around $50 million.|$|E

25|$|Faldo won {{his second}} major {{championship}} at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo's {{final round of}} 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him {{to get into a}} playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. On the back nine, Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> the 13th, 5 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> the 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> the 17th. On the first hole of the ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot birdie putt to win the tournament.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Diabetic foot ulcers and amputations are preventable. Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the distribution of categories of <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> risk in patients with diabetes, attending a tertiary care hospital and factors that affect it. Materials and Methods: Detail history and examination including neurological and vascular assessment were performed in 100 patients with diabetes attending a Tertiary Care Hospital. <b>Foot</b> <b>at</b> risk was classified according to the task force of foot care interest Group of American Diabetes Association. Category of <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> risk was correlated with demographic and clinical features. Results: Fifty-two percent patients had <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> risk-category 1 and 2. Loss of protective sensation (LOPS) was present in 33 % (category 1). Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was present in 19 % (category 2). Both LOPS and PAD were present in 10 % patients. 95 % had never received foot care advice by health professionals, let alone prescriptive footwear or vascular consultation. Conclusions: This study brings forth that <b>foot</b> <b>at</b> risk of ulcer is rampant in patients with diabetes. There are lacunae in diabetic <b>foot</b> care <b>at</b> all levels of care. With the increase in diabetes, cost effective steps are required to improve foot care among diabetes in India. Considering the demographic profile of patients in our study, growing number of patients with diabetes, lack of time and staff allocated for foot care in our setup, audiovisual aids seems a good option to spread foot care awareness among diabetes...|$|R
