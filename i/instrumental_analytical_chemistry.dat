40|$|Just as {{with any}} other {{analytical}} technology, measurement of gene expression with cDNA or oligonucleotide arrays have measurement errors. It is commonly observed (e. g. Chen, Dougherty, and Bittner 1997) that the standard deviation of measurements rises proportional to the expression level. However, this proportionality cannot continue down to genes that are entirely unexpressed because that would imply zero measurement error, which is not observed.

40|$|The {{success of}} modern methods in <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{sometimes}} obscures {{the problem that}} the ever increasing amount of analytical data does not necessarily give more insight of practical relevance. As alternative approaches, toxicity- and bioactivity-based assays can deliver valuable information about biological effects of complex materials in humans, other species or even ecosystems. However, the observed effects often cannot be clearly assigned to specific chemical compounds. In these cases, {{the establishment of an}} unambiguous cause-effect relationship is not possible. Effect-directed analysis tries to interconnect <b>instrumental</b> <b>analytical</b> techniques with a biological/biochemical entity, which identifies or isolates substances of biological relevance. Successful application has been demonstrated in many fields, either as proof-of-principle studies or even for complex samples. This review discusses the different approaches, advantages and limitations and finally shows some practical examples. The broad emergence of effect-directed analytical concepts might lead to a true paradigm shift in <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry,</b> away from ever growing lists of chemical compounds. The connection of biological effects with the identification and quantification of molecular entities leads to relevant answers to many real life questions...|$|R

40|$|This book is {{dedicated}} to celebrate the 60 th birthday of Professor Rainer Huopalahti. Professor Rainer “Repe” Huopalahti has had, and in fact is still enjoying a distinguished career {{in the analysis of}} food and food related flavor compounds. One will find it hard to make any progress in this particular field without a valid and innovative sample handling technique and this is a field in which Professor Huopalahti has made great contributions. The title and the front cover of this book honors Professor Huopahti’s early steps in science. His PhD thesis which was published on 1985 is entitled “Composition and content of aroma compounds in the dill herb, Anethum graveolens L., affected by different factors”. At that time, the thesis introduced new technology being applied to sample handling and analysis of flavoring compounds of dill. Sample handling is an essential task that in just about every analysis. If one is working with minor compounds in a sample or trying to detect trace levels of the analytes, one of the aims of sample handling may be to increase the sensitivity of the analytical method. On the other hand, if one is working with a challenging matrix such as the kind found in biological samples, one of the aims is to increase the selectivity. However, quite often the aim is to increase both the selectivity and the sensitivity. This book provides good and representative examples about the necessity of valid sample handling {{and the role of the}} sample handling in the analytical method. The contributors of the book are leading Finnish scientists on the field of organic <b>instrumental</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Some of them are also Repe’ s personal friends and former students from the University of Turku, Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry. Importantly, the authors all know Repe in one way or another and are well aware of his achievements on the field of analytical chemistry. The editorial team had a great time during the planning phase and during the “hard work editorial phase” of the book. For example, we came up with many ideas on how to publish the book. After many long discussions, we decided to have a limited edition as an “old school hard cover book” – and to acknowledge more modern ways of disseminating knowledge by publishing an internet version of the book on the webpages of the University of Turku. Downloading the book from the webpage for personal use is free of charge. We believe and hope that the book will be read with great interest by scientists working in the fascinating field of organic <b>instrumental</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry.</b> We decided to publish our book in English for two main reasons. First, we believe that in the near future, more and more teaching in Finnish Universities will be delivered in English. To facilitate this process and encourage students to develop good language skills, it was decided to be published the book in English. Secondly, we believe that the book will also interest scientists outside Finland – particularly in the other member states of the European Union. The editorial team thanks all the authors for their willingness to contribute to this book – and to adhere to the very strict schedule. We also want to thank the various individuals and enterprises who financially supported the book project. Without that support, it would not have been possible to publish the hardcover book...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Least square linear {{regression}} {{is widely used}} in <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry.</b> In practice a linear relationship between substance content and measured value still has been assumed based on the correlation coefficient criterion, although not recommended. Textbooks provide the necessary formulas for the fitting process, {{based on the assumption}} that there is no error in the independent variable. In practice the ordinary least squares (OLS) textbook procedure is used even when the previously stated assumptions are not strictly fulfilled. In this paper, how to validate the calibration function is dealt with in detail using as an example based on measurements obtained for cadmium determination by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). Assessing uncertainties related to linear calibration curves is also discussed. Considering uncertainties of weights and volumetric equipment and <b>instrumental</b> <b>analytical</b> signal it is observed that the most important factor that contributes to the final uncertainty is the uncertainty of the calibration function...|$|R
