5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E
5|$|Visits to one {{hospital}} that was experienced {{in addressing the}} health problems of drug addicts left Hope <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being experimented on, {{so he went to}} another, St. Clare's. Here, according to his wife, the treatment was not adjusted for the methadone program he was on, putting added strain on his heart. Hope was hospitalized with pneumonia in 1967 and died a few weeks later, on May 19, of heart failure. His wife was aged 31 {{at the time of his}} death. They had three children; their daughter, Monica Hope, became a singer.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{eventually}} bowled England out for 441, {{leaving them}} {{a target of}} 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.|$|E

50|$|The song is a ballad {{in which}} the narrator {{reflects}} on {{his life as a}} troubadour, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> content with what he has accomplished ("I was a young troubadour when I rode in on a song / I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone").|$|R
5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka extermination camp to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to understand his character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E

25|$|When Joe Hooker {{was removed}} from command of the army on June 28, Slocum, as the ranking corps commander, would {{normally}} be in line to succeed him, but the War Department instead appointed George Meade as army commander, apparently <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a more aggressive fighter. Slocum graciously consented to serving under Meade, his junior in rank.|$|E

25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me.

25|$|De Gaulle {{outlined}} a programme of further nationalisations {{and a new}} economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20% reduction in the military budget. Refusing to 'rule by compromise', de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together. Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it {{was little more than}} a stop-gap measure.|$|E
25|$|When the Second World War broke out, Lee {{volunteered to}} fight for the Finnish forces during the Winter War in 1939. He and other British volunteers were kept away from actual fighting, but they were issued winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe {{distance}} from the front lines. After a fortnight, they returned home. Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator. When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard. In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force.|$|E

Analog stated [...] "Of all the commissioned sequels, Wolfgang Diehr’s most captures {{the voice of}} H. Beam Piper.

[...] "His feelings appeared to be strongly enlisted in what he said.

500|$|Guy Hamilton {{was asked}} to direct again, but {{declined}} <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "drained of ideas... I had nothing to contribute until I'd recharged batteries"; Terence Young returned to direct after the hiatus of Goldfinger. Richard Maibaum's original script from 1961 {{was used as the}} basis of the script, which he then re-drafted, with further revisions by John Hopkins. Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965, and moved to Nassau on 22 March, before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May.|$|E
500|$|Chrisye {{approached}} Addie MS, a young composer, {{and asked}} him to help with the next album. Addie, despite <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not in the same class as Djarot and Jockie, accepted, and [...] suggested using similar melodies as in [...] "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" [...] and Badai Pasti Berlalu. The resulting album, Sendiri (Alone), with songs by Guruh and Junaidi Salat, included harps, oboes, cor anglais, and a string section. Spawning three singles, the album sold well and earned Chrisye his first BASF Award.|$|E

Faced with such a scene, Lockhart (Tracy Letts) declares that the United States is accepting Haqqani's terms for the prisoner exchange.|$|R
500|$|Aside from Valiente's autobiography, The Rebirth of Witchcraft, {{the first}} {{published}} biography of Valiente {{was written by}} Jonathan Tapsell and published as Ameth: The Life and Times of Doreen Valiente by Avalonia Books in 2013. Doyle White characterised this volume as being [...] "all-too-brief". Belham-Payne initially considered writing a biography of Valiente, but <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not academically qualified to do so, he commissioned Heselton — who had previously published several books on Gardner — to do so, publishing the result as Doreen Valiente: Witch through his Doreen Valiente Foundation in 2016. It held its launch party at the esoteric-themed bookstore, Treadwell's, in central London, in February 2016, shortly after Belham-Payne's death.|$|E
500|$|Producer Harve Bennett was {{exhausted}} by {{his work on}} the previous three Star Trek films and wanted to move on, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not part of the Star Trek [...] "family" [...] and that he had been mistreated by Nimoy. When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly answer the question of God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film had the feeling of a tone poem rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.|$|E
500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just had a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount}} of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Repressed {{anger in}} {{individuals}} and social groups who espouse beliefs that threaten or endanger {{the freedom of}} others are central themes in Drever's work.

40|$|The Monday {{morning edition}} of the French left {{magazine}} Libération featured a triumphant François Hollande alongside the headline “Normal!” to the bewilderment of many journalists outside France. Catherine Fieschi argues that “Normal!” perfectly captures {{the feeling of the}} left in France that Hollande’s victory does not mark a revolution in French politics, and reflects their <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> more than capable of a competent and quietly confident presidency...|$|R

500|$|Oliver {{initially}} had a [...] "friendly rivalry" [...] with sister Penny. Catherwood {{believes they}} always had [...] "a really good relationship". She characterised the siblings' relationship as [...] "one of constant rivalry but ultimately unconditional support", and noted, [...] "Everything always comes more easily to Oliver than Penny – she has spent her life playing catch up". When Penny considered giving her career up over a patient she was romantically involved with, {{in order to protect}} her, Oliver ruined the romance. Their relationship remained unaffected by this: Catherwood revealed, [...] "Well they are brother and sister, so you forgive your family for enormous amounts. So it doesn't affect their relationship, if anything he is there as soon as she breaks down he's there to catch her, full of apologies and support." [...] She said the situation would bring them closer together, because it is a typical scenario siblings go through. When Catherwood quit the series, Penny was killed whilst attempting to rescue a patient from a train crash. Her death was not shown on-screen: a conscious decision made by the production team to fully focus on Oliver's story. Series producer Myar Craig Brown revealed that the big focus would be on the effect it had on Oliver. Forced {{to come to terms with}} her death, he faced an [...] "emotional rollercoaster of <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> second best to her".|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
500|$|Like most newspapers, the Daily News prospered during World War II. Its {{readership}} {{peaked in}} 1947, when an average 300,000copies per day were sold. In both absolute and relative terms, however, it was falling {{further and further}} behind the other Los Angeles dailies. In addition, Boddy, who was now past sixty, was losing interest {{in the management of}} the paper. In 1950, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> repeating himself in print, Boddy sought the Democratic nomination for United States Senate. Boddy was tapped to enter the race when incumbent Sheridan Downey dropped out during the primary. Democratic establishment figures distrusted the remaining major Democratic candidate, liberal Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, and feared that a Douglas victory would hand the election to the likely Republican candidate, Representative Richard M. Nixon. Daily News staffers believed that Boddy was abandoning his journalistic integrity in running. Boddy ran in both major party primaries, a practice known as [...] "cross filing." [...] His campaign was ineffective, and he finished a distant second in each primary. [...] During the campaign, he dubbed the leftist Douglas as [...] "the pink lady" [...] in the Daily News, a nickname which was reused by the Nixon campaign in the general election. Just before the primary, when Nixon, who along with Douglas had also cross-filed, sent out election materials which did not mention that he was a Republican, an ad appeared in the Daily News from the hitherto-unknown [...] "Veterans Democratic Committee". The advertisement accused Nixon of masquerading as a Democrat, and dubbed him [...] "Tricky Dick"—the first appearance of that Nixon moniker. Nixon {{went on to win the}} general election in a landslide.|$|E
