25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side. In this method the diver is usually face down to upright, and sweeps the right <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> the waist from left to right, around to the back, {{in contact with the}} body or scuba set, and round as far back as {{possible}} against the cylinder, the straightens the arm backwards and swings it around outwards and forwards in an arc until it is pointing forwards. This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand can find it by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E

500|$|The {{front cover}} for Marquee Moon {{was shot by}} {{photographer}} Robert Mapplethorpe, who had previously shot the cover for Patti Smith's 1975 album Horses. His photo situated Verlaine a step {{in front of the}} rest of the band, who were captured in a tensed, serious pose. Verlaine held his right <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> his body and extended his slightly clenched left hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the contact prints, Lloyd took the band's favorite shot to a print shop in Times Square and asked for color photocopies for the group members to mull over. Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to print more [...] "while turning the knobs with his eyes closed". He likened the process to Andy Warhol's screen prints. After he showed it to the group, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe's original photo, which Fred Smith had framed and kept for himself.|$|E

2500|$|Inventory {{proportionality}} is {{the goal}} of demand-driven inventory management. The primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days' (or hours', etc.) worth of inventory on <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous. In such a case, there is no [...] "excess inventory," [...] that is, inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out. Excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain it could have been utilized better elsewhere, i.e. to the product that just ran out.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a needle and thread to sew a running stitch by <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch. Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a thimble, on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up. A third option is called [...] "loading the needle" [...] and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|... "But it (the {{wholesale}} Arab exodus) {{was also}} ... {{largely due to}} a policy of deliberate terrorism and eviction followed by the Jewish commanders in the areas they occupied, and reaching its peak of brutality in the massacre of Deir Yassin.There were two good reasons why the Jews should follow such a policy. First, the problem of harbouring within the Jewish State a large and disaffected Arab population had always troubled them. They wanted an exclusively Jewish state, {{and the presence of}} such a population that could never be assimilated, that would always resent its inferior position under Jewish rule and stretch a <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> so many frontiers to its Arab cousins in the surrounding countries, would not only detract from the Jewishness of Israel, but also constitute a danger to its existence. Secondly, the Israelis wanted to open the doors of Palestine to unrestricted Jewish immigration. Obviously, the fewer Arabs there were in the country the more room there would be for Jewish immigrants. If the Arabs could be driven out of the land {{in the course of the}} fighting, the Jews would have their homes, their lands, whole villages and towns, without even having to purchase them.|$|E
2500|$|The strings may be sounded {{by drawing}} {{the hair of}} the bow held by the right <b>hand</b> <b>across</b> them (arco) or by {{plucking}} them (pizzicato) most often with the right hand. In some cases, the violinist will pluck strings with the left hand. This is done to facilitate transitions from pizz to arco playing. It is also used in some virtuoso showpieces. Left hand pizzes are usually open strings. The right arm, hand, and bow are responsible for tone quality, rhythm, dynamics, articulation, and most (but not all) changes in timbre. The player draws the bow over the string, causing the string to vibrate and produce a sustained tone. The bow is a wooden stick with tensioned horsetail hair, which has been rosined with a bar of rosin. The natural texture of the horsehair and the stickiness of the rosin help the bow to [...] "grip" [...] the string, and thus when the bow is drawn over the string, the bow causes the string to sound a pitch. Bowing {{can be used to}} produce long sustained notes or melodies. As well, the bow can be used to play short, crisp little notes, such as repeated notes, scales and arpeggios.|$|E
