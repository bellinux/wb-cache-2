By ICAO Annex 10 Chapter 5.2.1.7.2.1 - Full call signs type C, a call sign consists {{out of the}} telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency, followed by the <b>flight</b> <b>identification.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>identification</b> is very often {{the same as the}} flight number, but could be different due to call sign confusion, if two or more flights close to each other have similar flight numbers (e.g. KLM649 and KLM645 or BAW466 and BAW646). For example, British Airways flight 75 would use the call sign Speedbird Seven-Five, since Speedbird is the telephony designator for British Airways and 75 would be the <b>flight</b> <b>identification.</b> (The telephony designator {{is not the same as}} the call sign, although the two are sometimes conflated).

50|$|To avoid {{confusion}} {{from two}} or more aircraft using the same SELCAL code, ASRI tries to assign code duplicates to aircraft that do not usually operate in the same {{region of the world}} or on the same HF radio frequencies. However, aircraft commonly move between different geographical regions and it is now routine for two aircraft with the same SELCAL code to be found flying in the same region. Therefore, air crew always verify both SELCAL and call sign (i.e., aircraft tail registration, or telephony designator and <b>flight</b> <b>identification)</b> to be sure their aircraft is the intended recipient.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{assessment}} of the capability of controllers based on the combined actuation of flaps and variable-stiffness devices to alleviate helicopter main rotor vibratory hub loads. Trailing-edge flaps are positioned at the rotor blade tip region, whereas variable-stiffness devices are located at the pitch link and at the blade root. Control laws are derived by an optimal control procedure based on the best trade-off between control effectiveness and control effort, under the constraint of satisfaction of the equations governing rotor blade aeroelastic response. The numerical investigation concerns the analysis of performance and robustness of the control techniques developed, through application to a four-bladed helicopter rotor in level <b>flight.</b> The <b>identification</b> of the most efficient control configuration is also attempted...|$|R

40|$|Identifying {{phases of}} flight in General Aviation {{can help in}} {{identifying}} safety events, which are events which may result in the aircraft being in a hazardous state. Unlike commercial operations that have well-defined phases of flight such as taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing, GA missions have more hard-to-identify phases of flight. For example, pilot training missions can involve multiple “touch-and-go” maneuvers, which {{make it difficult to}} define a distinct cruise phase during the patterns. Here, we present an algorithm to automatically identifying phases of flight in GA. The method includes an algorithm to tailor the phase of <b>flight</b> <b>identification</b> for flights from different regions.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} is {{the most}} common mycosis, however, the available information about antifungal susceptibilities of these yeasts is limited. AIM: To compare the gold standard fungal culture with a new molecular identification method and report the incidence of yeast species in vulvovaginitis candidosa. METHOD: The authors studied 370 yeasts isolated from vulvovaginal candidiasis and identified them by phenotypic and molecular methods. RESULTS: The most common species was Candida albicans (85 %), followed by Candida glabrata, and other Candida species. CONCLUSION: At present there are no recommendations for the evaluation of antifungal susceptibility of pathogenic fungal species occurring in vulvovaginal candidiasis and the natural antifungal resistance of the different species is known only.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} method {{based on}} system identification theory for helicopter flight dynamics modeling with rotor {{degrees of freedom}} is developed. A fully parameterized rotor flapping equation for identification purpose is derived without using any theoretical model, so {{the confidence of the}} identified model is increased, and then the 6 degrees of freedom rigid body model is extended to 9 degrees of freedom high-order model. Bode sensitivity function is derived to increase the accuracy of frequency spectra calculation which influences the accuracy of model parameter identification. Then a frequency domain identification algorithm is established. Acceleration technique is developed furthermore to increase calculation efficiency, and the total identification time is reduced by more than 50 % using this technique. A comprehensive two-step method is established for helicopter high-order <b>flight</b> dynamics model <b>identification</b> which increases the numerical stability of model identification compared with single step algorithm. Application of the developed method to identify the flight dynamics model of BO 105 helicopter based on flight test data is implemented.

40|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} are capable of, and in fact, do, operate {{at high speed}} (> 250 knots indicated airspeed [KIAS]) at low altitude (below 10, 000 ’ above ground level) worldwide.

Yet neither design/construction standards nor operational practice have changed to reflect the new threat. Subsequent serious damage resulting from recent collisions indicates change is necessary. Since 2003, flight rules in Canada and the United States have been amended, principally due to concern over bird strikes, to prohibit high-speed flight below 10, 000 ’.
