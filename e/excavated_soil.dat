5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently <b>excavated</b> <b>soil,</b> will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|Several birds prey on meat ants. The masked woodswallow (A. personatus) and the white-browed woodswallow (Artamus superciliosus) {{will gather}} around meat ant nests and swoop at them, {{catching}} several ants before eating them. Pieces of meat ants {{have been found}} in the faeces of the red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris), hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata) and the red-browed treecreeper (Climacteris erythrops). Meat ants that forage on Ventilago viminalis trees are often eaten by the apostlebird. Some large ground-feeding birds, such as currawongs, magpies and ravens dig out newly established colonies after a queen has found a suitable spot to nest. Small domes of <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> are present at such spots, revealing the queens' presence to these birds. As a result, many queens are consumed by birds, leaving many abandoned nest chambers.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. <b>Excavated</b> <b>soil</b> can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
30|$|Fluidity of the <b>excavated</b> <b>soils,</b> {{which are}} crucial to the {{creation}} of the earth pressure balance at the cutting face, can be achieved through two aspects of work. At first, using suitable additives is the key to condition the soils. The second aspect involves the full mixing of the additives and the <b>excavated</b> <b>soils.</b> For a shield more than 10  m in diameter, the second work is more important. The construction practice shows that the scheme of injecting the bentonite slurry (8 % of Concn) and the foam liquid (5 % of Concn) simultaneously to condition the <b>excavated</b> <b>soils,</b> the special designs of the 10.22  m diameter shield machine for the agitating system, the simultaneous backfilling grouting system and the independently driven agitating device are successful, and they can provide a useful reference for similar projects.|$|R

5|$|There {{are very}} few {{material}} remains of the medieval town today. The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today, but from the remains of its foundations {{it does not appear}} to have been a substantial fortification. It was lightly built, with a thickness of perhaps , reinforced by rectangular towers. The three gates have left far more substantial remains. The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> dumped on the inner side and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today a swamp) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both the wind and the coast's shoals.|$|E
500|$|There are six genera of North American {{pocket gopher}}s: Cratogeomys, Geomys, Orthogeomys, Pappogeomys, Thomomys, and Zygogeomys. The camas pocket gopher is a smooth-toothed pocket gopher {{of the genus}} Thomomys, within the pocket-gopher family Geomyidae. The incisors of gophers in the genus Thomomys have {{characteristically}} smooth anterior surfaces, while those of Geomys have two deep grooves per tooth and those of Cratogeomys have a single groove. The camas pocket gopher {{is a member of}} the subgenus Megascapheus, established in 1903, at that time for the camas pocket gopher alone. Taxonomists subsequently assigned other gophers to the same subgenus. The name Thomomys derives from the Greek [...] (heap) + [...] (mouse), probably describing the mounds of <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> produced by the burrowing gopher. [...] translates as [...] "bulb" [...] in Latin, and the word for [...] "devour" [...] is [...] [...] Naturalist David Douglas reported that the gopher consumed bulbs of the camas lily, and Vernon Bailey later attributed the lack of camas lilies in areas inhabited by the gopher to the bulbs being eaten. However, naturalist H. M. Wight observed that the gopher ate primarily dandelion greens, and was skeptical that it was a large consumer of bulbs.|$|E
500|$|Two {{caissons}} were {{sunk into}} the river bed below the stage. From there, the tunnels were constructed in each direction using Barlow-Greathead tunnelling shields of a similar design to those used to construct the C The north tunnel was constructed first, commencing in February 1899, followed by the south tunnel from March 1900. This was technically the most difficult stage of the project, as it necessitated tunnelling under the river. The tunnellers worked {{in an atmosphere of}} compressed air at up to [...] to prevent water leaking into the excavations. On several occasions, however, the tunnel was breached and escaping air caused [...] "blowouts", producing water spouts up to [...] high above the surface of the river. One such blowout disrupted Doggett's Coat and Badge race. By using the river as the centre of tunnelling operations, the company was able to remove <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> onto barges and bring in required material the same way, thus avoiding having to transport large amounts of material through the streets. Tunnelling also took place from station sites, notably at Piccadilly Circus. The tunnellers worked with a remarkable degree of accuracy given the technology of the time; the tunnel being driven north from the Thames eventually reached the one being dug south from Piccadilly Circus, meeting under Haymarket, with a deviation of only three-quarters of an inch (1.9cm).|$|E

40|$|Following the {{revision}} and transposition of the EU Waste Framework Directive into the French legal framework, {{it has been}} essential to define guidance and methods for sustainable reuse of <b>excavated</b> <b>soils</b> which would ensure human health and environmental protection. One provision of the European Directive sets that <b>excavated</b> <b>soils</b> that are not reused on site {{should be considered as}} waste and managed as such under national policies. In order to clarify these rules and provide stakeholders with a common operational framework, the French Ministry for Environment called upon BRGM and INERIS to draft a guidance for the reuse of <b>excavated</b> <b>soils</b> in off-site locations (i. e. within road construction, or development projects) and to develop the necessary tools for its implementation at local / regional scale. Following a review of European countries practice in this field, methodological tools have been developed with the support of working groups which included a wide range of stakeholders (professional unions, environmental protection association, planners, lawyers, etc.). The tools are now freely available from the French Portal for contaminated land managemen...|$|R

Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area, Allan Pluen's team is believed to have saved thousands on the final cost of the halls.

2500|$|The current church {{stands on}} the stump of Bell Hill, a major {{promontory}} which initially divided the heart of Dunedin in two. In the city's early years, gold was discovered inland, resulting in rapid growth in the city. The hill became a massive obstacle {{to the development of}} Dunedin, and a decision was made by the Otago Provincial Council to make a substantial excavation into the hill. This resulted in a cutting through which one of the city's main streets, Princes Street, now passes, and the reduction of the height of Bell Hill by some [...] Much of the <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> and stone was used in the reclamation of land which now forms the Southern Endowment of South Dunedin.

2500|$|The nests and {{colonies of}} M. smithii were studied {{in great detail}} in Puerto Rico and Brazil. [...] On the surface, M. smithii nests can be {{recognized}} by their nest mounds consisting of <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> and clay. A nest entrance of roughly 1.2 mm in diameter {{is located in the}} center of each nest mound. Large M. smithii nests, which are presumably older, can contain up to 7 or so chambers. Some fungus chambers are shallow whereas others can be found in great depths, as deep as 2 meters. The abandoned chambers are used to deposit waste from the fungus garden and loose soil from chamber construction. The number of nest chambers tends to increase as colonies grow older. [...] Because M. smithii queens are capable of asexual reproduction, it is believed that colonies can also grow by budding [...] in addition to independent colony foundation. Colonies that grow by budding can result in large colony networks.|$|E
50|$|In Monteverde, it is {{the main}} pest in gardens, and enters houses at night to cut bread, cabbage, or fruit that has been left out. The nests are often in or under a piece of dead wood, and often with a {{superstructure}} of loose, dead leaf fragments. They do not <b>excavate</b> <b>soil</b> very extensively, if at all. They may be arboreal at times, nesting in low branch junctions of epiphyte-laden trees.|$|R
50|$|Some {{preprocessing}} and postprocessing of soil {{is necessary}} when using LTTD. <b>Excavated</b> <b>soils</b> are first screened to remove large (greater than 2 inches in diameter) objects. These may be sized (e.g., crushed or shredded) and then introduced {{back into the}} feed material. After leaving the desorber, soils are cooled, re-moistened to control dust, and stabilized (if necessary) {{to prepare them for}} disposal or reuse. Treated soil may be redeposited onsite, used as cover in landfills, or incorporated into asphalt.|$|R
50|$|Leafcutter ants {{can create}} {{bottom-up}} gaps by forming their large nests. The ants <b>excavate</b> <b>soil</b> rich in organic matter, and store additional organic matter in their underground chambers. This creates rich soils that promote plant growth.

60|$|The ponds {{were four}} in number, close {{bordering}} the water, embracing about an acre each, and {{situated in a}} low fen, draining several valleys. The <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> was thrown up in dykes, made tight by being beaten all over, while in a soft state, with the heavy, flat ends of Palm stalks. Lving side by side, by three connecting trenches, these ponds {{could be made to}} communicate at pleasure; while two additional canals afforded means of letting in upon them the salt waters of the lagoon on one hand, or those of an inland stream on the other. And by a third canal with four branches, together or separately, they could be partially drained. Thus, the waters could be mixed to suit any gills; and the young fish taken from the sea, passed through a stated process of freshening; so that by the time they graduated, the salt was well out of them, like the brains out of some diplomaed collegians.|$|E
60|$|It {{was here}} that the actual {{position}} of the plateau, so indefinite of approach, began to be realized. It now appeared an independent elevation, surrounded on three sides by gorges and watercourses, so narrow as to be overlooked from the principal mountain range, with which it was connected by a long canyon {{that led to the}} ridge. At the outlet of this canyon--in bygone ages a mighty river--it had the appearance of having been slowly raised by the diluvium of that river, and the debris washed down from above--a suggestion repeated in miniature by the artificial plateaus of <b>excavated</b> <b>soil</b> raised before the mouths of mining tunnels in the lower flanks of the mountain. It was the realization of a fact--often forgotten by the dwellers in Eagle's Court--that the valley below them, which was their connecting link with the surrounding world, was only reached by ascending the mountain, and the nearest road was over the higher mountain ridge. Never before had this impressed itself so strongly upon the young girl as when she turned that morning to look upon the plateau below her. It seemed to illustrate the conviction that had been slowly shaping itself out of her reflections on the conversation of that morning. It was possible that the perfect understanding of a higher life was only reached from a height still greater, and that to those half-way up the mountain the summit was never as truthfully revealed as to the humbler dwellers in the valley.|$|E
