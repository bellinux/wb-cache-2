Like many of Swift's songs, the lyrics invoke princess imagery with lines such as [...] "Today was a fairytale/ You were the prince/ <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> damsel in distress." [...] Bertoldi said the lyrics were [...] "driven more by sweeping emotion than [...] specific, youth-focused imagery".

500|$|Love {{has played}} a variety of Fender guitars {{throughout}} her career, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster; the latter was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City. Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for [...] "Miss World". Earlier in Hole's career, between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425 because she [...] "preferred the 3/4 neck", but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins. In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, {{as well as a}} Univox Hi-Flier. Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury. During her 2010 and more recent tours, Love {{has played a}} Rickenbacker 360 onstage. She has referred to herself as [...] "a shit guitar player", further commenting in a 2014 interview: [...] "I can still write a song, but [...] sounds like shit... <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good rhythm player but I am no longer dependable." [...] Love's setup has included Fender tube gear, Matchless, Ampeg, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander.|$|E

Shaun Williamson as Barry played the Michael Jackson role, while Lucy Speed as Natalie took on Ola Ray’s role as his date. Unlike the original video – where Jackson was seen to turn into a zombie – the spoof saw Natalie transformed into the walking dead. A dozen cast-members took part in the spoof where they recreated the dance routine made famous in the original video. [...] Speed has commented “I really enjoyed that.

2500|$|Ginsberg talked {{openly about}} his {{connections}} with communism and {{his admiration for}} past communist heroes and the labor movement {{at a time when}} the Red Scare and McCarthyism were still raging. He admired Fidel Castro and many other quasi-Marxist figures from the 20th century. In [...] "America" [...] (1956), Ginsberg writes: [...] "America, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry". Biographer Jonah Raskin has claimed that, despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy, Ginsberg held [...] "his own idiosyncratic version of communism". On the other hand, when Donald Manes, a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the Communist Party, Ginsberg objected: [...] "I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the Communist party, nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. government or any government by violence. ... I must say that I see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capitalist that I have observed".|$|E
2500|$|The {{seventh and}} final season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes, begins with Michael receiving an assignment from Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman), a high-ranking CIA official {{with whom he}} made the deal that got his team and Maddie set free. Strong made the deal because he believes Michael {{is the only person}} he can entrust with a dangerous mission that involves thwarting an American named Randall Burke (Adrian Pasdar) believed to be running freelance terror operations. Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives. Maddie, meanwhile, is trying to get custody of Nate's son, Charlie, to keep him out of foster care. It turns out Burke {{is part of a larger}} organization, and he sacrifices his life in order to help Michael rescue a woman whom Burke called [...] "the key to everything": Sonya (Alona Tal). Michael and the team, including Fiona, begin working with Sonya to get deeper into her organization. As they do, Michael meets James (John Pyper-Ferguson), the man calling the shots for Sonya and Burke, and after passing some intense tests, Michael is welcomed into James's [...] "family". It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse. Maddie sacrifices herself to protect them and Michael shoots James, intent on taking him in custody. James blows up his own building, hoping to kill Michael and Fiona. They escape, but must be presumed dead to protect themselves. Strong releases Sam and Jesse, without imprisonment. [...] While the two of them contemplate continuing helping out those who need it like they had for the past seven years, Michael and Fiona have made their home in a small town in Ireland raising Charlie as their own and being the family that Fi had always dreamed of with Michael as her husband. As the show ends, Michael asks Fiona what should he tell Charlie when he is older. Fi says Michael should tell him the truth, but Michael doesn't know where to start. Fiona tells him to start from the beginning, by saying, [...] "My name is Michael Westen. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> spy." ...|$|E

40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of MTV 2 ̆ 7 s television show <b>I</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Fat, this paper looks at reality television and the weight-loss format in particular, as expressions of the coming into being of the modern subject within the contemporary culture of self-revelation. Through the cultural myth of fast transformation by overcoming the body, heroic narratives depict subjects renouncing their fat bodies {{in order to produce}} themselves anew. Drawing on Michel Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s late work on Christian technologies of the self, this paper asserts the continuity of ascetic ethical practices in the representation of modern fitness. This analysis draws on Julia Kristeva 2 ̆ 7 s figure of the abject in order to provide a missing gender component to Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s articulation of self-renunciation. Expanding Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s panoptic metaphor to a contemporary culture characterized by self-revelation, this paper depicts the continuities of ascetic transformation discourse as represented in <b>I</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Fat...|$|R
