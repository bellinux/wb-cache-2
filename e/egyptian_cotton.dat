25|$|Cotton {{was first}} {{planted in the}} Shire valley by Eugene Sharrer, and the British Central Africa Company {{continued}} to grow cotton on its Chelumbo and Chikwawa estates. From 1903 the company also encouraged cotton cultivation by African smallholders in the Upper Shire District, by distributing cheap <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> seed. The company gave instruction on the method of cultivation and agreed to buy the future crop at a guaranteed (but low) price. There was no significant shortage of land for peasant farming in the Upper Shire Valley, as the British Central Africa Company only exploited {{a small proportion of}} its land and, until the 1930s, the company tolerated squatters who did not pay rent on its land. Its tenants had to perform labour thangata or grow cotton for sale to the company, but in general there was plenty of land available for food production. The efforts of the colonial administration to introduce cotton as a peasant cash-crop were largely unsuccessful, as the prices paid to the peasants were low, so they concentrated on growing food. The British Central Africa Company Ltd also had a cotton ginnery for processing its own and smallholder cotton until at least 1961. In 1971, the purchase and processing of smallholder cotton was taken over by a parastatal body.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the urban {{development}} of Burdur is generally held {{to begin with the}} Turkish settlement after the Seljuq victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. In the late 11th century, the Kınalı tribe of the Oghuz Turks captured the Burdur area and settled there. Turks became {{the majority of the population}} of the area after 1211, establishing a number of villages in addition to expanding the town. The first Turkish settlement was in an area known as Hamam Bendi that had a lower elevation than today's city but was farther to the lake than the ancient town of Limnombria. These residents used the site of today's Grand Mosque of Burdur as an open marketplace, known as Alanpazarı. Realising the high incidence of malaria in the area they had settled, these residents then moved uphill, away from the lake. These first residents had not submitted to any state, but Kilij Arslan II, the Seljuq Sultan of Rum, captured the area in 1177 and imposed his sovereignty over the local tribes. The town remained under the undisputed sovereignty of the Sultanate of Rum between 1206 and 1260, when it was captured by the Mongol Empire. Developing commerce in the port of Antalya increased the significance of Burdur as a centre of commerce. Tragacanth obtained from the mountains of Psidia, wine from Kütahya, wax, wood and tar from many parts of Anatolia passed through Burdur, in exchange of which <b>Egyptian</b> spices, <b>cotton</b> and sugar was traded.|$|R
40|$|The {{textile fibre}} mixture as a {{multicomponent}} blend of variable fibres imposes regarding the proper method {{to predict the}} characteristics of the final blend. The length diagram and the fibrogram of cotton are generated. Then the length distribution, the length diagram, and the fibrogram of a blend of different categories of cotton are determined. The length distributions by weight of five different categories of <b>cotton</b> (<b>Egyptian,</b> USA (Pima), Brazilian, USA (Upland), and Uzbekistani) are measured by AFIS. From these distributions, the length distribution, the length diagram, and the fibrogram by weight of four binary blends are expressed. The length parameters of these cotton blends are calculated and their variations are plotted against the mass fraction x of one component in the blend. These calculated parameters are compared to those of real blends. Finally, the selection of the optimal blends using the linear programming method, based on the hypothesis that the cotton blend parameters vary linearly in function of the components rations, is proved insufficient...|$|R

40|$|In many countries, {{agricultural}} {{exports are}} managed directly by governments. A frequent problem encountered by policy makers involves {{the accumulation of}} unwanted surpluses caused by domestic price support programs, unforeseen declines in world demand, or unexpected shifts in the domestic supply-demand balance. This paper examines the intertemporal use of the world markets {{as a means to}} eliminate these surpluses. The analytical results follow directly from the theory of storage. They are applied to an analysis of the <b>Egyptian</b> ELS <b>cotton</b> market, where stock levels in the early 1980 sbecame about six times as large as normal carryout. Estimation results suggest that optimal disposal plans may frequently involve selling surplus stocks in a single year. Key words: cotton, Egypt, export subsidies, international trade. The export markets of many primary com-modities are affected by surplus disposal pro-grams. In recent years, the European Commu-nity (EC) and the United States have sold large quantities of dairy products, cereals, feed grains, and beef under explicit (export subsidies) or implicit (P. L. 480) surplus dis-posal programs. In these cases, the accumula-tion of surpluses resulted from price support programs that kept domestic prices at levels higher than world prices. Problems of surplus accumulation can also arise when exporters possess market power. When international market positions are managed by marketing boards or some similar institution, unforeseen shortfalls in world excess demand conditions can leave the exporter with unexpectedly large stocks. Although policy makers will in-corporate storage activity in their production and sales plans, such plans are conditioned on an uncertain future, and ex ante policies ma...|$|R

About 200 to 300 acres of coffee bushes were planted at Magomero from 1895, but after poor crops in 1898 and 1899, the management looked for a more suitable crop. Following the collapse of coffee prices, the Shire Highlands estates next turned to cotton from 1903. Growing [...] <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> in the Shire Highlands was at first unsuccessful: it was more suitable for the hotter Shire Valley. However, from 1906, W.J. Livingstone developed a hardier variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland, and by 1908 had planted 1,000 acres at Magomero, increased to 5,000 acres by 1914.

2500|$|The Great Depression of 1873, and {{subsequent}} farming depressions, {{and most importantly}} the growth of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> and Indian cotton pushed aside American cotton, which had previously provided the prosperity of the planter class.

[...] Still, the growers experimented with multi-crop rotation, schemes at sharecropping and tenant farming, and eventually earned valuable income from tobacco in later decades. [...] The number of plantations never recovered, yet, ironically several of the sharecroppers and tenant farmers managed to evolve into a yeoman farmers. However, the setbacks in economic markets and demand, domestic and foreign competition, all combined to keep the narrow gauge railroad from generating sufficient traffic and rebuilding the antebellum prosperity.

2500|$|The spun fibers are {{generally}} divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. [...] These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. [...] Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of {{animals such as}} sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). [...] Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. [...] Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. [...] Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. [...] Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean {{and some people are}} allergic to it. [...] It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. [...] Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his reign in 1863, Egypt's debt had been 3 million Egyptian pounds. When Isma'il's reign ended in 1879, Egypt's debt had risen to 93 million pounds. During the American Civil War, when the Union blockade had cut off the American South from the world economy, the price of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton,</b> known as [...] "white gold" [...] had skyrocketed as British textile mills turned to Egypt as an alternative source of cotton, causing an economic blossoming of Egypt that ended abruptly in 1865. As the attempts of his grandfather, Muhammad Ali the Great to depose the ruling Ottoman family in favor of his own family had failed due to the opposition of Russia and Britain, the imperialistic Ismai'il had turned his attention southwards and was determined to build an Egyptian empire in Africa, planning on subjecting the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa. As part of his Westernization programme, Isma'il often hired Westerners to work in his government both in Egypt and in the Sudan. Ismai'il's Chief of General Staff was the American general Charles Pomeroy Stone, {{and a number of other}} veterans of the American Civil War were commanding Egyptian troops.

2500|$|Livingstone {{turned to}} cotton from 1903: growing [...] <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> was {{unsuccessful}} {{as it was}} more suitable for hotter areas, but from 1906, he developed a hardier variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland, and in 1908 planted 1,000 acres at Magomero with it; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour over a long growing period, and Livingstone ensured that 3,000 to 5,000 workers were available throughout its five or six month growing season by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called thangata. This word originally meant help, such as one neighbour might give another, but it came to mean the work that a tenant on a European-owned estate had to undertake in lieu of rent. Tenants were also required to undertake additional work {{on account of the}} Hut tax which the owner paid on behalf of tenants. Other men worked for wages: they were often unpaid, underpaid or given tobacco instead of cash, and violently coerced by the owners. Although William Jervis Livingstone pioneered the thangata system at Magomero from 1906, once Alexander Livingstone Bruce came to live in Nyasaland in 1908 and control of the estate operations, he instructed Livingstone, his manager, to exploit thangata rigorously to maximise the amount of cotton grown. The A L Bruce Estates increased the labour demand to four or five months a year, mainly in the rainy season, which was also the main growing season for both cotton and food crops, leaving tenants little time to grow their food. Single women tenants and widows were now also required to work.|$|E
