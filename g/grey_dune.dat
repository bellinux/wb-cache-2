40|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>dunes</b> are an {{important}} habitat in Dutch coastal sand dunes, harbouring various Red Data Book flora and fauna species. However, during the last decades, dune grasslands belonging to this habitat have suffered from severe grass encroachment due to prolonged stabilisation, atmospheric pollution, and rabbit decline. In the Amsterdam Water supply Dunes shallow sod cutting was ap-plied in 2002 {{on a small scale}} in dune grasslands of the syntaxa Taraxaco-Galietum veri and Phleo-Tortuletum ruraliformis, with high cover of the tall grass species Calamagrostis epigejos and Elytrichia maritima. In this article, we describe the first results of sod cutting, which was exe-cuted in order to recover dune grassland vegetation and the accompanying characteristic fauna species. Soil and biomass were studied and permanent plots were used for vegetation survey and pellet counting of rabbits. In addition, several insect groups were monitored in pitfalls and plots, and along transects. The dune grasslands of the Taraxaco-Galietum veri show a strong increase of characteristic plant species and a recovery of rabbits, butterflies and grasshoppers. In the dune grasslands of the Phleo-Tortuletum ruraliformis vegetation responds more slowly to sod cutting, probably due to lower nutrient availability. Number of rabbits and the grasshopper Oedipoda caerulescens increased as well. The longer-term effects remain to be seen, but the results indicate that a rapid improvement of vegetation and fauna can be reached after shallow sod cutting of grass-encroached <b>grey</b> <b>dunes.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Grey dunes {{are formed}} when {{pioneering}} plant species inhabit embryo dunes and begin a successional process toward dune stabilization and soil formation. Pioneer plants capture saltating sand grains {{carried by the}} wind and deposit them to continue build up the dune. Grey dunes are then formed after the root structures of pioneering plants stabilize foredunes. Sand stabilization allows for dead plant material to be decomposed within the soil, adding nutrients and water-retention abilities to the soil. As soil starts to slowly form, new plant species colonize the stable dunes ultimately developing more extensive root structures and plant diversity. When the dune has become continuously vegetated, lichen and moss grows in the understory, providing a water-repellent surface that reduces erosion (through rainfall and wind), this results in the official formation of the <b>grey</b> <b>dune.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the spider assemblage structure {{and the presence of}} indicator species in the Flemish coastal dunes are presented. The analysis is based on data from more than 170 year-round pitfall sampling campaigns from the 1970 s onwards. We were able to find indicator species for all identified habitats. The assemblages are determined by variation in vegetation structure (succession), atmospheric and soil humidity and the occurrence of both natural of anthropogenic disturbance. In the fragmented habitats (grasslands and <b>grey</b> <b>dunes),</b> a clear relationship was found between the mean habitat size and the stability of the assemblage composition. In moss dominated dunes and short grasslands total species numbers do not increase with patch size. Due to microhabitat variation and the possibility of attaining viable population sizes the total number of typical species is, however, higher in larger patches. In small patches, edge effects are more important and the number of observed species is enlarged by the intrusion of species from nearby habitats...|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{dispersal}} by ballooning is {{a passive}} flight, by which wind drag generates an upward lift on a silk thread. It {{is likely to}} reflect an aerial lottery, in which the absence of flight direction control is a serious cost for long-distance dispersal in a fragmented landscape. For species occurring in one patchily distributed habitat type, dispersal should evolve {{in a different way}} from morphological traits, directly linked to active dispersal. Therefore, we expect that if the risk of landing in an unsuitable habitat is lower than the probability of reaching a suitable habitat, selection should benefit a well-developed ballooning behaviour. We investigated interspecific variation in the ballooning-initiating tiptoe behaviour as it is linked to spider dispersal performance. Our results indeed indicate that ballooning performance is negatively related to habitat specialization in spiders from patchy <b>grey</b> <b>dunes,</b> so habitat specialists are characterized by poorly developed dispersal behaviour. These findings are concordant with recent insights that dispersal is selected as risk spreading in generalists, while it is selected against in specialist species...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>dune</b> {{ecosystems}} in Europe show {{a decrease}} in area and quality. Lacks of natural dynamics and increased eutrophication have led to grass encroachment and increased shrub cover. Policy {{to improve the quality}} of these dry dune systems has been developed but the efficacy of measures for ecological restoration is not always clear. In this research the efficacy of sod cutting and increased aeolian sand dynamics as restoration measures to improve the quality and increase the area of <b>grey</b> <b>dune</b> is researched. To this purpose articles in international scientific literature and management reports from the Netherlands are reviewed. The restoration measures are not often discussed in scientific literature and restoration measures are often not sufficiently monitored. Much of the literature on the effects of increased aeolian sand activity is mainly geomorphological. Scientific knowledge on the long term effects of restoration measures in grey dunes or comparable systems is scarce. However from the reviewed studies a few general trends became obvious. Sod cutting and the increase of aeolian sand dynamics can be an effective way to increase both the quality and the area of <b>grey</b> <b>dune</b> ecosystems. Dependent on how the measures are performed both measures can have a beneficial effect on pioneer stages as well as species rich dune grasslands. Points of interest are the effect on SOM, the soil seed bank, sand deposition and pH, as well as the scale of the measures. These factors are crucial in the establishment of target communities. Future research should focus on the effects of recovery measures on soil processes, soil biota and on the effects on the longer term. Effects of the restoration measures on species rich <b>grey</b> <b>dune</b> grasslands on the longer term are uncertain. Recovery in lime-rich sites seems to be slower while in acid dunes the grass encroachment is a bigger problem.

40|$|Pitfall {{trapping}} in the National Park Thy, north-western Jutland, Denmark, in 2011 and 2013 revealed 3654 {{specimens of}} the harvestman Nelima gothica. In most European countries, including Denmark, this species {{has been considered}} rare and little information is available on its biology. The species was found predominantly in the yellow dune habitat close to the North Sea coast. Here it could be either very abundant or completely absent at localities only a few kilometres apart. It also occurred in lower numbers in the <b>grey</b> <b>dunes</b> and the dune heathland, and was rare in managed grassland; it disappeared from habitats further inland. In the yellow dunes high numbers were recorded especially in rather dense Ammophila arenaria vegetation not disturbed by sand shifting. The phenology follows the typical pattern of North-European Phalangiidae and Leiobuninae: an annual life-cycle with juveniles developing through late spring and summer months, reproduction in autumn and hibernation in the egg stage. The findings suggest that N. gothica may be found all along the coastal dunes of western Denmark and possibly the Wadden Sea area, though it may only locally reach high abundances.

Detailed data on these animals' time budgets were collected over a full year, through the focal animal observation technique. On average the Haflinger horses spent 68 % of the daytime grazing, 18 % resting and 8 % walking. Seasonal features influenced horses' behaviour, mainly through a change in grazing time. Shorter grazing time in summer allowed the animals to rest longer than during the other seasons. We suggest that especially the decreased forage {{quality and quantity of}} the grazed habitats in the non- growing season account for the increased grazing time in autumn and winter. In all four seasons the horses preferred grazing in the grassy habitat. However, habitat use showed seasonal variation. <b>Grey</b> <b>dunes</b> were grazed more intensively in winter and spring, compared to summer and autumn. The contribution of roughage, scrub and woodland to the habitat use was low over the entire year.
