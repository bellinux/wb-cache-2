40|$|Perennial {{and intense}} malaria {{transmission}} (<b>holoendemic</b> malaria) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are 2 cofactors in {{the pathogenesis of}} endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL). In the present study, we compared EBV loads in children living in 2 regions of Kenya with differing malaria transmission intensities: Kisumu District, where malaria transmission is <b>holoendemic,</b> and Nandi District, where malaria transmission is sporadic. For comparison, blood samples were also obtained from US adults, Kenyan adults, and patients with eBL. Extraction of DNA from blood and quantification by polymerase chain reaction give an EBV load estimate that reflects the number of EBV-infected B cells. We observed a significant linear trend in mean EBV load, with the lowest EBV load detected in US adults and increasing EBV loads detected in Kenyan adults, Nandi children, Kisumu children, and patients with eBL, respectively. In addition, EBV loads were significantly higher in Kisumu children 1 – 4 years of age than in Nandi children of the same age. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} repeated malaria infections in very young children modulate the persistence of EBV and increase the risk for the development of eBL.

40|$|Abstract. Malaria is <b>holoendemic</b> in the {{lowlands}} of Papua NewGuinea (PNG), and interactions among Plasmodium species may influence prevalence of mixed infections. Previously, field samples from a cross-sectional survey in Dreikikir, East Sepik Province, analyzed by blood smear and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR), showed that mixed infections were common and randomly distributed in this malaria endemic region. To evaluate further whether Plas-modium species distribution is random, blood smear – and PCR/sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization– based analyses of cross-sectional survey samples were conducted in 2 additional malaria <b>holoendemic</b> regions of north-ern PNG. Despite ecologic, species prevalence, and transmission season differences in these new surveys, all 4 Plasmo-dium species {{were found to be}} randomly distributed in each area; random distribution patterns also were observed when study populations were divided into age groups. These findings provide consistent evidence that Plasmodium species infections occur independently of one another in PNG malaria <b>holoendemic</b> sites. This independent occurrence suggests that age-dependent, acquired malaria immunity has limited influence on the distribution pattern of Plasmodium species infections in endemic human populations; infection by 1 human malaria parasite species does not reduce susceptibility to infection by others; and malaria vaccines would exhibit limited protection against blood-stage infection by heterolo-gous Plasmodium species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Research in malaria-endemic {{areas is}} usually focused on malaria during early childhood. Less {{is known about}} malaria among older school age children. The {{incidence}} of clinical attacks of malaria was monitored, using active case detection in primary schools, in two areas of western Kenya that differ in the intensity of transmission. Clinical malaria was more common in schools in the Nandi highlands, with a six-fold higher incidence of malaria attacks during the malaria epidemic in 2002, compared with school children living in a <b>holoendemic</b> area with intense perennial transmission during the same period. The high incidence coupled with the high parasite densities among cases is compatible with {{a low level of}} protective immunity in the highlands. The malaria incidence among school children exposed to intense year-round transmission (26 per 100 school children per year) was consistent with reports from other <b>holoendemic</b> areas.

However, this study detected no such difference in the TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 9, and MAL allele frequencies between the two study sites. All polymorphisms were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium in the Kenyan and Papua New Guinean populations. TLR 9 SNPs and length polymorphisms within the TLR 2 5 ' untranslated region were the only mutant alleles present at a frequency greater than 10 % in all populations. Conclusion Similar frequencies of TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 9, and MAL genetic polymorphisms in populations with different histories of malaria exposure suggest that these innate immune pathways have not been under strong selective pressure by malaria.

40|$|Pregnant women, {{especially}} primigravidas, {{are highly}} susceptible to malaria infection, resulting in maternal anemia and {{low birth weight}} infants. Because circulating parasitemia is rare in the newborn, the cause of poor fetal outcomes has been unclear. We measured cytokine concentrations in placentas collected from women delivering in urban hospitals in malaria-holoendemic or nonendemic areas of Kenya. Normal placentas displayed a bias toward type 2 cytokines; type 1 cytokines IFN- � and IL- 2 were absent in placentas not exposed to malaria but present in {{a large proportion of}} placentas from a <b>holoendemic</b> area. TNF- � and TGF- � concentrations were significantly higher, and IL- 10 concentrations significantly lower, in placentas from the <b>holoendemic</b> area. Among primigravidas, placental TNF- � concentrations were significantly higher in the presence of severe maternal anemia, and both IFN- � and TNF- � were significantly elevated when a low birth weight, rather than normal weight, infant was delivered.

40|$|Abstract. The rate of malarial parasitemia in {{children}} and adults was assessed by microscopy and the polymerase chain reaction in a <b>holoendemic</b> area in Nigeria. A high rate of subpatent Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia (19. 6 %) was found. Plasmodium malariae and P. ovale infections were common {{in a rural area}} (26. 1 % and 14. 8 %) but were observed sporadically in individuals from an urban area. Simultaneous infections with P. falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale were frequent in the rural area (11. 7 % triple infections). The rate of triple infections was higher than expected from the prevalences of each species (P, 0. 00001). Spleen enlargement was associated with mixed infec-tions of P. falciparum and P. malariae (odds ratio [OR] 5 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 0 – 11. 7) and less frequently observed in individuals without detectable parasitemia (OR 5 0. 06, 95 % CI 5 0. 01 – 0. 3). Spleen enlarge-ment and titers of antibodies to schizonts were positively correlated with parasite densities. The results also suggest that in some individuals a long-lasting subpatent parasitemia might occur.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{childhood}} anaemia in malaria <b>holoendemic</b> areas {{is a major}} public health challenge for which an optimal strategy remains to be determined. Malaria prevention may compromise the development of partial immunity. Regular micronutrient supplementation has been suggested as an alternative but its effectiveness remains unsettled. We therefore conducted a randomised placebo-controlled intervention trial with 207 Tanzanian children aged 5 months to 3 years on the efficacy of supervised supplementation of low-dose micronutrients including iron (Poly Vi-Sol with iron) three times per week, with an average attendance of ≥ 90 %. The mean haemoglobin (Hb) level increased by 8 g/l more in children on supplement (95 % CI 3 - 12) during the 5 -month study. All age groups benefited from the intervention including severely anaemic subjects. The mean erythrocyte cell volume (MCV) increased but Hb in children ≥ 24 months improved independently of MCV and no relation was found with hookworm infection. The data therefore suggest that micronutrients other than iron also contributed to Hb improvement. In the supplement group of children who had received sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) treatment, the mean Hb level increased synergistically by 22 g/l (95 % CI 13 - 30) compared to 7 g/l (95 % CI 3 - 10) in those without such treatment.
