6000|$|... (6.) Finally let me <b>insert</b> <b>as</b> the {{keystone}} {{of all that}} I have been saying in this chapter, be sincere, and ardent, and consistent, in your own piety. The whole structure which I have been attempting to build, will tumble into ruins without this. Be constantly watchful and careful, not only to maintain intimate communion with God, and to renew it daily in your seasons of retirement, but guard your conduct. Let piety control and regulate it. Show your pupils that it makes you amiable, patient, forbearing, benevolent in little things, {{as well as in}} great things, and your example will co-operate with your instructions, and allure your pupils to walk in the paths which you tread. But no clearness and faithfulness in religious teaching will atone for the injury which a bad example will effect. Conduct speaks louder than words, and no persons are more shrewd than the young, to discover the hollowness of empty professions, and the heartlessness of mere pretended interest in their good.|$|E

6000|$|LXXX. That all the {{measures}} deprecated in future by the said Warren Hastings, with {{a reference to}} former conduct, in his several letters aforesaid, being (so far as the same are intelligible) six in number, have been all of them the proper acts and measures of the said Warren Hastings himself. For he did himself first of all introduce, and did afterwards continue and support, that interference which he now informs the Court of Directors [...] "is ruinous and disreputable, and which the very symptoms of an intention to renew" [...] he considers in the highest degree dangerous; he did direct, with a controlling and absolute authority, in every department of government, and in every district in the dominions of the Nabob of Oude. Secondly, the appointment of agents, which was eminently the act of his own administration: he not only retaining many agents {{in the country of}} Oude, both [...] "secret and avowed," [...] but also sending some of them, in defiance to the orders of that very Court of Directors, to whom, in his said letter of the 1st of October, 1784, he assigns [...] "vengeance and corruption" [...] as the only motives that can produce such appointments. Thirdly, that he, the said Warren Hastings, did instruct one of the said agents, and did charge him upon pain of [...] "a dreadful responsibility," [...] to perform sundry acts of violence against persons of the highest distinction and nearest relation to the prince; which acts were justly liable to the imputation of [...] "vengeance" [...] in the execution, and which he, in his reply to the defence of Middleton to one of his charges, did declare to be liable to the suspicion of [...] "corruption in the relaxation." [...] Fourthly, that he did raise new demands on the Vizier, [...] "and overcharge accounts on one side and take a wide latitude on the other," [...] by sending up a new and before unheard-of overcharge of four hundred thousand pounds and upwards, not made by the Resident or admitted by the Vizier, and, by adding the same, did swell his debt [...] "beyond the means of payment"; and did even <b>insert,</b> <b>as</b> the ninth article of his charge against Middleton, [...] "his omitting to take any notice of the additional balance of Rupees 26,48,571, stated by the Accountant-General to be due from the Vizier on the 30th of April, 1780," [...] to which he did add fourteen lac more, making together the above sum. Fifthly, that he, the said Warren Hastings, did assign [...] "political dangers," [...] in his minute of the 13th December, 1779, for burdening the said Nabob of Oude [...] "with unnecessary defences and enormous subsidies," [...] with regard to which he then declared, that [...] "it was our part, not his [the Nabob's], to judge and to determine." [...] And, sixthly, that he did not only show the design, but the fact, of personal kindness to the partisans of what he here calls, as well as in another letter, and in one Minute of Consultation, a [...] "late usurpation,"--he having rewarded the principal and most obnoxious of the instruments of the said late usurpation, (if such it was,) Richard Johnson, Esquire, with an honorable and profitable embassy to the court of the Nizam.|$|E
