40|$|The Helias reactor is a scaled-up {{version of}} the Wendelstein 7 -X experiment. A {{straightforward}} extrapolation of Wendelstein 7 -X leads to HSR 5 / 22, which has 5 <b>field</b> <b>periods</b> and a major radius of 22 m. HSR 4 / 18 is a more compact Helias reactor with 4 <b>field</b> <b>periods</b> and 18 m major radius. Stability limit and energy confinement times are nearly {{the same as in}} HSR 5 / 22, thus the same fusion power (3000 MW) is expected in both configurations. Neoclassical transport in HSR 4 / 18 is very low; the effective helical ripple is below 1 %. This paper describes the power balance of the Helias reactor, the blanket and maintenance concept. The coil system of HSR 4 / 18 is comprised of 40 modular coils with NbTi-superconducting cables. The reduction from 5 to 4 <b>field</b> <b>periods</b> and the concomitant reduction in size will also reduce the cost of the Helias reactor. (orig.)

The <b>Field</b> <b>Period</b> can be completed over summer break or winter break, as students have the month of January off.

Each student's site supervisor evaluates the student's work ethic and progress and reports back to Keuka College's Experiential Learning office. Upon completion, students meet with their academic advisors to present unique documentation of the experience and hand in a recap paper and reflective journal.|$|E

50|$|One early {{example of}} a finding was {{reported}} by Visser, Krosnick, Marquette and Curtin (1996) who showed that surveys with lower response rates (near 20%) yielded more accurate measurements than did surveys with higher response rates (near 60 or 70%). In another study, Keeter et al. (2006) compared results of a 5-day survey employing the Pew Research Center’s usual methodology (with a 25% response rate) with results from a more rigorous survey conducted over a much longer <b>field</b> <b>period</b> and achieving a higher response rate of 50%. In 77 out of 84 comparisons, the two surveys yielded results that were statistically indistinguishable. Among the items that manifested significant differences across the two surveys, the differences in proportions of people giving a particular answer ranged from 4 percentage points to 8 percentage points.|$|E
40|$|Confinement of a plasma for {{controlled}} {{thermonuclear fusion}} is studied numerically. Toroidal equilibria are considered, {{with an emphasis on}} the Modular Helias-like Heliac 2 (MHH 2), which is a stellarator of low aspect ratio with just two <b>field</b> <b>periods</b> surrounded by 16 modular coils. The geometry is fully three-dimensional, but there is an axial symmetry of the magnetic structure that is calculated to give confinement competitive with that in circular tokamaks. Additional vertical and toroidal field coils, together with a current drive, provide the flexibility and the control of rotational transform necessary for a successful experiment. An MHH 3 device with three <b>field</b> <b>periods</b> and comparable quasi-axial symmetry is presented, too, and because of reversed shear, its physical properties may be better. Variational analysis of equilibrium and stability is shown to give a more reliable prediction of performance for these stellarators than linearized or local theories that suffer from a failure of differentiability and convergence...|$|R

The {{newspaper}} was owned by Field Enterprises, controlled by the Marshall Field family, which acquired the afternoon Chicago Daily News in 1959 and launched WFLD television in 1966. When the Daily News ended its run in 1978, much of its staff, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, were moved to the Sun-Times. During the <b>Field</b> <b>period,</b> the newspaper had a populist, progressive character that leaned Democratic but was independent of the city's Democratic establishment. Although the graphic style was urban tabloid, the paper was well regarded for journalistic quality and did not rely on sensational front-page stories. It typically ran articles from The Washington Post/Los Angeles Times wire service.|$|E

He served in a mine in Komló and became a local leader of the {{revolution}} in 1956. After the revolution was crushed by Russian forces, he fled to the United States where he won a scholarship and became a physiologist. He was granted asylum in the United States and came to Bard College in the winter <b>field</b> <b>period</b> of 1956-57. Bitó graduated from Bard College in 1960 as a pre-med biology major. He went on to obtain his Ph.D. from Columbia University in medical cell biology in 1963. His research {{led to the development of}} Xalatan, the drug that has saved the sight of millions of glaucoma sufferers. He has published more than 150 scientific articles and received, among many other honors, the highest recognition in the field of eye research, the Proctor Medal, in 2000 and the Helen Keller Prize for Vision Research in 2013. Upon retiring from Columbia University as Emeritus Professor of Ocular Physiology, he returned to Hungary and his first love of writing. Of his 14 nonscientific books—novels, essays, and three anthologies of some of his more than a hundred newspaper and magazine articles—some have appeared in translations in half a dozen countries.|$|E
40|$|Typically, {{the end of}} {{a survey}} <b>field</b> <b>period</b> is a point when a survey struggles to achieve what is seen as an {{acceptable}} response rate. Response is shaped by the decisions of field staff to continue applying effort and respondents to be open to persuasion. The situation is an uncomfortable one in that it is quite difficult to apply measurable standards to the process in a way that can be mapped with any precision into response probabilities. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) has long gone to the bitter end of the <b>field</b> <b>period</b> where the remaining possibilities of completed interviews are very slim, and in doing so has held response rates approximately constant over time. The hope is that this operational approach will allow as much constancy across time as possible in any response biases. Yet this is a costly approach that could not be justified easily if the last cases are not sufficiently different from cases collected earlier. This paper examines the set of the last cases collected for the 2007 SCF and describes {{the ways in which they}} differ from ones collected earlier in the <b>field</b> <b>period.</b> Some limited comparisons are also made with the nonrespondents...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{stellarator}} configurations {{have been}} developed for ARIES-CS. These configurations are optimized to provide good plasma confinement and flux surface integrity at high beta. Modular coils have been designed for them in which the space needed for the breeding blanket and radiation shielding was specifically targeted such that reactors generating GW electrical powers would require only moderate major radii (< 10 m). These configurations are quasi-axially symmetric in the magnetic field topology and have small number of <b>field</b> <b>periods</b> (≤ 3) and low aspect ratios (≤ 6). The baseline design chosen for detailed systems and power plant studies has 3 <b>field</b> <b>periods,</b> aspect ratio 4. 5 and major radius 7. 5 m operating at β~ 6. 5 % to yield 1 GW electric power. The shaping of the plasma accounts for ≥ 75 % of the rotational transform. The effective helical ripples are very small (< 0. 6 % everywhere) and the energy loss of alpha particles is calculated to be ≤ 5 % when operating in high density regimes. An interesting feature in this configuration is that instead of minimizing all residues in the magnetic spectrum, we preferentially retained a small amount of the non-axisymmetric mirror field. The presence of this mirror and its associated helical field alters the ripple distribution, resulting in the reduced ripple-trapped loss of alpha particles despite the long connection length in a tokamak-like field structure. Additionally, we discuss two other potentially attractive classes of configurations, both quasi-axisymmetric: one with only two <b>field</b> <b>periods,</b> very low aspect ratios (~ 2. 5), and less complex coils, and the other with the plasma shaping designed to produce low shear rotational transform so as to assure the robustness and integrity of flux surfaces when operating at high β...|$|R
