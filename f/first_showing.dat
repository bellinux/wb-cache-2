25|$|The {{principle}} of the modern computer was first described by computer scientist Alan Turing, who set out the idea in his seminal 1936 paper, On Computable Numbers. Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. He proved that some such machine {{would be capable of}} performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by <b>first</b> <b>showing</b> that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: in general, {{it is not possible to}} decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.|$|E
