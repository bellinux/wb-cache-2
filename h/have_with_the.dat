25|$|Traditionally, the Bedouin {{society was}} nomadic, pastoral, and {{agricultural}} based. Within this system, labor was divided along gender lines. Women were traditionally {{in charge of}} the agricultural activities, which included herding, grazing, fetching water, and raising crops, while men were in charge of guarding their land and receiving visitors. Bedouin culture, especially as it relates to gender norms, developed around this economic structure. In accordance with these traditional economic roles, women in Bedouin society did not interact with strangers, especially unfamiliar men. Bedouin men mediated most of the interactions their families <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> larger society. As such, Bedouin culture became highly patriarchal. Within this traditional system, the men have held most of the power, but the vital economic roles of the women granted them significant degree of influence over the household decision-making.|$|E
25|$|In September 1934, Malden {{decided to}} leave his home in Gary, Indiana, to pursue formal {{dramatic}} training at the Goodman School (later part of DePaul University), then associated with the Goodman Theater in Chicago. Although he {{had worked in the}} steel mills in Gary for three years, he had helped support his family and was consequently unable to save enough money to pay for his schooling. Making a deal with the director of the program, he gave the institute the little money that he did <b>have,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> director agreeing that, if Malden did well, he would be rewarded with a full scholarship. He won the scholarship. When Malden performed in the Goodman's children's theater, he wooed the actress Mona Greenberg (stage name: Mona Graham), who married him in 1938. He graduated from the Chicago Art Institute in 1937. Soon after, without work and without money, Malden returned to his hometown.|$|E

Frankfort especially notes the stylistic similarity with the sculpted head of a male deity found at Ur, which Collon finds to be [...] "so close to the Queen of the Night in quality, workmanship and iconographical details, that it could well have come from the same workshop." [...] Therefore, Ur is one possible city of origin for the relief, but not the only one: Edith Porada points out the virtual identity in style that the lion's tufts of hair <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same detail seen on two fragments of clay plaques excavated at Nippur.

500|$|Several {{elements}} of the episode were highlighted for their implausibility. The arrival of New Directions in New York without having their songs already prepared received widespread condemnation, including from VanDerWerff and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, and led Brown to write, [...] "there is absolutely no universe in which that makes sense. At all. It was so logically unsound that it was distracting." [...] The notion that Rachel would not know that Cats had closed eleven years before was derided by Brown and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times, while Rachel and Kurt's encounter with [...] "the only friendly security guard in New York City" [...] was mocked by Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez. Several critics were disappointed that Quinn's ominous mention of plans for New York in [...] "Funeral" [...] came to nothing, including Benigno, who called her actual idea a [...] "cockamamie sabotage plot", though he credited Agron's scene as a [...] "great, wasted job in a great, wasted character", sentiments echoed by VanDerWerff and James Poniewozik of Time. Terron R. Moore of Ology.com gave the episode a [...] "C+", and likened Quinn's dropped plot to Will leaving for Broadway and Rachel disowning her love for Finn: [...] "the fact {{that none of this}} happened—and the fact that we know none of it would ever happen—is just another issue I <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show. I hope that next season, it actually grows a pair." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{describes}} {{a series of}} conflicts between reality and the Romantic ideal of uniting with nature. In the words of Richard Fogle, [...] "The principal stress of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual: inclusive terms which, however, contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain, of imagination and common sense reason, of fullness and privation, of permanence and change, {{of nature and the}} human, of art and life, freedom and bondage, waking and dream." [...] Of course, the nightingale's song is the dominant image and dominant [...] "voice" [...] within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This {{is not to say that}} the song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins summarizes the way [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] perform this when he says, [...] "we are dealing with a talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, any more than it could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions". However, there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nightingale.|$|E

500|$|Samus {{has been}} well {{received}} by the video game community. In 2001, IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters. She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website's users, the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie, especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates. Among their list of voted characters, IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that [...] "could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage {{to live up to}} the source material." [...] Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs [...] "Character Battle" [...] contests, winning the [...] "Character Battle V" [...] in 2006. In 2009, GameSpot featured her in their poll [...] "All-Time Greatest Game Hero", in which she lost to Mario in the semi-finals. Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity. The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that they <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character is by being her through gameplay, while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, [...] "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," [...] referring to the revelation that she is a woman. MMA and actress Ronda Rousey told GameSpot in a 2016 interview that she [...] "always wanted to be Samus" [...] if a live-action Metroid film is made.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E
