[...] "Hear anything that might prove useful?" [...] The Broken One saw Anne. [...] "Why, here is Anne. [...] What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed; [...] Tell me what is it?" [...] Anne just wagged her dress [...] With both hands held behind her. [...] "Guess," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, guess which hand? My my! Once on a time [...] I knew a lovely way to tell for certain [...] By looking in the ears. But I forget it. [...] Er, let me see. I think I'll take the right. [...] That's sure to be right even if it's wrong. [...] Come, hold it out. Don't change.--A Ram's Horn orchid! [...] A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder, [...] If I had chosen left. Hold out the left. [...] Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those, [...] Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?" [...] Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side, [...] And thought she wouldn't venture on so much. [...] "Were there no others?" [...] "There were four or five. [...] I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all." [...] "I wouldn't--so I wouldn't. You're the girl! [...] You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart." [...] "I wanted there should be some there next year." [...] "Of course you did. You left the rest for seed, [...] And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl! [...] A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck [...] Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans [...] To a discriminating appetite, [...] Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had [...] In bushel lots--doesn't come on the market. [...] But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all? [...] You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying. [...] You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe [...] With a lawyer at hand to find you out. [...] Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne. [...] You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn [...] You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper. [...] What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would. [...] Don't you defend yourself. If it was there, [...] Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?" [...] "Well, wait--it's common--it's too common." [...] "Common? [...] The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner." [...] "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper [...] To You--to you I mean--they're both too common." [...] The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers [...] As if with some idea that she had scored. [...] "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets. [...] It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though: [...] Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. [...] Somehow I'll make it right with her--she'll see. [...] She's going to do my scouting in the field, [...] Over stone walls and all along a wood [...] And by a river bank for water flowers, [...] The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, [...] And at the sinus under water a fist [...] Of little fingers all kept down but one, [...] And that thrust up to blossom in the sun [...] As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.' [...] Anne has a way with flowers to take the place [...] Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee [...] And lifts their faces by the chin to hers [...] And says their names, and leaves them where they are." [...] The lawyer wore a watch the case of which [...] Was cunningly devised to make a noise [...] Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut [...] At such a time as this. He snapped it now. [...] "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. [...] The lawyer man is thinking of his train. [...] He wants to give me lots and lots of money [...] Before he goes, because I hurt myself, [...] And it may take him I don't know how long. [...] But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: [...] The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup? [...] Just hook them {{on the inside of the}} pitcher. [...] Now run.--Get out your documents! You see [...] I have to keep on the good side of Anne. [...] I'm a great boy to think of number one. [...] And you can't blame me in the place I'm in. [...] Who will take care of my necessities [...] Unless I do?" [...] "A pretty interlude," [...] The lawyer said. [...] "I'm sorry, but my train-- [...] Luckily terms are all agreed upon. [...] You only have to sign your name. Right--there." [...] "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here [...] Where you can't make them. What is it you want? [...] I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to get it over with as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|E
