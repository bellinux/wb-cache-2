The Viennese court wanted to destroy the city first, but later they decided to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{counterbalance}} the importance of Szigetvár, which was still under Ottoman rule. Slowly the city started to prosper again, but in the 1690s two plague epidemics claimed many lives. In 1688 German settlers arrived. Only about one quarter of the city's population was Hungarian, the others were Germans or Southern Slavs. According to 1698 data, South Slavs comprised more than a half {{of the population of the}} town. Because Hungarians were only a minority of the population, Pécs did not support the revolution against Habsburg rule led by Francis II Rákóczi, and his armies pillaged the city in 1704.|$|E

As such, they decided to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a minimum, with only one flashback, in the fifth-season premiere [...] "The Wars to Come", in the entire series prior to the sixth season. However, Benioff and Weiss decided that the re-introduction of Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven would provide the narrative ability to show a flashback, by that providing a better understanding for both the characters and the viewers.|$|E

[...] "I Couldn't <b>Keep</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Myself" [...] features lush strings and electric piano, which according to one writer [...] "create a jaunty atmosphere that harkens back to early Kool and the Gang and the Blackbyrds." [...] Its narrator wants to brag to his friends about his new girlfriend's sexual abilities. [...] "Gangsta Groove" [...] adapts hip hop's [...] "" [...] trope in a humane story, compared by one writer to a blaxploitation theme. It draws on the funk music of Parliament-Funkadelic, Cameo, and the Ohio Players. [...] "Tonyies!

At its end, Raphael Wiggins sings the line [...] "last night a DJ saved my life", {{a reference to the}} 1982 song of the same name.

500|$|Some tennis commentators, {{including}} Murray himself, {{have spoken}} of a [...] "Big Three" [...] or [...] "Trivalry", with Murray {{behind the other}} three players. [...] Statistician Nate Silver, in 2014, even labelled the group the 'Big Three and a Half'. Andy Murray's overall record against the other {{three members of the}} Big Four is (as of August 2016) 28-55. Murray also briefly fell outside the top ten in the rankings in 2014, at the time {{the only member of the}} Big Four to have done so since 2006, following a drop in form after back surgery at the end of 2013. However, Murray features in the top ten on a number of Open Era records, including in quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals reached at Grand Slams, and is to date the only person in history to have won two Gold Medals in singles at the Olympic Games. In the ATP rankings he was the last of the Big Four to reach world No. 1, though he had by that time spent 76 weeks as No. 2. Murray's 3 Grand Slam and 2 Olympic Games victories since 2012 have seen him listed more comfortably alongside the other three members during the mid-2010s [...] His rise to reach the world No. 1 ranking in November 2016, and <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> finish the year at the top position, has further helped cement his position in the Big Four.|$|E
500|$|Sons of Soul {{expanded}} on {{the traditional}} R influences of The Revival, with upbeat funk and classic Motown styles. Songs such as [...] "If I Had No Loot", [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend", and [...] "Tell Me Mama" [...] incorporated lively tempos, strident harmonies, melodic hooks, and lead vocalist Raphael Wiggins' high tenor singing. Other songs were performed with funk grooves, including [...] "I Couldn't <b>Keep</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Myself", [...] "Gangsta Groove", [...] "Fun", and [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key". Rick Mitchell of the Houston Chronicle wrote that the songs' arrangements [...] "cleverly... integrate classic influences into contemporary grooves." [...] Carl Allen of The Buffalo News claimed that the album [...] "reconnected" [...] black popular music [...] "to its gospel/blues roots with hip-hop flair." [...] Along with older R, the album's music appropriated contemporary urban styles such as dancehall and hip hop, incorporating hip hop beats, turntable scratches, and samples, which were taken from both contemporary rap and older soul. Tony Green of the St. Petersburg Times viewed that Tony! Toni! Toné! incorporated musical aspects from their R and hip hop contemporaries, thereby [...] "representing black pop's Generation X. Mid- to late-twentysomethings caught [...] {{the tail end of}} the heyday of acts like Earth, Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder [...] found themselves getting smacked in the face by the rap revolution." [...] The group reproduced what they sampled with live instrumentation, which Keyboard magazine interpreted their as an analog approach to the principally digital hip hop genre.|$|E

So it was that Chad weakened and died after seven days– on 2 March, which remains his feast day. Bede writes that: [...] "he had always looked forward to this day– or rather his mind had always been on the Day of the Lord". Many years later, his old friend Egbert told a visitor that someone in Ireland had seen the heavenly company coming for Chad's soul and returning with it to heaven. Significantly, with the heavenly host was Cedd. Bede was not sure whether or not the vision was actually Egbert's own.|$|E

2500|$|Carved in Stone was {{followed}} up by their 1998 release, Tyranny. The album {{is a deeply}} political concept album, with themes including the nature {{of war and the}} military-industrial complex. Tyranny is also notable for the contributions made by a number of guest musicians. Beyond James LaBrie's vocal contribution to [...] "I Believe," [...] D. C. Cooper (vocalist of Royal Hunt) contributed vocals to the track [...] "New World Order," [...] and violinist Paul Chou made a guest appearance on the tracks [...] "Spoken Words" [...] and [...] "New World Order," [...] with the former featuring a duet between Mike Baker and Laura Jaeger.

Benoit's coworker and best friend, wrestler Chris Jericho, stated that from his own research on the condition, the symptoms [...] "fit Daniel to a tee, all across the board". With regard to those who had publicly stated that they had no knowledge of Daniel having the condition, Jericho said, [...] "If Chris had decided that he wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> himself, you wouldn't have been able to pry that out of him with anything."
