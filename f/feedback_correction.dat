25|$|Hearing {{plays an}} {{important}} part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a feedback mechanism to fix speech errors. If a single <b>feedback</b> <b>correction</b> occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a feed forward mechanism. This is apparent in some deaf people. Deafness, as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it. However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's feed forward mechanism still helping to fix speech errors, {{even in the absence of}} auditory feedback.|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} quality, reduce heavy-duty gear noise, {{and avoid}} edge contact in manufacturing helical gears, a closed-loop <b>feedback</b> <b>correction</b> method in topographic modification tooth flank is proposed {{based on the}} gear form grinding. Equations of grinding wheel profile and grinding wheel additional radial motion are derived according to tooth segmented profile modification and longitudinal modification. Combined with gear form grinding kinematics principles, the equations of motion for each axis of five-axis computer numerical control forming grinding machine are established. Such topographical modification is achieved in gear form grinding with on-machine measurement. Based on a sensitivity analysis of polynomial coefficients of axis motion and the topographic flank errors by on-machine measuring, the corrections are determined through an optimization process that targets minimization of the tooth flank errors. A numerical example of gear grinding, including on-machine measurement and closed-loop <b>feedback</b> <b>correction</b> completing process, is presented. The validity of this flank correction method is demonstrated for tooth flank errors that are reduced. The approach is useful to precision manufacturing of spiral bevel and hypoid gears, too...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of neural noise, which leads variability in motor commands, {{the central nervous system}} can effectively reduce movement variance at the end effector to meet task requirements. Although online correction based on feedback information is essential for reducing error, feedforward impedance control is another way to regulate motor variability. This Update Article reviews key studies examining the relation between task constraints and impedance control for human arm movement. When a smaller reaching target is given as a task constraint, flexor and extensor muscles are co-activated, and positional variance is decreased around the task constraint. Trial-by-trial muscle activations revealed no on-line <b>feedback</b> <b>correction,</b> indicating that humans are able to regulate their impedance in advance. These results demonstrate that not only on-line <b>feedback</b> <b>correction,</b> but also feedforward impedance control, helps reduce the motor variability caused by internal noise to realize dexterous movements of human arms. A computational model of movement planning considering the presence of signal-dependent noise provides a unifying framework that potentially accounts for optimizing impedance to maximize accuracy. A recently proposed learning algorism formulated as a V-shaped learning function explains how the central nervous system acquires impedance to optimize accuracy as well as stability and efficiency...|$|E

The writer took the second year students of SLTP Negeri 1 Baki Sukoharjo class G as the object. There are 42 students. The writer uses pre-test and post-test to get the data. The students are asked to make a good recount text. The data analysis is processed by statistical computation. The writer uses inferential statistics to prove the hypothesis. The result of the study shows that the student’s ability in their writing skill increases. It is shown in the difference of mean scores between the pre-test and the post-test. The difference of mean scores between the pre-test and post-test is 0, 66. The t value of the computation is 2, 785.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to differentiate between two models of motor lateralization: “feedback corrections” and dynamic dominance. Whereas the <b>feedback</b> <b>correction</b> hypothesis suggests that handedness reflects a dominant hemisphere advantage for visual-mediated correction processes, dynamic dominance proposes that each hemisphere has become specialized for distinct aspects of control. This model suggests that the dominant hemisphere is specialized for controlling task dynamics, as required for coordinating efficient trajectories, and the nondominant hemisphere is specialized for controlling limb impedance, as required for maintaining stable postures. To differentiate between these two models, we examined whether visuomotor corrections are mediated differently for the nondominant and dominant arms. Participants performed targeted reaches in a virtual reality environment in which visuomotor rotations occurred in two directions that elicited corrections with different coordination requirements. The <b>feedback</b> <b>correction</b> model predicts a dominant arm advantage for the timing and accuracy of corrections in both directions. Dynamic dominance predicts that correction timing and accuracy will be similar for both arms, but that interlimb differences in the quality of corrections will depend on the coordination requirements, and thus, direction of corrections. Our results indicated that correction time and accuracy did not depend on arm. However, correction quality, as reflected by trajectory curvature, depended on both arm and rotation direction. Nondominant trajectories were systematically more curvilinear than dominant trajectories for corrections with the highest coordination requirement. These results support the dynamic dominance hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The design {{luminosity}} of {{the future}} linear colliders requires transverse beam size at the nanometre level at the interaction point (IP), as well as stabilisation of the beams at the sub-nanometre level.

In principle, a beam-based intra-train feedback system in the interaction region can correct the relative beam-beam offset and steer the beams back into collision. In addition, this feedback system might considerably help to relax the required tight stability tolerances of the final doublet magnets.

This study investigated the effect of Coded-Correction Feedback (CCF) and Non-Coded <b>Correction</b> <b>Feedback</b> (NCCF) on the quality of Indonesian EFL students’ writing. It involved 53 senior high school students of 11 th Grade. Each student was exposed to two different treatments (CCF and NCCF) and the students’ writing quality, after receiving each type of treatments or WCF, was then measured. The effect of each feedback was estimated by comparing the individual students’ scores in writing composition after receiving CCF with their scores after receiving NCCF. The result of this study revealed that the quality of the students’ writing with CCF was better than that with NCCF. The findings of this study showed that the quality of the students’ writing receiving CCF was better than that receiving NCCF because CCF promotes awareness with noticing as well as understanding. Hence, the use of CCF can be considered more effective than NCCF.   Therefore, it is suggested that CCF be employed in giving corrective feedback to the students’ compositions to improve the quality of their writing, and that teachers employ CCF when giving WCF to improve the quality of students’ writing...|$|R
