5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
25|$|Some {{new mothers}} (and fathers) in the US will take unpaid time off, {{allowed by the}} <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act. The FMLA entitles {{eligible}} employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} to be a forerunner of the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, then teacher Ackerman {{successfully}} sued the Board in a landmark case which established the right of either parent to receive unpaid leave for child care. A quarter of a century later, now a Congressman, Ackerman in the House-Senate Conference Committee, signed the report of the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act which became the law of the land.|$|E

This led them to write the Awareness Protection Congressional Bill and the Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research Congressional Bill (http://www.cdhbills.org). In 2010, CHERUBS, along with several other organizations and thousands of CDH <b>families</b> <b>and</b> researchers, won the fight against the trademark.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, {{and care for}} an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E

25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers {{to be able to}} take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.|$|E
25|$|The CWA {{opposed the}} 1988 Act for Better Child Care (H.R. 3660), {{which would have}} {{provided}} government-sponsored child care for families in which both parents are working. The CWA also testified against the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act {{on the premise that}} it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} expresses {{support for}} raising the federal minimum wage to $15 {{an hour and}} indexing it to inflation, a plank supported by Sanders. The adoption of this point was a boost for the Fight for $15 movement. The platform also calls for ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and workers with disabilities, and for twelve weeks of paid <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> leave.|$|E

This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act {{against the state}} of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee’s claims.|$|E
25|$|Altmire gained {{national}} attention with {{his effort to}} guarantee enlistment bonuses of combat-wounded veterans and was the principal author {{of the law that}} expands the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act to cover military guard and reserve families.

25|$|Historically {{significant}} {{pieces of}} legislation have been enacted {{at the federal level}} to address the sex disparities in the workplace. These {{pieces of legislation}} attempt to address the wage gap in the U.S., gender discrimination in hiring and firing, and the occupational rights of workers in taking <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> leave. Despite these significant legislative efforts, the U.S. still lags behind other developed countries in progressive family-friendly work policies.|$|E

25|$|If {{government}} support for workplace family-friendly policies or childcare subsidies was stronger, more solutions could be attempted. For example, child care subsidies {{by the government}} actually result in less childcare and work disruptions and could impact low-income families as well by making childcare more affordable. However, {{government support}} is not {{at the level of}} other developed countries. Legislation such as the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act had little impact on gender inequality in care work and was strongly opposed by businesses.|$|E

25|$|Glimpses of {{television}} news programs {{reveal that the}} US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Having traced the rifle back to Hassan, the Moroccan police descend on his house and roughly question {{him and his wife}} until they reveal that the rifle was given to him by a Japanese man, and then sold to Abdullah. The two boys see the police on the road and confess to their father what they have done, believing {{at the time that the}} American woman has died of her wounds. The three flee from their house, retrieving the rifle as they go. The police corner them on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, possibly fatally injuring him. As his father rages with grief, Yussef surrenders and confesses to the crimes, begging clemency for his <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> assistance for his brother. The police take him into custody.|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E
2500|$|Dodd {{has also}} {{involved}} himself in children's and family issues, founding the first Senate Children's Caucus and authoring the <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act (FMLA), which requires larger employers to provide employees unpaid {{leave in the}} event of illness, a sick family member, or the birth or adoption of a child. To date, more than 50 million employees have taken advantage of FMLA mandates. He is working to support a bill that would require employers to provide paid <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> leave. For his work on behalf of children and families, the National Head Start association named him [...] "Senator of the Decade" [...] in 1990.|$|E
