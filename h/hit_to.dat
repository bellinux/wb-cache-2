5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted {{the focus of the}} musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.|$|E

5|$|Bickford was {{expected}} to start the 1948 season {{in the minor leagues}} due to lack of control. However, a friend of Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth stated that Bickford was likely better as a starting pitcher and reached the major league roster. His Major League debut was on April 24, 1948 in a 16–9 loss against the New York Giants. He entered in relief {{at the top of the}} fourth inning, after Al Lyons gave up three earned runs to start the inning. He got Sid Gordon to <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> a double play and after giving up a single to Johnny Mize, he retired Willard Marshall on a grounder to end the inning. He made his first career start against the Pirates, a 4–1 victory on May 19 in which he only gave up five hits. On June 7, he pitched a four-hitter in an 11–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, throwing five perfect innings before giving up a <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> Dick Culler to start the sixth inning. He finished with an 11–5 mark and a 3.27 earned run average as the Braves won the National League pennant and advanced to the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. In his only World Series appearance, he started Game 3, where he gave up one run on four hits in 3.1 innings pitched and was charged with the loss.|$|E
5|$|During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League {{in double}} plays {{made by a}} second baseman {{for the second year}} in a row, with 137. He also kept the Dodgers in {{contention}} for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants.|$|E
5|$|Edler was {{responsible}} for a knee-on-knee <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> Carolina Hurricanes captain Eric Staal in {{the quarterfinals of the}} 2013 IIHF World Championship, and was suspended for the final two games of the championship. Sweden {{went on to win the}} gold medal, and Edler was awarded a medal even though he did not play in the gold medal game. On 29 July 2013, the IIHF extended the suspension to cover Sweden's first two games of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Edler later joined team Sweden during the Olympics after his two-game suspension. He recorded a goal and two assists in the tournament, helping Sweden earn the silver medal.|$|E

5|$|It was the {{beginning}} of Koufax's breakout season. Posting an 18–13 record for the Dodgers in 1961, Koufax led the league with 269 strikeouts, breaking Christy Mathewson's 58-year-old NL mark of 267. Koufax was selected as an All-Star {{for the first time and}} made two All-Star Game appearances; MLB held two All-Star games from 1959 through 1962. He faced only one batter in the 9th inning in the first game, giving up a <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> Al Kaline and he pitched two scoreless innings in the second game.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E
5|$|Nicol {{made his}} major league debut for the Browns on September 23, 1890, {{starting}} the {{game against the}} Philadelphia Athletics {{that resulted in a}} 21–2 win. He did not allow a single <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the Athletics through seven innings, after which the game was called off due to darkness. Although the game was previously considered a no-hitter, a rule change made by the MLB's Committee on Statistical Accuracy in 1991 redefined the definition of a no-hitter; a no-hit game now had to span a minimum of nine innings. As a result, Nicol's debut was one of fifty no-hitters deleted from the official record books.|$|E

5|$|On June 23, 2017, Fister was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox. On June 25, Fister {{made his}} first start with the Red Sox, going 7 2/3 innings and {{striking}} out 5 batters, allowing 2 earned runs and getting the win in a 6-2 victory against the Cleveland Indians. On an August 22 start in Cleveland, Fister allowed a lead off home run to Francisco Lindor to briefly tie the score at 1-1, but this {{would turn out to}} be the only hit registered by the Indians as Fister would go on to pitch a complete game 1-hitter and not allow a <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the final 28 batters faced in the game in an eventual 9-1 Red Sox win.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope match between Randy Orton and Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes started the match by {{performing}} {{a series of}} elbows on Orton's head. Orton, however, took the advantage after hitting Rhodes' head several times with the cowbell, {{which was in the}} middle of the rope connecting the two men. After a final <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the head, Orton pinned Rhodes to win the match. After the match, Orton attempted to punt Rhodes in the head, but Rhodes' son, Cody, made the save.|$|E
5|$|Torres, a physical, forechecking {{forward with}} {{offensive}} capabilities, was suspended five times for illegal hits to opponents' heads. He received the fourth-longest suspension {{in the history}} of the NHL at the time for his <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the head of Marian Hossa in Game 3 of the 2012 Western Conference Quarterfinals. In October 2015, Torres received a 41-game (half-season) suspension for an illegal hit on Anaheim player Jakob Silfverberg. This is the longest suspension ever given by the NHL for a hit on another player.|$|E

5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Momchil was {{approached}} by agents of Kantakouzenos' opponents, the Constantinopolitan regency, and persuaded to turn against him. Thinking that Kantakouzenos and his Turkish allies from the Emirate of Aydin were far away in eastern Thrace, he attacked a Turkish fleet of 15 ships near Portolagos and sank three of them. He then overcame another Turkish force that arrived to exact retribution near the fortress of Peritheorion (also known as Burugrad), and plundered several cities {{in the area that}} refused to surrender. Afterwards, Momchil along with 1,000 horsemen attacked Kantakouzenos, who had set camp near Komotini with only 60 horsemen to protect him. The Byzantines were thoroughly routed: Kantakouzenos' horse was killed and he received a powerful <b>hit</b> <b>to</b> the head, which he survived thanks to his helmet. Momchil captured many of Kantakouzenos' men, but the claimant to the throne himself managed to escape in the turmoil.|$|E
