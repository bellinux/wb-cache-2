60|$|Sally {{managed to}} control her voice, though it <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gale {{paused and}} the white hand he raised expressively <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|This {{reassured}} Bostil, and {{he resumed}} his chair. But his hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{took up the}} Standard. In {{spite of}} his self-control, his hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Again the {{tell-tale}} color {{flickered in}} her face; then it vanished, {{and her voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Alfreton's eyes glistened, and {{his hand}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as he touched the rim of Winston's goblet.|$|R
60|$|Tuppence {{pulled herself}} {{together}} with an effort. Her voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but she spoke out bravely.|$|R
60|$|Dave {{sat down}} very quietly without a word, {{and the hand}} he laid on Hare's knee <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|The young man's hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as {{he raised}} his glass. He looked towards Jocelyn Thew almost appealingly.|$|R
6000|$|Anderson {{turned away}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{and ran his}} hand over the papers on his desk. Did she only imagine that his hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Something of her mistress's {{agitation}} {{seemed to}} have become communicated to Lenora. Her voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as {{she stepped into the}} elevator.|$|R
60|$|Arnold {{found it}} quite {{impossible}} to answer her lightly. The fingers, indeed, which held {{the receiver to}} his ear, were <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can tell}} you something,' said the lady, 'Riza <b>shakes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> He is too fond of first-fruits. His {{nomination}} will not be popular.' ...|$|R
60|$|Winston turned, and {{a curious}} smile crept {{into his face}} as he laid a lean hand that <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on the toilet table.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} soft {{and her voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as she leaned towards him. Something in his {{helplessness}} had kindled the protective spirit in her.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Flint {{went to the}} lamp, {{unrolled}} {{the ball}} of telegrams, seized one and crossed the room quickly, {{and held it out}} to her. His hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|The amazed Martha {{could only}} chafe the hands, and note sorrowfully the frightful {{changes in the}} face of her friend. The weirdly calm, slow voice began to <b>shake</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{reached and}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> iron bell. In shuffled a small Negro girl about twelve, barefoot, not very tidy, glowering {{at me with}} thumb in mouth and bulging eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Appleby made a last effort, but {{his voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as he said, “This is not your business, Harper. You can’t do {{anything}} for me. Don’t be a fool!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know--to-morrow, perhaps. I wonder, Belle," [...] he went on, {{his voice}} <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> [...] "if {{you will always}} think as badly of me as you do now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you want}} to be very careful," [...] remarked Codfish, his voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "The ink will be sure to spoil some things, not to mention the bad tomatoes." ...|$|R
60|$|Ennison's voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> They {{were his}} friends, and they {{recognized}} his unusual earnestness. Drummond, {{who had been}} about to speak, refrained. Cheveney walked away with a shrug of the shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, Jane, I {{always knew}} we'd {{get a look}} at them hosses again--I shore knew," [...] Lassiter was saying in the same old, cool, {{careless}} drawl. But his clawlike hands <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{blue glass}} lamp of the police-station came into sight, {{and for an}} instant she stopped. Then she was walking on again, her chin tilted. But her voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as she spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sidney {{is still}} unconscious," [...] she announced, her voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "The doctors seem hopeful--but oh! Sir Henry, it is terrible {{to see him}} lying there just {{as though he were}} dead!" ...|$|R
60|$|They now unfastened Ravonino {{from the}} pole, and found, to their great joy, {{that he was}} yet alive, though {{considerably}} <b>shaken.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> rice-soup, however, and a night's rest, put him all right again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dearest Edith rallies me, you see!' {{said her}} mother, shaking her head: which <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of itself sometimes, {{as if the}} palsy Bed now and then in {{opposition}} to the diamonds. 'Wicked one!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Prickly Porky {{turned his}} dull-looking eyes towards her, and in {{them was a}} troubled, worried look. [...] "Where's Pekan the Fisher?" [...] he asked, and his voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with {{something}} very much like fear.|$|R
60|$|The girl's hand <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as {{she opened}} the knife he passed her, and just then a cry came down faintly from one of the rooms above. Barbara swung round swiftly, and moved into the corridor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brimstone and gall,' thundered Hook, 'what cozening is here?' His {{face had}} gone black with rage, {{but he saw}} that they {{believed}} their words, and he was startled. 'Lads,' he said, <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> 'I gave no such order.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do as I tell you," [...] he ordered. [...] "If there's one of {{you here}} opens his lips about this, he leaves my service to-morrow. Not a dollar of pension, mind," [...] he added, his voice <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|The eyes of Madame {{seemed to}} narrow for a moment. Monsieur Louis lit a {{cigarette}} with fingers which <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and the fair face of Mademoiselle Flossie was suddenly white. Then they all three looked at one another.|$|R
60|$|It was unaccountable, but {{he almost}} fancied {{that he saw}} this new thing pass from her face, leaving her pale and tremulous. She looked away again and busied herself with the tea-caddy, but the fingers which held the spoon were <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he said, and {{his voice}} <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> [...] "I {{would have tried to}} thank you on behalf of the best comrade you or I ever had, only that I fancy he will be here in a minute to answer for himself." ...|$|R
60|$|He put {{his hand}} up and brushed at an {{imaginary}} something before his eyes. Then he loomed over her, and that hand, now <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> reached out for her veil. Before he could touch it, however, she swept it back, revealing her face.|$|R
60|$|His voice <b>shook</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and he paused. It {{seemed to}} Julia {{that she saw}} the man for the first time, and she wished passionately that Lucy could hear those words of his which he spoke so shyly, and yet with such a passionate earnestness.|$|R
