50|$|The quick-change barrel {{used in the}} AUG is cold hammer-forged by GFM-GmbH of Steyr Austria for {{increased}} precision and durability, its bore, chamber and certain components of the gas system are chrome-plated. The standard rifle-length barrel features 6 right-hand grooves and a rifling twist rate of 228 mm (1:9 in). An <b>external</b> <b>sleeve</b> is shrunk on to the barrel and carries the gas port and cylinder, gas valve and forward grip hinge jaw. There is a short cylinder which contains a piston and its associated return spring. The barrel locks into a steel insert inside the receiver through a system of eight lugs arranged around the chamber end and {{is equipped with a}} folding, vertical grip that helps to pivot and withdraw the barrel during barrel changes. The most compact of the barrels has a fixed vertical grip.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1939 the British {{government}} asked Smith & Wesson {{to design}} a light rifle firing the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge for military use. [...] The British government advanced one million dollars toward production of the design following receipt of prototypes assembled in accordance with a patent application filed on 28 June 1939. Testing at the Royal Small Arms Factory revealed the rifle had been designed for cartridges as loaded by United States civilian cartridge companies, and the higher pressure United Kingdom military loads caused broken receivers after as few as 1,000 rounds. The British government required redesign so rifles would withstand firing 5,000 rounds without failure. The receiver was strengthened with an <b>external</b> <b>sleeve</b> to meet that requirement. [...] Rifles with the strengthened receiver were designated Mark II and rifles with original receivers were subsequently referred to as Mark I. The British government cancelled the production contract after receiving 60 prototypes and 950 rifles. Approximately 750 were Mark I rifles, and about 200 were the stronger Mark II design. The rifles were not issued to the armed forces; and most were cut in half and dumped at sea when {{the second world war}} ended. Five were saved for display in museums including the Tower of London.|$|E

40|$|Realization of {{electrically}} boosted turbochargers requires {{electric motors}} capable of operating {{at very high}} speeds. These motors often use a permanent magnet rotor with the magnets retained within an interference fit <b>external</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Whilst {{it is possible to}} model such systems numerically, these models are an inefficient tool for design optimization. Current analytical models of rotors typically consider the stresses induced by the shrink fit of the sleeve separately from the stresses generated by centripetal forces due to rotation. However, such an approach ignores the frictional interaction between the components in the axial direction. This paper presents an analytical model that simultaneously accounts for interaction between the magnet and outer sleeve in both the radial and axial directions at designed interference and with the assembly subjected to centripetal and thermal loads. Numerical models presented show that with only moderate coefficients of friction and rotor lengths; axial load transfer between magnet and sleeve takes place over a short distance at the ends of the assembly. The paper then demonstrates how the analytical model aids definition of a feasible set of rotor designs and selection of an optimum design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{processing}} {{characteristics and}} difficulties of drum with fold line grooves are analyzed. Three kinds of CNC machining methods, namely three-axis linkage, single-axis servo and two-axis servo, are introduced. With CNC machining methods of single-axis servo and two-axis servo, the spindle motor of machine tool needs not to transform. A CNC system is developed which acquires the absolute {{position on the}} circle of drum through the spindle encoder and spindle zero position switch. It allows simultaneous servo position and velocity control of Z-axis AC servo motor or both Z-axis and X-axis AC servo motors. With the changes of angular displacement of spindle, the system manages the interpolation motion of X-axis and Z axis, so drums with fold line grooves {{can be achieved by}} this way. Both of these methods have been applied to transformation of machine tool with simple, economical and reliable operation. This paper also proposes three methods to improve the processing efficiency of the drum: increasing a function of return to zero rapidly, processing with more tools at the same time, processing <b>external</b> steel <b>sleeve</b> with fold line grooves and then installing it on a smooth drum...|$|R
40|$|The 9977 {{package is}} a {{radioactive}} material package that was originally certified to ship Heat Sources and RTG contents up to 19 watts {{and it is}} now being reviewed to significantly expand its contents in support of additional DOE missions. Thermal upgrading will be accomplished by employing stacked 3013 containers, a 3013 aluminum spacer and an <b>external</b> aluminum <b>sleeve</b> for enhanced heat transfer. The 7 th Addendum to the original 9977 package Safety Basis Report describing these modifications is under review for the DOE certification. The analyses described in this paper show that this well-designed and conservatively analyzed package can be upgraded to carry contents with decay heat up to 38 watts with some simple design modifications. The Model 9977 package has been designed as a replacement for the Department of Transportation (DOT) Fissile Specification 6 M package. The 9977 package is a very versatile Type B package which is certified to transport and store a wide spectrum of radioactive materials. The package was analyzed quite conservatively to increase its usefulness and store different payload configurations. Its versatility is evident from several daughter packages such as the 9978 and H 1700, and several addendums where the payloads have been modified to suit the Shipper's needs without additional testing...|$|R
40|$|The paperdeals with tubular, {{cast-iron}} columns {{which should}} be reinforced due to the planned new structural function of these elements.

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} vein {{is surrounded by}} an <b>external</b> <b>sleeve</b> of cardiomyocytes that are widely recognised {{to play an important}} role in atrial fibrillation. While intracellular Ca 2 + is thought to influence the electrical activity of cardiomyocytes, there have been relatively few studies examining Ca 2 + signalling in these cells. Therefore, using fluo- 4 and fluorescence imaging microscopy, we have investigated Ca 2 + signalling in an intact section of the rat {{pulmonary vein}}. Under resting conditions cardiomyocytes displayed spontaneous Ca 2 + transients, which were variable in amplitude and had a frequency of 1. 6 ± 0. 03 Hz. The Ca 2 + transients were asynchronous amongst neighbouring cardiomyocytes and tended to propagate throughout the cell as a wave. Removing extracellular Ca 2 + produced a slight reduction in the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous Ca 2 + transients; however, ryanodine (20 M) had a much greater effect on the amplitude and reduced the frequency by 94 ± 2 %. Blocking IP 3 receptors with 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (20 M) also reduced the amplitude and frequency (by 73 ± 11 %) of these events, indicating the importance of Ca 2 + release from the SR. Electrical field stimulation of the pulmonary vein produced Ca 2 + transients in cardiomyocytes that were significantly reduced by either voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel blockers or ryanodine...|$|E
40|$|The Valhall {{field is}} the largest field that BP {{operates}} on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, {{and is one of}} the most well known high porosity chalk fields in the Southern part of the North Sea. During many years of oil production, there has been compaction of the reservoir. The current casing design at Valhall has developed with time as the field has matured, and is affected by several considerations like casing shear in the overburden due to subsidence, non-uniform loading in the reservoir due to chalk production and compaction. The main objective of this thesis was to develop options that could be included in the current casing design, to guarantee a higher injection pressure than is available today at the Valhall field. The current design is limiting the maximum injection pressure in the water injectors, and the main factor is the use of 95 / 8 ” drilling liner combined with a cement squeeze job through a C-Flex port collar. This cement job is not approved as a barrier element as required by NORSOK. The injection pressure is today limited by the strength of the 133 / 8 ” casing shoe, which is lower than desired. The study involves reviewing BP’s casing design manual, the current casing design on Valhall, the special requirements for Valhall, and investigating several technologies that could provide potential solutions to the barrier challenges on Valhall. The recommended option is to include the <b>External</b> <b>Sleeve</b> Inflatable Packer Collar (ESIPC), Cement Assurance Tool and the C-Flex in the 95 / 8 ” drilling liner. The ESIPC would provide a good cement job in the liner annulus, as it would enable returns to be observed during the cement job, providing evidence that there is a cement column behind the drilling liner by a cement bond log. The C-Flex is included to make it possible to perform a cement squeeze job through the C-Flex additionally to the ESIPC or in worst case alone if the ESIPC fails. The Cement Assurance Tool is just an extra safety in case the cement around the liner would contract and make a micro-annulus, which could create a possible leak. This option would most likely provide a barrier element according to NORSOK. This barrier element is very important to be able to increase the injection pressure at a wanted level, which is approximately 6, 300 psi. At present time, the ESIPC is not strong enough to be included in a drilling liner. It has to be reinforced and tested before it could be included in the drilling liner to be able to withstand the large forces acting on the tool. The corresponding dual bottom-top wiper plug set has to be reinforced as well, because the plug set would be exposed to large forces during the losses, and when it is set inside the ESIPC...|$|E

40|$|Grouted splice sleeve {{connector}} system takes {{the advantages of}} bond-slip resistance of grout and mechanical gripping of reinforcement bars to provide resistance to the tensile force. In this system,grout acts as a load transferring medium and bonding material between bars and sleeve. This study adopted the end-to-end rebars connection method to investigate the effect of development length and sleeve diameter to the bonding performance of {{sleeve connector}}. The end-to-end method is referring to the condition where reinforcement bars were inserted into the sleeve from both ends and meet at the center before grout is filled. Eight specimens of grouted splice sleeve connector were tested under tensile load to determine their performance. Sleeve connector was designed using 5 mm thick circular hollow section (CHS) steel pipe and consisted of one external and two internal sleeves. The tensile test results show that connector with smaller <b>external</b> and internal <b>sleeve</b> diameter appear to provide better bonding performance. Three types of failure were observed in this research, which are bar fracture (outside the sleeve), bar pullout, and internal sleeve pullout. With reference to these failure types, development length of 200 mm is the optimum value due to its bar fracture type, which indicates the tensile capacity of the connector {{is higher than the}} reinforcement bar. ...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{method of}} thromboprophylaxis {{and the value}} of {{screening}} ultrasonography for detection of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in neurosurgery patients remains unclear.

A greater number of distal DVTs were detected with the implementation of whole-leg ultrasonography in the last 2 years of observation. Chart review of 237 patients diagnosed with DVT demonstrated an admitting diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage in nearly half of the patients. The median hospital length of stay for DVT patients was 18 days. Institutional control data demonstrated non-ruptured aneurysm and cerebrovascular anomalies to be the leading reason for admission, followed closely by subarachnoid hemorrhage. The hospital protocol of biweekly screening ultrasound and dual modality prophylaxis for neurosurgery patients resulted in a proximal DVT incidence consistent with that demonstrated by previous studies of standardized dual modality prophylaxis, and higher than that demonstrated in previous studies that employed ultrasound screening protocols...|$|R

The AGM-114L, or Longbow Hellfire, is a fire-and-forget weapon: equipped with a millimeter wave (MMW) radar seeker, it requires no further guidance after launch—even being able to lock-on to its target after launch—and can hit its target without the launcher or other friendly unit being {{in line of sight}} of the target. It also works in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, such as smoke and fog which can mask the position of a target or prevent a designating laser from forming a detectable reflection. Each Hellfire weighs 47 kg, including the 9 kg warhead, and has a range of 8000 m. The AGM-114R [...] "Romeo" [...] Hellfire II entered service in late 2012. It uses a semi-active laser homing guidance system and an integrated blast fragmentation sleeve warhead to engage targets that previously needed multiple Hellfire variants. It will replace AGM-114K, M, N, and P variants in U.S. service.|$|R
