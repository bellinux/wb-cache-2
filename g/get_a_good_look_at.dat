5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although he did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the creature, he describes it {{to the rest of}} the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E

Fortunately the Son of Sam couldn't see Chrissie and leaves, but not before Reacher <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at his posture and mannerisms.|$|R
50|$|Two gangsters, later {{revealed}} as Rocky and Leo, collect protection money from several local shops. A ballet teacher, Jill, cannot pay {{because of bad}} business and is beaten.

25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing quite a stir in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the monster up close.|$|E
25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In ecotone habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When {{they have access to}} enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use , such as termite mounds, to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their surroundings.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E

2500|$|Jim Emerson {{describes}} how the Coens introduced Chigurh {{in one of the}} first scenes when he strangles the deputy who arrested him: [...] "A killer rises: Our first blurred sight of Chigurh's face ... As he moves forward, into focus, to make his first kill, we still don't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him because his head rises above the top of the frame. His victim, the deputy, never sees what's coming, and Chigurh, chillingly, doesn't even bother to look at his face while he garrotes him." ...|$|E
2500|$|A St. Anthony {{police officer}} patrolling Larpenteur Avenue radioed {{to a nearby}} squad {{that he planned to}} pull over the car and check the IDs of the driver and passenger, saying, [...] "The two {{occupants}} just look like people that were involved in a robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just because of the wide-set nose. I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the passenger." [...] At 9:04p.m. CDT, the officer told a nearby officer that he would wait for him to make the stop.|$|E
2500|$|Brendan's {{curiosity about}} K-9 is matched only by Sarah's renewed concern over Lavinia's absence. They thus split up and follow their new-found obsessions. Sarah goes into town to {{question}} the locals, and Brendan stays behind to test the capabilities of Sarah's new [...] "pet". In town, Sarah discovers that Lavinia has become disliked by some because of her blunt letters to the local newspaper editors about a growing practice of witchcraft in the area. Brendan, meanwhile, is attacked while using K-9 to analyse soil samples in Lavinia's garden. His attackers, George Tracey and his son, Peter, are tied into the local coven. George Tracey flees before Brendan can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, however K9 uses his laser gun to stun Peter before setting off in pursuit of George. [...] Peter is pinioned and interrogated by Brendan, but makes his escape when Brendan goes outside to investigate a crashing sound {{which turns out to}} be the accidental destruction of a greenhouse by K9 in his pursuit of the elder Tracey.|$|E

5000|$|On Wednesday, December 12, 2012, {{at about}} 2:00AM, in Waltham, Massachusetts, {{on the campus}} of Brandeis University, an animal, thought to be a coyote, {{attacked}} a student walking back to her dorm. The animal appeared from dense cover and in a very dark location, and quickly disappeared, so the victim did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look.</b> Multiple residents had sighted a pack of coyotes in the area. The woman was treated for a tooth or claw wound.|$|R
2500|$|A strong, {{noxious odour}} {{coming from the}} rear of the plane was first {{reported}} to the cabin crew around 19:00. Flight attendant Judi Davidson, 33, traced the odour to the lavatory. She attempted to look into the lavatory but was forced back by thick grey smoke rapidly filling the small room; she then ordered the third ranking crew member to find Sergio Benetti, 37, the chief cabin crew officer, and ask him to investigate. As Benetti sprayed the interior of the affected lavatory with a CO2 extinguisher, Davidson reported the fire to the captain while 28-year-old flight attendant Laura Kayama began urging the passengers on the sparsely-populated flight to come away from the front and rear of the plane and sit close together near the over-wing exits. At no time did any of the cabin crew mention to either Cameron or Ouimet that they had not yet seen flames. [...] Benetti, the one person who had managed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the scene, had not reported seeing anything resembling the traditional causes of airline fires in pre-smoking-ban days: flames from a trash bin fire or the paper towel dispenser, both of which were commonly set ablaze by passengers smoking in the lavatories on long flights. First officer Ouimet went to investigate personally at 19:03, but was driven back by the thick smoke. At 19:04, Benetti reported that he thought the fire was probably out because he had completely doused the lavatory with fire retardant.|$|E

25|$|The {{group on}} the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars.
