5|$|By 1939, Low Fell {{had become}} the select suburb of Gateshead and had {{substantial}} and independent shopping facilities. All of the houses between Shipcote and the village were private and the owners added 'Low Fell' to their addresses, at times not even mentioning Gateshead, although, if we adhere to the original boundaries, they did not live in Low <b>Fell</b> <b>at</b> all".|$|E
50|$|Wainwright's {{clockwise}} walk {{starts from}} the highest point of the A6 at 1400 ft. The summits reached are Whatshaw Common at 1593 ft, Little Yarlside at 1691 ft, Great Yarlside (the third highest of the Outlying <b>Fells)</b> <b>at</b> 1986 ft and Wasdale Pike at 1852 ft.|$|R
50|$|Walks {{to the top}} of the <b>fell</b> begin <b>at</b> St Mary's Church, Whicham to the south; St Mary's Church, Whitbeck to {{the west}} or from the Corney Fell Road which crosses the <b>fells</b> <b>at</b> an {{altitude}} of 1,250 feet four miles to the north of the top. A more challenging and interesting route begins at Beckside Farm on the A595 road and follows Whitecombe Beck before ascending the Horse Back ridge. This ridge separates Blackcombe and Whitecombe on the eastern side of the fell, and gives good views into both combes.|$|R
50|$|The {{golf course}} harbors a rare groove of cork oaks, planted by last Dorga maharaj, Hari Singh before 1947 {{and the plants}} were {{imported}} from Europe. Cork had demand then, mostly for closing the bottles and the cork oaks and other trees escaped <b>felling</b> <b>at</b> the time of construction of the golf course.|$|R
5|$|Royal Athlete {{had gained}} {{popularity}} {{with the public}} after finishing third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and was sent to post at 17/2, providing Ben de Haan, the 1983 winning jockey, with his 11th and final ride in the race. He <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> Valentine's (the ninth).|$|E
5|$|The 100/1 {{outsider}} Santa's Son had led {{the field}} over the Canal Turn, but the short-distance runner eventually fell out of contention and jockey Jamie Moore pulled him up before the 27th fence. Killyglen <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> the 27th, having been close to leader Ballabriggs {{at the beginning of}} the second circuit.|$|E
5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> Pentecost. They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 {{to show that it}} was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E

5|$|After he {{was told}} that the Dutch had {{followed}} him, Tiku ordered most of his followers to return to Tondon while he and a group of fifteen, including his two wives, continued south. They first arrived at Ambeso, but the fortress fell several days later, at which time they evacuated to Alla'. This fortress <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> the end of March 1907 and Tiku began to work his way back to Tondon through the forest. He and the other leaders, Buginese and Torajan alike, were chased by Dutch troops. The other leaders capitulated to the Dutch and were sentenced to either three years in a prison in Makassar or exile to Buton. Tiku, meanwhile, stayed hidden in the forests.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact {{and led to}} a burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of a run, in six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Poulton top-scored for Australia with 23 from 28 balls, helping to stabilise the innings after the Australians had fallen to 2/10. However, she <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> 4/45, bowled by Holly Colvin, and eventually, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

50|$|Ransome {{says in a}} Note at the {{beginning}} that The stories in this book are those that Russian peasants tell their children and each other. It was written for English children who play in deep lanes with wild roses above them in the high hedges, or by the small singing becks that dance down the grey <b>fells</b> <b>at</b> home.|$|R
5|$|Following the World Cup, Belgium {{embarked}} on their qualification campaign for Euro 2016. Mertens netted his first brace for Belgium in their opening qualifying match, netting twice in three {{minutes in a}} 6–0 win over Andorra. The following year, he scored one and assisted another in a 3–1 win over Israel which ensured that Belgium secured top spot in their qualifying group. He was later named in Belgium's squad for the tournament proper and featured in all five of the nation's matches as Belgium <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> the quarter-final stage once again, this time losing out to Wales.|$|E
5|$|In {{its next}} game, however, the Demon Deacons <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> {{home to the}} No. 19 Virginia Tech Hokies, 27-6. The Hokies would later go on to finish second in the Coastal Division and earn a bid to the 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl. Wake Forest {{recovered}} from its second loss of the season to earn a 38-24 victory against Maryland—its first since 1998—clinching the Atlantic Division championship and earning a bid to the ACC Championship Game. Wake became the first team in ACC history to go 6-0 in ACC road games, and extended the school record for wins in a season to 10.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Arsenal <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> {{the last}} 16 {{stage for the}} third time in three years, losing 3–1 to Bayern Munich at home, but {{managing}} to win 2–0 in the return leg, meaning they went out on the away goals rule. They were once again eliminated by Bayern Munich in the 2013–14 season after losing 2–0 at home, and drawing 1–1 away at Munich. They were eliminated by Monaco in Round of 16 in the 2014–15 season on away goals, and by Barcelona 5–1 on aggregate in 2015–16. Arsenal exited at the last 16 for the seventh consecutive time to Bayern Munich, losing 10–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5000|$|Although Brent station lay at {{the foot}} of Dartmoor hills, the line leaving Brent <b>fell</b> steeply <b>at</b> 1 in 60 to Avonwick and {{continued}} falling, less steeply to Gara Bridge and almost to Loddiswell. Rising there at 1 in 50, it reached a summit at Sorley Tunnel, from where it <b>fell</b> again <b>at</b> 1 in 50 to Kingsbridge.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fells</b> <b>at</b> {{the present}} {{are being used}} for {{pleasure}} riding and competitive uses, pack-work, trekking and shepherding. The Fell pony {{can be seen in}} the horse show world, seen in in hand, under saddle, and working hunter pony classes. They also do well in driving and endurance riding. They are very suitable for riding and driving for persons with disabilities.|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
5|$|Light showers {{from the}} {{precursor}} front skirted Bermuda prior to tropical development, with 24-hour precipitation totals {{of no more}} than 0.87 in (22mm) recorded on the territory. Moisture brought on by the storm from afar enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in Bermuda; 1.75 in (45mm) of precipitation <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> L.F. Wade International Airport on July 18, with an additional 1.6 in (40mm) recorded the next day. Although the rains proved to be mostly beneficial, minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor-drainage areas.|$|E
5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire <b>fell</b> <b>at</b> this point.|$|E
40|$|The Usutu Pulp Company's forests cover 75, 000 ha (58, 000 ha planted) with {{an annual}} {{production}} of approximately 1 million tonnes of pulpwood (Evans, 1996) (Figures 45 and 46). The main species are Pinus patula Schiede ex Schlecht. andamp; Cham. (<b>felled</b> <b>at</b> {{an average age of}} 15 to 17 years) and P. elliottii Engelm. (<b>felled</b> <b>at</b> 16 to 22 years). The forests supply 3000 brown wet tons of pulpwood per day to an unbleached kraft pulp mill (see cover and Figure 48) which sells its product mainly into the sack and linerboard markets. Variation in wood quality is a problem for the mill because it adversely affects pulp quality. Wood quality variation could be better managed by the mill and even exploited if the underlying causes of the variation were understood. The objectives of this work were therefore {{to examine the effects of}} major genetic, physiological and environmental factors such as species, growth rate, age and elevation on wood and kraft pulp properties [...] . </p...|$|R
