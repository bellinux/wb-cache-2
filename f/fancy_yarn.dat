40|$|<b>FANCY</b> <b>YARN</b> is a yarn with {{deliberate}} imperfections. Strange {{as it may}} appear, {{in present}} times when defect-free yarn {{is considered to be}} a premium product, fancy yarns, with all their imperfections, are also in demand. It is a different matter that the volume production of <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> is insignificant in comparison to the normal yarn production. The demand for fancy yarns is due to the special aesthetic appeal it imparts to the fabric made using such fancy yarns. Fabrics produced using <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> find applications in normal and high-fashion clothing, curtains, carpets, upholstery fabrics, as a base for "effect" wallpaper manufacture and many more. Ring spinning is successfully employed to manufacture <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> Rotor spinning, which offers economical benefits over ring spinning, has also been employed to produce <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> A number of ideas have been applied in practice to produce <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> on rotor spinning machines. The approach of these conventional devices has been to control the speeds of the mechanical elements of the rotor spinning machine. Because the rotor spinning machine is a very high speed spinning machine, with the latest ones having rotor speeds of over 100 000 rpm, the conventional devices become limited in their approach, not application. A new approach is therefore necessary to produce <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> on rotor spinning machines. This work is a new approach in that direction. The principal idea is to affect the fibre flow without altering the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor spinning machine. To bring about this influence of the fibre flow, pressurized air has been employed for the first time. The concept of using pressurized air not only offers a new alternative to produce <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> on rotor spinning machines, but also offers a simple and relatively inexpensive route to <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> manufacture. Hence, this approach has been referred to as pressurized air method of producing <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> The fibres flowing in the fibre transport channel of the rotor spinning box are affected by pressurized air. This influence of the flowing fibres by the pressurized air causes the effects or the imperfections in the yarn being spun to result in a <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> The duration of the time the pressurized air is applied to affect the fibre flow, influence the characteristics of the effects such as thickness, length and appearance. By programming the pressurized air blowing time, effects can be produced in a predetermined way. In this way the need to alter highly frequently the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor spinning machine is obviated. As with the conventional methods employed on rotor spinning machines in the production of fancy yarns, the pressurized air method also has its own limitations. While the conventional methods can only produce effect lengths longer than the rotor circumference, the pressurized air method can only produce effect length shorter than the rotor circumference. But by combining the conventional method and the pressurized air method, the shortcomings of the two methods can be overcome in a unique way. This work, being the first of its kind, provides a fairly comprehensive understanding of the concept of using pressurized air in the production of fancy yarns on rotor spinning machines...|$|E
40|$|Currently, Japan's textile {{industry}} has been declining because the cheap fiber product of neighboring Asian countries is expanding the market. Therefore, Japan's {{textile industry}} differentiates itself by making <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> of fiber products. <b>Fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> has a high added value. We researched the creation of false twist yarn from the <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> We are considering applying a 1 /f fl uctuation to the yarn shape to add high value to the false twist yarn.

40|$|Abstract––Mechanical crimp texturising {{technique}} is {{making use of}} differential migration behavior of the constituent filaments during their torsional deformation as well as bending deformation. Types of yarn, yarn fineness, filament fineness, shape factor etc. are the detrimental factors for these extents of deformations. Fully drawn continuous filament yarns with contrasting colours, apart from variation {{in one or more}} contributing factors mentioned above were grouped together for the desired production of fancy yarns. Structure of <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> was analyzed by microscopical examination. The colour analysis of the product yarn was also done on Hunter lab colour measurement instrument Spectra Span 9100. This has permitted in identifying apparent colour of <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> scientifically, which is different than its parent yarn colour. Favorable transformation of cheaper and stronger flat filament feeder yarn structure to favourable crimpy/bulky yarn structure was an added gain of this production process. All the samples were also shown good crimp associated properties. Thus newly designed <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> produced out of flat filament yarn found to be a good option for value addition along with added comfort to apparel textiles as well as home furnishing...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used kinds of complex {{structure}} <b>yarns</b> are <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns.</b> <b>Fancy</b> <b>yarns</b> enable to obtain various, often distinctive, textile effects providing exclusivity to fabric. For these reasons, the majority of <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns</b> are used in the clothing industry and high fashion. However, these yarns are also used in the production of other textiles, in particular, in technical textiles. The aim of this work is to weave fabrics with <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns</b> in the weft, and to analyse the impact of the fatigue process on mechanical properties of fabrics. The object of research are 14 variants of fabrics with <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns</b> of different structure in the weft. Designed fabrics may be used in the manufacture of car seat upholstery. Fabrics were stressed in different fatigue cycles, i. e. 500 000 and 1 000 000 cycles. In addition, fabrics were stressed at the temperature of - 25 °C to maximize the stressing environment, and to mimic conditions in the use of fabric. The next stage of this work the mechanical properties of fabrics (breaking force, elongation and breaking work) were determined before and after fatigue with different number of cycles. Also, the impact of the fatigue process on mechanical properties of the analysed fabrics was evaluated. In addition, the impact of overfeed used during the manufacturer of <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns</b> to mechanical properties of fabrics of these yarns was determined. It was found in the study that the fatigue and the different number of cycles of fatigue affect mechanical properties of tested fabrics with <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns</b> in the weft. It was found that there is no correlation between overfeed used in the manufacture of <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns,</b> and mechanical properties of fabrics with these yarns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Broken silk thread {{is one of}} the {{numerous}} fancy yarns, and has been used in development of yarn-dyed textiles. However, the processing technology of traditional broken silk thread is very complex, and has restricted its wide application in the development of new textile products. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a novel spinning technology of broken silk <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> Some examples of broken silk thread, which spun silk or cotton yarn is used as core yarn and binding yarn, polyester filament is as used as effect yarn, are spun on the ring <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> twisting machine, and physical properties of these fancy yarns are tested and analyzed.

40|$|Abstract: Current global {{textiles}} and fashion industries have gradually shifted focus to high value-added, high sensibility, and multi-functional products based on new human-friendliness and sustainable growth technologies. Textile design CAD {{systems have been}} developed in conjunction with computer hardware and software sector advances. This study compares the patterns or images of actual woven fabrics and virtual fabrics prepared with a textile design CAD system. In this study, several weave structures (such as <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> weave and patterns) were prepared with a shuttle loom. The woven textile images were taken using a CCD camera. The same weave structure data and yarn data were fed into a textile design CAD system in order to simulate fabric images as similarly as possible. Similarity Index analysis methods allowed for an anal-ysis of the index between the actual fabric specimen and the simulated image of the corresponding fabric. The results showed that repeated small pattern weaves provide superior similarity index values than those of a <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> weave that indicate some irregularities due to <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> attributes. A Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity(CW-SSIM) index resulted in a better index than other methods such as Multi-Scale(MS) SSIM, and Feature Similarity(FS) SSIM, across fabric specimen images. A correlation analysis of the similarity index based on an image analysis and a similarity eval-uation by panel members was also implemented.

40|$|Both loop fancy yarns and frotte fancy yarns {{belong to}} the group of yarns with {{continuous}} effects. The difference between frotte and loop yarn relies {{on the fact that the}} loop yarn is constructed with two core yarns and the frotte yarn is constructed with only one core yarn. The differences are evident in the shape of these two types of fancy yarns. These shape differences are the functions of the tensions of component yarns during the twisting process. The shape and construction of the <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> influence its properties. The properties of loop and frotte fancy yarns, woven and knitted fabrics are compared in this article in order to find out the optimal yarn’s and fabric’s production condition to satisfy the final user and maintain low production costs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of attenuation by woven structures produced from hybrid yarns. The woven structures have been designed for protection against electromagnetic fields (EMFs). The idea of creating hybrid yarns that may intensively protect against EMFs comes from the analogy discovered between {{the construction of a}} fancy bunch yarn and an electric system composed of electro-conductive solenoids on a ferromagnetic material connected in series and then in parallel. The application of hybrid <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> as a weft made of copper as a special effect thread insulated with lacquer and wrapped around a core of steel thread in a textile fabric will enable EMF attenuation as a result of inducing an electromotive force in the special effect thread and magnetizing the core thread. In this way, the designed electric circuit (textile fabric) in the variable primary EMF will be the source of a secondary EMF directed opposite to the direction of the primary field. The fabricated woven structures present electrical and magnetic components of EMF attenuation in some narrow ranges...|$|E
40|$|A study {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the theoretical models of the fancy yarns. The investigated fancy yarns are of traditional structure, i. e., their effect intermediate product composed of two yarns as well as of complex structure – their effect intermediate product made of three yarns. The analysis is done using two theoretical methods for predicting the coil length of the binder yarn in the <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn.</b> Theoretical values of the coil length of the binder yarn of 29 types of investigated fancy yarns are compared with the experimental data. The experimental comparison was performed for various structure fancy yarns specially manufactured for this investigation and using data presented by the other authors. The comparison between the calculated coil length values and experimental data shows good agreement for 21 results (according to the 1 st and 2 nd method). Here the deviations not exceed 5 %. The developed analysis showed that the both theoretical methods could be used for the predicting of the geometrical indices of the fancy yarns, still the method satisfying the requirement of the precondition about the circle shaped cross-section of the effect intermediate product is more precise in many cases...|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{simplest}} division into continuous and point effects, {{the classification of}} fancy yarns does not exist. There is also no published complex guide concerning technological aspects of the production of fancy yarns. The elaboration of such guides could be time consuming and probably they would not fit exactly the requirements of rapidly changing industry and end-user demands. The geometry of the effects could {{be considered as a}} classiffing factor. Other factors supporting classification are the tensions of component yarns occurring during the twisting process. Thus we can classify knop yarn as a point effect <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn,</b> and according to the tension changes we rank knop yarn as a subgroup of bunch yarns. In the knop yarn group, the component yarns change their functions during the twisting process periodically {{one of them is the}} core yarn and next it changes the function to become an effect yarn. In this way one may obtain fancy colour effects. The properties of this type of yarn were investigated focussing on changing the twist and frequency of occurring effects using multiple regressions.

40|$|The {{researcher}} was {{studied the}} properties of vetiver grass, biomaterial from agriculture for developing textile products from vetiver grass fiber using a chemical process to extract cellulose and remove chlorophyll, resulting in cellulose lengths of between 3 to 10 centimeters monitored by microscope. The long section fibers are in bundles and cross-sections of vetiver fiber in polygon-shaped group. The vetiver fibers are hirsute, shiny, non-sulky and inflexible. The vetiver fiber size is rather large, strong, and tough with a tenacity of 2. 11 grams per denier, which is stronger than wool but {{not as strong as}} cotton fiber. When the fiber is wet properties are poor flexibility and toughness. To produce good-quality fiber, it must mixed with cotton fiber in a ratio of 50 : 50 by hand carding, then using a machine until the fibers are aligned and spun into yarn with a spinning wheel, resulting in thread that is large as <b>fancy</b> <b>yarn</b> suitable for a weft. The vetiver is put in a loom weaving in the thread by using a cotton wrap and vetiver fiber weft, using a small textile machine for blue viscose rayon warp and the vetiver thread weft. The result is a new style of vetiver cloth, with the structure of the fabric quite thick with a rough texture like hemp which looks distinctive and outstanding, and which may be used for many products such as women's dresses, place mats of dining table and other uses...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) were {{predominantly}} developed for {{applications in the}} biomedical and engineering industry, and {{only a limited number}} of applications in textiles are known. Fabrics made of natural fibres (e. g. cotton, flax and their mixtures) present many advantages, such as wearing comfort, but they are subject to creasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of compensating for this disadvantage by using SMAs to create aesthetic low crease flax/cotton fabrics. Body Temperature SMAs (BT SMA) that regain their (straight) form when they are subject to human body temperature were used for this purpose. Clothing and bed sheeting are potential applications of these hybrid structures, which become wrinkle-free when they are exposed to the heat of the body, a hair dryer or that generated by an electrical current. The materials selected to achieve this purpose were the following: (1) textile yarns (e. g. single cotton or flax/cotton yarns, two-fold flax yarns and two types of loop <b>fancy</b> <b>yarns)</b> and (2) BT SMA wires of 300 mu m diameter. A power weaving loom and a hand-weaving shuttle loom were used to embed the SMA wires, and four types of hybrid fabrics were produced. The thickness, wrinkle recovery, dimensional stability as well as the cohesion of the SMA wires in the woven fabric were tested. All the tests were performed before and after a washing cycle for both the hybrid and reference fabrics. An increase in thickness was noticed after washing, and the recovery time after crushing varied according to the type of fabric. The slippage of SMA wires from the fabrics was noticed for all the samples, which was dependent on the type of yarns used, their linear density and the weaving process...|$|R
