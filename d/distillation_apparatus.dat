5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected {{to become a}} part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented <b>distillation</b> <b>apparatus</b> to convert grape must into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of a project initiated a year ago to determine any differences in test results on recovered asphalt cements caused by the use of industrial grade of solvent as compared with the reagent grade. AASHTO specifies the use of reagent grade of trichlorethylene, but the Laboratory uses industrial grade which costs much less. Last year this objective of the project was aborted when it was found that a larger difference in test results was obtained between the two <b>distillation</b> <b>apparatuses</b> than between the two solvents, Then all efforts were directed toward obtaining uniformity in test results between the apparatuses under the east hood as compared with that under the west hood. Considerable progress was made toward this end. (See report under this same title dated April 1982). The objective this year was to again evaluate the results when using both variables (apparatuses and solvents). Another objective developed later in this investigation; this was to determine any differences in test results on recovered asphalt cements caused by the use of reclaimed trichlorethylene (from the distillation process) as compared with the use of industrial grade of solvent. At the present time the reclaimed trichlorethylene is discarded. If the reclaimed solvent could be used for further recoveries, a considerable savings in solvent costs would result...|$|R
25|$|Short path {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a short path <b>distillation</b> <b>apparatus</b> which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.|$|E

Methods: Essential oil was extracted by hydro <b>distillation</b> using clevenger <b>apparatus</b> and was analyzed for chemical constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Larvicidal activity was recorded after 12 and 24 h of post-exposure against three mosquito species, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefascia­tus. Dead larvae were identified when they failed to move after probing with a needle in the siphon or cervical re­gion. The LC 50 and LC 90 values for three mosquito larvae were calculated by Probit analysis. Results: The GC-MS analysis revealed that essential oil contains 23 different constituents. Out of these 23 constitu­ents, major constituents identified were n-tetracosane (39. 18 %), n-eicosane (30. 04 %), tetratriacotane (2. 97 %), 7 -oc­tadecanal (2. 81 %), and tricosane (2. 31 %). Essential oil from leaves of Coccinia grandis exhibited significant larvi­cidal activity against An. stephensi with LC 50 and LC 90 values 39. 41 ppm and 123. 24 ppm, respectively.

The study for componen-tial content of essential oil of 18 uncommon species from Lamiaceae {{family from the}} collection of Nikitsky Botanical Garden to increase therapeutic possibilities and their practical use in phytotherapy was the purpose of this paper. The plant species under study were introduced to the South Coast of Crimea from different ecological and geographic zones in seeds from botanical gardens of Europe. Methods. Every species was represented by 3 - 20 samples, which were studied by biomorpholofical and principal economically valuable features. The article presents the generalization and analysis of long-time studies for biologically active substances from 18 species of aromatic plants from Lamiaceae family. The content of essential oil was determined in a phase of mass blossom, from freshly harvested raw materials by means of hydro <b>distillation</b> at Ginsberg <b>apparatuses.</b> Componential content of essential oil was studied by the method of gas liquid chromatography. Results. Identification of the essential oils components allowed isolation of plant chemotypes with high content of valuable substances (methyl chavicol, carvacrol, pinen, thymol, and others). Highproductive samples (forms), prospective for industrial cultivation were isolated by the features complex. Based on the classification of A. D. Turova in phytotherapeutic action of plants and results of our studies, the isolated plant forms were distributed in 10 groups of usage in phytotherapy. On the example of Agastache foeniculum we showed that one and the same plant species may have different chemotypes, which have treatment and toxic action. Conclusion. The data obtained broaden and add the information about a chemical composition of plants and allow broadening the raw material base of medicinal plant by means of introduction of uncommon species from Lamiaceae family into cultivation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The total sale {{of brandy}} for 2007 in South Africa was R 7 300 000 000 and local {{statistics}} indicate that brandy {{is by far}} the most purchased spirit beverage. Sales of brandy even outweigh the total sales for whisky and the forecast for the estimated sales of brandy in the next five years is said to increase by 25 %. It is therefore crucial to investigate those factors that influence the production of brandy as better understanding and control of these processes leads to the production of a brandy that is consistent and of premium quality. Many factors influence the final outcome of distillates. Of these factors, the <b>distillation</b> technique, the <b>apparatus</b> used for the purpose of distillation together with the low wine is of utmost importance as they influence the sensory profile and the chemical composition of the distillate. The effect of different variations of pot still designs on the chemical composition and the sensory profile of the resultant distillate was investigated. Five different Pot still variations were used and varied with regards to the design of their pot still head and swans neck apparatus. Two low wines were used for the purpose of distillations and were both from 2007 vintage. GCFID was used to identify the volatile compounds found in the distillates and together with Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) a profile of the distillates was produced which was used to differentiate between the different pot still variations and their effect on the final product. The data generated from the QDA sessions was subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and together with the chemical analysis a correlation between certain compounds and sensory attributes were found in the distillates. Distillate samples were also subjected to a sensory style classification system and were classified accordingly. The chemical composition of the two low wines prior to distillations differed significantly from each other with low wine one containing a larger amount of total esters and carbonyl compounds whilst low wine two contained a larger amount of total higher alcohols and acids. The distillates of low wine one also contained over all larger amounts of total esters and in the case of the distillates of low wine two, they contained larger amounts of higher alcohols and acids than low wine one. Variation one was based on the Alambic Charentais method of pot still design and it was found that only variation one influenced the chemical composition and the sensory profile of the distillates. This variation produced a distillate with a lower amount of total esters and more specifically ethyl acetate as well containing a lower intensity of the fruit and sweet associated caramel aromas and flavours. The esters, ethyl acetate and the ethyl esters of the long chained fatty acids were found to correlate with the sensory attributes known as fruit associated aroma, soapy aroma, and spicy aroma and therefore indicated that these compounds are responsible for these attributes. There were no correlations found between the chemical compounds, sensory attributes and sensory style classifications in the distillates of both low wine one and two. It was shown that the addition of certain esters, carbonyl compounds, higher alcohols and acids in specific ratios could alter the sensory classification of the distillates. Therefore the chemical composition and the sensory characteristics of distillates are largely dependent on the chemical composition of the low wine prior to distillation rather than the pot still design. Therefore, with further research it could be possible to predict the outcome of the chemical composition of the distillates by analyzing the chemical compounds found in the low wine prior to distillation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die totale verkope aan brandewyn vir 2007 in Suid Afrika beloop R 7 300 000 000 en statistiek wys dat brandewyn by verre die mees gesogte spiritus drank is. Verkope van brandewyn is selfs meer as die verkope van whisky en die voorspelling is dat die verkope van brandewyn met 25 % gaan vermeerder in die volgende vyf jaar. Dit is dus belangrik om die faktore te ondersoek wat die produksie van brandewyn beïnvloed om sodoende die verstokingsproses te verstaan en te kontroleer om ‘n konsekwente kwaliteitsproduk op die mark te plaas. Baie faktore beïnvloed die finale produk. Faktore soos die distillasie tegnieke, die apperate wat gebruik word vir distillasie tesame met die rabatspiritus is van die uiterste belang aangesien dit die sensoriese profiel en die chemiese samestelling van die distillaat beïnvloed. Die effek van die verskillende variasies van potketelhelms op die chemiese samestelling van die distillate word ondersoek. Vyf verskillende helms met variasies in die swaannek ontwerp was gebruik. Twee verskillende rabatspiritus, van die 2007 oesjaar, was gebruik vir distillasie. GC-FID was gebruik om die vlugtige komponente van die distillate mee vas te stel. Kwantitatiewe Beskrywende Analise (QDA) is gebruik om ‘n profiel van die distillate op te stel wat weer gebruik is om te differensieer tussen die verskillende potketelhelm variasies en hulle effek op die finale produk. Die data wat deur die QDA sessies gegenereer was, is in die Vernaamste Komponent Analise (PCA) ingevoer en tesame met die chemiese analise is ‘n korrelasie tussen sekere komponente en die sensoriese analise van die distillate gevind. Distillaat monsters was ook aan sensoriese styl van klassifikasie onderwerp en is as volg daarvan geklassifiseer. Die chemiese samestelling van die twee rabatspiritus voor finale distillasie het betekenisvol van mekaar verskil ten opsigte daarvan dat die eerste rabatspiritus het hoë konsentrasies esters en karboniel verbindings gehad terwyl die tweede rabatspiritus meer hoë konsentrasies van sure en hoër alkohole gehad het. Die distillaat van die eerste rabatspiritus het ook hoë konsentrasies esters en karboniel verbindings gehad terwyl die distillaat van die tweede rabatspiritus weer hoë konsentrasies van sure en hoër alkohole gehad het. Variasie een is gebaseer op die Alambic Charentais van potketel ontwerp en daar is ook gevind dat hierdie variasie die enigste een was wat die chemiese samestelling en die sensoriese profiel van die distillate beïnvloed het. Hierdie variasie het ‘n distillaat geproduseer wat lae konsentrasies van totale esters, veral etielasetaat, sowel as laer intensiteit van vrugtige en soet geassosieerde karamel aromas en geure. Die esters, etielasetaat en etiel esters van die lang ketting vetsure, is gevind dat dit goed korreleer met die sensoriese eienskappe wat geassosieer word met vrugtige aromas, spesery-agtige aromas en seperige aromas. Daar is geen korrelasie gevind tussen die chemiese verbindings, sensoriese eienskappe en sensoriese styl van klassifikasie van distillate een en twee nie. Dit was ook bewys dat byvoeging van esters, karboniel verbindings, sure en hoër alkohole, in spesifieke verhoudings, die sensoriese eienskappe kan verander. Dus is die chemiese samestelling en sensoriese eienskappe van die distillate grootliks afhanklik van die chemiese samestelling van die rabatspiritus, voor die tweede distillasie, as wat dit afhanklik is van die potketelhelm ontwerp. Gevolglik, met verdere v navorsing, is dit moontlik om die uitkoms van die chemiese samestelling van die distillaat te voorspel deur die analise van die chemiese verbindings van die rabatspiritus te ontleed...|$|R
