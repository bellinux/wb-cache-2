5|$|These {{simulations}} {{showed the}} basic idea of how a single large planet can shepherd the smaller extreme trans-Neptunian objects into similar types of orbits. It was a basic proof of concept simulation that did not obtain a unique orbit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> as they state there are many possible orbital configurations the planet could have. Thus they did not fully formulate a model that successfully incorporated all the clustering of the extreme objects with an orbit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> But {{they were the first}} to notice there was a clustering in the orbits of extremely distant objects and that the most likely reason was from an unknown massive distant planet. Their work is very similar to how Alexis Bouvard noticed Uranus' motion was peculiar and suggested that it was likely gravitational forces from an unknown 8th planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid. The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{planet and}} its host star were {{selected}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) {{as part of a}} competition for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, for some systems that did not already have proper names.

Both names derive from Norse mythology: Rán is the goddess of the sea and Ægir, her husband, is the god of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Solaris {{features}} Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude {{is the central}} musical theme of Solaris. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach's music featuring Artemyev's composition atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at story's end.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The present {{work has}} {{analyzed}} and discussed {{the effect of}} gravitational force on the walk-run transition speed on <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> of <b>the</b> solar system. A walk-run transition speed at different gravity level has been calculated. Our results suggested that by increasing gravity level, the walk-run transition speed occurred at faster speed whereas the corresponding Froude numbers remain constant in normal and high gravities. The most significant effect of gravity on the Froude number was observed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> with gravity lower than the earth. In addition, the rates of oxygen consumption at the walk-run transition speed for these celestial objects have been predicted. The {{results showed that the}} rate of oxygen consumption <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> are at <b>the</b> highest <b>for</b> those which have a gait transition at Froude number of greater than 0. 5...|$|R

5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The {{last line of}} defense <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E
