2500|$|Between 1908 and 1910, the AEA {{produced}} four aircraft, {{each one}} {{an improvement over}} the last. Curtiss primarily designed the AEA's third aircraft, Aerodrome #3, the famous <b>June</b> <b>Bug,</b> and became its test pilot, undertaking most of the proving flights. On July 4, 1908, he flew [...] to win the Scientific American Trophy and its $2,500 prize. This {{was considered to be}} the first pre-announced public flight of a heavier-than-air flying machine in America. [...] On June 8, 1911 Curtiss received U.S. Pilot's License #1 from the Aero Club of America, because the first batch of licenses were issued in alphabetical order; Wilbur Wright received license #5. [...] The flight of the <b>June</b> <b>Bug</b> propelled Curtiss and aviation firmly into public awareness. [...] At the culmination of the Aerial Experiment Association's experiments, Curtiss offered to purchase the rights to Aerodrome #3, essentially using it as the basis of his [...] "Curtiss No. 1, the first of his production series of pusher aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|From 1891, Bell {{had begun}} {{experiments}} at Baddeck and Hammondsport to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. By 1908, {{the success of}} the AEA was seen in a series of ground-breaking designs, culminating in the Silver Dart. [...] By the time the Silver Dart was constructed in late 1908, it was the Aerial Experiment Association's fourth flying machine. One of its precursors, the <b>June</b> <b>Bug,</b> had already broken records. It won the Scientific American Trophy for making the first official one mile (1609 m) flight in North America.|$|E

2500|$|Jabari Darnell Wilkes: (played by: Seasons 1–6 Tanner Scott Richards, Season 7–8 Kendré Berry) is Maya and Darnell's son. He {{was born}} when Maya was only 16 years old. A running gag {{in the series}} is Toni's habit of mispronouncing his name by calling him names such as Jumanji, Gymboree, Jujube, Jacuzzi, Jalebi, <b>June</b> <b>bug,</b> Djibuti, Jaboobooboo, Jamal, Jafifi, Jamiroquai, Jimmy Crack Corn, Jungle Jim, Juwanna Mann, Jeep Cherokee, Jolly Rancher, Jakarta, Jingle-jangle, Jehoshaphat, Jambalaya, Japetso, Jaboomboom, Jappuccino, and Jam On It.

2500|$|In North America, the Canadian-American Aerial Experiment Association {{was founded}} by Alexander Graham Bell, who had {{made a number of}} earlier {{experiments}} with tetrahedral kites, and John McCurdy and his friend Frederick Walker Baldwin, two recent engineering graduates of the University of Toronto, on 30 September 1907. [...] The AEA produced a number of fundamentally similar biplane designs, greatly influenced by the Wright's work, and these were flown with increasing success during 1908. [...] Baldwin flew their first design, Red Wing on 12 March 1908, flying 97m (319ft) before crashing and being damaged beyond repair: its successor, White Wing, equipped with ailerons, made three flights in May, the best of 310m (1,017ft), before being destroyed in a crash. On 4 July 1908 their next aircraft, the <b>June</b> <b>Bug</b> piloted by Glenn Curtiss, won the Scientific American trophy for the first officially observed one kilometer flight in North America. After the AEA's disbandment at the end of March 1909, one of its American members went on to start a growing US-based aviation firm.|$|E
2500|$|The AEA's work {{progressed to}} heavier-than-air machines, {{applying}} {{their knowledge of}} kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the Red Wing, framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine. On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America. The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons {{as a means of}} control). One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft. [...] The White Wing and <b>June</b> <b>Bug</b> were to follow {{and by the end of}} 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments. Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was named}} by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell after the common Phyllophaga, a beetle known colloquially in North America as the [...] "June bug," [...] because <b>June</b> <b>bugs</b> were {{observed}} to fly similarly to aircraft: they have large stiff outer wings for gliding, and more delicate smaller propeller-like wings that do the actual propulsion.|$|R

50|$|Phyllophaga is a {{very large}} genus (more than 260 species) of New World scarab beetles in the {{subfamily}} Melolonthinae. Common names for this genus and many other related genera in the subfamily Melolonthinae are May beetles, <b>June</b> <b>bugs,</b> and <b>June</b> beetles. They range in size from 12 to 35 mm and are blackish or reddish-brown in colour, without prominent markings, and often rather hairy ventrally. These beetles are nocturnal, coming to lights in great numbers.|$|R

A country glass lamp was balanced on a rough shelf, and under it a young man sat absorbed in making notes, and apparently oblivious to the noise around him. Every gentleman in the room was collarless, coatless, tieless, and vestless. Some were engaged in fighting gnats and <b>June</b> <b>bugs,</b> while others battled with mosquitoes--all save the young man who wrote, he being wholly indifferent.|$|R

5000|$|There {{exists a}} ToonHeads episode that never aired called [...] "The Bugs Bunny 12". The episode {{was to have}} {{featured}} twelve Bugs Bunny cartoons that have been banned from airing on Cartoon Network's 2001 [...] "June Bugs" [...] marathon due to Bugs' enemy being an ethnic/racial stereotype, though most have aired on Cartoon Network before, such as Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt, What's Cookin' Doc (which was banned because it had clips from Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt), Herr Meets Hare (which aired on the ToonHeads special about World War II-era cartoons), Any Bonds Today (which aired, albeit edited, on the ToonHeads special about lost and rare animated shorts from Warner Bros), and Frigid Hare (which aired following Chuck Jones' death in 2002 {{as part of a}} special, four-hour compilation of Looney Tunes shorts).

5000|$|There was media {{attention}} in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as <b>June</b> <b>Bugs,</b> promising to broadcast every Bugs Bunny animated short in chronological order. The network {{originally intended to}} include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (some of them part of the Censored Eleven list of Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using ethnic stereotypes, albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure no children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent, however, considered it likely {{that there would be}} complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, [...] "We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that".|$|R
2500|$|Boars can be {{damaging}} to agriculture. Populations {{living on the}} outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. They generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34–47% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, {{as was the case in}} Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the 'wild boar famine'. Still within Japanese culture, the boar's status as vermin is expressed through its title as [...] "king of pests" [...] and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) [...] "When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar." [...] In Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as <b>June</b> <b>bugs</b> under control. The growth of urban areas and corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented, and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.|$|R
