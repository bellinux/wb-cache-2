The maximum reach of the spectrum-sliced dense wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (SS-DWDM PON) system with data transmission speed 2. 5 Gbit/s can be fairly limited by chromatic dispersion (CD) because of large optical bandwidth per channel compared to the bit rate.

40|$|The Broadband {{photonics}} (BBP) project {{under the}} Freeband consortium of projects investigated {{the design of}} a dynamically reconfigurable photonic access network. Access networks form a key link in ensuring optimal bandwidth to the end user without which any improvements deeper in the network in the aggregation or core segments are mitigated. Optical fiber deployment in the access are a natural choice as the bandwidth de- mands increase and Passive Optical Networks (PONs) form a preferred way of im- plementing fiber deployments. PONs have a logical Point to Multi-Point (P 2 MP) topology where in the <b>downstream,</b> the <b>Optical</b> Line Termination (OLT) broad- casts to all Optical Network Units (ONUs) while in the upstream, it is a many-to- one transmission and is contention based. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) ac- cess is one way of arbitration and in this thesis a qualitative analysis and comparison of the leading TDM based PON standards- EPON and GPON is presented. In traditional PONs, the average bandwidth available per user depends on the num- ber of ONUs supported by a single OLT. Typically the OLT-ONU association is fixed. The BBP network concept extends the view of a fiber plant deployment to a stack of logical PONs where multiple wavelength pairs are used to support a number of "logical" PONs. In this network, a headend based OLT transmits the down- stream data by modulating a C-Band, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) laser. In addition it transmits the light of a Continuous Wave (CW) DWDM laser, also in the C-Band, which is modulated with data by a Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (RSOA) in an ONU and used for upstream communication. The ONUs are thus wavelength agnostic. The OLT-ONU association is thus dynamic and depends on the wavelength pair added/dropped towards the ONU. The bandwidth availability to an end user can be optimised on an inter-PON basis. The research work focuses on the techniques to realise the bandwidth optimisation using Linear Programming techniques and de- scribes the service delivery architecture that can be realised to ensure an optical ser- vice delivery to the end user using conventional protocols of operation.

The gases used in this study were argon and krypton between 13 and 530  mbar. The distribution of the 2 p excited states of both gases was measured using optical emission spectroscopy, and the density of argon metastable atoms in the 1 s 5 state was deduced using tunable laser absorption spectroscopy. The amount of power absorbed was measured using calorimetry and X-ray transmission. The results showed a plasma confined around the X-ray beam path, its size determined mainly by the spatial dimensions of the X-ray beam and not by the absorbed power or the gas pressure. In addition, the X-ray absorption showed a hot central region at a temperature varying between 400 and 1100  K, depending on the incident beam power and on the gas used.

The hydrodynamic separator proposed is a closed-loop device developed to separate co-mingled waste into plastics, glass and other dense particles and organic sludge. The glass and other dense material stream is cleaned by the system, permitting efficient <b>downstream</b> <b>optical</b> sorting to take out metals and ceramics and, if required, glass sorted by colour. The plastics and the organic sludge are separate, processable waste streams. As the solid waste is introduced in the separator, the action of water jets located on the ramps of a fixed sinusoidal-shape bottom and the presence of hydrofoils at the upper part of the tank produce a flow pattern that lead plastics towards its collection point on the surface, while glass and ceramics are settled to the bottom of the tank and transported to the extraction point.

40|$|Since {{the launch}} of the Fermi satellite, BL Lacertae has been {{moderately}} active at ?-rays and optical frequencies until 2011 May, when the source started a series of strong flares. The exceptional optical sampling achieved by the GLAST–AGILE Support Program of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope in collaboration with the Steward Observatory allows us to perform a detailed comparison with the daily ?-ray observations by Fermi. Discrete correlation analysis between the optical and ?-ray emission reveals correlation with a time lag of 0 ± 1 d, which suggests cospatiality of the corresponding jet emitting regions. A better definition of the time lag is hindered by the daily gaps in the sampling of the extremely fast flux variations. In general, optical flares present more structure and develop on longer time-scales than corresponding ?-ray flares. Observations at X-rays and at millimetre wavelengths reveal a common trend, which suggests that the region producing the mm and X-ray radiation is located <b>downstream</b> from the <b>optical</b> and ?-ray-emitting zone in the jet. The mean optical degree of polarization slightly decreases over the considered period and in general it is higher when the flux is lower. The optical electric vector polarization angle (EVPA) shows a preferred orientation of about 15 °, nearly aligned with the radio core EVPA and mean jet direction. Oscillations around it increase during the 2011 – 2012 outburst. We investigate the effects of a geometrical interpretation of the long-term flux variability on the polarization. A helical magnetic field model predicts an evolution of the mean polarization that is in reasonable agreement with the observations. These can be fully explained by introducing slight variations in the compression factor in a transverse shock waves model...|$|R
30|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is the preferred}} technology in optical access networks since it offer resistance to chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD), multiple services access and high spectral efficiency [1, 2]. However, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) not only increases complexity of digital-to-analogue (D/A) and analogue-to-digital (A/D) converters, but also causes signals nonlinear distortion since it makes the power amplifier (PA) work in a non-linear area in optical access systems [2 – 8]. Hence, OFDM signals with low PAPR are desirable for optical signals access. In [9], there are many PAPR reduction techniques are introduced and analyzed. Amongst these techniques, selected mapping (SLM) {{is one of the}} promising methods for reducing PAPR influence because it is simple to achieve and not introduce any distortion [10]. Recently, SLM method is introduced into generation of (16 quadrature amplitude modulation orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplexing) 16 QAM-OFDM signals in millimeter wave optical access systems for solving high PAPR problem [11, 12]. In Ref. [13, 14], though high PAPR reduction of OFDM using recurring SLM with cyclic block codes scheme and a modified SLM scheme have been proposed, the BER performance has not been analyzed and their applications had not been carried out in communication systems. In this paper, a modified SLM technique is introduced for reducing the PAPR and enhancing reception performance of the downstream 8 QAM-OFDM signals in optical access systems. Compared with 4 QAM-OFDM signals, 8 QAM-OFDM signals are selected as the downlink signals in this scheme, because 8 QAM-OFDM signals can improve system capacity and spectrum efficiency. Moreover, generation and detection of 8 QAM-OFDM downstream signals is easier to implement than 16 QAM-OFDM signals. The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) curves are measured for analyzing the PAPR influence, when traditional SLM and one modified SLM methods are adopted. Compared with the traditional SLM technique, the PAPR value of 8 QAM-OFDM <b>optical</b> <b>downstream</b> signals with 128 subcarriers is reduced by almost 2  dB using modified SLM when the CCDF value is 10 − 2. Moreover, the bit error rate (BER) performance will be improved, as 10 Gbit/s 8 QAM-OFDM optical downlink signals are transmitted over single mode fiber (SMF) with different access length using this scheme.|$|R
40|$|RNA-seq {{sequencing}} has {{revolutionized the}} landscape of whole transcriptome sequencing and analysis. With its capacity of sequencing in a high-throughput and low-cost way, it produced ever increasingly amount of RNA-seq reads that are mines of treasure in biological and therapeutic studies. However, due to the complex nature and relatively un-developed knowledge base of transcription process, many challenges exist in the modeling and investigation of RNA-seq read data. It is of high importance to develop efficient computational tools to satisfy these needs. The {{first part of this}} thesis concentrates on algorithms for both upstream and downstream analysis of RNA-seq data. For the upstream, we aim to tackle down the problems of RNA-seq reads alignment where the segmental alignment causes the major difficulty. By employing a strategy of rigid extensive tries on read segmentations indices, we implemented an accurate algorithm for returning two-segmental alignments based on bi-directional BWT. For the downstream analysis, we study two types of gene fusion events which {{play a critical role in}} the formation of cancers. Unlike previous down-scoping-search methods, we applied a search-validate approach to design the framework. By introducing key techniques such as masking, two-segmental alignment and retention of multiple maps, we developed an efficient and robust tool for detecting gene fusions with high accuracy that proved by extensive simulation and real data tests. Optical mapping is a cutting edge technique for the study of genomic structural variations which address the defect and limitation of paired-end sequencing. It was designed with great improvement in accuracy, resolution and throughput than current techniques. Also, it produces much longer molecules which enables us to explore genomic regions rich in repetitive sequences. Optical mapping has the potential to enable us to draw a complete picture of the genome structure polymorphism and it is important for us to design tools for analysis of the data. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the algorithms for both upstream and <b>downstream</b> analysis of <b>optical</b> map data. For the upstream, we formulated a robust scoring function, which combines the effectiveness of heuristic functions and the accuracy of statistical functions. Based on it, we implemented the high performance OMDP algorithm. For the downstream, we developed BP-OMDP which makes use of both split-mapping and disparity of coverage depth to call inversions in NA 12878 human genome sample. published_or_final_versionComputer scienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
