5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Starc {{was signed}} by the Sydney Sixers for the inaugural Big Bash League, {{followed}} by the Champions League T20. In the 2014 Indian Premier League, he was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore and quickly became their key bowler in the IPL 2015 edition. After missing {{the beginning of the}} tournament with injury, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> continued on with his good form from the World Cup.

25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn to give it up. Cho had come back in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, it was even more unbelievable. Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. This certainly showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E

25|$|Kumble {{is one of}} the 4 bowlers, {{alongside}} Richard Hadlee, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, and {{the only}} Indian bowler ever, to have taken 5 wickets in a Test innings more than 30 times. He also holds the world record for the largest number of caught-and-bowled dismissals in tests, 35– which forms 5.65% of his total wickets. He is also one of 4 Indian bowlers to have conceded over 250 runs in a Test match, although he took 12 wickets in that match. He is known for bowling tirelessly, having bowled 72 overs in a Test innings once.

25|$|During the journey, the Cimarrons carried {{most of the}} supplies, such as {{bows and}} arrows for defense against the Spanish. Once {{they arrived at the}} spot where they planned to carry out their ambush in Nombre de Dios, a Cimarron spy was sent to the Spanish post to find out when the {{treasure}} procession would begin. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reported that Treasurer of Lima was to appear on the road within the next few hours. At one point, two Cimarrons were sent to kidnap a sleeping Spanish guard and question him about the Spanish treasure. He confirmed what the English already knew and begged not to be killed. When the mule train arrived with the treasure, the Spanish saw a Cimarron hiding and quickly turned the procession around. Drake and his men still managed to ambush the train but found that it did not carry anything of much value. The Cimarrones vowed to Drake and the English that they would continue being their friends and allies.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they handed the {{scapegoat}} {{over to him}} who was to lead it away. All were permitted to lead it away, but the Priests made it a rule not to permit an ordinary Israelite to lead it away. Rabbi Jose said that Arsela of Sepphoris once led it away, although {{he was not a}} priest. The people went with him from booth to booth, except the last one. The escorts would not go with him up to the precipice, but watched from a distance. The one leading the scapegoat divided the thread of crimson wool, and tied one half to the rock, the other half between the scapegoat horns, and pushed the scapegoat from behind. And it went rolling down and before it had reached half its way down the hill, it was dashed to pieces. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sat down under the last booth until it grew dark. His garments unclean become unclean from the moment that he has gone outside the wall of Jerusalem, although Rabbi Simeon taught that they became unclean from the moment that he pushed it over the precipice.|$|E

500|$|After Budington and the {{remainder}} of the crew were rescued and returned to the United States, the board of inquiry continued. Budington attacked Tyson's credibility, disputing Tyson's claim that he had obstructed Hall's efforts to sail the ship further north. He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he [...] " [...] it a practice to drink but very little". Bessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that [...] "My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm cup of coffee. And anyone knows what the consequences of that might be." [...] Bessels testified that Hall was [...] "taken by hemiplegia", and his left arm and side were paralyzed, and that he had injected Hall with quinine to correct his elevated temperature before he died.|$|E

2500|$|One {{remaining}} competitor was Octave Lapize. In {{the fifth}} stage, Defraye {{had problems with}} his knees, and was more than fifteen minutes behind Lapize. Defraye came back, and kept Lapize one point behind him in the general classification.

The eighth stage was a flat stage, and the fight was expected {{to continue in the}} ninth stage. Before the ninth stage, Lapize was only 2 points behind. During that stage in the Pyrénées, Defraye broke away on the Col de Portet d'Aspet, and Lapize could not follow. Later, Lapize stopped in protest because all the Belgians were riding for Defraye. Lapize said: [...] "How can you expect me to challenge in such conditions?" [...] The rest of his team La Française, the two remaining Charles Crupelandt and Marcel Godivier did not start the next stage, also in protest.|$|E
2500|$|... “A baiji named Saraswatibai, {{renowned for}} her singing, {{had come from}} Kashi. We wanted {{to listen to her}} singing. She charged six hundred rupees for a single night’s performance. We sent Shyamsundar, “Go and bargain, see what you can manage.” Shyamsundar went and could fix her up for three hundred rupees. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> said, “Three hundred rupees and two bottles of brandy.” On hearing about the brandy we were taken aback, mummy could object. Shyamsundar said, “She cannot sing without taking brandy.” Everything was ready. Saraswati entered the gathering. She was demure, round nosed, nothing great. Natore said, “Abanda, what have you done? Just thrown away three hundred rupees.” She was going to sing two songs. Natore was ready to {{accompany}} her on the mridangam. As the clock struck ten she started singing. One song and it was eleven at night. Natore was paralysed with the mridnagam in his lap. The wonderful voice of Saraswati reverberated around that dance-hall. How wonderfully she had tuned her voice. Some of us with pillows in our laps, others with hands close to our hearts, we were all wonderstruck. The gathering was won over with just one song. Everyone was still immersed in the song, when Saraswati said, “Aur kuch farmaiye.” (present your wish). After listening to her, no one dared to put anything forward. Then I told Shyamsundar, “Ask her to sing a bhajan. We have heard that bhajans of Kashi are very famous.” She sang a bhajan known to all, “Ao to Brajachandalal...” (Come oh, Lord!) Everybody was dumbfounded...|$|E
