The recent methods for <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detection are used only motion and color characteristics thus many wrong alarms are happening and this is decrease {{the performance of the}} systems. This research presents a new method for <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detection through image processing. In this algorithm all objects in an image is considered and then check them to figure out which objects are <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>fire.</b> The color, motion and disorder are useful characteristics in <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detection algorithm. Smoke of fire will blur the whole or part of the images. Thus by processing of the video frames, different objects will detect. Due to evaluate the features of objects, the goal objects (<b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke)</b> can be defined easily. Two-dimensional wavelet analysis is used in the presented method. The results of this research present the proposed features that can reduce the wrong alarms and increase the system performances...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical studies of <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> {{movement in the}} cavity of double-skin glass facades. The experimental tests were conducted using a two-storey rig with double-skin facade installed. Test results showed that double-layer of toughened glass panes broke when the temperatures reached about 600 [*]°C– 800 [*]°C; the <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> plume from the fire room {{were more likely to}} impede on the external skin in the cavity at the steady burning stage, and this could cause the external skin to break. The FDS model was employed to simulate one of the experimental tests and further used to study the effect of <b>fire</b> sources <b>and</b> cavity depths. Numerical modellings show good agreement when comparing the modelled temperatures with the measured temperatures next to the internal skins and external skins. For fully-developed fires in the modelling scenarios, the <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> plume hit the external panes without any attaching to the internal panes. The <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> plume could break the external skin but the internal skins are safe at low temperatures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the flight deck <b>and</b> cabin <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> incidents reported to the Canadian airworthiness authorities over a ten year span. The <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> related diversions are categorized to identify areas where efforts could be increased to improve safety. The costs of diversions are estimated to identify areas where operators could reduce costs by seeking technologies {{to reduce the number of}} diversions without any impact on safety. Only twenty-eight investigation reports into <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> incidents onboard aircraft have been published over the past three decades. These reports are not sufficient to identify areas where operators can reduce their operating costs. The Canadian airworthiness authorities received over 1, 000 <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>fire</b> incidents from the years 2001 to 2010, of which, over 680 reported <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> in the flight deck and cabin compartments for various makes and models of aircraft. Some of these flight deck and cabin incidents were related to in-flight entertainment or galley systems that were remedied while in-flight and did not require a diversion in most cases. The remaining incidents were found to be related to ingestion of oil, de-icing fluids and equipment and electrical failures that, in many cases, prompted the pilots to declare an emergency and divert. This paper categorizes the flight deck <b>and</b> cabin related <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> incidents to suggest specific areas for airframers and operators to focus their efforts in reducing flight diversions that will not only reduce costs, but improve safety.
