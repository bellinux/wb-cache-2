30|$|Building on {{previous}} studies on “scale structure” (Rappaport Hovav and Levin 2010, Rappaport Hovav 2008, Kennedy and Levin 2008, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> <b>McNally</b> <b>2005,</b> Beavers 2008, Kennedy 2001, Hay et al. 1999), Lin and Peck (2011) propose that Chinese motion morphemes {{can be classified}} into four types. This section introduces the notion of “scale” and the classification of Chinese motion morphemes. In Motion Morpheme Hierarchy, we will show that the order of motion morphemes in MMMCs can be predicted based on the four classes of motion morphemes.|$|E
30|$|According to Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2010 : 28), a {{scale is}} “a set of degrees—points or {{intervals}} indicating measurement values—on a particular dimension (e.g., height, temperature, cost), with an associated ordering relation” (also Kennedy 2001, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> <b>McNally</b> <b>2005,</b> among others). Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2010) {{point out that}} the path of a motion event is composed of continuous points ordered between the moving object and a reference object, and the ordered points indicate measurement values on the dimension of distance, so that the path can be understood as a spatial scale. Furthermore, they state that when the moving object moves along the path, its relative distance with respect to the reference object changes too, so the change can be understood as a scalar change that is measurable on the dimension of distance. For instance, according to them, the verb ascend lexicalizes a scale with its points ordered in the direction against gravity; the distance between the moving object and the reference object (e.g., the ground) keeps increasing as the moving object continues ascending.|$|E
40|$|The {{debate over}} epistemic contextualism has {{recently}} {{raised the question}} whether propositional knowledge attributions were gradable predicates. Contrary to Stanley (2005), I argue that they exhibit genuine constructions of degree. However, these constructions are limited in several important ways; most importantly, they only include what I call “qualitative modifications ” (well / better than) as opposed to “quantitative modifications ” (much / a lot / more). Drawing {{on the work of}} <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> <b>McNally</b> (<b>2005),</b> I argue that the absence of quantitative modifications shows that know itself is not gradable, but that know well is. An interpretation of these constructions is put forward, according to which know well operates on degrees of epistemic justification which is not at the same time degrees of knowledge. I explore an extension of the account into a unified semantics for the various gradable constructions that occur with know, and indicate its distinctive predictions. I conclude by listing several unsolved issues. The putative gradability of propositional knowledge ascriptions has recently been the subject of a debate among philosophers. Epistemic contextualists such as Cohen (1999) have drawn an analogy between know and context-sensitive gradable adjectives like tall. 1 Stanley (2005) has ar...|$|E

This assumption, together with recent insights on the semantics of scalar adjectives (Hay et al., to appear; <b>Kennedy,</b> 1999; <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> <b>McNally,</b> to appear), leads us to an explanation for a myriad of facts that have heretofore resisted analysis, despite extensive research spanning two decades.

40|$|Radical contextualists have {{observed}} that the content of what is said by the utterance of a sentence is shaped in far-reaching ways by the context of utterance. And they {{have argued that the}} ways in which the content of what is said is shaped by context cannot be explained by semantic theory. A striking number of the examples that radical contextualists use to support their view involve sentences containing color adjectives (“red”, “green”, etc.). In this paper, I show how the most sophisticated analysis of color adjectives within the explanatory framework of compositional truth conditional semantics—recently developed by <b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> <b>McNally</b> (Synthese 174 (1) : 79 – 98 2010) —needs to be modified to handle the full range of contextual variation displayed by color adjectives...|$|R

40|$|Alrenga (2005, 2006) {{indicates}} that same and different have both non-scalar and scalar uses in English. The former (i. e. non-scalar use) introduces the (non) -identity relation held between individuals/objects, such as “His car {{is different from}} mine”, while the latter (i. e. scalar use) introduces the (dis) similarity relation held between individuals/objects, such as “His watch is almost the same as mine. ” Interestingly, yiyang and buyiyang in Chinese also have such a contrast, as in (1) and (2). Whereas (1 a, 1 b) asserts the identity/non-identity relation held between his pen and mine, (2 a, 2 b) asserts his idea and mine are similar/ dissimilar in all pragmatically relevant respects. In this paper, I propose that both yiyang and buyiyang can serve as (non) -identity and (dis) similarity predicate in Chinese. On the one hand, when they introduce the (non) -identity relation, they act as the absolute adjectives (i. e. non-scalar use). On the other hand, they act as the gradable adjectives (i. e. scalar use) when they introduce the (dis) similarity relation, since they can receive some degree modifications. In addition, unlike buyiynag, yiyang can directly take a clausal complement as the property of being shared (i. e. the dimension of identity). Specifically, there are two pieces of evidence for the constituency between yiyang and the clausal complement, one comes from {{the scope of the}} question particle ma, as shown in (3); the other comes from the ellipsis-like behavior of yiyang, as shown in (4). Finally, based on the previous works on the semantic typology of gradable predicates (<b>Kennedy</b> <b>and</b> <b>McNally</b> (<b>2005)</b> etc.), I suggest the fact that yiyang and buyiyang receive different degree modifications can be attributed to their lexical semantic properties and scalar structures. In particular, I propose that both yiyang and buyiyang are absolute gradable adjectives whose scale structure is closed [...] -The former is partially closed (i. e. closed on its upper bound) while the latter is totally closed (i. e. closed on its both ends). Key words: comparison of identity, similarity, identity predicate, gradable adjectives, scal...|$|E

Corpus data from Boas (2000) strongly support our conclusions. The central idea of this analysis is that resultatives involve an abstract ‘path’ argument corresponding to degrees along the scale denoted by the resultative predicate. This approach is broadly consonant with conclusions reached independently in other recent work. This independent evidence includes the cross-linguistic parallels between resultatives and locative paths observed by Beck and Snyder (2001); Vanden Wyngaerd’...|$|R
50|$|On {{the topic}} of trauma <b>and</b> memory, Richard <b>McNally</b> (<b>2005)</b> wrote that {{memories}} are not videotapes of our experiences, meaning {{that they are not}} unchangeable records. The mechanism that retrieves a memory involves activation of several areas of the brain. Similarly, the mechanism that encodes a memory requires the use of different parts of the brain. Any fault in the encoding-retrieval system will degrade memory, and there are many potential faults, such as distortion by emotion, or focusing on the peripheral details at the expense of central details. An example of the latter is the well-known phenomenon where a person being robbed at gunpoint is so distracted by the gun that they don't have time to encode the robber's face.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the notion of scale as {{presented}} by two different theories: one, semantic, which sees it as property of the lexical item (MCNALLY; <b>KENNEDY,</b> 1999; 2005), <b>and</b> another, pragmatic, to which it is inferred from context (FAUCONNIER 1975). By applying <b>Mcnally</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> (<b>2005)</b> notions on Brazilian Portuguese and isolating the deadjectival verbs, we've noticed that, though it seems possible at first to classify these verbs through the categories proposed by these authors, such systematization is troublesome as the criteria for categorization are blurred between the properly semantic and the pragmatic, thus compromising the analysis. Through this study, we've differentiated the two types of criteria, stating, likewise, the limitations of both analyses, and we've proposed measures for a more refined model, reassuming Rappaport's (2008) initial ideas...|$|R
40|$|In the International System of Units (SI), ‘meter’ {{is defined}} in terms of seconds and the speed of light, and ‘second’ {{is defined in}} terms of {{properties}} of cesium 133 atoms. I show that one consequence of these definitions is that: if there is a minimal length (e. g., Planck length), then the chances that ‘meter’ is completely determinate are only 1 in 21, 413, 747. Moreover, we have good reason to {{believe that there is a}} minimal length. Thus, it is highly probable that ‘meter’ is indeterminate. If the meter is indeterminate, then any unit in the SI system that is {{defined in terms of}} the meter is indeterminate as well. This problem affects most of the familiar derived units in SI. As such, it is highly likely that indeterminacy pervades the SI system. The indeterminacy of the meter is compared and contrasted with emerging literature on indeterminacy in measurement locutions (as in Eran Tal’s recent argument that measurement units are vague in certain ways). Moreover, the indeterminacy of the meter has ramifications for the metaphysics of measurement (e. g., problems for widespread assumptions about the nature of conventionality, as in Theodore Sider’s Writing the Book of the World) and the semantics of measurement locutions (e. g., undermining the received view that measurement phrases are absolutely precise as in Christopher <b>Kennedy’s</b> <b>and</b> Louise <b>McNally’s</b> semantics for gradable adjectives). Finally, it is shown how to redefine ‘meter’ and ‘second’ to completely avoid the indeterminacy. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
