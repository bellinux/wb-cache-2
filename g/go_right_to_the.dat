2500|$|The Court {{appears to}} be saying that LGE simply {{licensed}} Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{was pretty}} hungry, but it warn't {{going to do}} for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my {{remainders}} if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was [...] "baker's bread"--what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.|$|E

50|$|The ski {{industry}} {{was one of}} the businesses which benefited by the railway stop. In the 1940’s, private ski facilities were opened to the public. Skiers could take a 7:00am train from Union Station to Craigleith Station, then board the Weider horse-drawn sleigh for 25 cents which would <b>go</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ski hill now called Blue Mountain. Father Don Plater drove the sled. The ski train service was suspended in 1942 due to the war effort and shortage of rail transportation. Service to Craigleith Station resumed after World War II in 1947 and continued until the 1960’s when transportation via automobile reduced ridership severely. In 1991, the neighboring railway corridor was secured by the Ontario Trails Council and is now the Georgian Trail.|$|E

[...] Using Canadian pop culture reference points, Toronto's Eye Weekly calls it, [...] "Scrappy as hell, yet often charming, it's a lost Degrassi High episode remade as an amateur porn flick and sometimes as sweet as all that candy."
