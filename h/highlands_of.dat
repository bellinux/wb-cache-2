The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E

Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest quality, is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E
