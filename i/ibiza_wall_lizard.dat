50|$|The <b>Ibiza</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis pityusensis) is {{a species}} of lizard in the Lacertidae family. It is most closely {{associated}} with the island of Eivissa, or Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands, but has become naturalised in parts of Spain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ibiza</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{feeds on}} small {{invertebrates}} including {{a high proportion}} of ants when they are available. It also eats vegetable matter, especially during the summer. Females produce a single clutch of one to four eggs. These hatch after a few weeks and the hatchlings are about 3.2 cm long from snout to vent. They become sexually mature at the age of one and a half or two years.|$|E

50|$|The Skyros <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{exhibits}} island gigantism {{on small}} islets surrounding Skyros. The Skyros <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> also exhibits a throat color polymorphy with six different throat color morphs that {{are expressed in}} both females and males.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ibiza</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{grows to}} a maximum snout-to-vent length of 7 cm but adults are usually a little smaller than this. The tail is about {{twice as long as}} the body. It is robust with a short-head and rounded body with {{relatively}} coarse, slightly keeled scales. The dorsal surface is usually green but can be grey or brownish. There is usually a well-defined pale dorso-lateral stripe and there may be a row of dark spots or a dark line running along the spine. The underside is white, cream, grey, orange or pink and the throat and occasionally the belly may be blotched with darker colour.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ibiza</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{native to}} the islands of Ibiza and Formentera in the Balearic Islands and the {{neighbouring}} rocky islets. It has been introduced to Muella de Palma (Mallorca), Barcelona where it once was assumed it died out but was 're-discovered' in 2007 (Bruekers, 2007), the town of Aleria in southern Spain and the island of Gaztelugatxe in northern Spain. It is found at altitudes of up to 475 m above sea level. This lizard largely inhabits vegetated areas especially in association with man. As well as gardens, pasture and arable land it is found on rocks, especially near the coast. On some small islets it may be very common and live almost exclusively on rock.|$|E
50|$|Intralocus sexual {{conflict}} {{diminishes the}} benefits of sexual selection. Examples of intralocus sexual conflict can be seen all throughout nature. In the <b>Ibiza</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis pityusensis), intralocus sexual conflict exist over color. In this species, color {{is used as a}} signal of male fighting ability. Males that are more brightly colored are perceived as better fighters. As lizards in this species age, they become larger and more colorful. During mating seasons, males will typically compete for females and resources by fighting with each other. Males will select opponents based on the intensity of the color of their opponent’s coat. Females of this species also possess brightly colored coats. This trait is detrimental for females, since being colorful makes them more conspicuous to males and predators. However, in males, being colorful helps males win fights and increases their reproductive success. Another example {{can be seen in the}} features of the soay sheep (Ovis aries) horns, and the length of the serin finch’s (Serinus serin) tail. Males that possess larger horns or longer tails in these species have higher success during male competition and increased reproductive success. However, these features require a great deal of energy for females to possess and do not benefit females in any significant way. In humans, males and females who appear to be more masculine in their physical appearance for their sex report to have brothers that score a higher mate value relative to their sisters. Similarly, individuals who are of normal weight and have higher levels of estradiol are positively correlated with higher mate values in women, and higher levels of testosterone are positively correlated with higher mate values in men. Individuals that are physically and hormonally more masculine tend to have brothers that are fairly more attractive than their sisters, while more feminine individuals have sisters that are more attractive than their brothers. This suggests that intralocus sexual conflict can mediate and determine the fitness of an individual.Another classic example is the human hip, where females need larger hips for childbirth as opposed to smaller hips (optimal for walking) for males. The genes that affect hip size must reach a compromise that is at neither the male optimum nor the female optimum.|$|E

50|$|Podarcis muralis (common <b>wall</b> <b>lizard)</b> is {{a species}} of lizard with a large {{distribution}} in Europe and well-established introduced populations in North America, where it is also called the European <b>wall</b> <b>lizard.</b> It can grow to about 20 cm in total length.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} endemic to Sicily and the Aegadian Islands, {{though it is}} absent from the northeastern part of Sicily. It frequents areas with lush {{vegetation}} {{on the edges of}} woodland, bushy slopes, pasture and cultivated land. It is often present in gardens, especially irrigated ones. In contrast to the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> it does not climb much and occupies more densely vegetated areas. It is the commonest <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> inland while the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is the more common near the coast.|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} lizard {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis taurica), the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and the green lizard (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand lizard and green lizard is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand lizard and green lizard. Furthermore sand <b>lizard</b> and balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> share roughly the same food source and moreover green lizard could possibly pass into a predator of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> juveniles also. Therefore sand lizard and green lizard became competitors (or predators) of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three lizard species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R

50|$|Podarcis is a genus of lizards. Its members {{look very}} similar to lizards of the genus Lacerta, {{to which they were}} {{considered}} to belong until the 1970s. While similar externally and ecologically, Podarcis form a distinct group differing from Lacerta by the construction of the skull and the hemipenis, and by the processes of the caudal vertebrae. They are commonly known as <b>wall</b> <b>lizards.</b> They are native to Europe and northern Africa, and most species are restricted to the Mediterranean region. The Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the common <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> have been introduced to North America.|$|R
