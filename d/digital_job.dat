30|$|This study {{addresses}} four {{specific and}} related topics of interest. First, we exploit unique data {{to analyze the}} determinants of <b>digital</b> <b>job</b> search in Peru by considering both Internet and mobile-phone channels. Second, we evaluate the overall effectiveness of public LMI on reducing unemployment spells and improving the match quality of workers to jobs. Evidence {{in this area is}} mixed, highly dependent on the research design and corresponds mainly to developed countries (e.g., Bishop 1993, Ashenfelter et al. 2005, Meyer 1995). Third, we compare the effectiveness of digital versus non-digital labor market intermediation within the public system. Finally, we analyze whether it is the technology or the set of information available to jobseekers that matters most. We then compare the impacts of restricted versus unrestricted information sets while holding fixed the information technology.|$|E

30|$|In sum, {{this section}} has {{uncovered}} evidence on key covariates {{that affect the}} access and usage of <b>digital</b> <b>job</b> search channels in Peru. Poverty {{and the lack of}} availability of Internet cafes seems to be the main barriers for Internet-based job search, while the presence of offspring, a computer-at-home, labor-market experience and high expectations on job gain prospects are positively related to this activity. The use of mobile phones for job search purposes, on the other hand, seems to be more idiosyncratic with respect to Internet-based search, although it is clear that disadvantaged men and migrant individuals are more prone to use it. Only two variables have a consistent positive effect for both digital channels: labor-market experience and job gain expectations, variables that are usually overlooked in the analysis of digital job-search channels.|$|E
30|$|By turning our {{attention}} to Panel B, one observes that job seekers who have previous job experience and are optimistic about future job-market prospects are disproportionally {{more likely to use}} both Internet and mobile phone channels for job search purposes. Those who had never worked show a 30 -percentage point lower probability of using <b>digital</b> <b>job</b> search compared to those with previous job experience, while jobseekers that are optimistic about the probability of finding a job in the near future are 16 percentage points more likely to search for jobs using digital technologies. The former result suggests that past labor-market experiences have made workers more aware of the possibilities of digital technologies, while the latter suggests a virtuous circle between digital labor-market intermediation and job gain expectations in developing settings (Dammert et al. 2013). Finally, no other labor-market variable, such as the type of worker or job-quality attributes, matters.|$|E
40|$|The print {{production}} workflow consists of various disparate systems — from production equipment to management information systems. During {{the production of}} a printed product, information regarding the product must be communicated between the systems in the workflow. Job Definition Format (JDF) is an industry standard that specifies this information interchange. It specifies a <b>digital</b> <b>job</b> ticket format for exchanging administrative and technical information related to a print job, and a messaging protocol for communicating information between the systems in the workflow. This licentiate thesis explores different aspects of integrating systems in a JDF-enabled print {{production workflow}}. Paper III and Paper IV analyze the properties of JDF’s messaging protocol—Job Messaging Format (JMF) —and discuss design solutions for a JMF integration layer. Paper I presents a software tool for simulating systems in the print production workflow. The tool is based on an open source software library, called the Elk Framework, which has been developed within the framework of these licentiate studies. The Elk Framework provides the base services required by a piece of JDF-enabled production equipment, called a Device/Worker in JDF parlance. Paper II presents a software tool that was developed for testing the simulation tool presented in Paper I. The test tool, named Alces, can be used for testing if JDF-enabled systems conform to the JDF Specification. Report code: LIU-TEK-LIC- 2006 : 66...|$|E

40|$|The {{internet}} {{is an essential}} employment resource for many of today’s job seekers, {{according to a new}} survey by Pew Research Center. A majority of U. S. adults (54 %) have gone online to look for job information, 45 % have applied for a job online, and job-seeking Americans are just as likely to have turned to the internet during their most recent employment search as to their personal or professional networks. Yet even as the internet has taken on a central role in how people find and apply for work, a minority of Americans would find it difficult to engage in many <b>digital</b> <b>job</b> seeking behaviors – such as creating a professional resume, searching job listings online, or following up via email with potential employers. And while many of today’s job seekers are enlisting their smartphones to browse jobs or communicate with potential employers, others are using their mobile devices for far more complex and challenging tasks, from writing a resume to filling out an online job application. Among the key findings:  The {{internet is}} a top resource for many of today’s job hunters: Among Americans who have looked for work in the last two years, 79 % utilized online resources in their most recent job search and 34 % say these online resources were the most important tool available to them.

30|$|By {{looking at}} Panel A in column 1, one {{is tempted to}} {{conclude}} that individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics seem to play no role on the likelihood of (overall) <b>digital</b> <b>job</b> search in metropolitan Lima since no variable is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Yet, a closer look at columns 2 and 3 reveals that indeed some personal characteristics matter depending on the specific digital channel used. Two variables emerge as statistically significant predictors for Internet job search: presence of offspring and poverty status, the former possibly associated with spillover effects from children’s exposure to Internet at schools and the latter associated with barriers to technology access due to income constrains. In fact, column 2 shows that the likelihood of using the Internet for job search purposes is almost 15 percentage points lower for poor households than that for non-poor ones and 19 percentage points higher for individuals with offspring relative to those without them. The positive relationship between Internet job search and income is in line with international evidence for developed countries (e.g., Stevenson 2009). Column 3, on the other hand, shows that gender, schooling attainment, poverty and migration status of jobseekers matters for mobile phone job search channel. Men are 10 percentage points more likely to search for jobs using mobile phones than are women, and an extra year of schooling is associated with 1.6 higher percentage points for mobile-phone job search. Likewise, the poor (and migrants) are 14 (and 9) percentage points more likely than non-poor (non-migrants) to use mobile phones during the job search process. Overall, these results suggest that poverty status is the main factor that differentiates the use of mobile phones from the Internet when selecting a job search channel. From a policy perspective, this result highlights the importance of mobile phones for vulnerable populations that cannot access the Internet in developing countries due to income barriers.|$|E

30|$|Gender {{integration}} {{refers to}} the process of assessing and reassessing the implications for both women and men of any program and action plan at all levels: social, economic, and political. It requires gender-specific interventions, policies, and practices that may target exclusively women or interventions that target men exclusively or even men and women together. In fact, the goal of integrating the gender dimension into the equation is to transform exclusionary or unequal social and institutional structures into equal and just ones for both women and men. For example, an intervention that targets both women and men is Get Online Week 2013, a pan-European awareness campaign empowering people to use technology and the internet - which ties in with the GrandCoalition for <b>Digital</b> <b>Jobs</b> officially launched at a conference in Brussels in early March 2013 - as over 20 % Europeans of both genders are young, unemployed, and mostly unaware that by 2015, up to 900, 000 vacancies for ICT-related jobs may remain open if jobseekers (men and women) do not acquire the right digital skills (European Commission 2013).|$|R

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the Grand Coalition for <b>Digital</b> <b>Jobs</b> is to contribute to raising the level of digital skills in the workforce and in particular in SMEs, in order to prepare them for the transformation of their businesses into the digital era. The main drivers for SMEs wanting to embrace the digital economy are internal efficiencies, cost reductions, better collaboration and new product and service offerings. Investing in the digitalisation of their business is vital for SMEs; this ultimately generates higher returns than any other forms of capital investment. Europe therefore needs to ensure that SMEs are equipped with the necessary digital skills to enable them to transform. This booklet aims to serve as a source of inspiration for SMEs that want to embrace digitalisation and acquire new skills. It contains a collection of case studies of SMEs that were able to transform their business with digital technologies as a result of gaining experience from a variety of development programmes and other external interventions. In order to present a sample that is representative of thousands of similar cases across Europe, several sectors and countries are covered. SMEs share their stories and experience of their digital transformation journeys. Each story focuses not only on the benefits and the results achieved but also on the characteristics of the intervention that made the digitalisation possible. Such interventions typically involved participation in development programmes available to SMEs in the EU, such as training courses offered by universities and public agencies. The authors looked at programmes managed by educational institutions and at market driven interventions. A key finding explained is the role played by small and medium sized digital technology providers in enabling the digital transformation of other SMEs. This typically occurs through a direct SME to SME interaction taking place, and without public support. The main take away from this analysis is that European SME digital enablers are key enablers and assets to be exploited for the digitalisation of the larger community of SMEs in Europe...|$|R
