25|$|The man {{is passed}} by two {{container}} ships, {{which do not}} see him, despite his use of signaling flares. He drifts out of the shipping lane with no food and water. On the eighth day, he writes a letter, puts it in a jar, and throws it in the water as a message in a bottle. Later that night, he sees a light in the distance. He tears pages from his journal along with charts to create a signal fire. The fire grows {{out of control and}} consumes his raft. He falls into the water and allows himself to sink. Underwater, he sees the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> with a search light approaching his burning raft. He swims up towards the surface to grasp an outstretched hand.|$|E

50|$|Internal drive {{propulsion}} is <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> {{marine propulsion}} {{commonly used in}} recreational boating. Like other forms of motorized boating, internal drive propulsion employs a motor that turns a propeller to move the boat forward. The primary difference between internal drive boats and stern drive boats is that the propeller is enclosed inside the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> internal drive <b>boat</b> whereas the propeller is exposed outside the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stern drive <b>boat.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A strake or {{stringer}} {{is part of}} {{the shell}} of the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> or ship which, in conjunction with the other strakes, keeps the vessel watertight and afloat. It is a strip of planking in a wooden vessel or of plating in a metal one, running longitudinally along the vessel's side, bottom or the turn of the bilge, usually {{from one end of the}} vessel to the other. Stringers run horizontally along the ship's frame providing structural strength. On a longboat, one strake will typically be made up of numerous planks running end to end.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Renzo Piano, the {{architect}} of the Modern Wing, the bridge is approximately 620 ft long and 15 ft wide. The bottom of the Bridgeway is made of white, painted structural steel, the floor is made of aluminum planking and the 42" [...] tall railings are steel set atop stainless steel mesh. The Bridgeway features anti-slip walkways and heating elements to prevent the formation of ice and meets ADA standards for universal accessibility. The bridge is named after museum donors Alexandra and John Nichols. [...] The bridge design was inspired by the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Copper {{sheathing}} is {{the practice}} of protecting the under-water <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship or <b>boat</b> from the corrosive effects of salt water and biofouling {{through the use of}} copper plates affixed to the outside <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> It was pioneered and developed by the Royal Navy during the 18th century.|$|R

50|$|Between 1790 and 1820, {{the legendary}} Colonel Plug, {{also known as}} Colonel Fluger, ran a gang of river pirates on the Ohio River, in a cypress swamp {{near the mouth of}} the Cache River, below Cave-In-Rock and Fort Massac and just above the {{confluence}} of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Plug's tactics were to sneak aboard personally, or have one of his pirates secretly go into the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat,</b> and dig out the caulking between the floor planks or drill holes with an auger, causing the boat to sink and be easily attacked. The boat and the cargo would later be sold down river.|$|E
5000|$|Nahuelito is a lake monster {{named after}} the Nahuel Huapi Lake as its {{sighting}} in the lake is reported widely. Whether {{it is a fact}} or fiction, its sighting has been reported by local people and tourists with widely varying descriptions mentioning a “giant water snake with humps and fish-like fins to a swan with a snake's head, the overturned <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat,</b> and the stump of a tree”. Its length is also reported in the range of 15 - 150 ft. Reported widely since the 1920s, predating Nessie and the book titled The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle), Nahuelito is described as “an Argentinean media star.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{facilities}} {{for the staff}} and crew who manned the lifeboats at Harwich were limited and following an intense period of fund raising from local supporters an appeal finally had enough funds {{to build a new}} boathouse and new training {{facilities for}} the crew. In 2003, after spending 40 years located in portacabins set up on Halfpenny Pier, the new boathouse and facilities opened at a cost of £1.25 million. The station building has been designed to bear a resemblance to the upturned <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b> This was done to pay homage to the local boatbuilding method of constructing hulls upside down. The location called the Harwich Navyard has a history of boatbuilding particularly navy ships which is how it got its name.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> jon <b>boat</b> (or johnboat) is <b>a</b> {{flat-bottomed}} <b>boat</b> constructed <b>of</b> aluminum, fiberglass, or {{wood with}} one, two, or three bench seats. They {{are suitable for}} fishing and hunting. The <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jon <b>boat</b> is nearly flat, therefore it tends to ride over the waves rather than cut through them as a V-hull might, thus limiting {{the use of the}} boat to calmer waters. Jon <b>boats</b> typically have <b>a</b> transom onto which an outboard motor can be mounted. They are simple and easy to maintain, and inexpensive with many options to upgrade. Typical options might include live wells/bait wells, side or center consoles, factory installed decks and floors, electrical wiring, accessory pads/mountings, casting and poling platforms.|$|R
40|$|The results {{obtained}} in an experimental research promoted {{to define the}} <b>hull</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lagoon <b>boat</b> designed to have a reduced wave generation and spreading are presented.

Finally <b>a</b> short description <b>of</b> the new boat design is presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} boat {{building material}} used for hull and spar construction. It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. it {{is a popular}} material for small boats (of e.g. 6 m length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as Teak, Totara and some cedars have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as Pinus radiata, will rot very quickly. The <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>boat</b> usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as oak while planking can be oak but is more often softwood such as pine, larch or cedar.|$|R

50|$|The {{center of}} lateral {{resistance}} {{is the center}} of pressure of the hydrodynamic forces on the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b> The center of pressure is the point on a body where the total sum of a pressure field acts, causing a force and no moment about that point. The total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field. The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics. Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point.|$|E
5000|$|A yardang is a {{streamlined}} protuberance {{carved from}} bedrock or any consolidated or semiconsolidated material by the dual {{action of wind}} abrasion by dust and sand, and deflation which is the removal of loose material by wind turbulence. Yardangs become elongated features typically three or more times longer than wide, and when viewed from above, resemble the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boat.</b> Facing the wind is a steep, blunt face that gradually gets lower and narrower toward the lee end. [...] Yardangs are formed by wind erosion, typically of an originally flat surface formed from areas of harder and softer material. The soft material is eroded and removed by the wind, and the harder material remains. The resulting pattern of yardangs is therefore {{a combination of the}} original rock distribution, and the fluid mechanics of the air flow and resulting pattern of erosion.|$|E
50|$|They all survived {{having spent}} the night {{clinging}} to the hull and at day break saw what would be their saviour: the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Japanese fishing <b>boat,</b> Number 10, Noshemi Maru, K30, which had been wrecked in 1960, two years earlier. In the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese fishing <b>boat</b> they built <b>a</b> still from which {{they were able to}} make fresh water. A fire to run the still was kept burning almost constantly with wood from the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the wreck in which they were living.|$|R
50|$|Zebra {{was laid}} down on 1 July 1894 and {{launched}} on 13 December 1895. Thames Iron Works was relatively inexperienced in building torpedo craft (it had previously built the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single torpedo <b>boat</b> as <b>a</b> subcontractor for Maudslay, Sons and Field (who supplied the engines for Zebra) {{and it took}} a long time for the ship to be completed and to complete trials (where she eventually reached the contract speed of 27 knots), not being accepted by the Navy until January 1900.|$|R
500|$|After departing the station, the <b>boats</b> {{travel through}} <b>a</b> short flume section before {{emerging}} from the building and ascending a [...] chain lift hill. Once {{at the top of}} the hill, the track dips and turns 180 degrees to the right, entering a mid-course brake run. A sweeping 180 degree downward turn to the right is followed by an upward turn into another brake run. The ride then drops below ground, passing under the queue path before emerging over an air-time hill, where riders experience <b>a</b> feeling <b>of</b> weightlessness. This hill drops into the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upturned <b>boat</b> and is followed by the ride's splashdown. On the boat's return path to the station it passes <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> lighting, fire, and water effects. Riders exiting Storm Coaster pass alongside the ride's finale, with the chance to get soaked by other boats in the splashdown area.|$|R
