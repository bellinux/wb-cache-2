5|$|Gimmick! {{was also}} ported to the PlayStation in Japan {{as a part}} of Sunsoft Memorial Collection: Volume 6 along with Super Spy Hunter. This version {{contains}} some sound <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> its Famicom counterpart. This collection package was made available on the PlayStation Network in Japan on 22 December 2010.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Malayalam-language Indian film My Boss is {{a remake}} of The Proposal. Set in Mumbai and Kerala, the remade version has many <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the {{original}} although the basic storyline remains the same. Popular actors Dileep and Mamta Mohandas played the lead roles in this version. The remake was also a hit.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the entry}} is written in {{continuous}} prose, starting with a physical description giving length, weight, and {{a detailed account of}} plumage with differences between the sexes (more than a page in the cirl bunting's case).

5|$|A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the modern game: games were played {{outdoors}} on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the rover. Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the Canadian rules—six men per side and three periods of play.|$|E
5|$|C. m. soemmerringii (Fischer, 1811) {{is found}} in {{north-eastern}} Europe and north and central Asia, from the former Soviet Union to Lake Baikal and north-west Mongolia, and south to Turkey, Israel and the eastern Himalayas. Its south-western limits are Serbia and southern Romania. It winters in Iran and northern India (Kashmir). Johann Fischer von Waldheim described this taxon as Corvus soemmerringii in 1811, noting its <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> populations in western Europe. Its species name was given in honour of the German anatomist, Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring. It is distinguished by the nape and {{the sides of the}} neck being paler, creating a contrasting black crown and lighter grey part collar.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the African river martin {{was the sole}} member of its genus and {{subfamily}} until {{the discovery of the}} white-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon eurystomina, by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya in 1968. Although some authorities follow Brooke in placing that species in a separate genus Eurochelidon due to its significant <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the African species, it remains a member of the same subfamily. Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily.|$|E
5|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, Kanō combined the throwing {{techniques of the}} Kitō-ryū and the choking and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū. As such, judo's Koshiki no Kata preserves the traditional forms of the Kitō-ryū with only minor <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the mainline tradition. Similarly, many of the techniques (but not the forms) of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū are preserved in the Kime no Kata.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 11 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to gold in group 11 as the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, copper, silver, and gold, although it may show some <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> them.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. Nihonium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it may be able to involve its d-electrons in bonding, although these predictions are disputed.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the woolly hare(Lepus oiostolus),but is now {{treated as a}} separate species. Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the woolly hare. In 2005, {{it was found that}} molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric speciation or parapatric speciation. It might also be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably be its northern form.|$|E

5|$|Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer {{is spoken}} by the {{indigenous}} Khmer {{population of the}} Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, {{have been forced to}} take Vietnamese names. Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> Standard Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Other {{remains of}} similar animals were found {{throughout}} the late 19th century and 20th century. Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada, was named T. warreni by William Parks in 1926. This skeleton had notable <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> T. neglectus, and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus, Parksosaurus, in 1937. Sternberg also named an additional species, T. edmontonensis, based on another articulated skeleton, this time including a partial skull (NMC8537), and {{drew attention to the}} genus' heavy build and thick bones. Due to these <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> the regular light hypsilophodont build, he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily, Thescelosaurinae. T. edmontonensis has, since Peter Galton's 1974 review, generally been considered a more robust individual (possibly the opposite sex of the type individual) of T. neglectus. However, Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of Thescelosaurus and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus. The other point of contention regarding T. edmontonensis is its ankle, which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted, but which was regarded by William J. Morris (1976) as truly different from T. neglectus.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally {{have been proven}} to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic {{studies have shown that}} the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.|$|E

5|$|Roentgenium is {{the ninth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Rukia was {{the first}} {{character}} of the series created by Kubo, her design being the one he decided to use {{for all the other}} Soul Reapers. Reaction to her character is generally positive. Her <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> typical shōnen heroines is praised, as is her interaction with other characters. Additionally, she usually ranks second in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Bleach popularity polls, and is consistently the most popular female character in those polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Rukia's likeness, including a plush doll and several figurines.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium and osmium {{have very}} similar {{chemistry}} {{due to the}} lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> them: for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide contraction. Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E
