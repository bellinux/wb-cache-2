5|$|Lack of {{patronage}} led to Pentland folding his businesses {{and taking a}} job in 1930 as a pilot with Australian National Airways (ANA), a new airline founded by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at Singleton. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in Queensland and New South Wales. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where {{he was known as}} a practical joker who liked to hold a map in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after war was declared in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E

50|$|Nekodamashi (猫騙し, ねこだまし) is an {{unconventional}} sumo wrestling technique, which involves a wrestler clapping {{his hands together}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>face</b> at the tachi-ai (start of the bout). The aim of this technique is to cause the opponent to close his eyes briefly, allowing the instigator to gain the advantage.|$|R
25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E
500|$|The first single, [...] "Stinkfist", {{garnered}} limited airplay. It was shortened {{by radio}} programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of [...] "Stinkfist" [...] to [...] "Track No.1" [...] due to offensive connotations, and {{the lyrics of}} the song were altered. Responding to fan complaints about censorship, Matt Pinfield of MTV's 120 Minutes expressed regret on air by waving his fist in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> while introducing the video and explaining the name change.|$|E
500|$|The {{cover is}} a picture of two men passing each other on Berwick Street in London. The two men are London DJ Sean Rowley and album sleeve {{designer}} Brian Cannon (back to the camera). [...] The album's producer Owen Morris {{can be seen in the}} background, on the left footpath, holding the album's master tape in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> [...] The location was chosen because the street was a popular location for record shops at the time. The cover cost £25,000 to produce.|$|E

50|$|The wrestler {{stands in}} <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{opponent}} <b>facing</b> at him, ducks, hooks one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms over the opponent's shoulder (if {{it is the}} opponent's left shoulder that the attacker chooses to seize, he hooks with his right, or opposite if sides are reversed), swings himself under the opponent's armpit then around and over the opponent's back so that he faces {{the same way as}} the opponent.|$|R
500|$|Noah Bean {{noted that}} his {{character}} Officer Kemp [...] "meets pretty gruesome, unbelievable ends," [...] as Kemp's face becomes covered with skin and scar tissue. To create {{the effect of}} Kemp's orifices closing, the crew used a combination of make-up and computer graphic effects. They created casts of Bean, including the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> ears, back, and torso. They applied make-up over parts of his face at different stages as the scene demanded. For Olivia's unsuccessful emergency tracheotomy, the actress cut into a fake neck that Bean wore.|$|E
500|$|Altgens {{described}} {{what he saw}} following the fatal shot to JFK. [...] "There was no blood {{on the right-hand side}} of his face; there was no blood on the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> But there was a tremendous amount of blood on the left-hand side and {{at the back of the}} head." [...] This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he should have seen some evidence otherwise. He also remembered seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine, and thinking that she was frightened by the events and was trying to get away.|$|E
500|$|After 1994, Armstrong refused all {{requests}} for autographs because {{he found that}} his signed items were selling for {{large amounts of money}} and that many forgeries were in circulation; any requests that were sent to him received a form letter in reply, saying that he had stopped signing. Although his no-autograph policy was well known, author Andrew Smith observed people at the 2002 Reno Air Races still trying to get signatures, with one person even claiming, [...] "If you shove something close enough in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> he'll sign." [...] He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts, because he believed these letters should come from people who know the Scouts personally.|$|E

60|$|The American {{passed it}} over without a word. Von Bork undid a winding of string and two {{wrappers}} of paper. Then he sat gazing {{for a moment}} in silent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him. Across the cover was printed in golden letters Practical Handbook of Bee Culture. Only for one instant did the master spy glare at this strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he was gripped at the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> writhing <b>face.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Final Round 20 {{continued}} the rivalry between Joshua [...] "Wolfkrone" [...] Philpot and Kenneth [...] "KBrad" [...] Bradley, which started at Frosty Faustings {{two months earlier}} when Wolfkrone harshly taunted KBrad after winning 2-1. Both players had won their respective pools when they met in the winner's bracket of the top 64. KBrad defeated Wolfkrone 2-0, not losing a single round during their matches, followed by KBRad literally putting his head inches in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>face</b> while the crowd went wild. KBrad eventually took fourth place in the finals, while, Wolfkrone came in at 13.|$|R
500|$|Unlike 9413, other extras {{around him}} begin to find success. A woman (Adriane Marsh) {{with the number}} [...] "13" [...] on her head {{constantly}} kneels and stands back up {{at the behest of}} a film director, and eventually succeeds in landing a part, greeted by a [...] "Casting Today" [...] sign. Another extra (Voya George) with the number [...] "15", who unlike 9413 has expressionless and unenthusiastic facial expressions, holds paper masks in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> symbolizing his performances. He is greeted with enthusiasm by the cheering masses, all of whom speak in the same gibberish as 9413. His number 15 is replaced with a star and he achieves tremendous success. 9413 admires this new movie star and attempts to mimic him, presenting his own, much more impressive-looking mask. But the star is unimpressed and disregards 9413, who sadly cradles his mask like a baby, lamenting his inability to achieve success.|$|E
500|$|MacLaren's {{obituary}} in The Times {{stated that}} he was [...] "one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time". As a batsman, he {{had a reputation for}} stylishness, but his technique was based on scoring runs safely. He always tried to seize the initiative in a game. Batting with his head slightly raised, he drew his bat back unusually far, which provided the power to his shots, and in particular his drives. He scored runs quickly, mainly through his ability to score from good length balls. When playing a shot, he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball, he followed through with the bat, often holding his pose for effect. These qualities, and his quick footwork, made him effective on difficult batting pitches. One of his most highly regarded shots was the hook. In later years, Cardus described the shot: [...] "To see MacLaren hook a fast ball... from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry; he didn't merely hook the ball, he dismissed it from his presence." [...] Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero, wrote prolifically about him in later years; he called one such essay on MacLaren [...] "The Noblest Roman", and judged him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh suggests: [...] "If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer, it is MacLaren, the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus." [...] MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder, initially in the outfield but later at slip.|$|E

50|$|This DDT {{sees the}} wrestler stand in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{opponent}} <b>facing</b> at him, duck, hook one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms over the opponent's shoulder (if it's the opponent's left shoulder that the attacker chooses to seize, he hooks with his right, or opposite if sides are reversed), swing himself under the opponent's armpit then around {{and over the}} opponent's back so that he faces {{the same way as}} the opponent, lock the opponent's head under his other hand's armpit, spin another 180° to end up having the opponent locked in a front facelock and fall back to drive the opponent skull first to the mat, as in a regular DDT. The maneuver is usually performed after the attacker ducks a punch or a clothesline.|$|R

2500|$|The golden {{trevally}} is found {{either as a}} solitary individual or in small schools as an adult. Juveniles tend to form larger schools which tend to congregate and follow ( [...] or [...] "pilot") larger fish such as groupers, sharks, and even jellyfish. This behaviour mimics that of the related pilot fish, Naucrates ductor, with their maneuverability protecting them from their hosts, which in turn provides them with protection from predation from other fish. This behaviour extends to scuba divers, with one diver reporting a single young individual obsessively stationing itself in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> plate.|$|E
2500|$|Next are verses {{from the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John {{referring}} to Jesus {{after he was}} flogged by soldiers. Another section shows the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas watching the punishment of Jesus from afar. Christ then receives the cross. The next section shows Jesus on his knees with Simon of Cyrene [...] carrying the cross and followed by a large crowd and soldiers. Saint Veronica appears in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Christ, wiping <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with a cloth. The north and south segments show the falls Jesus suffered while carrying the cross while the three Marys look on.|$|R
60|$|Of {{this person}} little need be said. He was a large-boned, loud-voiced, red-faced man, named Meiklewham; a country writer, or attorney, who managed the {{matters of the}} Squire much to the profit of one or other,--if not <b>of</b> both. <b>His</b> nose {{projected}} from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> broad vulgar <b>face,</b> like the stile of an old sun-dial, twisted all of one side. He was as great a bully in his profession, {{as if it had}} been military instead of civil: conducted the whole technicalities concerning the cutting up the Saint's-Well-haugh, so much lamented by Dame Dods, into building-stances, and was on excellent terms with Doctor Quackleben, who always recommended him to make the wills <b>of</b> <b>his</b> patients.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{presence}} of the drug mafia, Sartaj is questioned by his senior about the report. At the same time, Tommy, who is on the run from the police and has been searching for Bauria, jumps and enters the enclosure, alerting everyone including Vikrant and the senior policeman. He fatally hits Vikrant with his hockey stick and tries to make a move upstairs. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Sartaj grabs his senior's service revolver and shoots everyone except Tommy. He then rushes inside the house to get his brother Balli, who is being held captive by Vikrant's wife. He shoots her and frees Balli, while Tommy goes upstairs and helps Bauria beat her captors. Finally, as Tommy and Bauria run off, Balli kneels down and cries in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother whose <b>face</b> is expressionless. Later Tommy calls Bauria on his crew member's phone to ask her real name. Sitting by a beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters [...] "Mary Jane".|$|R
2500|$|The {{album is}} Q-Tip's second {{released}} studio effort, following his solo debut Amplified and the 2002 shelving of Kamaal/The Abstract. Q-Tip {{put together a}} band for recording The Renaissance. In an interview for Billboard magazine, he discussed his musical direction for the album, stating [...] "I wanted a hip-hop sonic feel, something pure {{to the sound of}} hip-hop with real drums, real emotion and people taking solos… In that sense this record feels like we're moving in a new direction … something hip-hop should do". Production for The Renaissance was primarily handled by Q-Tip, {{with the exception of the}} J Dilla-produced [...] "Move." [...] The album also features contributions from such artists as Norah Jones, D'Angelo, Raphael Saadiq and Amanda Diva. The album cover art features Q-Tip in a silver suit holding an MPC2000XL in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Department of the Environment {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published on 4 March 1976 and tests showed no equipment fault on the train. Postmortem evidence indicated that, {{at the time of}} impact, the driver's hand was on the [...] "dead man's handle", rather than in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> to protect it, implying he had made no attempt to stop. Witnesses were interviewed; some passengers on the train reporting that the train accelerated when entering the station, and some witnesses standing in the station reported that the driver, 56-year-old Leslie Newson, was sitting upright in his seat and looking straight ahead as the train passed through the station. The state of the motor-control gear, as found after the accident, indicated that power had been applied to the motors until within two seconds of the impact.|$|E
2500|$|A blatant bigot, McReynolds {{would not}} accept [...] "Jews, drinkers, blacks, women, smokers, married or engaged individuals" [...] as law clerks. Time [...] "called him 'Puritanical', 'intolerably rude', 'savagely sarcastic', 'incredibly reactionary', and 'anti-Semitic'". McReynolds refused to speak to Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the Court, for three years {{following}} Brandeis's appointment and, when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement. He habitually left the conference room whenever Brandeis spoke. When Benjamin Cardozo's appointment was being pressed on President Herbert C. Hoover, McReynolds joined with fellow justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter in urging the White House not to [...] "afflict the Court with another Jew". When news of Cardozo's appointment was announced, McReynolds is claimed to have said [...] "Huh, {{it seems that the}} only way you can get on the Supreme Court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a Jew, or both." [...] During Cardozo's swearing-in ceremony, McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper, and would often hold a brief or record in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> when Cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench. Likewise, he refused to sign opinions authored by Brandeis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} the song opens with a man {{standing}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a jukebox, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> unseen by the camera. He scrolls his finger {{up a list of}} songs and stops at [...] "Any Way You Want It". He then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a coin which he inserts into the jukebox. He then selects the song and we see a record being flipped over and beginning to spin. This dissolves into a shot of a studio tape spinning which leads to the group performing the song in the studio. The band's performance comprises most of the video until the song ends. At this point the man at the jukebox is revealed to actually be lead singer Steve Perry who turns and smiles at the camera. Another video exists which is a live performance during the Departure Tour. Both videos were omitted from the band's Greatest Hits 1978-1997 DVD in favor of another live version of the song from the Escape Tour.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} is oval shaped, with a width of 107.5 cm and {{a height of}} 73 cm. In the foreground it depicts the naked, sleeping Antiope. She lies with {{her head on the}} left edge of the painting, twisted so that her front side faces the viewer. Her right arm is bent under her head while her left arm hangs down into the abyss in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her. This arm covers the right breast, while the left remains free. Her legs are bent up towards the viewer, with the right continuing the line of her body at the knee while her left leg is only slightly bent to point back to the lower right of the painting. The whole body is painted in pale, warm colours and lights up the otherwise dark and earthy image. Under the sleeping woman there is a cloth, which hangs over the abyss near her breast, disappears under her arm near her head and is lifted by the satyr behind her. The satyr, whose head is crowned with grape vines symbolising the presence of the god Bacchus. lies in the opposite direction behind the woman, with the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body also <b>facing</b> the viewer. With his left arm he lifts the cloth to the height of Antiope's shoulder and it is obvious that he has just uncovered the sleeping maiden. His left arm is bent on a tree root at the right edge of the image and props up his upper body. With his head and upper body, the satyr looms over the hips of the sleeper in order to gaze upon her - he licks his lips lustfully. His body is shadowy and cannot be made out below his hips. The satyr is depicted in brown tones. His suntanned skin and muscular body forms a clear contrast with the softly worked, shapely Antiope.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think it's nonsense, do you?" [...] said Cashel, after a pause. Then {{he raised}} {{one of the}} candles, and {{illuminated}} a picture that hung on the wall, [...] "Look at that picture," [...] he said. [...] "You see that fellow in armor--St. George and the dragon, or whatever he may be. He's jumped down from his horse to fight the other fellow--that one with {{his head in a}} big helmet, whose horse has tumbled. The lady in the gallery is half crazy with anxiety for St. George; and well she may be. THERE'S a posture for a man to fight in! His weight isn't resting on his legs; one touch of a child's finger would upset him. Look at his neck craned out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as flat as a full moon towards his man, as if he was inviting him to shut up both his eyes with one blow. You can all see that he's as weak and nervous as a cat, and that he doesn't know how to fight. And why does he give you that idea? Just because he's all strain and stretch; because he isn't at his ease; because he carries the weight <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body as foolishly as one of the ladies here would carry a hod of bricks; because he isn't safe, steady, and light on his pins, as he would be if he could forget himself for a minute, and leave his body to find its proper balance of its own accord. If the painter of that picture had known his business he would never have sent his man up to the scratch in such a figure and condition as that. But you can see with one eye that he didn't understand--I won't say the principles of fighting, but the universal principles that I've told you of, that ease and strength, effort and weakness, go together. Now," [...] added Cashel, again addressing Lucian; [...] "do you still think that notion of mine nonsense?" [...] And he smacked his lips with satisfaction; for <b>his</b> criticism <b>of</b> the picture had produced a marked sensation, and he did not know that this was {{due to the fact that}} the painter, Mr. Adrian Herbert, was present.|$|R
