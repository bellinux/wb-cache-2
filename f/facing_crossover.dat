50|$|A short {{distance}} {{west of the}} station, {{on the far side}} of the A10, there is a single east-to-north spur towards Seven Sisters. To allow this to be reached by westbound trains, there is a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover,</b> located in the platform area.|$|E
50|$|Up Walsall to Birmingham International trains had a {{platform}} face {{of their own}} (platform 3), but down Birmingham International to Walsall trains used the up main platform via a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover.</b> The 19th-century bridge over the railway underwent renovation from August to September 2006.|$|E
50|$|A further {{extension}} of the line opened in 1888 to Skipton via Addingham, Bolton Abbey and Embsay saw the station assume {{the status of a}} junction. Terminating trains only used the bay Platform 1, as the lack of a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover</b> on the approach lines meant that Platform 2 was not available as a terminating road. Platform 2 was only available as a departure road for trains that were first drawn back towards Ben Rhydding, and then shunted back into the bay. A carriage storage siding was originally provided between Platforms 1 and 2, explaining the wide gap between the current lines in this location. The <b>facing</b> <b>crossover</b> was finally installed during the remodelling of the station approaches in 1983, thus allowing terminating trains to directly access Platform 2.|$|E
50|$|The Chesterfield Tramways Company {{took over}} in December 1886. The company brought several more tramcars and reduced the fare prices from 2d to 1d. Chesterfield Tramways decided to relay the track and extend the line to the borough {{boundaries}} and electrify it. The Electric Tramways Committee put forward a parliamentary bill to that effect.Work began in summer 1904 on the track relaying and hanging of the wire. The longer line was mostly single track with turnouts and double track in the town centre and opened in November 1904. Weekends proved to be rather busy so the line was operated in two sections with <b>facing</b> <b>crossovers</b> on Low Pavement and Cavendish Street to allow two tramcars to park side-by-side.|$|R
50|$|The various {{compositions}} by Van Veen {{could be}} described as Minimal Music with different <b>faces,</b> <b>crossovers</b> to jazz, blues, soundscape, Avant-garde, techno, trance and pop music. Currently Van Veen is director of Van Veen Productions, Chairman of the Simeon ten Holt Foundation, Culemborg Cultural Foundation, Pianomania Foundation and artistic director of several music festivals in Culemborg, Utrecht and Veldhoven. He is active in the International Utrecht Student Piano Competition and the Murray Dranoff Two Piano Competition. Over the last 15 years Van Veen recorded more than 110 CDs for several labels (Mirasound, Koch, Naxos, Brilliant Classics) and his own label PIANO. The latest box is an eleven CD box set with his project called the Minimal Piano Collection volume X-XX as an extension for his successful Minimal Piano Collection Volume I-IX.|$|R

50|$|The {{interchange}} is modelled on {{a successful}} design {{used on the}} Strasbourg tram system in France, and comprises two staggered island platforms. Trams serve the outer faces of the platforms, whilst the inner faces are served by local bus services. An elongated <b>facing</b> <b>crossover</b> allows outbound trams to terminate in the inbound platform. Vehicular access to the interchange is restricted to buses and trams.|$|E
50|$|Over the Bank Holiday {{weekend of}} early May 2008, the Chat Moss line {{was closed to}} rail traffic to allow a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover</b> to be {{installed}} between the inbound (to Liverpool) and outbound (to Manchester) lines. This crossing was placed on site on Sunday 4 May 2008 and is located east of Mill Lane bridge. The work on this weekend involved {{the use of a}} Kirow rail mounted crane.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the closure}} of both junctions, and the {{simplification}} of the railway to a pure through service {{as part of the}} Rhymney Line, the station was rebuilt to a two platform with bus interchange in 1970. [...] The signalling system is currently set up to allow northbound services to terminate in the southbound platform (using a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover)</b> & return directly to Cardiff if required, although this facility is only used during the evenings in the current (May 2013) timetable. The on-going Valley Lines resignalling scheme will see a new bay platform bought into use at the station for use by terminating trains, which will allow a further increase in service frequencies to/from Cardiff in the future.|$|E
5000|$|East of Brigham Circle, the [...] "E" [...] Branch {{runs in a}} {{dedicated}} reservation in the median of Huntington Avenue; west of the circle is street running in mixed traffic to the terminus at Heath Street. Because of this, service is often terminated at Brigham Circle due to traffic conditions to preserve service frequency on {{the remainder of the}} line. At these times, the parallel [...] bus provides all service west of Brigham Circle. A <b>facing</b> point <b>crossover</b> is located just east of the station, allowing terminating trains to cross over to the inbound platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{stop was}} {{built as a}} single island {{platform}} with two platform <b>faces,</b> with a <b>crossover</b> just outside the stop, though in 2015, the northern track was removed, leaving just the southern platform in use by trams. It is {{on the edge of}} Wolverhampton's main shopping area, and around {{a quarter of a mile}} from Wolverhampton railway station.|$|R
50|$|Minories {{packed a}} great deal into its small space. The cutting {{location}} gave a plausible excuse to fill {{every inch of the}} baseboard with trains and the assumption of an exit via cut-and-cover lines also explained the abrupt scenic break. Lines from the platforms exited via a pair of <b>facing</b> and trailing <b>crossovers</b> that allowed access from both running lines to any of the platforms, despite only using six or seven sets of points. By curving these lines around obstacles such as a signal box, the visual impression was also given of a far longer running space.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{services}} on the line are now operated by bi-directional diesel multiple unit trains. Locomotive hauled trains from Tralee to Cork, Mallow and Dublin simply passed the station, stopped, then reversed into the platforms, then to continue {{on their way to}} Mallow with the engine always at the [...] "right-end" [...] - the reverse applied with trains from Mallow to Tralee which entered the station, reversed out and continued on their way, again with the locomotive at the right end without running round. The situation is different at Kilkenny where as direction was changed, locomotives had to be detached and put {{on the front of the}} train. A change of ends for locomotives was required. At Killarney there is also a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover</b> east of the station that allows trains in either direction to bypass Killarney Station, but it has been used for this purpose only rarely since freight trains to Tralee ended a few years ago.|$|E
50|$|Platform 7 is disused and {{the line}} is covered by vegetation. However, with the planned two-year {{blockade}} of Thameslink trains through Central London while London Bridge station is under reconstruction Network Rail considered reinstating and electrifying this line as a 'dead-end'. The object was to terminate some additional services arriving via Crystal Palace which would otherwise need {{to go on to}} Beckenham Junction to terminate, thus obviating unnecessary occupation of the 1Â¾ miles of single bi-directional line east of Birkbeck Junction and also save a carriage set. To achieve the change the lead to the down spur at Bromley Junction would have been being removed to the up line and a <b>facing</b> <b>crossover</b> put into place west of it. To provide the necessary pathing northbound the trains would use the same spur line, which would have become reversible to the resited point on the up line at Bromley Junction. Despite safety problems for the user-operated level crossing into the track maintenance depot on the former steam shed site because of restricted sighting under Goat House bridge having apparently been resolved the changes have been postponed until the work at London Bridge is complete. This is mainly because it was judged the cost did not justify the change, at least until a general renewal of the signal and control installation is undertaken.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} Philpstoun, {{in common with}} others in West Lothian, was an extremeley busy centre for shale mining and {{petroleum}} manufacturing for almost a century, and this {{was reflected in the}} railways around Philpstoun. The station itself was situated in a deep cutting, and had two platforms. Immediately to the west, a <b>facing</b> junction, with <b>crossovers</b> and a looping facilities connected to a set of exchange sidings at Westfield, and these ran into Philpstoun No 1 shale mine. Extensive sidings connected within the facility, and a short branch ran just west of the (still extant) shale bings, crossing the canal, and continuing past Easter Pardovan in a southerly direction to serve a shale pit at Ochiltree (just north west of Threemiletown). A tramway ran in the same direction on the eastern flank of the bings.A trailing siding left the main up line near Pardovan, this was known as Pardovan siding and originally served a quarry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a novel construction of face-sample set method by applying genetic algorithms (GA). The GA can yield new <b>face</b> samples by <b>crossover</b> and mutation. These new samples {{will have some}} new prosperity: simulating the variations of face in daily life and the variations {{of the image of}} light and quality. First we align the face samples with one another to reducing the amount of variation between images of faces and improve fitness of solutions. And then these face samples are divided into three sub-sets: train set, validation set and test set. The train set is then used to train a Sparse Network of Winnow (SNoW). And the train set is also used as the initial population of GA. After every 20 -generation, we will use the initial generation and solutions with high weight, evaluated by SNoW, to train the network SNoW again. And each newly-trained SNoW is tested by validation set. Finally, these trained classifiers are checked by the test set to check its generalization performance. The experiment results prove the new train set can improve the performance of SNoW obviously than only the original train set...|$|R
40|$|The control {{policies}} {{that are used in}} inventory management systems assume that orders arrive in the same sequence as they were ordered. Due to changes in supply chains and markets, this assumption is no longer valid. This paper aims at providing an improved understanding of the phenomenon of order crossovers and the conditions for the occurrence of order crossovers. Order crossovers are caused by differences in lead times and in the time between orders. These differences originate from several sources. This paper distinguishes three types of order crossovers according to the sources of the differences encountered. It reviews literature on these sources of differences that may cause crossovers. From a detailed analysis of the effect of contemporary changes in modern inventory management on the possibility of occurrence of the various types of order crossovers, we conclude that order crossovers should be taken into account in the inventory {{policies that}} are implemented in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. The type of order crossovers that firms will encounter more frequently are predominantly expected order crossovers and general order crossovers. Modern ERP systems are not able to handle these types of order crossovers effectively. The types of industries that have a higher probability of <b>facing</b> these order <b>crossovers</b> are either located upstream in the supply chain, or use natural resources, or order strategic materials from multiple suppliers or from abroad. A case study of a tobacco firm that encountered order crossovers confirms these findings. The firm estimated that the potential cost savings of taking expected order crossovers into account were 30 %. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The other race effect (ORE) is a {{well-known}} phenomenon whereby individuals tend to identify more accurately faces from their same-race (SR) as opposed to faces from the other-race (OR). First reported by Feingold (1914), almost a hundred years ago, since then the ORE has found consistent support at the behavioural level. In spite of a general consensus regarding the robustness of this effect, theoretical accounts have thus far failed {{to reach an agreement}} concerning the causes underlying this phenomenon. Two main strands exist within the academic literature, differing on the alleged roots of the ORE. One regards this phenomenon as stemming from different levels of expertise individuals hold with SR and OR face (i. e. the expertise based accounts); the other advocates the importance of social cognitive factor (i. e. the social cognitive accounts). Neuroimaging data can provide important insights in understanding the basis of the ORE. These studies though have thus far failed to reach a degree of consistency. EEG data for example are highly contradictory. A number of studies report no race sensitivity on the N 170 face preferential component, while others show that this component is in fact modulated by race. However, discrepancy is found even amongst the study reporting N 170 modulation to race, with some showing larger N 170 to SR faces, while others revealing the opposite pattern. Similarly, fMRI data show the same degree of inconsistency, especially with regards to the role played by the fusiform face area (FFA). The aim of this thesis is to clarify the neurphysiolological basis of the ORE in order to gain further insights into its origins. To this end three studies (two employing EEG and one fMRI) were designed to answer three main questions related to the ORE: when, how and where in the brain does this phenomenon occur. The first study investigates the conjoint effects of race and the face inversion effect (FIE - regarded as a marker of configural face processing) on the N 170. Interestingly, no race modulations on this ERP component were observed for upright faces. Race however impacted upon the magnitude of the electrophysiological FIE, with SR faces leading to greater recognition impairment and eliciting larger N 170 amplitudes compared to inverted OR faces. These results indicate that race impacts upon early perceptual stages of face processing and that SR and OR faces are processed in a qualitatively different manner. The second study exploites the advantages conferred by adaptation paradigm to test neural coding efficiency for faces of different races. An unbiased spatiotemporal data-driven analysis on the newly developed single-trial repetition suppression (srRS) index, which fully accounts for the paired nature of the design, revealed differential amounts of repetition suppression across races on the N 170 time window. These data suggest the SR faces are coded more efficiently than OR faces and, in line with the previous results, that race is processed at early perceptual stages. The final study investigates whether and where in the brain faces are coded according to the laws predicted by valentineâs norm based multidimensional face space model. Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDM) showed that faces are coded as a function of experience within the dominant FFA according to the laws of valentineâs theoretical framework Importantly in all experiments I tested both Western Caucasian (WC) and East Asian (EA) observers viewing WC and EA <b>faces.</b> A <b>crossover</b> interaction between the race of the observers and that of the face stimuli is in fact crucial to genuinely relate any observed effect to race, and exclude potential low level confounds that may be intrinsic in the stimulus set. These data, taken together indicate that the ORE is an expertise based phenomenon and that it takes place at early perceptual level of face processing...|$|R
