40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about illustrating the fundamental principles for planning, locating and designing <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. The study aims {{to give an}} understanding of the need and demand for <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces today, as well as to determine how these can be met according to different theories. The study also aims to investigate the issue with incorrectly <b>parked</b> <b>bicycles,</b> which occurs frequently in the cityscape and therefore creates an obstacle in street spaces. An observational study on the new bicycle lots along Götgatan was conducted in order to analyze how the theories of <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces are applied in practice. Cyclists were then interviewed in order to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} cyclists’ revealed preferences. A quantitative survey was also conducted to measure the popularity of the bicycle stands among the cyclists. The study clearly shows that the most fundamental principles, of the various theories, of suitable <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces are as follows: Planning areas intended for <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces at an early stage, locating the <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces as close to the target point as possible, as well as designing the <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces according to peoples needs. Well thought out planning, correct placement, and carefully estimated needs are key concepts in the establishment of attractive and frequently used <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. The observational study revealed that there were few cyclists who chose to <b>park</b> their <b>bicycles</b> in the new bicycle lots on Götgatan. The interviews provided an explanation for why cyclists do not choose the new bicycle lots as their parking option. It was shown that this is due to unnecessary long walk to their target points as well as a potential safety risk in regards to crossing the bicycle lane in order to reach pedestrian sidewalk. Proximity to the target point and avoidance of crossing the bicycle lane are among the most fundamental principles that are illustrated by the theories and are also the most applied in practice...|$|R

25|$|As {{secure and}} {{convenient}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> {{is a key}} factor in influencing a person's decision to cycle, decent parking infrastructure must be provided to encourage the uptake of cycling. Decent <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> involves weather-proof infrastructure such as lockers, stands, manned or unmanned <b>bicycle</b> <b>parks,</b> as well as bike parking facilities within workplaces to facilitate bicycle commuting. It also will help if certain legal arrangements are put into place to enable legitimate ad hoc parking, for example to allow people to lock their bicycles to railings, signs and other street furniture when individual proper bike stands are unavailable.|$|R
