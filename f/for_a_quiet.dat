To ensure that Nora {{does not show}} up to Parker's (Zane Huett) birthday party, Tom and Lynette tell her that they are having Kayla over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> afternoon. Nora becomes suspicious and arrives at the party unannounced. She is furious over their deception and threatens to take Kayla home, but Tom tries to calm her by inviting Nora to stay. Lynette accuses Tom of putting Nora and Kayla ahead {{of the rest of}} the family, which encourages Tom to ask Nora to leave and pick up Kayla later. Eventually, Nora obliges.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{being placed}} in a {{position}} to shape {{the office of the presidency}} via precedent, Hyde by and large opted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> conservative interpretation of the office. His age and health obligated him to schedule periods of rest throughout his days, and his lack of political experience caused him to defer to his advisers on questions of policy and discretionary powers, especially to his Secretary, Michael McDunphy. On 13 November 1938, just months after Hyde's inauguration, Hyde attended an international soccer match between Ireland and Poland at Dalymount Park in Dublin. This was seen as breaching the GAA's ban on 'foreign games' and he was subsequently removed as patron of the GAA, an honour he had held since 1902.|$|E
25|$|Introverts {{often take}} {{pleasure}} in solitary activities such as reading, writing, using computers, hiking and fishing. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, scientist, engineer, composer and inventor are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though they may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity {{at a time and}} like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents. They are more analytical before speaking. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> more minimally stimulating external environment.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E

Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Haflinger" [...] {{comes from}} the village of Hafling, which today is in {{northern}} Italy. The breed is also called the Avelignese, from the Italian word for Hafling, which is Avelengo or previously Aveligna. Haflingers are always chestnut in color and come in shades ranging from a light gold to a rich golden chestnut or liver hue. [...] The mane and tail are white or flaxen. The height of the breed has increased since the end of World War II, when it stood an average of [...] The desired height today is between [...] Breeders are discouraged from breeding horses under the minimum size, but taller individuals may pass inspection if they otherwise meet requirements of the breed registry. [...] The breed has a refined head and light poll. [...] The neck is of medium length, the withers are pronounced, the shoulders sloping and the chest deep. The back is medium-long and muscular, the croup is long, slightly sloping and well-muscled. The legs are clean, with broad, flat knees and powerful hocks showing clear definition of tendons and ligaments. The Haflinger has rhythmic, ground-covering gaits. The walk is relaxed but energetic. The trot and canter are elastic, energetic, and athletic with a natural tendency to be light on the forehand and balanced. There is some knee action, and the canter has a very distinct motion forwards and upwards. One important consideration in breeding {{during the second half of}} the 20th century was temperament. A requirement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> kind nature has become part of official breed standards and is checked during official inspections. Some sources recognize two types of Haflinger, a shorter, heavier type used for draft work and a taller, lighter type used for pleasure riding, light driving and under-saddle competition. The Food and Agriculture Organization recognizes both an [...] "Avelignese" [...] and an [...] "Avelignese Tradizionale" [...] as existing in Italy, although, as of 2007, only 13 of the latter existed, including only one breeding stallion. However, all breed organizations recognize and register only one type.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "snug", {{sometimes}} called the smoke room, was typically a small, very private room {{with access to the}} bar that had a frosted glass external window, set above head height. A higher price was paid for beer in the snug and nobody could look in and see the drinkers. It was not only the wealthy visitors who would use these rooms. The snug was for patrons who preferred not to be seen in the public bar. Ladies would often enjoy a private drink in the snug in {{a time when it was}} frowned upon for women to be in a pub. The local police officer might nip in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> pint, the parish priest for his evening whisky, or lovers for a rendezvous.|$|E

2500|$|No {{student is}} {{required}} to be Christian to attend the Eastern Nazarene College, but each traditional undergraduate student, upon registering, agrees to {{what is called a}} Lifestyle Covenant: to, among other things, [...] "abstain from the use of illegal drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and to avoid attendance at bars, clubs, or other activities or places of entertainment that promote themes of inappropriate sexuality, violence, profanity, pornography or activities demeaning to human life." [...] The Student Handbook also specifies that [...] "No person shall engage in sexual acts with anyone other than a spouse." [...] While some guidelines might appear to be [...] "relics from another era," [...] according to the Boston Globe, the Globe has also noted that other prominent Christian colleges uphold these ideals, and that Eastern Nazarene is known for being a progressive [...] "trendsetter" [...] with a [...] "slightly more liberal bent" [...] than its peers. The John Templeton Foundation has also cited Eastern Nazarene College as an institution that builds character, and the Quincy Patriot Ledger has said that the school's [...] "deep religious roots make <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> campus and good neighbors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wishing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> holiday {{free from}} crime, Poirot goes to Rhodes during the low season in October {{where there are}} but a few guests. Aside from the young Pamela Lyall and Sarah Blake there is Valentine Chantry, a {{consciously}} beautiful woman who seems to swoon under the attentions of Douglas Gold. This is done at the expense of his own wife, Marjorie, a mildly attractive woman, and Valentine's husband Tony Chantry. This is the [...] "triangle" [...] that everyone observes, and it gets rather absurd with the two men vying for Valentine's favour. She seems to delight in the attention. Marjorie Gold soon wins the sympathy of many of the guests of the hotel as her husband is frequently in the company of Valentine, she confesses her own doubts about Valentine to Poirot. Poirot, however, warns her to flee the island if she values her life. The event comes to a head one evening, beginning when Gold and Chantry have a loud argument. Valentine and Marjorie return from a drive, and the former is poisoned by the cocktail her husband gives her. Gold is immediately suspected, as the strophanthin that kills Valentine is found in the pocket of his dinner jacket. Poirot notices otherwise, seeing that Chantry puts it in Gold's pocket just as everyone's attention is on his dying wife. Poirot gives this information to the police, and points out to Pamela Lyall that she was focusing on the wrong triangle. The real triangle was between Douglas, Marjorie and Chantry. Chantry and Marjorie were in love, but they could not get married as Douglas, a Catholic, would not consent to divorce. For this reason, Chantry and Marjorie decided to kill Valentine and ensure that Douglas was blamed for the murder. Also, Poirot's warning to Marjorie Gold was not because he feared she was a victim at risk of being murdered, but the opposite. He was warning her she would be caught, tried, and convicted as one of the culprits, and be hanged for murder.|$|E
