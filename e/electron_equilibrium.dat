40|$|When {{converting}} fractional (percentage) depth doses to tissue-phantom ratios, {{one must}} use {{a factor that}} accounts for the different source-to-point distances. Two minor correction factors are also involved. One is the ratio of total to primary dose at the two different distances from the source, for the same depth and field size. This factor is usually ignored. It was determined experimentally that this can introduce up to 1. 5 % error at 6 MV. The second correction factor reflects differences related to scattered photons and electrons at the depth of normalization in the two geometries. This correction is accounted for in published conversion procedures. It {{was found to be}} less than 1 % provided the normalization depth is sufficient for <b>electron</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> which occurs first well beyond the depth of maximum dose. One may avoid electron-equilibrium problems by using an interim normalization depth that provides <b>electron</b> <b>equilibrium</b> with some margin, renormalizing to a shallower depth if desired.

The interaction between the plasma and the wall is modeled by original boundary conditions : On the one hand, ions are absorbed by the wall while electrons are partially re-emited.

Spatial and temporal characteristics of this turbulence, i. e., amplitudes, correlation times, radial and perpendicular correlation lengths and apparent phase velocities of the density contours, are determined by means of correlation analysis. For a low-density, L-mode discharge with strong equilibrium flow shear exhibiting an internal transport barrier (ITB) in the ion channel, the observed turbulence characteristics are compared with synthetic density turbulence data generated from global, non-linear, gyro-kinetic simulations using the particle-in-cell (PIC) code NEMORB. This validation exercise highlights the need to include increasingly sophisticated physics, e. g., kinetic treatment of trapped <b>electrons,</b> <b>equilibrium</b> flow shear and collisions, to reproduce most of the characteristics of the observed turbulence. Even so, significant discrepancies remain: an underprediction by the simulations of the turbulence amplituide and heat flux at plasma periphery and the finding that the correlation times of the numerically simulated turbulence are typically two orders of magnitude longer than those measured in MAST. Comparison of these correlation times with various linear timescales suggests that, while the measured turbulence is strong and may be `critically balanced', the simulated turbulence is weak.

Of interest are undamped waves {{that are the}} small amplitude limit of nonlinear excitations, such as electron acoustic waves (EAWs). A deviation consisting of a small plateau, a region with zero velocity derivative over a width {{that is a very}} small fraction of the electron thermal speed, is shown to give rise to new undamped modes, which here are named corner modes. The presence of the plateau turns off Landau damping and allows oscillations with phase speeds within the plateau. These undamped waves are obtained in a wide region of the (k,ω__R) plane (ω__R being the real part of the wave frequency and k the wavenumber), away from the well-known `thumb curve' for Langmuir waves and EAWs based on the Maxwellian. Results of nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations that corroborate the existence of these modes are described. It is also shown that deviations caused by fattening the tail of the distribution shift roots off of the thumb curve toward lower k-values and chopping the tail shifts them toward higher k-values. In addition, a rule of thumb is obtained for assessing how the existence of a plateau shifts roots off of the thumb curve.

40|$|The full Klein-Nishina {{cross section}} for the inverse Compton {{scattering}} interactions of electrons implies {{a significant reduction}} of the electron energy loss rate compared to the Thomson limit when the electron energy exceeds the critical Klein-Nishina energy E_K = gamma_K * m_e c^ 2 = 0. 27 m_e^ 2 c^ 2 /(k_BT), where T denotes {{the temperature of the}} photon graybody distribution. As a consequence the total radiative energy loss rate of single electrons exhibits sudden drops in the overall energy loss rate ~ gamma ^ 2 - dependence when the electron energy reaches the critical Klein-Nishina energy. The strength of the drop is proportional to the energy density of the photon radiation field. The diffuse galactic optical photon fields from stars of spectral type B and G-K lead to critical Klein-Nishina energies of 40 and 161 GeV, respectively. Associated with the drop in the loss rate are sudden increases (Klein-Nishina steps) in the equilibrium spectrum of cosmic ray electrons. Because the radiative loss rate of electrons is the main ingredient in any transport model of high-energy cosmic ray electrons, Klein-Nishina steps will modify any calculated <b>electron</b> <b>equilibrium</b> spectrum irrespective of the electron sources and spatial transport mode. To delineate most clearly the consequences of the Klein-Nishina drops in the radiative loss rate, we chose as illustrative example the simplest realistic model for cosmic ray electron dynamics in the Galaxy, consisting of the competition of radiative losses and secondary production by inelastic hadron-hadron collisions.
