5000|$|About 58% of the {{vineyard}} area {{that existed in}} 1900 has since become a wasteland; another 16% lies fallow 40 to 80% of the time. Some 480 ha remains and the trend is decreasing: in 2006, only 380 ha of that 480 hectares was actually used to grow grapes. The wastelands are overgrown with bushes and, over time, they revert to being forests. This is a big problem. If we want to retain {{the character of the}} landscape, we will have to find new uses for the terraces, or at least maintain them and keep them open. The Land consolidation program at the Oelsberg in Oberwesel provides a successful example of preserving the terraces without major movement of dirt. By creating transverse terraces and construction of a drip irrigation system, the characteristic small parcels could be retained for the viticulture industry. At Bacharach, a smooth transformation to facilitate the maintenance of the trellis is in the planning stage. Particularly distinctive landmarks, such as the single layers at Roßstein opposite Oberwesel, or below Stahleck Castle at Bacharach, or around Gutenfels Castle at Kaub deserve the continuation of the industry to maintain the appeal of the cultural landscape. At the foot of many of the Middle Rhine Valley castles, we now find derelict vineyards and scrubland. Reintroducing viticulture would restore the much sought-after picture postcard idyll, in which the light and fine-grained green and rich yellow (in the autumn) of the terraced vineyards, with their small parcels, contrasts nicely with the darker green of the forest. [...] Despite parcel consolidation, use of mechanization is limited, as most vineyards are too steep to allow access using wheeled tractors or <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters.</b> This means, all labour is still done manually. Consequently, the only profitable vineyards are the ones selling their own bottled wine, and even they need the extra income from renting out apartments or restaurants or even an ostrich farm.

40|$|A {{survey of}} 190 wine and table grape {{farmers in the}} Western Cape puts the average wage for farm labour at R 928 per month in 2003 and R 1123 per month in 2004. Output per worker has doubled since 1983. On farms with <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters,</b> labour is 30 per cent more {{productive}} (48 ton/worker) than on farms where wine grapes are picked by hand (37 ton/worker). At 9. 75 tons per worker, table grapes are four times as labour-intensive as wine grapes. Resident men dominate the workforce on wine farms, while the resident female workforce is 20 per cent larger than the resident male workforce on table grape farms. Seasonal workers contribute a third of labour in table grapes, and brokers less than ten per cent in either case. In a single-equation short-run Hicksian demand function, wage, output, capital levels and mechanisation intensities are highly significant determinants of employment. Higher wages decrease employment and larger output increases employment. More mechanisation, measured {{by the number of}} tractors used to produce a ton of fruit, raises labour intensity too. <b>Grape</b> <b>harvesters</b> could not be shown to reduce jobs. The ten per cent rise in the minimum wage planned for March 2005 could reduce employment by 3. 3 per cent in the wine industry and 5. 9 per cent in the table grape industry, but {{it is more likely that}} the wage increase will be offset against fewer benefits.

40|$|Today {{also those}} {{countries}} boasting a century-old olive growing tradition {{have to look}} at the latest, most dynamic, non labour-intensive olive growing systems to abate production (notably, harvesting operations) costs and remain competitive in a globalized market. This is why over the last few years super intensive olive orchard cultivation has been attracting a lot of interest on the part of olive growers all over the world as it accounts for an innovative model whereby olive groves are tailored to the special needs of <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters.</b> This paper reports the first results of experimental mechanical harvesting tests in a super-intensive olive cultivation. The study is intended to explore both productivity and work capacity of two of the most commonly used <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters,</b> Grégoire G 120 SW and New Holland Braud VX 680, in a view to assessing their harvesting performance by a series of tests conducted in Spain. On the basis of the tests it was possible to verify that the machines are able to detach the almost all the drupes (more than 90 %), with one only passage, and this independently of both size and location of drupes on the tree crown and of their maturity stage. Using these machines, two people can often carry out the whole harvest process: an operator driving the harvester and another person transferring the fruit from the harvester in the field to the olive oil mill for processing. With this system, the work speed is usually, in the best working conditions, about 1. 7 km/hour and the average harvesting time is about 2. 5 - 3 hours/ha. For the time being it is however impossible to draw definitive conclusions in terms of performance of the above cultivation systems and harvesting machines.

As technology improves mechanical harvesters have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and unripe or rotted bunches which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable {{in the production of}} white and sparkling wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.|$|R

There is lack of data, however, regarding the accuracy of such {{weighing systems}} mounted on harvesting machinery, especially on that used to collect high value crops such as fruits and vegetables. Certainly, dynamic weighing systems mounted on the bins of <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{are affected by the}} displacement of the load inside the bin when moving over terrain of changing topography. In this work, the load that would be registered in a grape harvester bin by a dynamic weighing system based on the use of a load cell was inferred by using the discrete element method (DEM). DEM is a numerical technique capable of accurately describing the behaviour of granular materials under dynamic situations and it has been proven to provide successful predictions in many different scenarios. In this work, different DEM models of a grape harvester bin were developed contemplating different influencing factors. Results obtained from these models were used to infer the output given by the load cell of a real bin. The mass detected by the load cell when the bin was inclined depended strongly on the distribution of the load within the bin, but was underestimated in all scenarios. The distribution of the load was found to be dependent on the inclination of the bin caused by the topography of the terrain, but also by the history of inclination (inclination rate, presence of static periods, etc.) since the effect of the inertia of the particles (i. e., representing the grapes) was not negligible. Some recommendations are given to try to improve the accuracy of crop load measurement in the field...|$|E

In the CROPS project also attention is paid to reliable detection and classification of objects and obstacles for autonomous navigation in a safe way in plantations and forests. For the several applications within the CROPS project platforms were developed. Sensing systems and appropriate vision algorithms for the platforms have been developed. For the software platform the Robot Operating System (ROS) is used.

40|$|BACKGROUND Super-intensive {{cultivation}} facilitates olive mechanized harvesting, allowing substantial {{savings in}} the production cost of virgin olive oil (VOO). However, the number of varieties adapted {{to this type of}} cultivation is small. This study explores the impact that harvesting with a <b>grape</b> straddle <b>harvester</b> of ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ and ‘Manzanilla Cacereña’ olives grown in super-intensive cultivation has on the physiology of the fruit {{and the quality of the}} oil subsequently extracted. RESULTS For both cultivars, fruits harvested mechanically showed higher respiration and ethylene production and lower firmness than fruits harvested by hand. Their oils exhibited lower phenol contents, lower oxidative stability and lower presence of positive sensory attributes. However, in these oils the values of parameters used to assess the level of quality of VOO remained within the limits required for the best commercial category. CONCLUSION Mechanical harvesting of ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ and ‘Manzanilla Cacereña’ super-high-density hedgerows induced physiological alterations in the fruits and a reduction in the contents of natural antioxidants and flavour components in the oils, though it did not result in a loss of the ‘Extra’ level of quality. © 2014 Society of Chemical IndustryThis work was funded by the research project AGL 2011 - 30371 -C 02 - 02 of the Spanish State Secretary for Research and by the FEDER program.

Trunk shaking is not an adequate option {{due to lack of}} space and intense strain in labour and machinery. Continuous canopy shaking is the obvious approach, not only increasing working capacity but also overcoming the problem of scarce and expensive labour. Continuous canopy shaking harvesting equipment available today are adapted over-the-row <b>grape</b> or coffee-beans <b>harvesters.</b> Recently purposely built, rotor type, large over-the-row olive harvesters, mainly of South American and Australian design, are too heavy and expensive, hardly suitable to the difficult wet soil conditions encountered in the Mediterranean countries. Tree growth is a limitation for the over-the-row concept. These harvesters may be used for a considerable number of harvest campaigns in groves of the limited growth Arbequina cultivar, but only up to the third production year in groves based on normal growth local cultivars. Tree growth limitation can only be adequately dealt with the side-row concept. Furthermore the side-row concept tends to be simpler and less expensive, meaning lower running costs. In 2009, the SIDE-ROW CONTINUOS CANOPY SHAKING FRUIT HARVESTER project was set to develop such technology. This paper describes a prototype and gives an account of the different stages of its development. The equipment comprises two symmetrical harvesters that follow a tree row one at each side. Each harvester is based on a trailed type structure towed by a farm tractor which also drives, through its power-take-off, the hydraulic power pack that ensures hydraulic energy for most of the hydraulic actuators. An operator in the control station controls the harvest through electro-hydraulic controls. A vibratory rotor with flexible rods is used for engaging and shaking the fruit bearing branches. Each harvester also comprises a catching platform with conveyors belts delivering fruits to a temporary storage bag which is hydraulically lowered to the ground when full. The row side of the harvester is bordered along the edge by flexible synthetic interface with the tree trunk. After two harvesting campaigns the basic concept is now set. Minor detail solutions will be addressed in 2013. Investors are now being attracted to finance pre-series machines intended for durability tests which will define the product for the market...|$|R
