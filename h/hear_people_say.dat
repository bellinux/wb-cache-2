We shared some technology with Naughty Dog way back when, and that was great, but we are a company that puts stock in developing specialized technology {{and we will continue to}} do so."

500|$|Several suicides were {{connected}} to the campaign, including a Cuban gay activist in Miami named Ovidio [...] "Herbie" [...] Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> homosexuals should be deported, forced into concentration camps, or executed. Ramos shot himself {{a few days later}} after telling a friend, [...] "I didn't know they hated us so much". Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, [...] "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I {{had anything to do with}} it, but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Albert's marriage, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} of his continual bachelor status. Although he had received much press attention for dating well-known fashion models and actresses, his apparent disinclination to marry gave rise to rumours that he was homosexual. Prince Albert has consistently denied suggestions of homosexuality, most notably in a 1994 interview published in the French magazine Madame Figaro. [...] "At first it was amusing", he said, [...] "but it becomes very irritating {{in the long term}} to <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that I am homosexual". In July 2011, Prince Albert married Charlene Wittstock.|$|E

But I hasten to remind them that Martin Luther King, Jr. said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream, to make room at the table of brotherhood and sisterhood for lesbian and gay people." ...|$|E

It was a part of his Southern gallantry--his accent always came out {{strongly}} when he said anything of that sort--and it committed him to nothing in particular. She had had occasion to wish, more than once, that he wouldn't be so beastly polite, as she used to <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> in England. She answered that she didn't care about ends, she cared about beginnings; but he didn't take up the declaration; he returned to the subject of Olive, wanted to know what she had done over there, whether she had worked them up much.|$|E

"It is a {{long and}} very {{interesting}} story, but in substance it is this: While in a condition of contemptuous disbelief as to the alleged phenomena of spiritualism, Sir William chanced to witness a séance wherein a young girl named Florence Cook was the medium. Her doings so puzzled and interested him that he went {{again and again to}} see her. Dissatisfied with the conditions under which the wonders took place, he asked Miss Cook to come to his house and sit for him and his friends. This she did. She was a mere girl at the time, about seventeen years of age, and yet she baffled this great chemist and all his assistants. You sometimes <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> 'Yes, but he was in his dotage.' He was not. He was in his early prime. He brought to bear all his thirty years' training in exact observation, and all the mechanical and electrical appliances he could devise, without once detecting anything deceitful." ...|$|E
500|$|Other issues {{included}} the studio's desire to substitute Montreal or Prague for Paris {{in order to}} lower costs, Liman's insistence {{on the use of}} a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc. In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich; several scenes set in Zürich were also filmed in Prague. Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, [...] "When I <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> that the production was a nightmare it's like, a 'nightmare'? Shooting's always hard, but we finished." ...|$|R
5000|$|I just didn't {{want us to}} be the Lady Bulldogs. I could <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "There comes Coach Hogg and all of {{her little}} b!+¢#ə$." [...] Former head coach Sonja Hogg on the Lady Techsters {{nickname}} in 2009 In 1974, Louisiana Tech President F. Jay Taylor established the university's first women's athletic program, a women's basketball team. He hired a 28-year-old P.E. teacher at Ruston High School, Sonja Hogg, as the program's first head coach. However, Hogg refused to call her team the Lady Bulldogs after the La Tech men's nickname. She asserted that bulldogs were [...] "unfeminine" [...] and that [...] "a lady dog is a b!+¢#." [...] For that reason, her first initiative as head coach was to nix the nickname Bulldogs from any connection with her team. Thus, Hogg decided to change her team's nickname to the Lady Techsters.|$|R

6000|$|... 'You {{need not}} be afraid, kind Mary,' wrote Averil, on {{the first days of}} her voyage; 'I am quite well, as well as a thing can be whose heart is dried up. I am {{hardened}} past all feeling, and seem to be made of India-rubber. Even my colour has returned--how I hate to see it, and to <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> my roses will surprise the delicate Americans. Fancy, in a shop in London I met an old school-fellow, who was delighted to see me, talked like old times, and insisted on knowing where we were staying. I used to be very fond of her, but it was as if I had been dead and was afraid she would find out I was a ghost, yet I talked quite indifferently, and never faltered in my excuses. When we embarked, it was no use to know it was the last of England, where he and you and home and life were left. How I envied the poor girl, who was crying as if her heart would break!' ...|$|E

The poor woman has not been dead long enough for {{anything}} to come of that, but I do not believe anything ever will. There are {{people who say that}} Mr. Windham drinks; but I have seen no signs of it. Then there is another one--and no matter what you may <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> about these things, you must never mention that I told you this. Mrs. Barnes, the rector's wife, has spoken to Margaret on the subject. She looks very well, so far as I can judge; but there is consumption in her family. She is almost bigoted in regard to the duties of a rector's wife. She tries just as hard as she can to fill the position properly herself, and she knows Mr. Barnes would never be satisfied with any one who did not agree with him as she does about the responsibilities of a rector's wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} so {{degrading}} as the constant anxiety about one's means of livelihood. I {{have nothing but}} contempt {{for the people who}} despise money. They are hypocrites or fools. Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five. Without an adequate income half the possibilities of life are shut off. The only thing to be careful about is that you do not pay more than a shilling for the shilling you earn. You will <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that poverty is the best spur to the artist. They have never felt the iron of it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It exposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into your soul like a cancer. It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank, and independent. I pity with all my heart the artist, whether he writes or paints, who is entirely dependent for subsistence upon his art." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems almost}} like a foolhardy risk," [...] Julien muttered. [...] "If those fellows could have got at him, they'd have killed him. Have they gone back to their room, I wonder? Let us <b>hear</b> what the <b>people</b> <b>say</b> about the affair." ...|$|R

60|$|When we hear, as {{we often}} <b>hear,</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> 'What a noble-hearted man that is after all, {{and yet he}} is going to the devil!' let us {{remember}} the penitent thief and have hope. Who would have seemed to have gone to the devil more hopelessly than that poor thief when he hung upon the cross? And yet the devil did not have him. There was in him a seed of good, and of eternal life, which the devil had not trampled out; and that seed flowered and bore fruit upon the very cross in noble thoughts and words and deeds. Why may it not be so with others? True, they may receive the due reward of their deeds. They may end in shame and misery, like the penitent thief. Perhaps it may be good for them to do so. If a man will sow the wind, it may be good for him to reap the whirlwind, and so find out that sowing the wind will not prosper. The penitent thief did so. As the proverb is, he sowed the gallows-acorn, poor wretch, and he reaped the gallows-tree; but that gallows-tree taught him to confess God's justice, and his own sin, and so it may teach others.|$|E
60|$|December 7.--Being a blank {{day in the}} rolls, I {{stayed at}} home and wrote four leaves--not very freely or happily; I {{was not in the}} vein. Plague on it! Stayed at home the whole day. There is one thing I believe {{peculiar}} to me--I work, that is, meditate for the purpose of working, best, when I have a quasi engagement with some other book for example. When I find myself doing ill, or like to come to a stand-still in writing, I take up some slight book, a novel or the like, and usually have not read far ere my difficulties are removed, and I am ready to write again. There must be two currents of ideas going on in my mind at the same time,[89] or perhaps the slighter occupation serves like a woman's wheel or stocking to ballast the mind, as it were, by preventing the thoughts from wandering, and so give the deeper current the power to flow undisturbed. I always laugh when I <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> Do one thing at once. I have done a dozen things at once all my life. Dined with the family. After dinner Lockhart's proofs came in and occupied me for the evening. I wish I have not made that article too long, and Lockhart will not snip away.|$|E
60|$|Thus I {{came out}} of the contest a loser, but as a {{compensation}} had the knowledge that my physicians were false prophets; that, barring accidents, I could count on thirty, forty, even fifty years with their summers and autumns and winters. And that was the life I desired-- the life the heart can conceive--the earth life. When I <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> they have not found the world and life so agreeable or interesting as to be in love with it, or that they look with equanimity to its end, I am apt to think they have never been properly alive nor seen with clear vision the world they think so meanly of, or anything in it--not a blade of grass. Only I know that mine is an exceptional case, that the visible world is to me more beautiful and interesting than to most persons, that the delight I experienced in my communing with Nature did not pass away, leaving nothing but a recollection of vanished happiness to intensify a present pain. The happiness was never lost, but owing to that faculty I have spoken of, had a cumulative effect on the mind and was mine again, so that in my worst times, when I was compelled to exist shut out from Nature in London for long periods, sick and poor and friendless, I could yet always feel that it was infinitely better to be than not to be.|$|E
