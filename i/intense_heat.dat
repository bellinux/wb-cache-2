Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks.

These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E

5|$|Artisans {{from across}} India were {{recruited}} to craft the props. The costumes {{were designed by}} Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery stitched the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment.

40|$|The {{tracking}} {{mechanism for}} a point-focusing concentrator {{may be subject}} to failure. If this should occur, the solar image will travel across the aperture plate, and it may also impinge on the adjacent support structure. Such an event is called 'sun walk-off'. The present investigation is concerned with the transient response of different aperture plate materials to the <b>intense</b> <b>heating</b> produced in a typical walk-off situation for parabolic dish concentrators. Receivers for two solar module systems are considered, including a high-temperature receiver that utilizes a 2 -milliradian (mrad) concentrator, and a lower-temperature receiver which is coupled with a 4 -mrad concentrator. It is found that during a walk-off situation the solar image travels in a straight line in the radial direction. The results obtained for a copper aperture plate were disappointing. It appears that passive metallic plates without cooling or other protective support cannot withstand the <b>intense</b> <b>heating...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the other}} races of the 1935 season, Caracciola won the Eifelrennen at the NÃ¼rburgring and {{finished}} second at the Penya Rhin Grand Prix in Barcelona. He {{also won the}} Tripoli Grand Prix, organised by the Libyan Governor-General Italo Balbo. The Grand Prix {{was held in the}} desert, around a salt lake, and because of the <b>intense</b> <b>heat</b> Neubauer was concerned that the tyres on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and held it to the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where he began to feel he had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The <b>intense</b> <b>heat</b> burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. <b>Intense</b> <b>heat,</b> dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E

5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the <b>intense</b> <b>heat</b> generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the <b>intense</b> <b>heat.</b> Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Back in MopÃ¡n, AmÃ©squeta had {{received}} additional supplies {{and decided to}} catch up with his advance party. He left MopÃ¡n on 10 March 1696 with friar AgustÃ­n Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from DÃ­az or AjK'ixaw. On 20 March AmÃ©squeta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find DÃ­az's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in <b>intense</b> <b>heat</b> they met up with some Verapaz porters that DÃ­az had left behind. They followed DÃ­az's trail to the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that DÃ­az's party had passed that way, and AmÃ©squeta assumed that they had crossed to NojpetÃ©n. He wrote a letter to DÃ­az, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with AmÃ©squeta. During various attempts at communication to verify DÃ­az's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of AmÃ©squeta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in DÃ­az's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.|$|E
