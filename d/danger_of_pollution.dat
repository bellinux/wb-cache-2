Efforts are underway to improve the ecology of the Haw River, but there is disagreement between various environmental groups, local governments, and economic interests as to how to proceed. Recently, the newly revised Jordan Lake Rules have improved regulatory issues which affect future pollution. Most sections of the Haw are clean by reports from the state Water Quality Section, securing it as a recreational and water supply asset.|$|E

50|$|Much of the Trump administration's {{efforts to}} {{decrease}} pollution regulation involved directly rescinding or overturning pollution regulations enacted under the Obama administration. On February 16, 2017, President Donald Trump signed a resolution overturning President Obama's Stream Protection Rule, {{after being in}} effect for less than 30 days. On February 28, 2017, President Trump enacted an executive order to allow the Administrator of the EPA to revise or rescind the Clean Water Rule {{in the name of}} economic growth and eliminating ambiguous regulations. Research cited by the EPA shows that one in three Americans get their water from public drinking water systems which are partly sourced from streams protected by the Clean Water Rule. These streams may be in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> by industrial and agricultural waste, sewage, radioactive materials and a large number of other pollutants now covered by the Clean Water Rule. The administration has also proposed a rollback on the Obama administration's extension of federal jurisdiction over lands protected by the Clean Water Act in attempts to reduce water pollution in areas surrounding toxic waste facilities. The Trump administration has additionally rescinded rules limiting mercury and air toxins from power plants, limiting water pollution from coal plants, banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos, and banning methane emissions from landfills, among other rules, which has resulted in lawsuits from various environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Many of the lawsuits have been successful, such as a lawsuit from the Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups against the Trump administration's decision to suspend a rule which limited methane emissions from oil and gas wells, a decision which was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.|$|E

40|$|The basic task of {{this paper}} is to' obtain {{information}} according to which the degree of contamination to the soils with certain metals such as Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Co, As will be detennined along,. the Zletovica River flow by means of geochemical exploration. These explorations should serve for making a study about the environment within the great project for the construction of the watereconomy site Zletovica. The increased concentration of heavy metals in the samples of soil taken from the previously mentioned exploration wells at the both exploration profiles (I-II) is a potential danger for polluting the surface water flows of the rivers and the underground water that are in direct hydraulic relation to these water flows. Looking downstream, the surface water from the mentioned rivers empty into the Bregalnica River. It, along its flow, has formed alluvial detritus where a confined type of aquifer with free level was fonned. The city of Stip, as well as other inhabited places in the region, is being water supplied from such water aquifer. For getting a final conclusion about !he <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> of great ground water quantities (aquifers) from local and regional aspect, it is necessary to carry out detailed hydrogeological and geochemical exploration works. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{changes in}} human {{population}} often correspond with change in land use, including expansion of urban areas, agriculture and increasing industrialization, which necessitate increasing the available amount of drinking water. As the surface water sources {{are under the}} pressure of pollution, it has become necessary to use groundwater at an increasing rate. Groundwater recharge can be abundant in the alluvial plains where the urban areas are often located. Such areas can face <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> of groundwater and the changes in land use are likely to result in change in groundwater quality. Keeping these aspects in view, it was planned to development a groundwater water quality index in the Ganga-Yamuna interfluve area of northern India, The objective of the present study is to develop the Index of Aquifer Water Quality (IAWQ) inside the Geographic information system (GIS) environment, which can be used by the field investigators and modelers in assessing the groundwater vulnerability. The formula to estimate the IAWQ index is adopted from the procedure suggested Melloul and Collin (1998). The procedure developed for this involves weights assigned to these 8 parameters as per their analytical hierarchy in violating the (drinking water) standards and not as an arbitrary means (as taken by Melloul and Collin). The suggested procedure can be extending to include more number of chemical parameters as necessitate in individual case studies. In the modified procedure presented in the present study, the number of measured chemical parameters n is taken as 8 (Cd, Mn, Pb, Fe, NO 3 -, Total Alkalinity, TDS and Ca 2 +) as against n= 2 (chloride and nitrate) as taken in the Melloul and Collins work...|$|E
40|$|In Western economies {{the role}} of the state was minimal in the early phases of industrialization. The old liberalist {{doctrine}} was that the maximum of social welfare would automatically be attained if every individual strove for maximum personal welfare. Subsequent economic thinking as well as experience have taught that this applies under very restrictive conditions only. Correspondingly an increasing number of tasks have been assumed by the state, of which a series of examples are given. This is not the end; new tasks are now seen as a consequence of pollution, especially by the development of motor traffic, of the chemical industries and as a consequence of the claim of workers to more industrial democracy. Recently the process of inflation has added the need for control of incomes so as to make income distribution more equitable. Examples are given of the instruments the Netherlands government has now been given by parliament in order to control high incomes. In addition a cultural crisis prevails requiring a stricter application of existing law and new educational policies. Moreover the establishment of the new international order will add new obligations to national governments. Such new obligations may be created by treaties concluded in order to further the development of low-income countries, to reduce the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution,</b> of overfishing, etc. International taxes may be among the new instruments of national development policies. With the increase in state tasks the danger of overbureaucratization — already expressed in „Parkinson's law" — will grow further. Structural changes will be needed in order to reduce this danger. Generally speaking decentralization of a number of activities is needed; in other words, delegation of tasks to lower hierarchical levels. Another way of reducing the degree of bureaucracy is the simplification of unnecessarily complicated regulations, for instance in social insurance or assistance systems.
