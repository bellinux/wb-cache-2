This knowledge (Kevala Jnana), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are <b>incomplete,</b> <b>and</b> at best a partial truth. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.|$|E

An explicit formulae for hyperharmonic numbers, general generating functions of the Fibonacci- and Lucas numbers are obtained. Besides we define "hyperfibonacci numbers", "hyperlucas numbers".

5|$|Public {{communication}} from Malaysian officials regarding {{the loss of}} the flight was initially beset with confusion. The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, <b>incomplete,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders. Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were more significant than many other rustbelt cities. Several major development projects <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in office that assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures to homeowners. Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small resurgence in 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|As {{there is}} no {{definitive}} date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded, the boxing record associated with Dyer is incomplete. His total bouts and results presently stand, as listed by Boxrec, as 72 fights, of which 44 were wins (14 by knockout), 20 loses (4 by knockout), 6 draws and 2 'no contests'. It is accepted that this list is <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> more bouts could be added in future, or changed.|$|E
5|$|Baden was not {{originally}} intended to be surrendered {{under the terms of}} the Armistice, but was substituted for the battlecruiser Mackensen, which lay <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> could not put to sea. As a result, instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918, Baden left Germany on 7 January 1919. The Royal Navy inspected the ship on 9 January, but many of the technical instruments, including gunnery equipment, had been removed before the ship left Germany.|$|E

An <b>incomplete</b> pass <b>and</b> a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty <b>and</b> another <b>incomplete</b> pass, <b>and</b> Florida State was forced to punt. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed {{to capitalize on the}} defensive stop.

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> a few are contradictory.|$|E

5|$|In 1843, German {{botanist}} Carl Adolf Terscheck named {{a specimen}} of cactus collected in Mexico Echinocactus reichenbachii, but his description was <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> proved unhelpful to later scholars. During the years 1848 to 1856, George Engelmann made extensive studies {{of a plant}} he named Echinocereus caespitosus. Prior to this Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck referred to plants in European collections as Echinopsis pectinate var. reichenbachiana, and he later discussed the possibility with Engelmann that these two plants were one in the same.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this success, joined {{by the forces of}} John Doukas, John Palaiologos marched south into Thessaly, seizing and fortifying its fortresses, until he reached the town of Neopatras, where he made his camp for a time. He then continued on into Boeotia, the territory of the Duchy of Athens, where he took and plundered Levadeia and Thebes. At this point, however, John Doukas defected back to his father, upsetting the balance of power and John himself was soon after recalled to Lampsacus. Thus, his conquest of Greece remained <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> was soon reversed by the recovery of Epirus' fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Running back Dwayne Thomas gained six {{yards on}} the first play, then earned a first down at the 30-yard line on an option play. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Druckenmiller completed a nine-yard throw to Still. Tech committed a false-start penalty on third down, but the Hokies made up the penalty and earned a first down when Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings at the Texas 45-yard line. On the first play after the completion, Druckenmiller was sacked for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was <b>incomplete,</b> <b>and</b> the Hokies punted again.|$|E

5|$|Tech's Thomas gained six {{yards on}} a {{run up the}} middle, then Druckenmiller ran ahead for a one-yard gain. On third down, Tech {{committed}} a 10-yard penalty, negating {{what would have been}} a first-down run. A long pass on third down fell <b>incomplete,</b> <b>and</b> Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the quarter.

5|$|The Boston College drive {{began on}} its own 35-yard line. With little time remaining, Boston College would have to {{complete}} one or more Hail Mary passes. Although the odds of completing one such pass, let alone several, were very low, many Virginia Tech fans remained worried, as Boston College had previously beaten the Hokies in similar circumstances earlier in the season. Matt Ryan's first two passes fell <b>incomplete,</b> <b>and</b> his third was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi and returned 40yards for a Virginia Tech touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses.

The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is <b>incomplete</b> <b>and</b> of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.|$|E
