50|$|Some {{methods of}} lifting {{are good for}} the rear, {{but not for the}} front, such as lifting blocks. Lifting the rear with blocks is a common way to achieve the desired height. This is done by {{installing}} a block, of the desired <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift,</b> in between the leaf spring and leaf spring perch and installing longer U-bolts. It is a bad method for the front primarily because of safety issues while braking. When braking, the front wheels create the majority of the braking force. The block moves this lateral force, caused by braking, higher above the axle than it did in the stock form. This can cause the block to become displaced from its location and result in total loss of control.

40|$|Twelve {{subjects}} {{participated in}} {{an investigation of the}} biomechanical stresses of asymmetric lifting in stooped and kneeling postures. Three factors were manipulated in this study: Posture (stooped or kneeling), <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> (35 or 70 cm), and weight of lift (15, 20, or 25 kg). Subjects were required to lift or lower a box every 10 seconds for a period of 2 minutes. Electromyography (PIG) of eight trunk muscles was collected during a lift in this period. The PIG data, normalized to maximum extension and flexion exertions in each posture, were input to a biomechanical model and used to predict compression and shear forces at the L, level of the lumbar spine. Results from the EMG-driven biomechanical model indicated that compression was greater when lifting to a higher shelf (p < 0. 001), and indicated a significant interaction between posture and the weight of the lifting box (p < 0. 01). Peak lateral shear was not significantly affected by any main effects or interactions (p < 0. 05). Anterior shear was increased with increasing <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> (p < 0. 001), and also by the posture x weight interaction (p c 0. 01). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated a complex relationship for recruitment of the eight trunk muscles, with the triple interaction being significant (p < 0. 001). The results of this investigation will be used to evaluate safe loads for lifting in these restricted postures...|$|E
40|$|Determining an {{optimum height}} is remarked {{as one of}} the most {{important}} issues in heap designing and this is obtained by calculating the number and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> heap <b>lifts.</b> Although the increase <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> <b>height</b> has benefits in heap leaching method from economic point of view, it will reduce the stability and make process problems such as low permeability. The current paper analyzes the effect of sulphuric acid irrigation on the strength parameters of Miduk oxide copper ores. In addition, the result of the process experiments have evaluated with different irrigation rates as well as variable conditions of permeability. From process view, approximately 75 % of copper is recovered at irrigation rate of 8 l/hm 2. Due to the significance of economic and process parameters in determining the optimum <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifts,</b> these parameters are simultaneously studied. The results are demonstrated that although the increase of irrigation rate and permeability can lead to more copper recovery in this mine, it will remarkably decrease the stable <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifts.</b> Moreover, changes in the bed slope will have a similar effect on the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lifts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although the {{development}} of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) equation was partly based on the expertise of committee members convened under the auspices of NIOSH, to our knowledge, there is no study reported in the published literature that examined the role of professional expertise in determining the relative contribution of different lifting task variables to effort exertion. In this study, we explored whether professional expertise can be relied on, {{through the use of a}} systematic procedure, to quantify the effects of lifting task parameters on perceived effort and risk of injury outcome measures. Three international experts participated in the research reported herein and evaluated the interactive effects of 6 lifting variables: (a) weight of load. (b) horizontal distance, (c) frequency of handling, (d) work duration. (e) twisting angle, and (f) <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b> They predicted the lifting effort and the injury risk of a large number of lifting configurations. A linguistic approach was used to describe the lifting activities. Logistic regression analyses were employed to model effort as a function of various lifting task variables. The results showed that all 3 experts rated the weight of load as the most dominant variable and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> as the least important variable. Furthermore, they differed slightly in ranking the relative importance or other variables. In general, the effect of weight of load on physical effort was, at a minimum, 2 times more important than other lifting task variables. The horizontal distance, work duration, frequency, and twisting angle variables were considered to be more important than the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> by 25 % to 33 %. Collectively, these findings indicate that the experts a greed on the most and least important variables, In between, the relative importance of other variables was dependent on the professional training of the expert. The results further demonstrated that an increase in perceived physical effort was associated with an increase in the perceived risk of injury in the moderate- to high-range values. There was a large variance, however, at the lower levels of physical effort and perceived risk. Collectively, the aforementioned findings confirm the notion that low-level effort exertion activities are not perceived by the experts as risky. As the level of exertion increases, to moderate values, however, the experts start to be conscious about the risks, involved in the manual lifting activities, Therefore, one should not treat these 2 variables as equals, because they may reflect 2 separate dimensions in the low range. In the moderate to high range, they have some common variance but they may still reflect some differences to a certain extent. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to document how workers from different cultures and with different physical characteristics evaluate physical effort in industrial lifting activities. Three hundred and seventy-nine workers in Hong Kong were asked to evaluate the interactive effort of three lifting variables: weight of load, horizontal distance and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b> Logistic regression analysis was used to model the effort as a function of the lifting input variables. The input variables were subsequently classified according to the relationship between the input and output variables. The results showed that human personal knowledge and expertise can indeed be used to evaluate the physical effort required for different lifting tasks. Also, there was no difference in the cognitive reasoning pattern in evaluating the physical effort between the Hong Kong workers and the US workers...|$|E
