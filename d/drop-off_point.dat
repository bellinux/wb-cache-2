5|$|The largest {{change has}} been the {{downgrading}} of the former through route of New England Street in favour of a new north–south road, Fleet Street, which diverges to the west. This has allowed {{a large part of}} New England Street to be narrowed, pedestrianised and provided with cycle lanes. In contrast, Cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic, as it becomes the main east-west route in the New England Quarter, taking traffic between London Road and Fleet Street, the main north–south road. Two new roads, Stroudley Road and Billinton Road, have been built {{to the west of the}} new Fleet Street, between there and the railway line. These give access to the car park, Bellerbys College and a new pick-up and <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> immediately outside the side entrance to the station. Two new pedestrianised squares—Ann Square and New England Square—have also been created within the core site.|$|E
5|$|Based in Nui Dat, the SASR was {{responsible}} for providing intelligence to both the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and US forces, operating throughout Phuoc Tuy Province as well as Bien Hoa, Long Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces. From 1966 SASR squadrons rotated through Vietnam on year-long deployments, {{with each of the}} three Sabre Squadrons completing two tours before the last squadron was withdrawn in 1971. Missions included medium range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory. Operating in small groups of four to six men they moved more slowly than conventional infantry through jungle or bushland and were heavily armed, employing a high rate of fire to simulate a larger force on contact and to support their withdrawal. The primary method of deployment was by helicopter, with the SASR working closely with No. 9 Squadron RAAF which regularly provided rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree top height. On occasion, SASR patrols were also deployed by M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) with a method devised to deceive the Viet Cong as to their insertion and the location of their <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> despite the noise they made moving through the jungle. An operational parachute jump was also undertaken.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the island}} {{has become a}} major <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> {{especially}} for Dominicans, as well as Haitians and Cubans trying to reach Puerto Rico illegally. As a U.S. Commonwealth, Puerto Rico is seen by many illegal migrants as a stepping stone to the United States. On the other hand, they are usually deported immediately.|$|E

25|$|Parts of Canberra {{formed the}} {{backdrop}} for Cold War espionage activity, highlighted during the 1954 Petrov Affair when a Soviet Union spy defected to Australia. Telopea Park in south Canberra was a known <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> for KGB spies based at the nearby USSR Embassy. This embassy was constantly monitored by ASIO agents based in the Kingston Hotel located across the street. There was also an ASIO listening post {{on the grounds of}} Canberra Grammar School. In 1991, {{with the end of the}} Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the embassy grounds became the Russian Embassy.|$|E
25|$|Between 1998 and 2002, in {{preparation}} for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the station underwent a £100 million redevelopment. The glass roof of the trainshed, which is Grade II listed was re-glazed and re-painted. A new main entrance and enlarged concourse with a mezzanine level, designed by BDP, replaced the 1960s structure which had become insufficient for the number of passengers. A moving walkway was installed to take passengers from the concourse to platforms 13 and 14 at the far south end of the station which involves a long walk. Another entrance was also created on Fairfield Street to access a new taxi rank and <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> for cars.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} large urban centers currently face is managing solid waste. One way to reduce the problem is to encourage the voluntary delivery of waste by individuals, thus allowing its separation and impeding soil contamination, as well as reducing the pressure exerted on landfills. But big cities like Sao Paulo pose an additional difficulty {{for those who want to}} properly dispose of waste: the location of <b>drop-off</b> <b>points,</b> usually at run-down or little-known sites, such as under overpasses. In this article we propose a website to aid in finding <b>drop-off</b> <b>points</b> as well as contacts of waste recycling cooperatives and others. We also describe the website creation process, in order to encourage its adoption by other stakeholders...|$|R

The Piersons wire the ransom to Berlin, and Ripley takes it to the appointed <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> where he impulsively kills one of the kidnappers. The other three drive off. Ripley returns with the money and arranges a rendezvous at a gay bar, which he infiltrates by dressing in drag.

Ripley scares the amateur thugs into dashing out of the apartment, and he single-handedly rescues the semi-conscious hostage.|$|E

500|$|Blocks O–R of the {{development}} make up Brighton station car park. This has two decks, a ground area of [...] and 600 spaces, of which 26 are for disabled drivers. A pick-up and <b>drop-off</b> <b>point</b> with motorcycle parking and a turning circle is situated between the car park and the side entrance to the station. This was {{the first part of}} the New England Quarter to be completed; most of the work was undertaken by the Adenstar Construction Group, based in nearby Portslade. There was a contractual obligation to provide 600 spaces, although the form which this had to take was not specified and various proposals were considered, including a taller multi-storey structure with more floors and a much smaller ground area. During the construction works, a temporary car park was provided on land nearby.|$|E

40|$|Carpooling is an {{appropriate}} solution to address traffic congestion and to reduce the ecological footprint of the car use. In this paper, we address an essential problem for providing dynamic carpooling: how to compute the shortest driver 2 ̆ 7 s and passenger 2 ̆ 7 s paths. Indeed, those two paths are synchronized {{in the sense that}} they have a common subpath between two points: the location where the passenger is picked up and the one where he is dropped off the car. The passenger path may include time-dependent public transportation parts before or after the common subpath. This defines the 2 Synchronization Points Shortest Path Problem (2 SPSPP). We show that the 2 SPSPP has a polynomial worst-case complexity. However, despite this polynomial complexity, one needs efficient algorithms to solve it in realistic transportation networks. We focus on efficient computation of optimal itineraries for solving the 2 SPSPP, i. e. determining the (optimal) pick-up and <b>drop-off</b> <b>points</b> and the two synchronized paths that minimize the total traveling time. We also define restriction areas for reasonable pick-up and <b>drop-off</b> <b>points</b> and use them to guide the algorithms using heuristics based on landmarks. Experiments are conducted on real transportation networks. The results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the interest of restriction areas for pick-up or <b>drop-off</b> <b>points</b> in terms of CPU time, in addition to its application interest...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the separate}} collection systems used in Spanish towns with between 5000 and 50, 000 inhabitants. The study {{looks at the}} systems and their efficiency {{by means of the}} indicators fractioning rate, quality in container rate and separation rate. The results obtained are compared with those from a similar study conducted earlier that was applied to towns and cities with populations over 50, 000. It can be concluded that the most widely implemented system in Spain involves the collection of mixed waste from kerbside bins and picking up paper/cardboard, glass and lightweight packaging from <b>drop-off</b> <b>points.</b> Findings show that the best system is the one that collects mixed waste, organic material and multiproduct waste door-to-door, and glass from <b>drop-off</b> <b>points.</b> The indicator separation rate made it possible to establish beta regression models to analyse the influence of the following logistic variables: inhabitants per point (people/pt), time (years) and frequency of collection (freq).
