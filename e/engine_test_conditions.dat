40|$|Abstract: Automotive engines need {{strategies}} to satisfy with the emission regulations {{in terms of}} PM and NOx. HC-LNT (Hydrocarbon-Lean NOx Trap) with secondary injection system is considered as more practical technology in order to cope with emission regulations. The HC-LNT system, which is using diesel fuel itself as a reducing agent, absorbs NOx in lean exhaust gas condition and releases NOx in rich exhaust gas conditions. In this system, inappropriate amounts of reducing agent will slip through the LNT without the profits of conversion and cause additional emission problems. Therefore, the suitable amount of reducing agent should be supplied into the catalytic converter. In this research, engine emission test was conducted to optimize injection quantity at the various <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Different exhaust layouts and catalyst shapes have been studied and extension unit which makes better uniformity of exhaust gas was used for HC-LNT system. From this results, the effect of secondary injection conditions on NOx conversion characteristics of HC-LNT was clarified...|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} and decomposable fuel {{which is}} derived from edible and non-edible oils. It has different properties compared to conventional diesel but can be used directly in diesel engines. Different fuel properties characterise different combustion-phasing parameters such as cyclic variations of Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and maximum pressure (Pmax). In this study, cyclic variations of combustion parameters such as IMEP and Pmax were investigated using a multi-cylinder diesel engine operating with conventional diesel and palm biodiesel.

40|$|The self {{diagnostic}} accelerometer (SDA) {{developed by the}} NASA Glenn Research Center was tested {{for the first time}} in an aircraft engine environment as part of the Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) program. The VIPR program includes testing multiple critical flight sensor technologies. One such sensor, the accelerometer, measures vibrations to detect faults in the engine. In order to rely upon the accelerometer, the health of the accelerometer must be ensured. Sensor system malfunction is a significant contributor to propulsion in flight shutdowns (IFSD) which can lead to aircraft accidents when the issue is compounded with an inappropriate crew response. The development of the SDA is important for both reducing the IFSD rate, and hence reducing the rate at which this component failure type can put an aircraft in jeopardy, and also as a critical enabling technology for future automated malfunction diagnostic systems. The SDA is a sensor system designed to actively determine the accelerometer structural health and attachment condition, in addition to making vibration measurements. The SDA uses a signal conditioning unit that sends an electrical chirp to the accelerometer and recognizes changes in the response due to changes in the accelerometer health and attachment condition. In an effort toward demonstrating the SDAs flight worthiness and robustness, multiple SDAs were mounted and tested on a C- 17 aircraft engine. The <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> varied from engine off, to idle, to maximum power. The two SDA attachment conditions used were fully tight and loose. The newly developed SDA health algorithm described herein uses cross correlation pattern recognition to discriminate a healthy from a faulty SDA.

40|$|Efforts {{have been}} made {{previously}} by researchers to quantify the auto-ignition quality of fuels by calculating global activation energy using Arrhenius plots with data measured for the ignition delay period (ID). Large variation in the activation energy of fuels has been observed even for fuels with closer CN values. More recently, the activation energy values obtained by Kook et al in (2005) on an optical engine {{do not agree with}} data obtained in an identical metallic engine by Jayakumar using fuels of same CN. The disparity in their results {{can be attributed to the}} differences in ignition delay (ID) and effective temperature definitions used. Most researchers agree upon the start of ID time as the start of injection (SOI). The main point of disagreement has been in defining the end of ID period which is considered to be the start of combustion (SOC). As a result, numerous definitions for the ID period have been used by researchers which lead to variation in calculation of activation energy value. In addition, in heterogeneous combustion equipment to account for changes in charge temperature due to fuel evaporation and piston movement (in engines) an effective temperature value is used. Different definitions for the effective temperature have been reported in the literature. This leads to more variations in the activation energy value calculation. Furthermore, it was observed that <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> and the temperature regime in which the tests are done would also affect the calculation of activation energy value. This dissertation examines the effects of ignition delay definitions, effective temperatures, engine conditions and temperature regimes on the global activation energy. Moreover, homogeneous charge test data has shown presence of a NTC regime in which the activation energy value can be either positive, negative or zero. However, heterogeneous test data from literature has always shown positive values for activation energy. This dissertation has also explained the reasons behind such a behavior...|$|E

40|$|Testing {{was carried}} out on a Cummins N 14 single-cylinder {{heavy-duty}} D. I. diesel research engine with a full dilution tunnel system to quantify lubricating oil consumption (LOC) rates and determine any effects of changes in LOC rates on the particulate matter.

The three steady-state <b>engine</b> operating <b>conditions</b> <b>tested</b> were mode 4 (1200 RPM, 25 % load), mode 5 (1200 RPM, 100 % load), and mode 1 (1800 RPM, 100 % load).

The alterations consisted of installing an oil control ring with a unit pressure 50 % less than the standard value, removing the intake valve stem seals (VSS), removing the exhaust VSS, and removing all (intake and exhaust) VSS. Each of these alterations was tested individually to avoid causing interacting effects. LOC rates were successfully quantified by measuring the calcium concentration in the exhaust particulates.

The initial investigations were performed by analysis of data from top ring zone <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> datasets. Principal component analysis (peA) was used to explore the ring zone data. The difference in the performance of various lubricant formulations sampled from the ring zone region of operating Petter AA-I diesel and Petter W- 1 petrol engines was established by the partial least squares discriminant model (PLS-DA). The results from the study of the <b>test</b> <b>engine</b> data provided optimised insight into the break down of the chemical/physical parameters of the lubricants during operative conditions. This work proceeded onto condition monitoring techniques. Over a hundred used oil samples were obtained from the sump of various petrol and diesel engine vehicles, in addition fresh oil samples were also collected. Series sets of used oil samples were acquired by periodic sampling from a Honda 1. 8 L petrol engine, a Peugeot 1. 9 L diesel engine and a diesel <b>engine</b> sump <b>test.</b> Following sample acquisition, each oil sample was analysed using FTIRIATR and conductimetric titrations were performed. These analytical equipments are used to monitor and assess the extent of degradation. A novel model was developed to enhance the IP 400 conductimetric titration method of measuring base number of new and used lubricants. This nonlinear least-squares model was integrated into the titration programme along with two linear least-squares curve fitting methods. The models were effectively used to estimate the titration endpoint which was subsequently used in base number calculation. The results demonstrated the robustness of the three endpoint estimation methods and indicate reliability of the titration equipment and programme. peA was used to analyse the FTIR spectra data of the oil samples. peA performed on different sets of pre-processed data uncovered objective information on the condition of the lubricants. peA models of the series set oil samples highlighted difference between samples as a result of progressive degradation.
