40|$|Abstract: Although it is {{commonly}} admitted that forest reduces annual runoff, {{the amount of the}} reduction may vary considerably {{as a function of the}} soil and climatic conditions. Forest enhances evaporation through two main processes: 1) Deeper root systems use the water stored in soil more efficiently during the summer period. As a result, more water is retained in the soil during the following autumn before the resumption of winter discharge, and annual runoff is reduced. 2) <b>Loss</b> by <b>interception</b> is greater in forested areas than for other types of vegetation cover during the winter months, mainly because of more efficient use of advective energy. Studies in small catchments on Mount Lozère (South of France) have shown that during the winter period, "actual " evapotranspiration (calculated by the water balance method) is higher than "potential " evapotranspiration (estimated using a standard equation). These differences are due to <b>interception</b> <b>losses.</b> During the study period, one small spruce-forested catchment was cut and replanted, while another grassland/heath catchment was left undisturbed. <b>Interception</b> <b>losses</b> for the two basins were compared.

Studies in these systems have shown important contributions of cloud/fog water to the hydrological balance. To evaluate the importance of cloud/fog water to montane forests of the western slope of the Cordillera Yanachaga in the eastern Andes of central Peru, we monitored bulk precipitation (gross rainfall), cloud water and net precipitation weekly over one year at two elevations, 2468 and 2815 masl. Bulk precipitation was greater at the upper site (2753 mm) than at the lower site (2222 mm). Annual net precipitation was 92. 4 % and 70. 4 % of rainfall at {{the upper and lower}} sites, respectively. Net precipitation was primarily composed of throughfall; stemflow was negligible, contributing less than 0. 2 % of annual rainfall at both sites.

40|$|Evaporation of {{rainfall}} intercepted by tree canopies is usually {{an important part}} of the overall water balance of forested catchments and there have been many studies dedicated to measuring and modelling rainfall <b>interception</b> <b>loss.</b> These studies have mainly been conducted in dense forests; there have been few studies on the very sparse forests which are common in dry and semi-arid areas. Water resources are scarce in these areas making sparse forests particularly important. Methods for modelling <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> are thus required to support sustainable water management in those areas. In very sparse forests, trees occur as widely spaced individuals rather than as a continuous forest canopy. We therefore suggest that <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> for this vegetation type can be more adequately modelled if the overall forest evaporation is derived by scaling up the evaporation from individual trees. The evaporation rate for a single tree can be estimated using a simple Dalton-type diffusion equation for water vapour as long as its surface temperature is known. From theory, this temperature is shown to be dependent upon the available energy and windspeed. However, the surface temperature of a fully saturated tree crown, under rainy conditions, should approach the wet bulb temperature as the radiative energy input to the tree reduces to zero. This was experimentally confirmed from measurements of the radiation balance and surface temperature of an isolated tree crown. Thus, evaporation of intercepted rainfall can be estimated using an equation which only requires knowledge of the air dry and wet bulb temperatures and of the bulk tree-crown aerodynamic conductance. This was taken as the basis of a new approach for modelling <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> from savanna-type woodland, i. e. by combining the Dalton-type equation with the Gash’s analytical model to estimate <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> from isolated trees. This modelling approach was tested using data from two Mediterranean savanna-type oak woodlands in southern Portugal. For both sites, simulated <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> agreed well with the observations indicating the adequacy of this new methodology for modelling <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> by isolated trees in savanna-type ecosystems.

The canopy water storage capacity for the wet season {{was estimated to be}} 1. 86 mm, about twice that for the dry season (0. 91 mm), likely due to the large reduction in the leaf area index (LAI) from 4. 63 to 2. 23 (m 2 ·m− 2). Changes in seasonal canopy structure and micro-meteorological conditions resulted in temporal variations in the amount of interception components, and rainfall partitioning into stemflow and throughfall. Wet canopy evaporation after rainfall contributed 41. 8 % of the wet season <b>interception</b> <b>loss,</b> but only 17. 1 % of the dry season <b>interception</b> <b>loss.</b> Wet canopy evaporation during rainfall accounted for 82. 9 % of the dry season <b>interception</b> <b>loss,</b> but only 58. 2 % of the wet season <b>interception</b> <b>loss.</b> Throughfall accounted for over 79. 7 % of the dry season precipitation and 76. 1 % of the wet season precipitation, possibly due to the change in gap fraction from 64. 2 % in the dry season to 50. 0 % in the wet season. The reduced canopy cover in the dry season also produced less stemflow than that of the wet season. The rainfall stemflow ratio (P s f / P g) was reduced from 12. 6 % to 8. 9 %.

We {{need to know how}} net precipitation varies in ecosystems because natural systems are driven by non-linear ecohydrological processes where mean values cannot capture localized effects or the cumulative consequences associated with an extremely heterogeneous input. In this thesis, we present two studies that investigate the heterogeneity of <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> and throughfall in a forested catchment in the western Cascades range of Oregon. In one study, we examined the spatio-temporal patterns among point measurements of throughfall depth and isotopic composition to determine the cause of isotopic differences between throughfall and rainfall. Our results indicated that the residual moisture retained on the canopy from previous events {{plays a major role in}} determining the isotopic composition of the next event's throughfall. Differences between the isotopic composition of throughfall samples could indicate further partitioning of throughfall into various flow-paths from the canopy.

Before these plantations become widespread, it is crucial to determine what effects ponderosa pine plantations may have on scarce water resources in the region. In the first study, I examined the seasonal variation in transpiration and soil water depletion for four forest stands: high and low density ponderosa pine plantations, and high and low density cordilleran cypress stands. Measurements were taken during two growing seasons with contrasting amounts of precipitation. Transpiration was greater in ponderosa pine than in cordilleran cypress stands of similar density. The high density ponderosa pine plot used a greater amount of water from deeper soil layers compared to all the other plots. In the second study, I conducted measurements of above- and below-canopy rainfall, and water storage capacity of branches to estimate the proportion of water that it is intercepted by the canopy and evaporates back into the atmosphere without reaching the soil. A simple analytical model was used to estimate annual <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> by the four forest stands. Cordilleran cypress stands showed much larger <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> than ponderosa pine stands of similar density.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{description}} of rainfall partitioning by a vegetation canopy that changes in time a number of adaptations to the revised analytical model for rainfall interception by sparse canopies [J. Hydrol., 170 (1995) 79] was proposed {{in the first of}} two papers. The current paper presents an application of this adapted analytical model to simulate throughfall, stemflow and interception as measured in a mixed agricultural cropping system involving cassava, maize and rice during two seasons of growth and serial harvesting in upland West Java, Indonesia. Measured <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> were 18 and 8 % during the two measuring periods, while stemflow fractions were estimated at 2 and 4 %, respectively. The main reasons for these discrepancies were differences in vegetation density and composition, as well as differences in the exposure of the two sites used in the two respective years. Functions describing the development of the leaf area index of each of the component crops in time were developed. Leaf area index (ranging between 0. 7 and 3. 8) was related to canopy cover fraction (0. 41 - 0. 94). Using average values and time series of the respective parameters, <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> were modelled using both the revised analytical model and the presently adapted version. The results indicate that the proposed model adaptations substantially improve the performance of the analytical model and provide a more solid base for parameterisation of the analytical model in vegetation of variable density. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Since the 19 th century, 41 % of {{the land}} on ChiloeÂ´ Island (418500 S, 738400 W) in Chile was cleared. Following {{clearing}} and burning, much of the converted land remains in sparse shrub cover. We hypothesized that the arrested conversion back to forests may reflect a nearly permanent condition associated with {{a rise in the}} water table. To evaluate this possibility we acquired data from a 60 -year old evergreen forest and an area in shrub cover to parameterize two hydrologic models; one that accounts for hourly <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> and predicts net precipitation (Gash model), the other that calculates hourly transpiration from both overstory and understory components as well as evaporation from the soil (a modified Penmanâ€“Monteith model). In addition, standpipes were installed to record water table levels over 18 months. The fraction of a total annual precipitation (# 2; 2100 mm) transpired by shrub and forest cover differed (8 % versus 22 %) roughly in proportion to differences in the leaf area index (2. 2 versus 5. 0). Although whole canopy (stomatal) conductances were similar, the aerodynamic conductance was more than three-fold higher for forests compared with shrub cover (# 2; 12 mol m# 3; 2 s# 3; 1 versus 3 mol m# 3; 2 s# 3; 1). The frequent wetting of tree canopies, combined with an average wind speed of 0. 74 m s# 3; 1, resulted in # 2; 30 % <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> from forests compared with 1 % of annual precipitation lost through this pathway from shrub cover. As a result of these differences, only about half of the precipitation enters the ground under forest cover compared to 90 % under shrub cover. This difference in canopy <b>interception</b> <b>losses</b> accounts for a rise in the water table from an average of 45 â€“ 10 cm. The high water table prevents normal tree regeneration. This condition is stable unless an effort is made to provide an elevated substrate for tree seedlings to become established.

40|$|Rainfall and cloud water {{interception}} (CWI) {{were determined}} for a mature and a 19 -year old secondary lower montane cloud forest in central Veracruz, Mexico. Cloud water {{was measured using}} a passive fog gauge, and consisted most likely of a mixture of fog and wind-driven drizzle. CWI by the canopy {{was derived from the}} wet canopy water budget as throughfall + stemflow + calculated <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> minus rainfall. Rainfall <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> was calculated using the Liu model, parameterized for events with rain-only. Precipitation events with cloud water input occurred exclusively during the dry season (November-April), and were primarily associated with cold fronts. CWI was estimated at 6 % of dry season rainfall (640 mm on average) for the secondary forest vs. 8 % for the mature forest, whereas annual values were ≤ 2 % of total rainfall (3180 mm). Infrequent fog occurrence and low wind speeds were the most important reasons for the observed low values of CWI. Total apparent <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> (i. e. including CWI) was 17 % of annual rainfall for the mature forest and 8 % for the secondary forest. Post-event evaporation of intercepted water stored in the canopy rather than within-event evaporation dominated <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> at both forests. Hence, the higher loss observed for the mature forest is considered to reflect a higher canopy storage capacity, related in turn to a higher Leaf Area Index and larger epiphyte biomass. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The Penman–Monteith {{equation}} {{has been}} widely used to estimate the maximum evaporation rate (E) from wet/saturated forest canopies, regardless of canopy cover fraction. Forests are then represented as a big leaf and <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> considered essentially as a one-dimensional process. With increasing forest sparseness the assumptions behind this big leaf approach become questionable. In sparse forests {{it might be better}} to model E and <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> at the tree level assuming that the individual tree crowns behave as wet bulbs (‘‘wet bulb approach”). In this study, and for five different forest types and climate conditions, <b>interception</b> <b>loss</b> measurements were compared to modelled values (Gash’s interception model) based on estimates of E by the Penman–Monteith and the wet bulb approaches. Results show that the wet bulb approach is a good, and less data demanding, alternative to estimate E when the forest canopy is fully ventilated (very sparse forests with a narrow canopy depth). When the canopy is not fully ventilated, the wet bulb approach requires a reduction of leaf area index to the upper, more ventilated parts of the canopy, needing data on the vertical leaf area distribution, which is seldom-available. In such cases, the Penman–Monteith approach seems preferable. Our data also show that canopy cover does not per se allow us to identify if a forest canopy is fully ventilated or not. New methodologies of sensitivity analyses applied to Gash’s model showed that a correct estimate of E is critical for the proper modelling of <b>interception</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E
