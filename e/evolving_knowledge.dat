With this [...] "knowledge intensive work" [...] at the forefront of most organizations, the efficient transmission of this knowledge and information now becomes a major priority to be carried out in the workplace. The introduction of the Internet in the workplace allowed employees to transmit information electronically not only to others in their own office but those in other countries as well. Technology began to facilitate the rapid exchange of information for these organizations and thus contributed to a structural change in how they operate. These changes prompted researchers to delve deeper into the issues surrounding organizational technoethics in how technology was shaping the workplace, whether positively or negatively, and the ethical issues that may arise.The use of ICTs within organizations have given way to a new kind of office setting where physically being in the office is not mandatory to get the job done. This recent trend coined by many as the virtual workplace involves several workplaces that are connected through technology and are not hindered by physical restraints. Telecommuting, the hot desk, and virtual teams are the three major types of virtual workplaces that have been made possible through the use of technology and have changed the way many organizations communicate and transmit information.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Logic Programming Update Languages were {{proposed}} {{as an extension}} of logic programming that allows modeling the dynamics of knowledge bases where both extensional (facts) and intentional knowledge (rules) may change over time due to updates. Despite their generality, these languages do not provide a means to directly access past states of the <b>evolving</b> <b>knowledge.</b> They are limited to so-called Markovian change, i. e. changes entirely determined by the current state. We remedy this limitation by extending the Logic Programming Update Language EVOLP with LTL-like temporal operators that allow referring to the history of the <b>evolving</b> <b>knowledge</b> base, and show how this can be implemented in a Logic Programming framework. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, several {{approaches}} to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended logic programs (ELPs) have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate (sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. In this paper, we introduce {{a framework for}} reasoning about <b>evolving</b> <b>knowledge</b> bases, which are represented as ELPs and maintained by an update policy. We describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and define a logical language for expressing properties of <b>evolving</b> <b>knowledge</b> bases. We further investigate the semantical properties of knowledge states with respect to reasoning. In particular, we describe finitary characterizations of the evolution, and derive complexity results for our framework. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- We apply XCS with {{computed}} prediction (XCSF) {{to tackle}} multistep reinforcement learning problems involving continuous inputs. In essence we use XCSF {{as a method}} of generalized reinforcement learning. We show that in domains involving continuous inputs and delayed rewards XCSF can evolve compact populations of accurate maximally general classifiers which represent the optimal solution to the target problem. We compare the performance of XCSF with that of tabular Q-learning adapted to the continuous domains considered here. The results we present show that XCSF can converge much faster than tabular techniques while producing more compact solutions. Our results also suggest that when exploration is less effective in some areas of the problem space, XCSF can exploit effective generalizations to extend the <b>evolved</b> <b>knowledge</b> beyond the frequently explored areas. In contrast, in the same situations, the convergence speed of tabular Q-learning worsens. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Evolving</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Ecosystems were {{proposed}} {{recently to}} approach the Big Data challenge, following the hypothesis that knowledge evolves in a way similar to biological systems. Therefore, the inner working of the knowledge ecosystem can be spotted from natural evolution. An <b>evolving</b> <b>knowledge</b> ecosystem consists of Knowledge Organisms, which form {{a representation of the}} knowledge, and the environment in which they reside. The environment consists of contexts, which are composed of so-called knowledge tokens. These tokens are ontological fragments extracted from information tokens, in turn, which originate from the streams of information flowing into the ecosystem. In this article we investigate the use of LSH Forest (a self-tuning indexing schema based on locality-sensitive hashing) for solving the problem of placing new knowledge tokens in the right contexts of the environment. We argue and show experimentally that LSH Forest possesses required properties and could be used for large distributed set-ups...|$|E
