50|$|A {{drying tube}} or <b>guard</b> <b>tube</b> is a tube-like piece of {{apparatus}} used to house a disposable solid desiccant, wherein {{at one end}} the tube-like structure terminates in a ground glass joint for use in connecting the drying tube to a reaction vessel, {{for the purpose of}} keeping the vessel free of moisture.|$|E
5000|$|Both these {{techniques}} require rather expensive equipment {{and can be}} time consuming. Where air-free requirements are not stringent, other techniques can be used. For example, using a sacrificial excess of a reagent that reacts with water/oxygen can be used. The sacrificial excess in effect [...] "dries" [...] the reaction by reacting with the water (e.g. in the solvent). However, this method is only suitable where the impurities produced in this reaction are not in turn detrimental to the desired product of the reaction or can be easily removed. Typically, reactions using such a sacrificial excess are only effective when doing reactions on a reasonably large scale such that this by-reaction is negligible compared to the desired product reaction. For example, when preparing Grignard reagents, magnesium (the cheapest reagent) is often used in excess, which reacts to remove trace water, either by reacting directly with water to give magnesium hydroxide or via the in situ formation of the Grignard reagent which in turn reacts with water (e.g. R-Mg-X + H2O → HO-Mg-X + R-H). To maintain the resultant [...] "dry" [...] environment it is usually sufficient to connect a <b>guard</b> <b>tube</b> filled with calcium chloride to the reflux condenser to slow moisture re-entering the reaction over time, or connect an inert gas line.|$|E
30|$|To a {{solution}} of 5 A- 5 P (0.01  mol) in ethanol, β-D-ribofuranose- 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetra-o-acetate (0.01  mol) was added {{in the presence of}} TsOH and the content were refluxed under vacuum with stirring at 155 °C to 160 °C for 15 to 30  min. The vacuum was removed, and the reaction mixture was protected from moisture by fitting a <b>guard</b> <b>tube.</b> Stirring was further continued for 10  h and vacuum was applied for 10  min. at every hour. The viscous mass thus obtained was dissolved in sodium-containing methanol and boiled for 10  min then left for stirring overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The viscous residue, thus obtained was dissolved in ether, filtered, concentrated, and kept in refrigerator overnight to get crystalline product.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve <b>tubes,</b> <b>guard</b> cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|R
25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper <b>guards,</b> bumper <b>tubes,</b> and a locking gas cap, among others.

2500|$|Continuing {{the concept}} of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only {{available}} as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL. Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of the Lanz system on air sealing by self-inflation in high volume-low pressure (HVLP) tube cuffs. Methods: In vitro tracheal air sealing was studied in HVLP tracheal tube cuffs (internal diameter [ID] 8. 0 mm) made from polyurethane ([PU] Seal <b>Guard</b> tracheal <b>tube,</b> Covidien, Athlone, Ireland) and from polyvinylchloride ([PVC] HiLo tracheal tube, Covidien) with and without Lanz pressure regulating valve. Tube cuffs were placed in a vertical 22 mm ID artificial trachea and inflated to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 cm H(2) O cuff pressures. Pressure control ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) of 20 or 25 cm H(2) O was applied and air leakage was assessed spirometrically as the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory tidal volumes. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the air leakage with and without Lanz system for both cuff types at each cuff pressure and PIP (P <. 05). Results: The PVC tube cuffs with Lanz system resulted in significant air leakage at both 20 and 25 cm H(2) O PIP as compared to those without the Lanz system, especially at cuff pressures lower than the preset PIP (P <. 05). Although PU tube cuffs with Lanz system showed reduced air sealing when compared with cuffs without Lanz, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Cuff pressure compensation with the Lanz system during cyclic respiratory pressure changes interferes with the self-sealing mechanism in HVLP tube cuffs at cuff pressures lower than PIP level. This results in larger air leak across tube cuffs particularly in tube cuffs made from PVC...|$|R
40|$|The NET protein {{superfamily}} is {{a recently}} discovered family of novel, plant-specific actin binding proteins. The identification {{of this family}} represents a significant discovery as the plant cytoskeleton is not identical to the animal cytoskeleton and plant cells show plant specific processes and subcellular structures which rely on actin. There {{is a need for}} plant specific proteins which are capable of modelling actin within plant cells. The NET family comprises thirteen proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, which share the NET actin binding domain (found at the N-terminal end of each protein). Based on the C-terminal domains of the proteins, the family can be separated into four groups, each with a particular localisation. The localisations of these proteins are frequently within plant specific cell types, such as pollen <b>tubes,</b> <b>guard</b> cells or roots, or to plant specific cell structures such as plasmodesmata. It is thought that these proteins may be involved in modelling the actin cytoskeleton at junctions between actin and membranes (either cell membranes or membrane bound structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum). The NET 1 proteins are a group of four proteins, each consisting of an N-terminal actin binding domain and C-terminal coiled-coil domains. NET 1 a was the first protein to be discovered in a high-throughput screen of plant proteins for novel localisations carried out by Karl Oparka, where it was shown to bind to filaments. Work by Calcutt (Calcutt 2009) showed the filaments to be the actin cytoskeleton. The aim of this thesis has been to complete the characterisation of all Group 1 NET proteins, building on the analysis of NET 1 a by Calcutt (Calcutt 2009) and to investigate the possible functions of the NET 1 subfamily proteins. All four proteins {{have been shown to be}} capable of actin binding and to be expressed in, and locate to structures within, the roots of A. thaliana. NET 1 a has been linked to plasmodesmata, and the combined absence of NET 1 a and NET 1 b in the plant results in a cumulative, long root phenotype. Theories to explain this phenotype are suggested here, although the validation and testing of these will form the basis of future work. ...|$|R
