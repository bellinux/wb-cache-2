40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanics}} of a paradigmatic typical carton corner with five creases is analyzed theoretically, in closed form. A general kinematical {{analysis of the}} mechanism (in finite rotation) is presented, assuming the versor of the intermediate crease, s, as a 2 -degree-of-freedom Lagrangian parameter. The rotation θc of the cth crease is derived, together with the existence domain and {{a discussion of the}} singular configurations. The actions, driving the carton during a prescribed quasi-static <b>erection</b> <b>program,</b> are derived in a very efficient manner using the Virtual Works Equation, taking into account a non-linear anholonomic bending constitutive law of the creased paperboard. In particular, the active and reactive components of the moment ϕ, driving s along its path, are identified. No resort to the tangent stiffness computation is required. Some numerical examples illustrate the rotation and the driving forces obtained for both monotone-loading and complex loading–unloading erection paths. The presented results, “exact” within the scope of the restrictive hypotheses assumed, may be used in a preliminary design approach as well as a benchmark for more realistic FEM or CAE simulators...|$|E
40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) following {{treatment for}} clinically localized prostate cancer, particularly radical prostatectomy (RP), {{is a major}} quality of life issue that remains unsatisfactorily addressed. With the introduction and use of cavernous nerve–sparing procedures over the past 25 years, many men recover erections postoperatively that enable sexual intercourse unlike in the prior surgical era, when permanent ED postoperatively was certain. Despite this advance, 26 – 100 % of these patients may never recover normal erectile function (EF). Recent advances {{in the understanding of}} ED after RP have stimulated great attention to develop penile rehabilitation programs and neuromodulation. The purpose of penile rehabilitation is to prevent adverse corpus cavernosal tissue structural alterations and thereby maximize the chances of recovering functional <b>erections.</b> Rehabilitation <b>programs</b> are common in clinical practice, but there is no definitive evidence to support their efficacy. Neuromodulation represents another strategy for promoting erection recovery postoperatively. This therapy involves the application of neuroprotective interventions, conceivably targeting biological elements involved in the erection response that are affected by neuropathic injury. Well-conducted, controlled trials with adequate follow-up are required {{in order to determine the}} erection preservative benefits of these therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this essay is to describe the mechanisms related to post-RP ED, assess the need for penile rehabilitation and neuromodulation following surgery, and analyze the basic science and clinical trial evidence associated with these applications for preserving EF following prostate cancer treatment...|$|R
