25|$|On May 12, 2011, ClearCorrect filed a countersuit against Align Technology, denying {{allegations}} {{that it is}} infringing on Align patents. In the countersuit, ClearCorrect alleged that Align's allegations are invalid and accused Align of patent misuse and <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b> The countersuit cited much of the evidence raised in Align's previous patent case against Ormco, {{which resulted in a}} federal court ruling that 11 of Align's patent claims were invalid.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court has {{indicated}} {{that there are two}} branches of <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b> The first branch of <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> ("same invention" [...] or [...] "novelty-type" [...] <b>double</b> <b>patenting)</b> requires that claims of two issued patents must not be identical or conterminous. The second branch of <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> (termed [...] "obviousness-type" [...] <b>double</b> <b>patenting)</b> requires that claims of two issued patents be [...] "patentably distinct" [...] (non-obvious) in view of one another. Even applications that expire on the same day may be open to <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> challenges, as the courts have viewed possession of two patents for one invention to constitute an undue benefit.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian patent system prohibits <b>double</b> <b>patenting,</b> {{acquiring}} two patents for {{the same}} invention. In order to determine whether an inventor has secured a double patent, courts compare {{the claims of the}} patents, searching for identical or conterminous claims. This process is known as “same invention” <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b> Another type of <b>double</b> <b>patenting,</b> known as “obviousness” <b>double</b> <b>patenting,</b> had not yet been adequately explained in court.|$|E
50|$|Ramsey Mill has a {{cast iron}} windshaft and four <b>double</b> <b>Patent</b> sails.|$|R
50|$|As built, John Webb’s Mill had {{a wooden}} windshaft some 18 in {{longer than the}} present one, {{carrying}} four Common sails. It drove two pairs of millstones, the third pair being added at a later date. In 1890, the mill was carrying four <b>double</b> <b>Patent</b> sails and by the early 1900s was working on two <b>double</b> <b>Patent</b> sails and two single Patent sails.|$|R
50|$|Goldfield Mill is a four-storey tower mill. It had a pepperpot cap winded by a fantail. There {{were four}} <b>Double</b> <b>Patent</b> sails. The upright shaft and cast iron great spur wheel survive.|$|R
50|$|Technically, <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> {{can only}} exist between issued patents. However, <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> {{objections}} may {{be raised by}} an examiner during an application's pendency. The position of the Patent Office is that such objections are raised as a courtesy; examiners are {{under no obligation to}} identify <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> situations during prosecution. Canadian practice differs significantly from U.S. practice on this front, in that, once a <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> objection is encountered, there is no statutory provision for terminal disclaimer in the Canadian Patent Act. Thus, terminal disclaimer is not available to overcome <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> objections. Instead, the applicant must demonstrate (by arguing or amending the claims) that the claims are patentably distinct in view of those of the co-pending application.|$|E
5000|$|The United States has {{two types}} of <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> rejections. One is the ‘same invention’ type <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> rejection, based on 35 U.S.C. sec. 101, which states in the {{singular}} that an inventor [...] "...may obtain a patent." [...] The second rejection type precludes what {{is referred to as}} [...] "obviousness type" [...] <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b> The [...] "nonstatutory-type" [...] <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy and primarily is intended to prevent prolonging the patent term, by prohibiting claims in a second patent that are obvious variations on claims in an earlier patent. This type of <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> rejection only requires a single common inventor, and does not require common ownership. The terminology [...] "not patentably distinct" [...] or [...] "distinguished" [...] from the earlier claims is often used to describe [...] "obviousness type" [...] <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b>|$|E

50|$|Divisional {{applications}} filed voluntarily may be {{susceptible to}} {{attacks on the}} grounds of <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b> However, where a divisional is forced by the Patent Office during prosecution (i.e. to overcome a unity of invention objection), the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that such an application and its parent should not be open to <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> challenges.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>patenting</b> is the {{granting}} of two patents for a single invention, to the same proprietor {{and in the same}} country or countries. According to the European Patent Office, it is an accepted principle in most patent systems that two patents cannot be granted to the same applicant for one invention. However, the threshold for <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|In case T 307/03, which {{related to}} a pending divisional {{application}} of a granted European patent, three requests were pending. In the main request, the subject-matter of claim 1 corresponded exactly to the subject-matter of claim 3 when dependent on claim 1 of the granted European patent (that is, the patent granted on the parent application). The claim was therefore objected for <b>double</b> <b>patenting</b> and the main request was not allowed into the proceedings. The first auxiliary request was not allowed into the proceedings for essentially the same reasons. Finally, in the second auxiliary request, the subject-matter of the main claim encompassed by the subject-matter of claim 3 of the parent application as granted. This request was also not allowed into the proceedings on the ground of <b>double</b> <b>patenting.</b> The divisional application was therefore refused.|$|E
