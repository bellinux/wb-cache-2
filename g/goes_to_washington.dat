5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Wes Archer, {{and it was the}} first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images. Cagney {{played a}} series of patriots, and his gangster in Angels with Dirty Faces (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is {{executed}} so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration. Breen in essence neutered Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel Over the White House where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E

After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington.</b> The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E

25|$|So strong was her {{box office}} appeal {{by now that}} she was one of four finalists for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939). The film's producer, David O. Selznick, had briefly romanced Arthur in the late 1920s when they both were with Paramount Pictures. Arthur re-united with {{director}} Frank Capra and Stewart for Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> (1939), with Arthur cast once again as a working woman, this time one who teaches the naive Mr. Smith the ways of Washington, D.C.|$|E

Not very interested in acting, he quit show business to join the Navy (he appeared in uniform as himself in the Columbia Screen Snaphots short, Hollywood Grows Up), then studied aeronautical engineering at California Polytech. Simms later worked in Pasadena, California {{and around the world}} as an engineer until his retirement. In his last years, Larry Simms lived in Thailand with his wife.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, Philo broadened {{its range}} of {{activities}} as it became a training ground for essayist Randolph Bourne (Class of 1912), poet A. Joyce Kilmer (Class of 1908), and statesman V.K. Wellington Koo (Class of 1909), all prize winners in their time at Philo. In 1910 the society took a decidedly dramatic turn when it commenced a 20-year stretch of annual theatre productions, ranging from Elizabethan comedies to contemporary works. Many of the older productions, {{by the likes of}} Ben Jonson, Nicholas Udall, and Robert Greene, were North American debuts. Oscar-winning screenwriter Sidney Buchman (Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Cleopatra) (Class of 1923) got a start playing Shakespeare's Richard II for a Philo production.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after the failure of Billy Jack <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> Laughlin played small roles in a few films, such as The Big Sleep in 1978 and his last acting role was The Legend of the Lone Ranger in 1981. In 1984, he {{purchased}} a series of twelve advertisements in Variety condemning {{various aspects of the}} film industry and its treatment of independent filmmakers. He created a blueprint for taking control of the home video distribution industry as a way for independent films to be seen. This plan was also a failure. In 1985, he began production of a fifth Billy Jack film, The Return of Billy Jack, which featured the title character fighting child pornographers in New York City. However, he suffered a concussion and neck injury during filming, which led to the production being suspended. During this hiatus, funding for the picture ran out and production was never resumed. In 2009, a few scenes from the unfinished film were released on Laughlin's website. A notable incident occurred while he was filming in New York City, when he broke up a street fight on Manhattan's West Side, threatening to rip a man's arm off. He garnered notoriety at this time for making a citizen's arrest of a man after an argument over Laughlin's driving.|$|E

500|$|The {{title and}} {{plot of the}} episode is a parody of the 1939 film Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> in which the {{character}} Jefferson Smith comes to Washington with patriotic enthusiasm, but is shocked to see evidence of corruption in the government. The Tampa Tribunes Curtis Ross called this reference {{one of the best}} film references in The Simpsons history. Lisa's visit to the Lincoln Memorial is a direct reference to Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> in which Smith appeals to Lincoln's statue for inspiration like Lisa did in the episode. In his book Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era, Barry Schwartz writes that the scene with Lisa at the crowded monument shows how [...] "thoroughly Lincoln's moral and emotional significance has waned." [...] Mark Reinhart writes in the book Abraham Lincoln on Screen that the scene sums up [...] "with brilliant wit" [...] the American society's [...] "annoying and ultimately useless tendency to ask [...] 'What would Lincoln have done?' whenever [...] face a political or social dilemma." [...] Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> was once again referenced on The Simpsons in the season fourteen episode [...] "Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington".|$|E

500|$|... "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] {{was written}} by then-showrunner Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore, airing {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was Scully's first writing credit since he took over as showrunner for the show. In comparison with other episode scripts, the staff writers did not change much of the original writing. The plot revolves around Mel Gibson doing a remake of the 1939 film Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington.</b> Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analysed the episode and wrote in the book The Simpsons in the Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield that [...] "the episode is able to critique the practice of test screening, violence in film, and one of movies' favorite standards – the car chase", calling it [...] "a ridiculous parody of an action-film violence orgy". Staff writer Tom Gammill {{came up with the idea}} for the violent version of Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> and Gibson throwing his Senator badge away at the end of the film, is a reference to the ending of the film Dirty Harry from 1971. The idea for the set piece with electric cars at the beginning of the episode came from Kevin Nealon, who was a friend of former showrunner David Mirkin. One day, he came by and demonstrated his electric car for the writing staff.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the huge}} success of Snow White, Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for Pinocchio, which {{marked the first time}} an {{animated}} film had used celebrities as voice actors.

Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child. He cast 12-year-old child actor Dickie Jones, who had previously been in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith <b>Goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington.</b> He also cast Frankie Darro as Lampwick, Walter Catlett as Foulfellow the Fox, Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy, Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman, and Christian Rub as Geppetto, whose design was even a caricature of Rub.|$|E
