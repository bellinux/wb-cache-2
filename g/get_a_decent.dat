5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on 20 May. However, England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson wanted a four-week break {{before the start of}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, so that if any England players were involved (Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Peter Crouch all later made his squad) would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> rest before the tournament. The final was scheduled to be held at Wembley Stadium, however the stadium had fallen behind in its rebuild and would not be completed in time for the final. The final would instead be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, where it had been held since 2001. Mike Dean was originally appointed to referee the final, but questions about his impartiality were raised as he resided close to Liverpool. He was replaced by Alan Wiley.|$|E
2500|$|The Arab Ba'ath Progressive Party {{was legally}} {{registered}} {{for the first}} time in 1993. The branch is small, and has, according to a Wikileaks document, a [...] "minuscule number of adherents". Despite its small size, the branch is able through its leader, Fuad Dabbour, to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> footprint in Jordanian media. Dabbour's fiery statements on foreign policy are frequently quoted by the press. The party is less known than its pro-Iraqi counterpart, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. It is the party branch of the Syrian-dominated Ba'ath Party in Jordan. Fuad Dabbour is the branch's Regional Secretary. It is believed that the party has fewer than 200 members.|$|E
2500|$|Part of Brooks's {{appeal to}} the readers of The New Yorker, {{accustomed}} to prose {{by the likes of}} John Updike, may have been his singular voice and contrarian nature. Writing about the paucity of women on Wall Street, for instance, Brooks noted the dining policies of the Street's stuffier precincts barred women from dining there, and [...] "even more astonishing... was {{the fact that many of}} the public restaurants in the area did not take advantage of the situation by encouraging women, but rather fell in line with the clubs by banning them.... Without a reservation or a long wait, a woman could scarcely <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> lunch anywhere in the area at any price." ...|$|E

50|$|Sony Pictures Classics has {{a history}} of making {{reasonable}} investments for small films, and <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> return. It {{has a history}} of not overspending.

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{last in the}} 2010 {{contest and}} achieving record low viewing figures for the contest {{it was reported that}} the BBC were looking at different options for the organisation of the 2011 UK entry. In July 2010, it was reported that the BBC were in negotiations with singer-songwriter Mika to pen the United Kingdom entry. The broadcaster reported: [...] "It's always a difficult call trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> song together for Eurovision, as [...] proved. We had Pete Waterman overseeing it [...] but we still came last. Mika has all the right ingredients to make a successful song. We hope he says yes". Interest in competing in the contest was also expressed by 2004 Big Brother winner Nadia Almada and British actress Margi Clarke.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{legislation}} amended ACTAAP {{to conform}} to No Child Left Behind. Later, in 2005, Huckabee stated, [...] "And one thing I salute about [...] is No Child Left Behind, {{and no matter what}} you've heard about it let me tell you it's {{the best thing that ever}} happened in education because it says we're not going to let children spend years and years and let taxpayers spend thousands and thousands of dollars only to find out when the kid graduates high school that he's basically a functional illiterate, that we're not going to leave him lingering back in those classrooms and that he or she will <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> education and we will hold accountable those who are responsible for getting that child a good education." ...|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the inaugural}} Test match at the WACA Ground in Perth {{and the first}} new venue in an Ashes Test since the Brisbane Cricket Ground at Woolloongabba in 1928–29. Western Australia had won the Sheffield Shield in 1947–48 on {{percentages}} {{even though they had}} played fewer games than the eastern states and outright in 1968–69. Test status was granted to the WACA for the 1970–71 Ashes series and although its playing conditions were equal to any in Australia $400,000 was raised to build extra stands and improve the facilities. The state government supplied $100,000 and Perth City Council another $20,000. The remaining $280,000 was raised by public subscription, with [...] Norm O'Neill, Keith Slater and Peter Loader touring the state in aid of the cause. Farmers donated barley, wheat, oats, timber, sheep and cattle to be sold for the fund, one town built and sold a house and the racehorse La Loire made $18,000 in a raffle. 'Pre-Test interest was tremendous. You could not make a move in Perth just prior to the Test without breakfasting, lunching and dining-out on cricket...' On a pitch expected to suit fast bowling the two sides dropped their spinners Terry Jenner and Derek Underwood. The Lancashire fast-medium swing bowler Peter Lever made his Test debut as did Greg Chappell, the young South Australian all-rounder who had been twelfth man at Brisbane. However, this gave Australia only three specialist bowlers; Garth McKenzie, Alan Thomson and John Gleeson and England four; John Snow, Ken Shuttleworth, Peter Lever and Ray Illingworth. Lindsay Hassett commented that [...] "you can scarcely <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> Test attack from the two sides".|$|E
5000|$|De Visser {{has been}} openly {{critical}} {{of what he}} perceives as the manipulation of young players by player agents. He has said, [...] "I want the player to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good contract, and also that the football association and the club where the boy comes from <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> compensation. I would like to {{climb to the top}} of Mount Kilimanjaro and shout across the continent, Boys watch out for shady agents!" ...|$|R

On the other hand, because of his traumatic experience, Joon-seok has <b>a</b> difficult time <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> job even though he graduated from a prestigious university; he works part-time at a convenience store.

6000|$|The {{entrance}} of the new-comers broke the fixity of attention, and called for re-arrangement of seats in the too narrow semicircle round the fire-place and the table holding the glasses, spare pipes and tobacco. This was the soberest of clubs; but sobriety {{is no reason why}} smoking and [...] "taking something" [...] should be less imperiously needed as <b>a</b> means of <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> status in company and debate. Mordecai was received with welcoming voices which had a slight cadence of compassion in them, but naturally all glances passed immediately to his companion.|$|R

5000|$|Skeptics criticized {{them for}} [...] "self-promotion" [...] {{or for the}} amount of money they donated to charity. Some critics {{questioned}} their choice of charity—finding fault with the family for having donated their money to help needy people in Africa rather than in the United States. Not everyone understood the parents' egalitarian approach with their children, or the family's underlying philosophy. Commented one viewer of a television interview: “What kind of ass clown works his tail off, and busts his hump <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> education, only to listen to his kid suggest they give away the house?” ...|$|R

6000|$|Two miles {{were enough}} for the first day. Ken knew it {{and he began to}} wonder why the others, {{especially}} Weir, did not know it.

5000|$|As a result, Digital-Kienzle, {{including}} its PCS subsidiary, {{entered into a}} staff buy-out of the company, in part sponsored {{by some of the}} German states.

As a result, there is not much left to be said or heard about said ERP system.

However, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>decent</b> signal from Springfield (85 mi west of Champaign) was usually hit-or-miss at best. Plains Television had to build a microwave tower in Northwestern Champaign to send the WICS signal to the WCHU studios. With a more reliable signal, the station began a more routine schedule on September 14. It began broadcasting in color the next year.|$|R
