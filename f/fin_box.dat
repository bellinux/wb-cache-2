5000|$|Many {{surfboard}} locks use {{wire rope}} or wire cable {{to make the}} connection from the interface point on the surfboard to the securing object. Some surfboards {{do not have a}} leash plug, or a <b>fin</b> <b>box</b> or both. Therefore based upon the design of the surfboard one or more locking devices may or may not work.|$|E
5000|$|A {{surfboard}} lock is {{a device}} or {{a mechanism for}} securing a surfboard to prevent theft or loss. Typically surfboard locks attach to {{some part of the}} surfboard, such as the leash plug or center <b>fin</b> <b>box</b> slot. Alternately, some locking devices clamp or strap around the surfboard. Once the board is secured, the locking device attaches to some hard point like a vehicle or a non-movable object.|$|E

5000|$|A {{lashing device}} is a rope, wire cable, or strap which wraps around {{the board and}} {{essentially}} ties it up {{with some sort of}} locking device. A simple low cost {{way to do this is}} to wrap chain around the surfboard and secure it with a lock. Board clamping devices are large mechanical pencils that wrap around the board and like the lashing product secure the board by kissing it. Many times these clamping devices can be hard mounted in a truck bed or on the roof of a car to act as a carrying rack. Mechanical attachments to the board hardpoints such as the leash plug and <b>fin</b> <b>box</b> vary widely in their configuration but are generally some sort of attaching mechanism which grabs onto or into the board and then secured with a lock.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_Lock_A_Surfboard.jpg ...|$|E
50|$|Removable Fin Systems The {{most common}} types of fins used today, {{removable}} fins are surfboard fins {{that can be}} unscrewed from the surfboard and be replaced by different fins or be moved about the board for a different setup in maneuverability and stability. In the early 90’s three Australian surfers invented the fin control system (FCS). Since its global release in 1994 FCS has become the industry standard; providing elite athletes and everyday surfers an abundance of fin designs and a platform to change {{the performance of their}} surfboard by changing fins. The system also streamlined the surfboard manufacturing process by making it easier to install fins into boards and repair damaged fins. The leading competitor to FCS fins is Futures fins. Using a single larger <b>fin</b> <b>box,</b> the manufacture claims the fins provide a stronger connection and more closely approximate the feeling of a glass on fin.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy IV OSV {{was well}} received; reviewers have praised {{the quality of}} the {{composition}} despite the limited medium. Soundtrack Central compared it favorably with Uematsu's later works, especially the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI, and termed it a [...] "great CD". However, the length of several tracks {{as well as of the}} album as a whole was criticized, with reviewers finding it [...] "too short" [...] and disapproving of the early fade-out of some tracks. [...] Reviewers found the expanded and remastered version found in the <b>Finest</b> <b>Box</b> to be comparable to {{the quality of the}} original album, with some tracks improving in their remake, becoming [...] "deeper" [...] or [...] "sharper" [...] as was appropriate.|$|R

40|$|The {{empennage}} component {{selected for}} this program is the vertical <b>fin</b> <b>box</b> of the L- 1011 aircraft. The box structure extends from the fuselage production joint to the tip rib and includes {{the front and rear}} spars. Various design options were evaluated to arrive at a configuration which would offer the highest potential for satisfying program objectives. The preferred configuration selected consists of a hat-stiffened cover with molded integrally stiffened spars, aluminum trussed composite ribs, and composite miniwich web ribs with integrally molded caps. Material screening tests were performed to select an advanced composite material system for the Advanced Composite Vertical Fin (ACFV) that would meet the program requirements from the standpoint of quality, reproducibility, and cost. Preliminary weight and cost analysis were made, targets established, and tracking plans developed. These include FAA certification, ancillary test program, quality control, and structural integrity control plans...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{recounts the}} {{significant}} events {{which took place}} during the structural verification testing of two graphite/epoxy material, full-size vertical stabilizers. The ground test articles were tested to a high bending dynamic lateral gust condition. The first unit failed during static testing at 98 percent Design Ultimate Load. Failure began within the front spar cap. A detailed review of the failure was performed to identify all possible modes. This review resulted in a 'production line' type fix being designed for incorporation in the second ground test article prior to installation in the test fixture. The modified second unit sustained 106 percent of Design Ultimate Load without incident. One lifetime (36, 000 flights) of damage tolerance testing was accomplished with the specimen purposely damaged at five locations. A fail-safe loading was performed successfully after simulating lightning strike damage to the <b>fin</b> <b>box</b> cover. A large area repair was substantiated by completing a second lifetime of spectrum loadings. The residual static strength was determined to be 119. 7 percent of Design Ultimate Load...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of {{technical}} work conducted during the fourth phase of a multiphase program having {{the objective of the}} design, development and flight evaluation of an advanced composite empennage component manufactured in a production environment at a cost competitive with those of its metal counterpart, and at a weight savings of at least 20 percent. The empennage component selected for this program is the vertical <b>fin</b> <b>box</b> of the L- 1011 aircraft. The box structure extends from the fuselage production joint to the tip rib and includes front and rear spars. During Phase 4 of the program, production quality tooling was designed and manufactured to produce three sets of covers, ribs, spars, miscellaneous parts, and subassemblies to assemble three complete ACVF units. Recurring and nonrecurring cost data were compiled and documented in the updated producibility/design to cost plan. Nondestruct inspections, quality control tests, and quality acceptance tests were performed in accordance with the quality assurance plan and the structural integrity control plan. Records were maintained to provide traceability of material and parts throughout the manufacturing development phase. It was also determined that additional tooling would not be required to support the current and projected L- 1011 production rate...|$|E

50|$|Van Vliet {{used the}} ensuing publicity, {{particularly}} with a 1970 Rolling Stone interview with Langdon Winner, to promulgate {{a number of}} myths which were subsequently quoted as fact. Winners article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor {{the members of the}} Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad and French later discredited this. Van Vliet also claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Mark Boston from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished musicians before joining the band. Van Vliet also took complete credit for composition and arranging, a claim that band members strongly disputed in later years. A subsequent overview of the work, during recording, {{can be found in the}} Grow <b>Fins</b> CD <b>box</b> set (CDs 3 & 4) and its vinyl 3-volume alternatives.|$|R
5000|$|Surfboards have {{traditionally}} been constructed using polyurethane foam and it remains a popular choice. They are made stronger {{with one or more}} stringers going {{down the middle of the}} board. The foam is molded into a [...] "blank", in the rough shape of a surfboard. Once the blanks have been made they are given to shapers. Shapers then cut, plane, and sand the board to its specifications. Finally, the board is covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth and resin. It is during this stage that the <b>fins</b> or <b>boxes</b> for removable <b>fins</b> are attached and the leash plug installed. Another method of making boards is using epoxy resin and prolapse polystyrene foam, instead of polyester resin and polyurethane foam. In recent years, surfboards made out of balsa and a polystyrene core are becoming more popular. Even solid balsa surfboards are available.|$|R
