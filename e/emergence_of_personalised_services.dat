40|$|In many European countries, {{municipalities}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important as providers of electronic public services to their citizens. One of the horizons for further expansion is the delivery <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> electronic <b>services.</b> In this paper, we describe the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> in the Netherlands over the period 2006 - 2009 and investigate how and why various municipalities adopted <b>personalised</b> electronic <b>services.</b> In achieving this, we analyse data that were gathered during interviews with key stakeholders in ten selected Dutch municipalities. We synthesise the findings in an explanatory model <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> electronic <b>service</b> delivery diffusion. The model emphasizes persuasive pressures that are channelled to potential adopters <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, the model shows how persuasive pressure (as perceived by adopters) is followed-up by organisational search activities, and how, in various circumstances, the idea <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> is ‘framed’ by innovation champions, knowledge brokers and new members of staff as to appeal to specific organisational priorities and ambitions. In doing so, this article contributes to an institutional view on adoption and diffusion of innovations, in which (1) horizontal and vertical channels of persuasion and (2) human agency, rather than technological opportunity and rational cost-benefit considerations, account for actual diffusion of innovations...|$|R

40|$|SummaryOsteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related {{condition}} and {{the leading cause of}} pain, disability and shortening of adult working life in the UK. The incidence of OA increases with age, with 25 % of the over 50 s population having OA of the knee. Despite promising preclinical data covering various molecule classes, there is regrettably at present no approved disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs). With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, other therapeutic areas, in particular oncology, have experienced a paradigm shift towards defining disease by its molecular composition. This paradigm shift has enabled high resolution patient stratification and supported the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> or precision medicines. In this review we evaluate the potential for the development of OA therapeutics to undergo a similar paradigm shift given that OA is increasingly being recognised as a heterogeneous disease affecting multiple joint tissues. We highlight the evidence for the role of these tissues in OA pathology as different “hallmarks” of OA biology and review the opportunities to identify and develop targeted disease-modifying pharmacological therapeutics. Finally, we consider whether it is feasible to expect the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> disease-modifying medicines for patients with OA and how this might be achieved...|$|R

Data were collected in eight European countries using an online survey.

Perceived Privacy Risk was mainly determined by perceptions of Information Control, whereas Perceived Personalisation Benefit primarily depended on Perceived Service Effectiveness. Services that required increasingly intimate personal information, and in particular DNA, raised consumers’ Privacy Risk perceptions, but failed to increase perceptions of Personalisation Benefit. Accordingly, to successfully exploit <b>personalised</b> nutrition, <b>service</b> providers should convey a clear message regarding the benefits and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> nutrition <b>services.</b> Furthermore, service providers may reduce Privacy Risk by increasing consumer perceptions of Information Control.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to demonstrate the technical feasibility and medical effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> and care programmes for Parkinson's disease, based on the combination of mHealth applications, cooperative ICTs, cloud technologies and wearable integrated devices, which empower patients to manage their health and disease in cooperation with their formal and informal caregivers, and with professional medical staff across different care settings, such as hospital and home. The presented service revolves around the use of two wearable inertial sensors, i. e. SensFoot and SensHand, for measuring foot and hand performance in the MDS-UPDRS III motor exercises. The devices were tested in medical settings with eight patients, eight hyposmic subjects and eight healthy controls, and the results demonstrated that this approach allows quantitative metrics for objective evaluation to be measured, {{in order to identify}} pre-motor/pre-clinical diagnosis and to provide a complete service of tele-health with remote control provided by cloud technologies. © 2016, IGI Global.

40|$|With {{computing}} {{devices and}} the Internet becoming ubiquitous, users can {{make use of}} network-based software applications in dif- ferent places and situations. Mobile devices with Internet connec- tivity are {{a good example of}} this trend. Network-based software applications are being exposed to users as web services, which makes them accessible on demand, when and where the users re- quire them in their daily life. Often users have to make use of several services to fulfil their re- quirements. The required services can be combined into a service composition, to deliver a value-added service that fulfils all the dif- ferent requirements of a given user at a given moment. Creating such service compositions beforehand is difficult, or even impos- sible, as service developers would need to define all the possible service compositions that end-users may require. However, and given that services can be exposed through the Internet, service compositions can possibly be created on demand, driven by the users, whenever users require a given functionality that cannot be delivered by a single existing service. In this thesis we address the problem <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>service</b> delivery through on demand composition of existing services...|$|R

40|$|The premium player {{segment is}} {{a major source of}} {{revenues}} and profit for the casino sector. In their roles as providers <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> casino hosts are an important determinant in attracting and retaining this market segment. The service performance of such hosts impacts on both player retention and casino profitability. In seeking to explain these relationships, the present study identifies the antecedents of host service performance by using the five factor model of personality (FFM) and the concepts of emotional intelligence and adaptiveness. The researchers test the proposed relationships by adopting a hierarchical approach to FFM and emotional intelligence as basic personality traits or independent variables, adaptiveness as a surface trait or mediator, and host performance as the dependent variable. A sample of casino hosts at a large Australasia-based casino responded to a questionnaire-based survey which considered the five factors of personality, emotional intelligence, adaptiveness and service performance ratings. The results indicate that the FFM, emotional intelligence and adaptiveness have a significant influence on host performance. Structural equation modelling confirmed the existence of a hierarchical relationship between the basic personality traits, adaptiveness and performance outcomes and demonstrates that the inclusion of a mediator contributes to an enhanced evaluation of service performance. These findings enrich the literature by identifying new traits and provide insights that will support practitioners with their selection and training-related activities.

40|$|The {{need for}} personalised support systems {{comes from the}} growing number of {{students}} that are being supported within institutions with shrinking resources. Over the last decade the use of computers and the Internet within education has become more predominant. This opens up a range of possibilities in regard to spreading that resource further and more effectively. Previous attempts to create automated systems such as intelligent tutoring systems and learning companions have been criticised for being pedagogically ineffective and relying on large knowledge sources which restrict their domain of application. More recent work on adaptive hypermedia has resolved some of these issues but has been criticised for the lack of support scope, focusing on learning paths and alternative content presentation. The student model used within these systems is also of limited scope and often based on learning history or learning styles. This research examines the potential of using a personality theory as the basis for a personalisation mechanism within an educational support system. The automated support system is designed to utilise a personality based profile to predict student behaviour. This prediction is then used to select the most appropriate feedback from a selection of reflective hints for students performing lab based programming activities. The rationale for the use of personality is simply that this is the concept psychologists use for identifying individual differences and similarities which are expressed in everyday behaviour. Therefore the research has investigated how these characteristics can be modelled in order to provide a fundamental understanding of the student user and thus be able to provide tailored support. As personality is used to describe individuals across many situations and behaviours, the use of such at the core of a personalisation mechanism may overcome the issues of scope experienced by previous methods. This research poses the following question: can a representation of personality be used to predict behaviour within a software system, in such a way, as to be able to personalise support? Putting forward the central claim that it is feasible to capture and represent personality within a software system for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>personalising</b> <b>services.</b> The research uses a mixed methods approach including a number and combination of quantitative and qualitative methods for both investigation and determining the feasibility of this approach. The main contribution of the thesis has been the development of a set of profiling models from psychological theories, which account for both individual differences and group similarities, as a means <b>of</b> <b>personalising</b> <b>services.</b> These are then applied {{to the development of a}} prototype system which utilises a personality based profile. The evidence from the evaluation of the developed prototype system has demonstrated an ability to predict student behaviour with limited success and personalise support. The limitations of the evaluation study and implementation difficulties suggest that the approach taken in this research is not feasible. Further research and exploration is required –particularly in the application to a subject area outside that of programming...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the mobile communication systems is paving the way towards {{the development of new}} information services. At present Location Based Services (LBS) are gaining momentum since they allow the provision of mobile users with information related at their positions that, therefore, can help them on the move. The access to an information system is {{complicated by the fact that}} the access terminals and technologies may be heterogeneous. For instance, we can use mobile terminals with different displays, computation capabilities, access techniques (and, therefore, available bit-rate), software and so on. The user must be able to access the services not only by using a common personal computer at home, but also by means of its cellular phone (during a trip) or a personal digital assistant, in a totally transparent and seamless way. Accordingly, the provision <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> anywhere and anytime requires that the information system be adaptable and scalable, depending on the access technologies, terminal characteristics and user preferences. It is therefore very important that the system, for instance, be able to understand the characteristics of the technology adopted by the user to access the service, in order to adapt the content format and its presentation. Aim of this paper is to present some preliminary studies related to the Personalised Access to Local Information and services for tOurists (PALIO-IST 20656) project.

40|$|The <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>personalised</b> and {{precision}} healthcare requires detailed knowledge of human molecular pathology. Genomics {{has been transformed}} by sequencing technologies that can unravel the human genome in 1 day {{for less than a}} thousand dollars. Recently, metabolomics, the quantitative measurement of small molecules, has emerged as a field to study an individual’s molecular profile. This is very important because a genome can only give a prediction of an individual’s propensity to a disease – genotyping, while a metabolome can provide immediate diagnosis of biochemical activity in human body – phenotyping. However, the present approach of measuring metabolites depends on large and expensive equipment such as NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. More importantly, this equipment does not provide a single analytical platform to measure the entire metabolome. CMOS technology has made a major impact in personal mobile computing, digital imaging and communications as part of everyday life. CMOS provides a single integrated platform for sensing technologies, low-cost manufacturing and miniaturisation of microelectronic systems. CMOS has been used successfully to create an all-electronic sequencing technology. We anticipate that CMOS has the potential to allow multiple biomarkers to be monitored in parallel, thus paving the way for metabolome profiling.
