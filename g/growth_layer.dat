5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth.

These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla.

5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{principal}} reasons why speleothems are recognised as important palaeoclimate archives is their suitability for accurate and precise uranium-series (U-series) age determination. Sampling speleothem sections for U-series dating is straightforward in most cases because visible <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> are preserved. However, {{this is not always}} the case, and here we describe a sampling strategy whereby <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> are resolved from trace-element images produced by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). We apply this method to a section of an Italian subaqueous speleothem (CD 3) that lacks persistent visible <b>growth</b> <b>layering.</b> Trace-element imaging revealed <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> that are strongly non-planar in their geometry owing to the speleothem's pronounced euhedral crystal terminations. The most prominent trace-element layers were first digitized as x, y vector contours. We then interpolated these in the growth-axis direction to generate a series of contour lines at ∼ 250 -μm increments. The coordinates of these contours were used to guide the sampling via a computerised micromilling lathe. This produced a total of 22 samples for U-series dating by multi-collector ICP-MS. The dating results returned ages in correct stratigraphic order within error. Close inspection of the U-series data and the derived depth-age model suggests that the main source of model-age uncertainty is unrelated to the contour sampling but instead more associated with how closely spaced the model ages are in time, i. e. the model age density. Comparisons between stable oxygen and carbon isotope profiles derived from aliquots of the dating samples and two other stable isotope profiles from CD 3 spanning the same time period compare very favourably. Taken together, this suggests that our trace-element contouring method provides a reliable means for extracting samples for dating (and other geochemical analyses), and can be applied to similar speleothems lacking visible <b>growth</b> <b>layering...</b>|$|R

This study elucidates and quantifies {{the organization of}} calcitic trabeculae and pores in large primary spines of the slate pencil urchin H. mamillatus by image analysis from scanning electron microscopy, X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT) and gravimetry. This study delivers a detailed distribution of porosities within the whole spine and shows that parts of the spines have a much higher porosity then hitherto thought. The central part (medulla) of the high-magnesium calcitic stereom of H. mamillatus spines has a porosity range of 75 % to nearly 90 %. From this innermost structure, more than 200 radially aligned, but often sinuous trabeculae extend to the spine rim. The structure of this complicated meshwork (radiating layer) is best seen in basal cross sections and was confirmed by µCT scans. The radiating layer has a porosity range from 40 – 70 % and is irregularly separated by the dense <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> (15 – 35 % porosity). <b>Growth</b> <b>layers</b> were classified in proximal and distal <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> with numbers ranging within a single animal between 3 – 14 and 2 – 7, respectively.

From each tree core wood (wood billet containing 15 <b>growth</b> <b>layers)</b> and slabwood (outer 20 <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> of a wood billet containing 40 <b>growth</b> <b>layers)</b> samples were chipped and pulped to kappa numbers of 27 ± 2. An additional 7 samples were taken at 5 internode intervals (5 <b>growth</b> <b>layers)</b> from the 10 th to the 40 th internodes of 3 trees with average basic densities. Each internode sample {{from each of the}} 3 trees was combined on equal oven-dry basis, and kraft pulps were prepared. Wood basic densities, chip basic densities, and wood tracheid lengths for each of the 25 samples were compared with weighted average pulp fibre lengths, pulp fibre cross-sectional dimensions, fibre wall thickness: fibre diameter ratios, and pulp fibre coarseness. For all 25 pulps, chip basic density was found to be the wood property most closely related to pulp and handsheet qualities. About 80 % of the variation in handsheet tear, burst, and density properties were accounted for by variations in chip basic density. Inclusion of pulp fibre length in the regression analyses increased this variation accountability by 5 - 10 %. Of the pulp properties measured, the wall thickness: fibre diameter ratio was most closely correlated with chip basic density and therefore with the selected handsheet characteristics. Fibre coarseness was slightly less highly correlated but probably of more practical importance because of the relative ease of measuring this pulp parameter...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Secondary growth via {{successive}} cambia {{has been}} intriguing researchers for decades.

The present study aims to clarify secondary growth via successive cambia in the mangrove species Avicennia marina on a macroscopic level, addressing {{the formation of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> network as a whole. In addition, previously suggested effects of salinity on <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> formation were reconsidered. Methods: A 1 -year cambial marking experiment was performed on 80 trees from eight sites in two mangrove forests in Kenya. Environmental (soil water salinity and nutrients, soil texture, inundation frequency) and tree characteristics (diameter, height, leaf area index) were recorded for each site. Both groups of variables were analysed in relation to annual number of growth layers, annual radial increment and average <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> width of stem discs. Key Results: Between trees of the same site, the number of growth layers formed during the 1 -year study period varied from only part of a <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> up to four growth layers, and was highly correlated to the corresponding radial increment (0 - 5 mm year- 1), even along the different sides of asymmetric stem discs. The radial increment was unrelated to salinity, but the <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> width decreased with increasing salinity and decreasing tree height. Conclusions: A patchy growth mechanism was proposed, with an optimal growth at distinct moments in time at different positions around the stem circumference. This strategy creates the opportunity to form several growth layers simultaneously, as observed in 14 % of the studied trees, which may optimize tree growth under favourable conditions. Strong evidence was provided for a mainly endogenous trigger controlling cambium differentiation, with an additional influence of current environmental conditions in a trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability...|$|E

Two of the clones were also grown under four different soil nutrient conditions: (i) N deficient, (ii) P deficient, (iii) normal soil of average fertility, (iv) double topsoil with unrestricted root access to subsoil. The effect of periodic moderate moisture stress on wood properties was to induce the formation of frequent narrow false rings.

The ecological structure analyses were carried out according to the herb synusia and its ecological, chorological and chronological properties within the cenological relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of age {{is an important step}} in defining the life history traits of individuals and populations. Age {{determination of}} odontocetes is mainly based on counting annual <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> groups in the teeth. However, this useful method is always invasive, requiring the cutting of at least one tooth, and sometimes the results are difficult to interpret. Based on the concept that bone matrix is constantly deposited throughout life, we analysed the bone mineral density of the arm and forearm of a series of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu 1821) stranded along the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea or maintained in confined waters. The bone mineral density values we obtained were evaluated as possible age predictors of the Mediterranean population of this species, considering age as determined by counting <b>growth</b> <b>layer</b> groups in sections of the teeth and the total body length of the animal as references. Comparisons between left and right flipper showed no difference. Our results show that bone mineral density values of the thoracic limb are indeed reliable age predictors in Tursiops truncatus. Further investigations in additional odontocete species are necessary to provide strong evidence of the reliability of bone mineral density as an indicator of growth and chronological wear and tear in toothed-whales...|$|E
40|$|Otoliths, {{predominantly}} from Lanternfishes (Myctophidae), {{from two}} species {{belonging to the}} Deepsea Bristlemouths (Gonostomidae), and from one stromatoid species are described from the Quaternary of Sites 587 and 594 in the southwest Pacific. Their occurrences and preservation {{as well as their}} present distribution are discussed. <b>Growth</b> <b>layers</b> of some otoliths are described in detail and figured using SEM techniques...|$|R
5000|$|It had <b>growth</b> <b>layers</b> like tree rings, seen {{within the}} cavity of the {{organism}} and when the cone is sectioned. The cone was light-brown and glassy in appearance. It is distributed widely in North America. A specimen of a belemnoid {{had been found in}} Germany, clearly preserving 10 tentacles as carbon films, showing that belemnoids are similar to squids.|$|R
40|$|The {{passive control}} of {{compressible}} boundary <b>layer</b> <b>growth</b> by boundary <b>layer</b> trips {{has been studied}} experimentally. Axisymmetric trips and three dimensional trips were used in this study. The nomial freestream Mach numbers are 1. 5 and 4. The results show that trips are effective in promoting boundary <b>layer</b> <b>growth.</b> Trips are more effective for Mach 1. 5 flows than for Mach 4 flows...|$|R
