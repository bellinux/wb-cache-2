40|$|During last decades, Magnetic Resonance (MR) —compatible sensors {{based on}} {{different}} techniques {{have been developed}} due to growing demand for application in medicine. There are several technological solutions to design MR-compatible sensors, among them, the one based on optical fibers presents several attractive features. The high elasticity and small size allow designing miniaturized fiber optic sensors (FOS) with metrological characteristics (e. g., accuracy, sensitivity, zero drift, and frequency response) adequate for most common medical applications; the immunity from electromagnetic interference {{and the absence of}} electrical connection to the patient make FOS suitable to be used in high electromagnetic field and <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safer</b> than conventional technologies. These two features further heightened the potential role of FOS in medicine making them especially attractive for application in MRI.

40|$|Modeling of low {{severity}} soft-tissue injury due to unwanted collisions of a robot in collaborative settings is {{an important}} aspect to be treated in safe physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI).

However, {{for the design of}} an <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safer</b> robot arm, a reliable evaluation of the collision between a human and a robot that is based on skin injury criteria is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel human-robot collision model with and without covering, which is based on the impact stress distribution. The reliability of the proposed collision model is verified by a comparison with various cadaver experiments taken from existing biomechanical literature. Since the stress characteristics acting on the human head can be analyzed with this new collision model, the occurrence of certain soft-tissue injury can be estimated. Furthermore, the method serves for selecting the appropriate covering parameters, as e. g. elastic modulus and thickness, by evaluating the chosen skin injury indices...|$|R

Aims To identify alternative instruments, which if used would improve worker safety. Methods Retrospective review of 161 injuries with identification of safer alternative products for instruments that caused injury. The proportion of injuries that could be prevented was calculated [with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) ]. Results The average rate of injury was 7. 8 / 1000 employees per annum (95 % CI, 6. 8 – 9. 4 / 1000). In the 2 years the highest rates of injury occurred in pre-registration house officers (164 / 1000; 95 % CI, 64 – 264 / 1000), phlebotomists (154 / 1000; 95 % CI, 15 – 291 / 1000) and senior house officers (45 / 1000; 95 % CI, 13 – 77 / 1000).

30|$|Live viral vectors {{are widely}} used as {{delivery}} systems in mucosal vaccination, including adenovirus, attenuated influenza virus, Venezuelan equine virus, bacillus Calmette-Gue´rin and poxvirus vectors (Prevec et al., 1989; Caley et al., 1997; Hiroi et al., 2001; Gherardi and Esteban, 2005; Huang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Besides viral vectors, nucleic acid-based vaccines such as plasmid DNA and RNA, are also being developed. However, the inactivated/attenuated pathogens, vector- and DNA-based vaccines are always limited for use due to difficulties in microorganism culturing and some safety concerns such as the possibility of reverting to the virulent state in immunocompromised hosts, as well as potential adverse effects including allergic and autoimmune reactions. In contrast, vaccines with protein antigens are <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safer</b> than the whole pathogen-based and DNA-based antigens due {{to the absence of}} genetic materials. Furthermore, the technical maturation in mass production of specific peptides and recombinant proteins has substantially lowered the hurdle of developing protein/peptide-based therapeutics and vaccines (Degim and Celebi, 2007). Therefore, pathogen proteins and epitope peptides provide a promising alternative for antigen development. For example, the Nabel group reported that ferritin nanoparticle based HA delivery system demonstrated a more potent and broader immune protection against influenza than the inactivated virus. In this vaccine delivery system, HA mimics its natural trimeric conformation as in the virus (Kanekiyo et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the most prominent causes of premature injury, handicap and death in the modern world. In children, the problem is so severe that pedestrian {{accidents are}} widely regarded as the most serious of all health risks facing children in developed countries. Not surprisingly, educational measures have long been advocated as a means of teaching children how to cope with traffic and substantial resources have been devoted to their development and provision. Unfortunately, there seems to be a widespread view at the present time that education has not achieved as much as had been hoped and that there may even be quite strict limits to what can be achieved through education. This would, of course, shift the emphasis away from education altogether towards engineering or urban planning measures aimed at creating an <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safer</b> environment in which the need for education might be reduced or even eliminated. However, whilst engineering measures undoubtedly have a major role to play in the effort to reduce accidents, this outlook is both overly optimistic about the benefits of engineering and overly pessimistic about the limitations of education.

40|$|According to {{widespread}} public opinion, environmental contaminants and food additives are major chemical hazards in food. In contrast, scientific {{evidence shows that}} levels of environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals or residues of pesticides, have greatly decreased {{in the last three}} decades and are much below the tolerable limits; food additives are strictly regulated and their proper use justifies no food safety concerns. The concept that a “de minimis” value or a Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) can be identified for any chemical is gaining ground in food toxicology. The popular belief that compounds of natural origin are <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safer</b> than synthetic ones is not supported by scientific evidence. - Nutrition oriented cancer research in the past was preoccupied with the idea that food contained man-made carcinogenic substances. Their detection and elimination was thought to reduce and perhaps avoid the risk of cancer. A paradigmatic change has occurred: from the hunt for carcinogenic chemicals in food, research has moved to the study of food constituents preventing cancer and to their mechanism of action. The occurrence of health-promoting food constituents forms the basis of the present interest in “functional foods”. However, criminal actions leading to hazardous contamination of food do occur, the Spanish oil catastrophe of 1981 being an extreme example of this. Continued vigilance will be required to protect consumers from unsafe products. ...|$|R

40|$|Light Water Reactors (LWR), which {{represent}} {{the most common}} reactor in operation and under construction, have an average thermal efficiency of about 33 %- 35 %, therefore two third of the thermal energy produced by the nuclear reaction is typically wasted. The literature presents many possible applications of this thermal energy, however {{most of them are}} not feasible because of economic and legislative constraints: among the others the Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) {{is one of the most}} critic. The EPZ is the area surrounding the Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) subject to specific rules constraining the development of the area. These constraints avoid the complete exploitation of the energy produced by the power plants. Small Medium Nuclear Reactors (SMR) can offset some of the constraints since they are <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safer</b> and therefore can theoretically require a smaller EPZ. This chapter deals with the relationships among the Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ), the reactor size and the possibilities of cogeneration. After a review of the constraints for the EPZ in the different countries it show the relationship among EPZ and NPP size and presents the various options of nuclear cogenerations. These options are evaluated according to the commercial feasibility of the different technologies clustering the solutions in short and long term options. Â© 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Leishmanization (LZ) was the first effort for live vaccination and currently used in a few countries against cutaneous leishmaniasis, in spite of their obstacle and safety. Then, live attenuated vaccines developed with similar promotion of creating long term immunity in the host with lower side effect. Different example of attenuated strains are generated through long-term in vitro culturing, culturing under drug pressure, temperature sensitivity and chemical mutagenesis, but none are safe enough and their revision to virulent form is possible. Attenuation through genetic manipulation and disruption of virulence factors or essential enzymes for intracellular survival are among other approaches that are intensively under study. Other designs to develop live vaccines for visceral form of leishmaniasis are utilization of live avirulent microorganisms such as Lactococcus lactis, Salmonella enterica and Leishmania tarentolae called as vectored vaccine.

Motorcycle and car traffic crash injury self-reported in 2009, with twelve months' recall. In 2009, 5608 (10 %) participants reported a traffic crash injury. Most crashes involved a motorcycle (74 %). Car access increased and motorcycle use decreased between 2005 and 2009. Among those who used a motorcycle at both time points, traffic injury incidence was 2. 8 times greater compared to those who did not use a motorcycle at either time point. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test longitudinal and cross sectional factors associated with traffic crash injury: in the adjusted model, cars were negatively and motorcycles positively associated with injury.
