500|$|My disgust at this {{proposition}} was, I think, chiefly due to Victor Hugo's latter novels, which I regard as pretentious and untrue to nature. To this perhaps was added some feeling of indignation that I {{should be asked}} {{to give way to}} a Frenchman. The Frenchman had broken his engagement. He had failed to have his work finished by the stipulated time. From week to week and from month to month he had put off the fulfilment of his duty. And because of these laches on his part,— on the part of this sententious French Radical,— <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrown over! ...|$|E
500|$|The Norman propagandist and historian, William of Poitiers, {{claimed that}} Siward {{was among those}} who had sworn an oath to uphold Edward the Confessor's alleged {{declaration}} that William, Duke of Normandy (later King William <b>I),</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his heir. Others said to have made that oath were Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia, along with Stigand, who had been pardoned in 1044, and raised to Bishop of Winchester in 1047. [...] If this did happen, it was probably during or a little before spring 1051, when Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury, was journeying to Rome for his pallium.|$|E
500|$|Anna Rosmus {{received}} the 1994 award, {{in honor of}} work related to her research on the Nazi past of her hometown in Bavaria. [...] Rosmus researched anti-Semitism, and opposed neo-Nazis and the extreme right in Germany. [...] She also located and published artwork of Jews that had once lived {{in her hometown of}} Passau, Germany. [...] As a result of her work, Rosmus endured threats against her life. In a 1996 Yom HaShoah ceremony, Rosmus recounted threats she faced after conducting her research: [...] "Once-friendly neighbors threatened me openly - on the telephone, in person, in letters ... They threatened to kill me and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed just before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there, and several times I was sued. Nobody ever claimed I had said anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E
500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for the Sunday {{were from}} the First Epistle of John, [...] "Whoever doesn't love, remains in Death" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, {{the parable of the}} great banquet (...) [...] The unknown poet was likely the same as for the first cantata for Leipzig, also in 14movements, also arranged in two symmetrical parts to be performed before and after the sermon. Again the cantata begins with words from a Psalm, [...] (verses 2 and 4 in the Luther Bible), [...] "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows His handiwork. There is no speech or language, where their voice is not heard", connecting the Gospel to the Old Testament. The poet first expands in movements 2 and 3 the thought of the Universe praising God's creation. In the following two movements he deplores, following the Gospel, that nonetheless people did not follow the invitation of God, therefore he had to invite [...] "" [...] (from all streets) and bless those, as movement 6 says. Part I closes with the first stanza of Luther's chorale [...] "" [...] (1524), a paraphrase of Psalm 67. Part <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> performed before the sermon, Part II after the sermon and during communion. Part II talks about the duties of those who follow God's invitation, to pass the love of Christ in order to achieve heaven on earth, a thought also expressed in the Epistle reading. The third stanza of Luther's chorale closes the work.|$|E

She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
