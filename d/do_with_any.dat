5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal has little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, President Uribe {{publicly}} {{revealed that}} former US Vice President Al Gore had canceled {{his participation in}} a pro-environment event Uribe was to attend in Miami due to the continuing allegations against him. The Colombian President reacted by organizing a press conference during which he addressed several of the accusations Senator Petro and others had made against him. Uribe argued that his family had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> massacres {{and that they had}} already sold the implicated farms several years before the alleged events. He also stated that the Uribes and the Ochoas were both famous in the horse breeding business, causing their meetings to be both common and public. He claimed that the helicopter's hours and missions had been strictly logged, making it impossible for it to have participated in any massacre. Uribe said that he supported the CONVIVIR groups but was not solely responsible for their creation, adding that other civilian and military authorities also participated in their oversight. He also said that he dismantled some CONVIVIR groups when doubts began to surround their activities.|$|E

500|$|Witchfinder General is a 1968 British horror film {{directed}} by Michael Reeves and starring Vincent Price, Ian Ogilvy, and Hilary Dwyer. The screenplay was by Reeves and Tom Baker based on Ronald Bassett's {{novel of the}} same name. Made on a low budget of under £100,000, the movie was co-produced by Tigon British Film Productions and American International Pictures. The story details the heavily fictionalised murderous witch-hunting exploits of Matthew Hopkins, a 17th-century English lawyer {{who claimed to have}} been appointed as a [...] "" [...] by Parliament during the English Civil War to root out sorcery and witchcraft. The film was retitled The Conqueror Worm in the United States in an attempt to link it with Roger Corman's earlier series of Edgar Allan Poe–related films starring Price—although this movie has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> of Poe's stories, and only briefly alludes to his poem.|$|E

[...] Hutton {{asserted that}} the only [...] "sustained champion" [...] of Liddell's claims has been Michael Howard, noting that he had defended such ideas in a [...] "limited and measured" [...] manner.

500|$|In November 2009 Loretta {{became the}} centre of media {{controversy}} when various media outlets announced that Loretta {{would be part of}} a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past. The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The Sun compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger. Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children. Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities. Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked The Sun and its claims. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline. While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first. She said, [...] "I'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing. They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way." [...] She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show. Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining it had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> real life case: [...] "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events. The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were {{responsible for the death of}} a 12-year-old girl in the past." [...] The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past. It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{charitable}} {{status of}} the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack. British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all British prime ministers before them since its inception. Confounding expectations, David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011. According to a spokesman, Cameron's surprise refusal {{was due to the}} JNF-UK being an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country—i.e., Israel. Cameron's decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman's assurances that his decision had [...] "absolutely nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> anti-Israel campaign". However, campaigners claimed that Cameron's resignation was due to political pressures motivated by the JNF-KKL's discriminatory policies in Israel. Since then, the JNF-UK's Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament condemning the JNF and calling for the revocation of the JNF's charitable status in the UK was launched in 2011 and by February 2012 had been signed by 66 Members of Parliament. In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status and pledged to sign up to a campaign which calls the charity [...] "racist".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} {{period of the}} main {{response}} to the tsunami disaster – from December 2004 {{for the next four}} or five years – there was much debate about both the size and form of way that assistance was delivered. [...] For example, just one day after the tsunami, on 27 December 2004, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland reportedly categorised the contributions of rich countries as [...] "stingy". This was widely misinterpreted in the media as categorising the overall response to the tsunami whereas Mr Egeland later explained that at the time he had been making a general remark about overall global aid flows in recent years. Speaking at a press conference later Mr. Egeland said, [...] "It has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> particular country or the response to this emergency. We are in early days and the response has so far been overwhelmingly positive". The U.S. government, led by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, added another US$20 million on 28 December to the original U.S pledge of US$15 million, bringing the total up to US$35 million (not including direct aid rendered by naval vessels dispatched to the region). Initially, the U.S. Navy dispatched P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and an aircraft carrier to assist with relief operations.|$|E
