5|$|As a Jew, Kyle often defends {{and shows}} {{pride in his}} {{religion}} and ancestry. He is nevertheless lonely in this regard, particularly around Christmas time, though he takes solace in anticipating the annual appearance of Mr. Hankey, an anthropomorphic piece of feces who <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sewer to spread Christmas cheer.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E

5|$|The habitations {{and main}} farming areas are largely {{confined}} to the Wharfe valley, {{and the rest of}} the parish is mainly rough moorland pasture. The village is on one of several branches of the North Craven Fault where Hebden Beck <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moors through a steep-sided valley into the Wharfe valley, on an ancient east-west route.|$|E
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|As {{the four}} pack up their {{respective}} apartments—Rachel, in particular, displeased {{about having to}} switch—Phoebe returns home and takes a pregnancy test, though {{it is too soon}} for a result. Later with packing complete, Rachel finally refuses to move as Frank and Alice come by with another pregnancy test. The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross, which is cut short when Phoebe <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant, the mood turning to one of celebration.|$|E
50|$|The qualifiers were {{organized}} as four independent modified double-elimination tournaments featuring four teams each.

5|$|By {{the second}} verse, pink {{elephants}} float over the girl's bed and an animated fairy version of Madonna <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> picture and winks. She takes {{the little girl}} through another picture, displaying mythological and fairytale beings such as dragons, princes and unicorns {{as well as a}} castle where Madonna dances with the moon. An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows, then a parade of all the girl's toys around her room. As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn. She falls asleep again and her toys go back to being as they were. The violins and the instruments gradually fade inside the radio and the song ends.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Galvatron <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dead Universe, destroys {{an alien}} {{observatory}} and crushes Hound's unit on Cybertron {{to retrieve the}} body of Thunderwing. While unconscious during his battle with Megatron, Prime encountered the presence of Nova Prime, and he meets with Nova's once-associate, Omega Supreme. Monstructor escapes his prison and seeks revenge against Omega. He finds Omega along with Prime, and after battling him, Prime leaves Monstructor to be tended by Jetfire. Elsewhere, Blaster's body is recovered from space. After more assassination attempts he discovers the traitor is an unwilling Beachcomber, controlled by Soundwave and Bombshell's cerebro shell. Angry, he vows to hunt down Soundwave.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E

5|$|Once Nate <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vessel, he and Sully {{are confronted}} by another {{treasure}} hunter named Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman), to whom Sully owes {{a great deal}} of money. Backed by his partner, archaeologist Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes), Roman forces Nate to hand over the page and shoots Sully dead when he tries to intervene. Before he can kill Nate, a loose torpedo charge previously accidentally triggered by Nate causes the U-boat to explode, distracting the gang long enough for Drake to escape. He runs into Elena, who agrees to help him find the statue, and together they use Sully's plane to travel to the old colony.|$|E
5|$|Shane arms {{the rest}} of the group and they {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the other return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able to step forward and shoot her.|$|E
5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they {{hear the sound of}} a gunshotfrom the shot that Carl (Chandler Riggs) used to kill a reanimated Shane Walshand they turn to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to examine the location of oviposition by the phorid fly Megaselia halterata (Wood) (Diptera: Phoridae) in uncased and cased compost. Clearly, {{a majority of the}} gravid females choose oviposition sites directly after entering the top layer of the compost. In uncased compost, 60 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of four compost layers of equal thickness. When the compost was covered by a casing layer which was still uncolonized by Agaricus bisporus, oviposition was further concentrated in the top compost layer. In this situation, 91 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top compost layer whereas only 1. 5 % <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> casing. When the casing layer was colonized by mushroom mycelium, 45 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> casing layer and 53 % <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top compost layer. Further concentration in the top compost layer and the casing layer occurred as a result of upward migration of larvae. When compost was cased after oviposition, up to 43 % of all adults <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> casing layer. We concluded that in the control of phorid infestations with insect pathogenic nematodes, applications in uncased compost can be restricted to the upper compost layer. When compost and casing are filled simultaneously, nematode applications in the casing layer only could be considere...|$|R

5|$|There are {{estimated}} to be 100,000 species of ichneumonoid wasps in the families Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. These are almost exclusively parasitoids, mostly utilising other insects as hosts. Another family, the Pompilidae, is a specialist parasitoid of spiders. Some wasps are even parasitoids of parasitoids; the eggs of Euceros are laid beside lepidopteran larvae and the wasp larvae feed temporarily on their haemolymph, but if a parasitoid <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> host, the hyperparasites continue their life cycle inside the parasitoid. Parasitoids maintain their extreme diversity through narrow specialism. In Peru, 18 wasp species were found living on 14 fly species in only two species of Gurania climbing squash.|$|E

It is revealed that Tom had promised Migg some of his clothes, and Migg makes breakfast. Later, Migg and Tom play Risk and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called.
