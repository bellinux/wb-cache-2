So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

I had to do something like that, something completely transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E

500|$|Both {{his parents}} were {{interested}} in natural sciences, and they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms. Dawkins describes his childhood as [...] "a normal Anglican upbringing". He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that {{the theory of evolution}} was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god. Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But whatever <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|Tillman {{had been}} re-elected in 1901 and 1907. By 1912, the Democratic nominee, {{who would be}} elected by the {{overwhelming}} Democratic majority in the legislature, was determined by a primary. A primary was also used for governor, and Tillman ran {{at the same time}} as Governor Cole Blease, who also sought re-election. Blease, also an outspoken white supremacist, had entered politics as a Tillmanite legislator in 1890, and breaking from him, adopted similar techniques to Tillman's to appeal to poor farm workers and mill hands. Tillman faced two opponents in his re-nomination bid—his control over South Carolina politics had deteriorated over the years, and he had moved towards the Conservatives. He had not endorsed Blease in 1910. The two men reached an agreement that Tillman would remain neutral in the governor's race in 1912, but Tillman became convinced Blease could not win against former state chief justice Ira B. Jones. Both sides claimed to have letters from Tillman endorsing their candidate, but three days before the primary, Tillman condemned Blease and endorsed Jones. Blease, outraged, alleged betrayal, accused Tillman of [...] "insane jealousy", and said of the senator, [...] "possibly his mind has become more diseased of late than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had my last talk with his confidential physician". Both men were re-elected.|$|E

500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E

2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of the {{situation}} in Afghanistan since his visits in 2007, [...] "it's a very different war since I was here a year ago but the fighting with the Taliban is as intense as ever. The war's changed in that the Taliban are using far more IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and anti-personnel mines.", and [...] "I found the fighting was just as intense as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was there with the Royal Anglians. In fact, it's actually more dangerous now with the IED threat.". Kemp described how the Taliban had now apparently taken to engaging from a distance, and planting IEDs and mines in areas where troops are likely to take cover, such as in ditches, switching from conventional tactics to a greater use of booby traps and suicide bombers.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the strangeness}} of the concept, some historians have doubted {{the reality of the}} {{exchange}} of goods and suggested that the exchange was really a transfer of the liturgy itself. [...] For contrary evidence, others [...] look to Demosthenes' speech [...] "Against Phaenippus", where an exchange of property is explicitly mentioned by the litigant: [...] "For I made this offer before to Phaenippus, and now again, men of the jury, I tender it freely:—I will surrender to him all my property including the mines, if he will hand over to me the farm alone free from all encumbrances as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first went to it with witnesses, and will replace as they were before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried away from the buildings after removing the seals from the doors." [...] However, it is possible that placing seals on the property was done solely to assess the respective fortunes of the owners.|$|E
2500|$|Reportedly, Crumb filed {{a lawsuit}} to have his name removed from the film's credits. San Francisco {{copyright}} attorney Albert L. Morse said that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits. However, Crumb's name has remained in the final film since its original theatrical release. [...] In response to his distaste for the film, Crumb had [...] "Fritz the Cat—Superstar" [...] published in People's Comics later in 1972, in which a jealous girlfriend kills Fritz with an icepick; he has refused to use the character again. and wrote the filmmakers a letter saying not to use his characters in their films. [...] Crumb later cited [...] the film as [...] "one of those experiences I sort of block out. The last time I saw <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students.

2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E
