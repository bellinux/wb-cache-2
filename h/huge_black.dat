5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to the Nordisk familjebok (Nordic Familybook) and science writer Willy Ley the animal may have survived {{long enough to be}} remembered in the legends of the native European peoples as a <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> bull with a single horn in the forehead.|$|E
25|$|The oil {{industry}} moved {{most of its}} local operations offshore during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1947, offshore leases were approved by the federal government, and seismic exploration of the Channel {{took place in the}} 1950s, even though fishermen complained that the underwater explosions were killing fish. The first of the <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> fifteen-story oil platforms, a feature of the seascape south of Santa Barbara for fifty years, went up in 1958. During the period, Stearns Wharf was the main connection for oil services going out to the platforms.|$|E

6000|$|The Angel's {{attention}} was concentrated on two <b>huge</b> hairy <b>black</b> fists, that swayed and advanced and retreated. [...] "Come on d'yer say? I'll show yer," [...] said the gentleman in rags, {{and then with}} extraordinary ferocity; [...] "My crikey! I'll show yer." ...|$|R
60|$|Some <b>huge</b> vague <b>black</b> shape, with a {{flapping}} {{something like}} a wing, seemed to be struggling in the aperture of the roof. In another moment the slit was clear again, and the luminous haze of the Milky Way shone warm and bright.|$|R
25|$|Its reports {{detailed}} {{the existence and}} activities of terrorist organizations in the area, which benefited from the <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> market in Paraguay {{and served as a}} financial laundering center for other organizations abroad. A 1997 report including evidence of such activities was shared with the intelligence agencies of the United States, Brazil, Paraguay, France and Germany. The Sala Patria group, formed to investigate clues about the AMIA bombing outside of Argentina, started operating in Paraguay and gave crucial information that led to the capture of many suspected terrorists and the neutralization of a suspected plan to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Asunción, Paraguay.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Time Beetle", {{which was}} {{responsible}} for the creation of the alternate universe, was described in the episode's script as [...] "a <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> beetle... shiny carapace, spindly black legs moving and flexing, mandibles clacking together". Its design was influenced by the Giant Spider of Metebelis 3 that clung to Sarah Jane Smith's back in Planet of the Spiders. The beetle's normal Earth-like appearance was deliberate; prosthetic designer Niell Gorton thought that familiarity would ease the narrative and cited the cat nuns from [...] "New Earth" [...] and the Judoon from [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] as examples. The prosthetic was made using fibreglass and fitted on a harness in order not to burden Catherine Tate's performance. The episode's director Graeme Harper explained in the episode's commentary that only psychic characters such as Lucius from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] were aware of the beetle's existence.|$|E
2500|$|Stormbringer is a magic sword {{featured}} {{in a number of}} fantasy stories by the author Michael Moorcock. Created by the forces of Chaos, it is described as a <b>huge,</b> <b>black</b> sword covered with strange runes carved deep into its blade. It is wielded by the doomed albino emperor Elric of Melniboné. [...] Stormbringer makes its first appearance in the 1961 novel The Dreaming City.|$|E
5000|$|The Green Turtle had {{no special}} powers {{but was a}} skilled fighter and flew a [...] "Turtle Plane". He wore a large, flowing cape with a green turtle emblem, and was {{occasionally}} depicted with a <b>huge,</b> shadowy, <b>black</b> turtle silhouette rearing behind him, however {{the significance of this}} was never established.|$|R

2500|$|Much of Lowry's {{early years}} were {{spent in the}} leafy Manchester suburb of Victoria Park, Rusholme, but in 1909, when he was 22, due to {{financial}} pressures, {{the family moved to}} 117 Station Road in the industrial town of Pendlebury. Here the landscape comprised textile mills and factory chimneys rather than trees. Lowry later recalled: [...] "At first I detested it, and then, after years I got pretty interested in it, then obsessed by it... One day I missed a train from Pendlebury – [...] I had ignored for seven years– and as I left the station I saw the Acme Spinning Company's mill... The <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> framework of rows of yellow-lit windows standing up against the sad, damp charged afternoon sky. The mill was turning out... I watched this scene— which I'd looked at many times without seeing— with rapture..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Jackson's series, Sauron is {{originally}} {{portrayed as}} a towering [...] "black knight" [...] wielding a <b>huge</b> <b>black</b> mace (reminiscent of Tolkien's descriptions as well as conceptual artist John Howe's illustrations of Morgoth); in this form, he is portrayed by Sala Baker. While Tolkien never specifically discussed the type of armour, Sauron is shown in spiky plate armour of very high quality: it has very ornate filigree but is also quite functional. In the DVD commentary, the production team explained their intent was to represent Sauron's great skill as a craftsman and ring-maker: [...] Sauron was originally a maia spirit in service to the smith-vala Aulë, and thus was very wise in the lore of physical construction. [...] Sauron may have fallen from his previously angelic state, but a shadow of his great skill in forging and construction remains, {{even though it has}} been twisted to making weapons of war. [...] Thus they chose to depict Sauron as wearing frightening, but very high quality and ornate armour of his own creation. Sauron's body disintegrates with explosive force after Isildur cuts off the Ring with the hilt-shard of the sword Narsil. Sauron's spiritual essence remained intact as it eventually consolidates into the Eye of Sauron by the time of Barad-dûr's restoration, stationing himself between the twin horn-like spires above the tower to scan Mordor like a searchlight. The effect in Mordor is seen as a red beam that moves across the land, forever probing. It also seems to be visible to Frodo (and to see him in turn) any time that he is wearing the Ring. Pippin has a brief encounter with the Eye, after gazing into the palantír of Orthanc. In the extended edition of The Return of the King, Sauron's humanoid form appears when Aragorn looks into the palantír. When the Ring is destroyed, the Eye of Sauron collapses in on itself, causing a massive shock wave that destroys his entire kingdom.|$|E

Finnigan, the Puka is a <b>huge</b> {{humanoid}} <b>black</b> horse, which shape-shifts into {{whatever its}} victims fear {{the most in}} order to scare them to death (with haunted house Halloween enthusiasts being {{the only ones to}} survive his attacks long enough to fight back by being just as scary).|$|R

60|$|His {{entrance}} {{had been}} unnoticed, and he bent his gaze upon the drinkers at the bar. Dark-clothed, dark-faced men they all were, burned by the sun, bow-legged as were most riders of the sage, but neither lean nor gaunt.

60|$|As Bostil dismounted, {{throwing}} the bridle to a rider, {{he saw a}} face that suddenly froze the thrilling delight of the moment.

For years he had prepared himself for {{the moment when he}} would {{come face to face with}} this noted horse-thief.|$|R

They are intolerant of evil, and will {{fight to the death}} rather than serve an evil master.|$|R
