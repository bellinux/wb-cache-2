6000|$|... "The {{creature}} of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I {{must be careful}} of you, my treasure: nerves like <b>yours</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> made for rough handling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now look here, Captain, {{though the}} thing is but begun at present, yet there is enough to show that one idea at least of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> feasible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} need to ask it," [...] replied Master de Cressi, [...] "and if you and that lean henchman of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> to blame, then say who is?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lau. Methinks <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> very hard, for a serving-man's. But where, in {{the name}} of wonder, have you learned to talk so courtly? You are a strange valet de chambre.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{imagine that}} this Derek of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{one of our}} leading sunbeams. Well, I suppose he could hardly be, if that's his mother and there is {{anything}} in heredity." ...|$|R
5000|$|A fat man, Heton was {{supposedly}} complimented {{by the king}} James I with the comment [...] "Fat men are apt to make lean sermons; but <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> lean, but larded with good learning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have become}} an enigma again. But <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the creed of a simpleton. You are playing with me--revealing your wisdom from beneath a veil of {{infantile}} guilelessness. I have no more to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What you too are {{beginning}} to suspect.... That other things may be conceivable even if they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> possible. That this life of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> everything. That it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> taken too seriously. Because ... there are better dreams!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "great {{fortunes}} {{even like}} <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> above {{the chances of}} the money-markets. Your fortune, or {{a great part of}} it, might go. What would happen to you then? You would be a pauper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My first German prisoner," [...] said Kurt, half seriously. [...] "Now, Miss Anderson, we must {{be doing}} things. We don't want to {{meet a lot of}} I.W.W.'s out here. My car is out of commission. I hope <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> broken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here are two hearts {{concerned}} in {{the affair}} already, {{and no one}} can foresee the consequences; but," [...] turning to Paul, [...] "describe, this miniature, if you please, for there are many in the vessel, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the only one that has been mislaid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Feemy, {{now just}} look at the matter this way, one moment: supposing now--only just for supposition--this lover of <b>yours</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the sort of man we all take him to be, and that he was to turn out false, or inconstant; suppose now it turned out he had another wife somewhere else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|And you, dark Senate of {{the public}} pen, [...] You may not, like yon tyrant, deal in spies. [...] Yours are the public acts of public men, [...] But <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> their {{household}} privacies. [...] I grant {{you one of the}} great Powers on earth, [...] But <b>be</b> <b>not</b> you the blatant traitors of the hearth.|$|R
6000|$|Said the prince, who {{despite all}} efforts could not entirely shake off his unhappy habit of being modest, [...] "Those very {{delicate}} hands of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fit to ply the pankha.[FN#64] Why {{do you take}} so much trouble? I am cool and refreshed {{by the sight of}} you. Do give the fan to me and sit down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear child, I do {{wish you}} would ever think to get any thing for yourself," [...] said Mrs. Ames. [...] "I cannot consent to use up all your earnings, as I have done lately, and all Ellen's too; {{you must have a}} new dress this spring, and that bonnet of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> decent any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} should {{conclude}} that, because Mr. Shiner wants a different music, he has any ill-feeling for you. I myself, I must own, prefer organ-music to any other. I consider it most proper, and feel justified in endeavouring to introduce it; but then, although other music is better, I don't say <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is useless," [...] {{he replied}} curtly. [...] "I am sorry for you. We all {{understand}} your feelings, that <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{the principles of}} the border. If you had lived long here you could appreciate what these outlaws and renegades have done to us. This man is a hardened criminal; he is a thief, a murderer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jean and Peter Stein," [...] said Henri. [...] "Why, Jacques, <b>are</b> they <b>not</b> {{friends of}} <b>yours?</b> <b>are</b> they <b>not</b> sons of Michael Stein, the smith?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} keeping our end up," [...] he said, [...] "in the {{legitimate}} branch of our profession. You needn't grin like that," [...] he added, a little irritably. [...] "There is a legitimate side, and a very wonderful side, only a brain like <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> capable of assimilating it. You should have heard my paper to-night upon self-directed mesmeric waves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} where the joke comes in," [...] she said, and took the Hoppers away to a distance, where the Horners could not hear them. [...] "You know," [...] she then explained, [...] "those neighbors of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> very bright, poor things, and {{what they think is}} a joke isn't a joke at all--it's true, don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Wife, we will try, {{though to}} see such high visions the spirit should be calm, which I fear <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> not--nay, <b>be</b> <b>not</b> angry. We will try, we will try. Sit here now, and gaze, and above all be silent while I say the {{appropriate}} spells." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you call}} this a nosegay?' said Elizabeth, 'I call it a forest of flowers. Really, a Consecration opens people's hearts;--I do <b>not</b> mean that <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> open enough on {{ordinary}} occasions, Aunt Anne; but when the children took their walk in the alms-house court this morning, they were loaded with flowers from all quarters, beginning with old Mr. Dillon offering Winifred his best variegated dahlia, by name Dod's Mary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|A cry of [...] "Shame!" [...] {{arose from}} the entire body of spectators; when it abated Rupert said, quietly but clearly, [...] "My prayers are said, Captain Muller. If <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> say them now, for assuredly I will kill you--not as a dog, for a dog is a true and {{faithful}} animal, but as I would kill a tiger, or any other beast whose existence was a scourge to mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, ha, ha!" [...] Mr. Jones {{let out a}} ghostly, squeaky laugh. [...] "I've {{never been}} placed in such a ridiculous {{position}} before," [...] he went on, with a sepulchral equanimity of tone. [...] "It's you, Martin, who dragged me into it. However, it's my own fault too. I ought to--but I was really too bored to use my brain, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> trusted. You are a hothead!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have that}} pleasure," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Mr. Maddison is a {{neighbor}} of <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> he <b>not?</b> I met him, you know, on a certain very melancholy occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Thus {{to lose a}} crown,” {{says the}} young prince, {{starting}} up, and speaking French in his eager way; “to lose the loveliest woman in the world; to lose the loyalty of such hearts as <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> this, my lords, enough of humiliation?—Marquis, if I go on my knees will you pardon me?—No, I can’t do that, but I can offer you reparation, that of honour, that of gentlemen. Favour me by crossing the sword with mine: <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> broke—see, yonder in the armoire are two;” and the prince took them out as eager as a boy, and held them towards Esmond:—“Ah! you will? Merci, monsieur, merci!” ...|$|R

5000|$|Good man, did {{it never}} {{occur to you}} - an {{intelligent}} and mature man - [...] "I too am subject to ageing, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> exempt from ageing: surely I had better do good by body, speech, and mind"? ...This evil action of <b>yours</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> done by your mother or your father, or by your brother or your sister, or by your friends and companions, or by your kinsmen and relatives, or by recluses and brahmins, or by gods: this evil action was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its result.|$|R
5000|$|The Resource Forum of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) held a {{symposium}} on [...] "The Creation of the Illegal State of Israel" [...] at Arewa House Kaduna on May 21, 2008. Zakzaky said, when Israel is celebrating sixty years of occupying Palestine's land, we are mourning because {{the truth is}} Israeli State is created {{on the basis of}} terrorism and what <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>yours,</b> no matter years of oppression and hostage it would slip someday along with those supporting them. Israel will fall with her allies certainly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you've made a mistake," [...] said Miss Wilson, {{handing him}} back his money. [...] "Here. If it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>yours,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> ours; {{so you had}} better keep it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{may be the}} stoutest of men hereabouts," [...] quoth Guy of Gisbourne, [...] "yet, I tell thee, fellow, this sty of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the wide}} world. I lay my life upon it I am the better man of the two. He an outlaw, forsooth! Why, I hear that he hath never let blood in all his life, saving {{when he first came}} to the forest. Some call him a great archer; marry, I would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> afraid to stand against him all the days of the year with a bow in my hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How I hoped {{you would}} begin, and how go on, I told {{you when we}} spoke of these things last," [...] said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and {{encouraging}} manner. [...] "You have not made that beginning yet, {{but there is a}} time for all things, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> gone by; rather, it is just now fully come. Make a clear beginning altogether. You two (very young, my dears) are cousins. As yet, you are nothing more. What more may come must come of being worked out, Rick, and no sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: [...] "Having, at {{his being}} in Rome, made {{acquaintance}} with a pleasant priest, who invited him, one evening, {{to hear their}} vesper music at church; the priest, seeing Sir Henry stand obscurely in a corner, sends to him by a boy of the choir this question, writ in {{a small piece of}} paper;--'Where was your religion to be found before Luther?'

6000|$|... "I {{have told}} the truth as I see it," [...] {{answered}} the poor astrologer with some dignity, [...] "but if you wish, O Prince, {{that in the future}} I should indeed prophesy pleasant things to you, why, it can be done easily enough. Moreover, {{it seems to me that}} this horoscope of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so evil, seeing that it gives to you over twenty years of life and power, more by far than most men can expect--at your age. If after that come troubles and the end, what of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{cried the}} Portuguese interpreter, in broken English; [...] "you have saved our lives!
