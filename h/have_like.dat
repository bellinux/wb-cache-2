5|$|Plant Hybridization is more commonplace {{compared}} to animal hybridization. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species <b>have</b> (<b>like</b> most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
25|$|The Syrah-dominated appellations (AOCs) of {{northern}} Rhône <b>have,</b> <b>like</b> most other French appellations and regions, no tradition of varietal labeling of their wines. Indeed, such practices are generally disallowed under AOC rules, {{and only the}} AOC name (such as Cote-Rotie, Crozes-Hermitage or Hermitage) appears on the label. Varietal labeling of Syrah/Shiraz wines is therefore a practice which has emerged in the New World, and primarily in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Canadian Crown and the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples of Canada stretches {{back to the first}} interactions between European colonialists and North American indigenous people. Over centuries of interaction, treaties were established, and Canada's First Nations <b>have,</b> <b>like</b> the Māori and the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand, come to generally view these agreements as being between them and the Crown of Canada, and not the ever-changing governments.|$|E

25|$|An {{enormous}} number of cultivars <b>have,</b> <b>like</b> the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.|$|E
25|$|The current Indian rock {{scene has}} a larger {{following}} than ever, (although {{it is still}} marginalized compared to Indian film music, particularly the filmi soundtracks of Bollywood) and may soon become recognized in the international arena, as various South American and Japanese bands have become. Recent entries into the rock music scene are increasingly becoming comparable in their production quality to Western bands, and have been compared favorably to other internationally recognized acts. Now digital technology is making it easier than ever for these bands to distribute and sell their music. Some British bands of South Asian origin, such as Swami <b>have,</b> <b>like</b> their hip-hop counterparts, tried to enter the Indian market in addition to maintaining the traditional fanbase of non-resident Indians in United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. Others, such as Rudra, have emerged from Indian communities in other Asian countries. Progress is certain for the Indian rock scene {{with the advent of}} entities that support this genre. Rock Street Journal and Rolling Stone India are the two major publications that have been promoting Indian rock bands. The scene has also been transformed by the online medium, and the subsequent rise of a number of online portals promoting Indian rock, most notably the indie music website NH7, Headbangers India, IndianMusicMug, Unholy Maunder, IndianMusicRevolution, Indian Metal Scene etc. and Metal Spree.|$|E

Ritchson wanted {{to live up to}} the expectations he felt fans of the character would <b>have.</b> <b>Like</b> Gallner, Ritchson did not expect to be a part of the show again. After season five, there was an attempt to launch an Aquaman television series, which ultimately was never picked up.

The knee injury was not viewed as a problem, and he was scheduled to begin breeding mares soon after arriving at the farm, starting about February 14. [...] Mark Taylor quipped, [...] "He's going to <b>have</b> <b>like</b> two weeks to go from the playing field to the penthouse."

500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to <b>have,</b> <b>like</b> in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E

500|$|The tenth track, [...] "White Christmas", was {{the first}} song to be {{recorded}} for Wrapped in Red. A cover of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] follows up as the eleventh track. Clarkson opted for the Broadway performance of the song to stray away from Julie Andrews' version, citing: [...] "I think you shouldn't go near anywhere of what she's doing because she's so good." [...] Clarkson and Kurstin co-wrote [...] "4 Carats" [...] with Cathy Dennis and Livvi Franc. Originally written as a pop song, they converted it into a Christmas song to fit the album's theme, describing it as a crossover between Eartha Kitt's [...] "Santa Baby" [...] (1953) and Madonna's [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1984). A rendition of Imogen Heap's [...] "Just for Now" [...] was described by Clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment, saying: [...] "Can we just stop for like five minutes and <b>have</b> <b>like</b> a normal Christmas setting?" [...] The song begins by sampling the melody of the Christmas tune [...] "Carol of the Bells". The closing track, a rendition of the traditional carol [...] "Silent Night", features McEntire and Trisha Yearwood and ends in an a cappella setting between the trio. In addition, two tracks were {{also included in the}} deluxe edition of the album: the first, Clarkson's cover of [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas" [...] from her iTunes Session extended play, and the second, her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn [...] "Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel".|$|E

2500|$|Boas's {{rejection}} of Morgan's theories led him, in an 1887 article, to challenge Mason's principles of museum display. At stake, however, were more basic issues of causality and classification. The evolutionary approach to material culture led museum curators to organize objects on display according to function or level of technological development. Curators assumed {{that changes in}} the forms of artefacts reflect some natural process of progressive evolution. Boas, however, felt that the form an artefact took reflected {{the circumstances under which}} it was produced and used. Arguing that [...] "hough like causes <b>have</b> <b>like</b> effects, like effects have not like causes", Boas realized that even artefacts that were similar in form might have developed in very different contexts, for different reasons. Mason's museum displays, organized along evolutionary lines, mistakenly juxtapose like effects; those organized along contextual lines would reveal like causes.|$|E
2500|$|In Bach's typical {{format of}} the chorale cantata cycle, {{the text of the}} first and the last stanza is {{retained}} unchanged, while an unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas, in this case to three movements, two arias framing a recitative. According to Wolff, the librettist may have been Andreas Stübel, writing already in 1724/25. The theme of the chorale is connected to the gospel in a general way: our life depends on God's help and is lost without it. A connection is also provided by the image of flooding water that the psalm conveys, which begins [...] "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side" [...] (...) , and continues [...] "then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul, then the proud waters had gone over our soul" [...] (...) [...] The poet paraphrased it in the central recitative to [...] "" [...] ("Their fury would <b>have,</b> <b>like</b> a raging tide and like a foaming wave, flooded over us").|$|E
2500|$|The third {{criticism}} that Hume offers {{is that even}} if the argument did give evidence for a designer; it still gives no evidence for the traditional 'omnipotent', 'benevolent' (all-powerful and all-loving) God of traditional Christian theism. One of the main assumptions of Paley's argument is that 'like effects <b>have</b> <b>like</b> causes'; or that machines (like the watch) and the universe have similar features of design and so both also have the same cause of their existence: they must both have an intelligent designer. However, Hume points out that what Paley does not comprehend is to what extent 'like causes' extend: how similar the creation of a universe is {{to the creation of a}} watch. Instead, Paley moves straight to the conclusion that this designer of the universe is the 'God' he believes in of traditional Christianity. Hume, however takes the idea of 'like causes' and points out some potential absurdities in how far the 'likeness' of these causes could extend to if the argument were taken further as to explain this. One example that he uses is how a machine or a watch is usually designed by a whole team of people rather than just one person. Surely, if we are analogizing the two in this way, it would point to there being a group of gods who created the universe, not just a single being. Another example he uses is that complex machines are usually the result of many years of trial and error with every new machine being an improved version of the last. Also by analogy of the two, would that not hint that the universe could also have been just one of many of God's 'trials' and that there are much better universes out there? However, if that were taken to be true, surely the 'creator' of it all would not be 'all loving' and 'all powerful' if they had to carry out the process of 'trial and error' when creating the universe? ...|$|E
