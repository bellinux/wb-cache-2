2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, after the revolution, little had changed. The career path for most artisans still involved apprenticeship under a master, followed by moving into independent production. [...] However, {{over the course of the}} Industrial Revolution, this model rapidly changed, particularly in the major metropolitan areas. For instance, in Boston in 1790, the vast majority of the 1,300 artisans in the city described themselves as [...] "master workman". By 1815, journeymen workers without independent means of production had displaced these [...] "masters" [...] as the majority. By that time journeymen also outnumbered masters in New York City and Philadelphia. This shift occurred as a result of large-scale transatlantic and rural-urban migration. Migration into the coastal cities created a larger population of potential laborers, which in turn allowed controllers of capital to invest in labor-intensive enterprises on a larger scale. Craft workers found that these changes launched them into competition with each other to a degree that they had not experienced previously, which limited their opportunities and created substantial risks of <b>downward</b> <b>mobility</b> that had not existed prior to that time.|$|E

50|$|The {{first is}} the {{conventional}} upward trajectory toward assimilation. The second is a process called selective acculturation, in which some groups try to inspire achievement in their children by referencing the traditional values of the home country, such as a dedication to education.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that social, educational, cultural and physical factors in childhood and early adulthood may influence the chances and direction of social mobility, the movement of an individual between social classes over his/her life-course. This study examined the association of such factors with intra-generational and inter-generational social mobility within the Newcastle Thousand Families 1947 birth cohort. Methods: Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the potential association of sex, housing conditions at age 5 years, childhood IQ, achieved education level, adult height and adverse events in early childhood with upward and <b>downward</b> social <b>mobility.</b> Results: Childhood IQ and achieved education level were significantly and independently associated with upward mobility between the ages of 5 and 49 - 51 years.

5000|$|The sonnet {{does make}} an {{intriguing}} reference to Astrophel and Stella: in line 13 of the Petrarchan sonnet, Wroth writes, [...] "…Sir God, your boyship I despise". The phrase [...] "Sir God" [...] {{is linked to}} the late 16th century poem, Astrophel and Stella. Sidney's Astrophel is referred to as [...] "Sir Foole". According to Catherine Bates, Astrophel contracts similar difficulty as he, [...] "is not only overmastered, the willing victim of a superior power, he is also emasculated". Perpetuating the gender roles of the time, Bates argues that Sidney paints Astrophel, a boy, as feminine. Wroth includes traces of Astrophel and Stella to provide ties to previous gender inequality. Astrophel only experiences the struggle between coercion, [...] "overmastered", and consent, [...] "willing", because he is cast as feminine. Bates's understanding of <b>downward</b> <b>mobility</b> in social status by moving from male to female through Sydney's Astrophel and Stella is strongly supported by Bernadette Andrea's analysis of social norms. Wroth's echo of Sydney's work is to address the gender issues from a new voice: the female perspective.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} exists an {{employment}} penalty from motherhood in Spain. In particular, {{we are interested}} in transitions from employment to non-employment and <b>downward</b> occupational <b>mobility.</b> Results show that Spanish women experience significant transitions from employment to non-employment after first birth and these shifts are strongly linked to pre-birth job features and education. We find that around 40 % of Spanish women who were at work one year before childbearing are not in employment one year after. Our analysis reveals that one third of them are unemployed nine months later. Longer follow-up shows that most of those who exit from employment remain out of work permanently. We find that fixed-term contracts (i. e. labour market uncertainty) impacts negatively on the likelihood of re-entry. On the other hand, accumulated human capital (experience and higher level of education) increases the probability of staying at work. There is evidence of differences between cohorts. Whereas in young cohorts exit is exclusively linked to childbearing, in old cohorts leaving employment is already initiated at marriage. For those Spanish women returning to work after confinement, <b>downward</b> occupational <b>mobility</b> is not common {{due to the lack of}} part-time jobs...|$|R
