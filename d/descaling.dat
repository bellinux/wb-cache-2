5|$|With major {{production}} {{starting in}} the Industrial Revolution, hydrochloric acid {{is used in the}} chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, and MDI/TDI for polyurethane. It has numerous smaller-scale applications, including household cleaning, production of gelatin and other food additives, <b>descaling,</b> and leather processing. About 20 million tonnes of hydrochloric acid are produced worldwide annually. It is also found naturally in gastric acid.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{are added}} to mass {{finishing}} processes to assist in deburring, burnishing, cutting, cleaning, <b>descaling,</b> and inhibiting corrosion. They may be liquids or dry powders.

25|$|Cleansing and polishing: Walnut shells {{are mostly}} used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This {{environmentally}} friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive {{is well suited}} for air blasting, deburring, <b>descaling,</b> and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In {{the early days of}} jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used to scour the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with air cooled vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1997 During May-June, 1995 and 1996, outmigrating chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, and chinook salmon, O. tschawytscha, were {{captured}} in the Chena River near the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project. Fish condition was determined through the investigation of physical injury and scale loss. Except for one sample, the proportion of injured fish was never greater than 7 % for chum or chinook salmon. Few injuries were severe. The proportion of chinook salmon with scale loss ranged from 1 - 33 %, {{most of which were}} only partially <b>descaled.</b> When significant length differences existed, injured, <b>descaled,</b> and partially <b>descaled</b> fish were always larger than non-injured and non-descaled fish. Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) diet by weight consisted of chum salmon (2 %), invertebrates (89 %), other fish (3 %), and miscellaneous material (6 %). Plasma cortisol levels were used as an indicator of the primary stress response of chinook salmon and did not indicate any unusual physiological stress level...|$|R
500|$|Acetic acid is {{the second}} {{simplest}} carboxylic acid (after formic acid). [...] It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily {{in the production of}} cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in <b>descaling</b> agents. In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. As a food additive it is approved for usage in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.|$|E
500|$|The castle's {{state was}} {{assessed}} in 1961, {{and the cost}} of repairs estimated at £30,000 (equivalent to £1.1million in 2009 terms). The Ministry of Public Building and Works took over care of the castle from the Corporation of Rochester in 1965. Records of the Ministry's conservation work have gone missing, so precisely what was done is unclear. Between 1962 and 1965 the council removed buildings from the castle's ditch. Guardianship transferred to English Heritage in 1984. Since 1995 the City of Rochester has been responsible for daily management of the castle. <b>Descaling</b> {{at the start of the}} 21stcentury contributed to the decay of the keep, and one of the mural towers was in need of maintenance. Due to the decayed state of the keep, public access is restricted and netting has been erected to protect visitors. The possibility of adding floors and a roof to the keep was discussed in the 1970s and 1990s, but there were concerns that a roof would change the climate within the building. The castle is a Scheduled Monument, a [...] "nationally important" [...] historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a GradeI listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. The castle is open to the public.|$|E

50|$|Pickling is a metal surface {{treatment}} used to remove impurities, such as stains, inorganic contaminants, rust or scale from ferrous metals, copper, precious metals and aluminum alloys. A solution called pickle liquor, which contains strong acids, {{is used to}} remove the surface impurities. It is commonly used to <b>descale</b> or clean steel in various steelmaking processes.|$|R
50|$|Sedimentation is the {{accumulation}} within the water reservoir of natural minerals {{that exist in}} trace amounts in municipal water mains, mainly calcium carbonate. Heating the water causes the minerals to separate and fall {{to the bottom of}} the reservoir. This buildup can eventually create a variety of noises in gas boilers, reduce the efficiency of the unit and give rise to a sulfur (or rotten-egg) smell. Vinegar has been used to <b>descale</b> electric kettles.|$|R

This was then sewn or skewered to close the aperture and boiled in seawater. The cooked dish would then be served with potatoes or other root vegetables in season.|$|R
2500|$|Solutions {{of strong}} (HCl), {{moderately}} strong (sulfamic) or weak (acetic, citric, sorbic, lactic, phosphoric) acids are commercially available.

2500|$|The {{process begins}} with a <b>descaling</b> and {{removing}} soil from the workpiece. This {{can be done in}} the tumbler or in a separate cleaning system. After cleaning, the parts are prepared by combining them with water, medium, and a surface conditioner. The surface conditioner [...] lightly coats the workpiece in copper, while the medium removes any residual mill scale or oxides. Finally, accelerators, promoters and metal powder are added to the mix. The accelerators and promoters provide the proper chemical environment for the plating to occur, such as the maintenance of a pH level of 1 to 2 to prevent oxidation and promote adhesion. The medium that is already in the mixture cold welds the metal powder to the workpiece through impacts that are induced by the tumbling action of the tumbler. At this point the surface finish is typically matte to a semi-bright finish, however the finish can be improved with a water polish. The time required for the above process is approximately 50minutes.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>descaling</b> {{agent or}} {{chemical}} descaler is a chemical substance used to remove limescale from metal surfaces {{in contact with}} hot water, such as in [...] boilers, water heaters, and [...] kettles. [...] <b>Descaling</b> agents are typically acidic compounds such as hydrochloric acid that react with the alkaline carbonate compounds present in the scale, producing carbon dioxide gas and a soluble salt. [...] Strongly acidic <b>descaling</b> agents are often corrosive to the eyes and skin.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{morphological}} variation and basking posture on thermal characteristics in the speckled wood butter ̄y Pararge aegeria (L.). The process of heating and cooling in relation to wing type (<b>descaled,</b> darkened and original wing colour) and size was examined using dummies (i. e. dried butter ̄ies). Size (measured as wing length) and ambient temperature have a joint in ̄uence on body temperature: large butter ̄ies heat up more slowly than small ones, but with increasing ambient temperature the difference with size became smaller and even changed since large individuals heated up faster under warm ambient conditions. Surprisingly, darkening wings had no overall effect on thermal characteristics, but this may be an artefact of the manipulation as supported {{by the results of}} the absorption measurements. Normal butter ̄ies reached a higher equilibrium thoracic temperature than <b>descaled</b> butter ̄ies probably because wings without scales absorb less radiation. Finally, butter ̄ies with fully spread wings reached higher thoracic temperature and had faster cooling rates compared to butter ̄ies with half-opened wings. Implications of the results for the relation between morphology and behaviour of speckled wood butter ̄ies in their natural habitat are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Effectivness was {{evaluated}} of the Dryden Fish Screening Facility in the Wenatchee Reclamation District Canal near Dryden in north central Washington State. In situ {{tests were conducted}} by releasing groups of hatchery reared salmonids of different ages and sizes. Spring chinook salmon smolts (110 - 165 mm) were not injured or <b>descaled</b> in passing through the canal forebay. Smolts were not delayed as they migrated in the canal. Most fish released at the canal headworks exited the screening facility in 99 % of the test fish captured in the fish bypass in < 24 h. Steelhead subyearlings 65 - 125 mm were not injured or <b>descaled</b> in traveling through the bypass flume and fish return pipe. Average time for steelhead subyearlings to travel through thebypass structure was 70 seconds. Small rainbow trout fry 23 - 27 mm could pass through the 0. 125 -in. profile bar screen openings and were entrained in the irrigation canal; about 38 % was lost to the canal within 48 h of release. Some fry stayed in the forebay and did not migrate during the tests. Wild chinook fry 36 - 42 mm were also entrained. Estimated 34 % of emergent wild chinook salmon fry passed through the profile bar screens and were entrained in the canal. Approach velocity at the Dryden screens was {ge} 0. 4 ft/s; low velocities through the first two screen panels indicated that vertical louvers installed behind each screen panel to balance flow were not totally effective...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{removing}} cuticle in human hair treated with potassium hydroxide solution in 1 -butanol has been investigated. The morphological {{changes in the}} cuticle and surface of the cuticle-removed cortex were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When human hair was treated with dehydrated 5 % KOH/ 1 -butanol at 50 øC, {{the boundary between the}} exo- and endocuticles in a few outer layers became obscure at first, and the thickness of a layer decreased with the simultaneous dissolution of the outermost layer. The obscurity of boundary was also observed even in the inner layers with the thickness kept unchanged. The dissolution proceeded from the outer to inner cuticle layer successively, with the complete disappearance of the boundary between exo- and endocuticles in the inner layer. The surface of the untreated and <b>descaled</b> hair was examined by means of FT-IR in diffuse reflectance measurements. FT-IR microspectroscopy was also employed to measure inside the cortical cells. The appreciable changes in spectrum were observed for the surface of the <b>descaled</b> hair in the region from 1000 cm- • to 1100 cm-•. There was no change in the spectrum inside the cortex. These findings indicated that longer treatment with KOH/ 1 -butanol led to some modification of disulfide and SH groups {{on the surface of the}} cortex, but that it did not penetrate deeply into the cortex...|$|R
25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} {{is used to}} burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, <b>descale,</b> remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off die cast runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel {{is filled with the}} parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the study of a new {{aluminum}} brazing process, called Galluminium. This technique, consisting in using gallium as a solder, is advantageous since it enables to braze at ambient air without flux. Indeed if the gallium coating is done mechanically, it <b>descales</b> the alumina layer and acts as a barrier against further reoxidation. Nevertheless, liquid gallium causes a severe aluminum embrittlement since it penetrates into the aluminum grain boundaries. We will show in this paper that this phenomenon has only a little impact on the mechanical resistance of the brazed joints since the amount of deposited gallium is enough low to avoid a severe embrittlement and the heat treatment (from 200 degrees C to 600 degrees C during several minutes) during brazing process dissolves gallium in the bulk...|$|R
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, <b>descale,</b> remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|R
