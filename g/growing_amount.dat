5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw {{an increasing number of}} excavations of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E

25|$|In the 9th century, East Francia, the First Bulgarian Empire and Great Moravia {{ruled the}} {{territory}} of the Carpathian Basin. The land was inhabited mainly by Avars. The Magyars advancing through the Carpathian Basin encountered the Hungarian-speaking Székely people who inhabited the land at that time. Both contemporary sources and a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of archaeological evidence suggests that groups of the Avars survived the disintegration of their empire.|$|E

25|$|Logie (1995) {{proposed}} that the visuo-spatial sketchpad is broken down into two subcomponents, one visual and one spatial. These are the visual cache and the inner scribe, respectively. The visual cache is a temporary visual store including such dimensions as colour and shape. Conversely, the inner scribe is a rehearsal mechanism for visual information and is responsible for information concerning movement sequences. Although {{a general lack of}} consensus regarding this distinction has been noted in the literature, there is a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of evidence that the two components are separate and serve different functions.|$|E
25|$|From the 11th to 13th centuries, {{the number}} of exam {{candidates}} participating in taking the exams increased dramatically from merely 30,000 to 400,000 by the dynasty's end. Widespread printing through woodblock and movable type enhanced the spread of knowledge amongst the literate in society, enabling more people to become candidates and competitors vying for a prestigious degree. With a dramatically expanding population matching a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of gentry, scholar-officials needed the gentry to perform local services such as funding public works, prefectural and county schools, or aiding in tax collection.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} Bonatti was accused and vilified by {{a part of the}} {{climbing}} community but over time the <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of evidence in support of his version of the facts proved his honesty. Reinhold Messner, in June 2010, said: Bonatti {{was one of the greatest}} climbers of all time – the last true Alpinist, an expert in all disciplines. But more importantly Walter was a marvellous, tolerant, loving person. He leaves a great spiritual testament: he was a clean man vilified for 50 years over what happened on K2, but in the end everyone accepted that he was right.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained. Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang, several studies have shown that straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people. In the 2000s, there was a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of tolerance of people who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals. In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to metalcore to posicore. Straight edge bands from the 2000s include Champion, Down to Nothing, Embrace Today, Have Heart, and Throwdown.|$|E
25|$|The next {{generation}} of SNP annotation webservers {{can take advantage of}} the <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of data in core bioinformatics resources and use intelligent agents to fetch data from different sources as needed. From a user’s point of view, it is more efficient to submit a set of SNPs and receive results in a single step, which makes meta-servers the most attractive choice. However, if SNP annotation tools deliver heterogeneous data covering sequence, structure, regulation, pathways, etc., they must also provide frameworks for integrating data into a decision algorithm(s), and quantitative confidence measures so users can assess which data are relevant and which are not.|$|E
25|$|The posthumous second series, {{edited by}} Jeanne de Salzmann is titled Meetings with Remarkable Men(1963) and {{is written in}} a {{seemingly}} accessible manner as a memoir of his early years, but also contains some 'Arabian Nights' embellishments and allegorical statements. His posthumous Third Series, written as if unfinished and also edited by Jeanne de Salzmann (Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am') contains an intimate account of Gurdjieff's inner struggles during his later years, as well as transcripts {{of some of his}} lectures. There is an enormous and <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> written about Gurdjieff's ideas and methods but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{files were}} {{distributed}} by point-to-point technology: {{with a central}} uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, {{a large number of}} downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the more downloaders the faster the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of warez.|$|E
25|$|The Shadow {{has been}} adapted for the comics {{several times during}} his long history; his first comics {{appearance}} was on June 17, 1940 as a syndicated daily newspaper comic strip offered through the Ledger Syndicate. The strip's story continuity was written by Walter B. Gibson, with plot lines adapted from the Shadow pulps, and the strip was illustrated by Vernon Greene. Due to pulp paper shortages during World War II and the <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of space required for war news from both the European and Pacific fronts, the strip was canceled on June 13, 1942, after two years and nine adventures had been published. The Shadow daily was collected decades later in two comic book series from two different publishers (see below), first in 1988 and then in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{equivalent}} for {{sparkling wine}} is ’pezsgő’. The beginning of significant sparkling wine production in Hungary is dated {{back to the}} first half of the 19th century. The first wineries of sparkling wine were founded near Pozsony (today Bratislava) by Johann Fischer and dr. Michael Schönbauer in 1825 (first in Central-Europe) and Esch és Társa in 1835. A couple of decades later the main producers moved to the Buda Hills and Budafok nearby the capital creating a new center of production, the so-called ’Hungarian Champagne’ still existing nowadays. At the end of the 19th century the two most important wineries were József Törley és Társa moving from Reims, France to Budafok in 1882 and Louis és César-François founded in 1886. After the Soviet era the Hungarian wine sector was reborn. New and old wineries are seeking for the forgotten roots. Most of the Hungarian sparkling wines are made by the charmat and transvasée methods and a small but steadily <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> by the traditional, champagneois method. The sorts of grape used during production can be international like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Riesling, Muscat Ottonel, Muscat Lunel or natives like Olaszrizling, Kékfrankos, Furmint, Királyleányka, Hárslevelű, Kéknyelű and Juhfark.|$|E

50|$|De Duve {{proposed}} that peroxisomes {{may have been}} the first endosymbionts, which allowed cells to withstand the <b>growing</b> <b>amounts</b> of free molecular oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. Since peroxisomes have no DNA of their own, this proposal has much less evidence than the similar claims for mitochondria and chloroplasts. His later years were mostly devoted to origin of life studies, which he admitted as still a speculative field (see thioester).|$|R
25|$|Although a Confucian, the Hongwu Emperor {{had a deep}} {{distrust}} for the scholar-officials of the gentry {{class and}} was not afraid to have them beaten in court for offenses. In favor of Confucian learning and the civil service, the emperor ordered every county magistrate to open a Confucian school in 1369—following the tradition of a nationwide school system first established by Emperor Ping of Han (9 BC–5 AD). However, he halted the civil service examinations in 1373 after complaining that the 120 scholar-officials who obtained a jinshi degree were incompetent ministers. After the examinations were reinstated in 1384, he had the chief examiner executed after {{it was discovered that}} he allowed only candidates from the south to be granted jinshi degrees. In 1380, the Hongwu Emperor had the Chancellor Hu Weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him; after that the emperor abolished the Chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor. With a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of suspicion for his ministers and subjects, the Hongwu Emperor established the Jinyiwei, a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard. They were partly responsible for the loss of 100,000 lives in several major purges over three decades of his rule.|$|E

50|$|Inland Revenue {{has been}} criticised for what {{are seen as}} heavy handed tactics when forcing payment from debtors, {{specifically}} those owing tax arrears and child support payments, and for charging excessive penalties on debts which result in debtors falling into a cycle whereby {{they are unable to}} pay the <b>growing</b> <b>amounts</b> they owe.

He again began considering leaving the music industry, feeling as if he had already [...] "reached the finish line". Despite reassurances from Yanti that many singers continue to perform into their sixties, Chrisye observed that increasing numbers of established acts were being pushed aside by newcomers. While in this state of despair, Chrisye was approached by Jay Subyakto and Gauri Nasution, who offered him a solo concert at the Plenary Hall of the Jakarta Convention Centre, which had never before hosted a solo concert by an Indonesian artist. Unconvinced he had sufficient fans to fill the hall, Chrisye initially refused.|$|E
500|$|The network soon {{changed hands}} again: in September 1958, it was {{acquired}} by the Scranton Corporation. Scranton was {{under the control of}} the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a <b>growing</b> <b>amount</b> of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire radio industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire season—but there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known in the industry as [...] "sustaining" [...] shows. The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the [...] "mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks." ...|$|E
