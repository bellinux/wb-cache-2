50|$|Cabela's Dangerous Hunts is a first-person shooter {{in which}} the player <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>hunting</b> trips. The game {{features}} several game modes, such as Career Mode, which allows the player to create a profile and then customize their stats, age, and appearance. During hunts, there are penalties for killing non-game animals, which will result in failing. Terrain is another thing the player must pay attention to. Falling into deep streams or off of high ledges can result in an injury and failing the hunt. Aggressive animals such as bear, cape buffalo, and leopard will attack the player, which too results in injury and failure. The player also has an energy limit. After a while of hunting, the player will become tired and need to slow down. This effect can be reduced by carrying lighter equipment and conserving energy.|$|E
50|$|Set {{in modern}} Trinidad, Valmiki's Daughter is {{centered}} around the Krishnu family, which consists of Valmiki, Viveka, Vashti, and Devika. The husband, Valmiki, is a closeted gay doctor in an unaccepting environment. He learns about this part of his identity when, while attending school in England, he becomes involved {{in a relationship with}} an upper classmate named Tony. However, his guilt about his own sexuality persuades him to pursue a life of marrying Devika rather than staying with Tony whom he truly loves. However, despite his discomfort with his homosexuality, he still <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>hunting</b> trips to liaise with his lover, Saul. After each trip, he brings birds back to his family as a gift. Throughout the book, Mootoo illustrates that Valmiki's relationship with his wife is much more platonic than his sexual relations with Saul. Valmiki is not willing to come out because he is a well-respected doctor amongst his peers, {{and it would be a}} humiliating experience that would cost him his reputation.|$|E

When Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes asks information of Ethan for a census, Ethan lies, saying his last name is [...] "Rom" [...] and that he is from Ontario.

Ethan finds the survivors' leader, Jack Shephard, following him and beats him up. He warns Jack that he will kill either Claire or Charlie if Jack continues to follow him.
