5000|$|The Chilean tinamou is {{approximately}} 29 cm in length. It is almost tail-less and is stocky in shape. It has {{a bill that}} is curved and similar to the California quail. It has thick, short, pale, yellowish legs. It generally walks upright and has [...] "short tail and tail coverts drooping behind legs." [...] The pattern on its upper body looks striped, but is more complex in detail. It has a buffy face with a dark eyeline that is drooping and a small strip on its cheek, with a lighter colored crown. Its neck is brown and its lower neck has dark spots. It has a complex patterns that streak {{on the side of}} the chest, which is <b>grey.</b> The Chilean <b>tinamou,</b> just south of the Maule Region, has a brownish chest instead of a grey chest and more and reddish brown stripes on its upperbody and buttocks. For both regions, it has large wings that cover the body when on ground, and when flying the wings appear large and reddish brown underneath. The wings are also rounded.|$|R
5000|$|The black tinamou is {{a stocky}} {{terrestrial}} bird {{with a short}} tail and rounded wings. It is comparatively larger than other tinamous and tends to be about 40 to(-) 46 cm long, with females being a little larger than males. A male black tinamou has an average wingspan of about 234 to(-) 248 mm, and a female black tinamou has an average wingspan of 239 to(-) 256 mm. While {{there is no record}} of the average mass of a black tinamou, a male specimen weighing 1285 g has been examined at the Field Museum of Natural History. It is primarily slate grey, rather than truly black as its name would imply. The upperparts of an adult black tinamou are a uniform grey, while its midsection and greater wing coverts are sometimes edged with brown. Its lower breasts and flanks are a sooty brown color, as well as its belly. It has a rufescent vent, {{which may or may not}} have black speckling, depending on the subspecies. Its maxilla is black, and its mandible is a light <b>grey.</b> The black <b>tinamou</b> has blue-grey legs and dark brown eyes. An adolescent black tinamou is similar in color, but with whitish spots on the coverts of its wings. Black tinamou chicks generally have a light brown head with a broad, cinnamon-brown stripe extending from the crest of their heads to the napes of their necks. They have whitish throats and chins. Their neck, upper back and upper breast are a dusty brown. A black tinamou chick's lower back and rump is a dirty buff color, and its lower breast and belly range from dusky brown to pale brown.|$|R

They differ physiologically by having their {{nostrils}} halfway down their bill or more. They {{range in size from}} the largest, being the <b>grey</b> <b>tinamou</b> at 49 cm and the solitary tinamou at 1800 g, which are also the largest of all the tinamous, to the little tinamou at 21.5 - 24 cm and 174 - 238 g and the small-billed tinamou at 20 - 32 cm and 154 - 250 g.|$|E
