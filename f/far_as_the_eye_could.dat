He and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during Iniki's passage.

[...] Spielberg included footage of Iniki battering the Kaua'i coastal walls as part of the completed film, where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot. Members of the film's crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads.|$|E
500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E

[...] As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach, not a bush or tree, a twig or stone, not an object of any kind or a living thing, was in sight.

I wondered, [...] "this is [...] a concentration camp"? ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1839, {{the numbers}} of mustangs in Texas had been {{augmented}} by animals abandoned by Mexican settlers who had been ordered to leave the Nueces Strip [...] Ulysses Grant, in his memoir, recalled seeing in 1846 an immense herd between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers in Texas. [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach to our right, the herd extended. To the left, it extended equally. [...] There was no estimating the number of animals in it; I {{have no idea that}} they could all have been corralled in the state of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time." [...] When the area was finally ceded to the U.S. in 1848, these horses and others in the surrounding areas were rounded up and trailed north and east, resulting in the near elimination of mustangs in that area by 1860.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison {{authorized}} {{the opening of}} [...] of unoccupied lands in the Oklahoma territory acquired from the native tribes. On April 22, over 100,000 settlers and cattlemen (known as [...] "boomers") lined up at the border, and with the army's guns and bugles giving the signal, began a mad dash into the newly opened land to stake their claims (Land Run of 1889). A witness wrote, [...] "The horsemen had {{the best of it}} from the start. It was a fine race for a few minutes, but soon the riders began to spread out like a fan, {{and by the time they}} reached the horizon they were scattered about as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see".

As the convoy approached Malta, the ships came under assault by Ju 88s, in an action which Hill himself described to be as [...] "a mother and father of an attack". The freighter SS Waimarama, which was transporting fuel in drums on her upper deck, suffered a direct hit by a stick of bombs, blowing up in an inferno which engulfed surrounding ships and survivors alike. The flames blazed hundreds of feet in the air, and the Mediterranean was aflame [...] "as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see". As Italian aircraft dropped circling torpedoes into the water, Hill led the Ledbury into the surrounding inferno, where the destroyer's complement went over the ship's side with ropes to pick up survivors from the explosion. The intensity of the heat, {{and the amount of}} flames around the destroyer was so immense that as Hill leant over the side of his ship, he held on to his beard [...] "to prevent it catching fire".|$|E

2500|$|In July, {{continuing}} {{south in}} clear weather, Barkley found {{the entrance to}} the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He did not explore it, but gave it its present name honouring Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca claimed to have discovered and sailed up a large strait at this location in 1592. Barkley thought the strait he found matched the description Juan de Fuca had given and that it was in fact Juan de Fuca's strait. The veracity of Juan de Fuca's claim had long been scoffed at by geographers and is doubted by most historians to the present day. Captain Barkley was probably the first non-indigenous person to find the strait. He was surprised to find it at all because Captain James Cook had previously explored the area and not seen it. Cook had emphatically stated that Juan de Fuca's strait did not exist. Frances Barkley wrote about the discovery in her diary: [...] "In the afternoon, to our great astonishment, we arrived off a large opening extending to the eastward, the entrance of which appeared to be about four leagues wide, and remained about that width as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see, with a clear easterly horizon, which my husband immediately recognized as the long lost strait of Juan de Fuca, and to which he gave the name of the original discoverer, my husband placing it on his chart." [...] Barkley perhaps thought Tatoosh Island was the pinnacle reported by Juan de Fuca as located at {{the entrance to the}} strait. Fellow fur-trader Charles Duncan, who learned about the strait from Barkley, assumed the island was Juan de Fuca's pillar.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from {{creating}} the effects for Clark’s powers, Entity FX {{also has the}} responsibility of dressing up the backgrounds of location shoots. For instance, in a flashback sequence from [...] "Lineage", where Lionel finds his son {{in a field of}} flattened corn, Entity FX had to step in and adjust the scene based on executive producer Ken Horton’s request. The script called for [...] "corn flattened as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see", but Horton wanted a defined stopping point for all the destruction; a wall of corn was digitally erected surrounding the area of trammeled corn stalks. For the final shot of the season finale, where Clark is on a motorcycle heading toward Metropolis, Entity FX had to remove the forests and mountains that occupy the Vancouver landscape and digitally insert hills, extend the road into the distance and create a digital version of Metropolis in the background. In the episode [...] "Insurgence", during the moment when Clark is about to make his leap from the Daily Planet to LuthorCorp, the camera pans around the Daily Planet globe revealing Metropolis in its reflection before shifting down to the roof as Clark walks out. Entity FX created the image of Metropolis by using a computer to combine CG buildings, matte paintings, and real elements from the Vancouver streets. The company also took over the rest of the visual elements for the shot of Clark's actual leap. After Welling was shot on a green screen performing the leap from the Daily Planet, Entity FX performed their usual slowing and quickening of the timing elements, to give the effect of Clark’s speed, as well as added a reflected version of Clark in the LuthorCorp building to illustrate Clark’s impending crash through the glass.|$|E
