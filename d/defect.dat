The deficiencies of existing classifications of software <b>defects</b> are analyzed. And a classification for air on-board software code <b>defects</b> is presented. This classification is verified and completed by investigating the historical code <b>defects</b> of air on-board software. The revised classification has covered selected historical <b>defects</b> perfectly. The results of verification show that the revised classification of code <b>defects</b> can guide <b>defects</b> management effectively.

Methods: Population-based case–control study of 418 controls, 111 cases with heart <b>defects</b> (and of these, 38 had conotruncal heart <b>defects),</b> 27 with neural tube <b>defects,</b> 86 cases with urinary tract <b>defects,</b> 48 cases with orofacial clefts, and 20 with limb reduction <b>defects.</b> Maternal pre-pregnancy weight and height were self-reported.

40|$|AbstractA new {{general theory}} of <b>defects</b> in {{continuous}} media is introduced. The general mechanisms of generation and healing of <b>defects</b> are established. The kinematic description of continuum media with <b>defects</b> is presented. The definition of <b>defects</b> of different levels is given, and the classification of continuous media with <b>defects</b> is introduced. The hierarchic structure {{of the theory of}} <b>defects</b> is established and discussed. It is shown that all the known types of <b>defects</b> are naturally included in the presented classification of <b>defects.</b> A new broad class of <b>defects</b> of new types is established and interpreted. It is shown that the existence of new classes of <b>defects</b> is directly connected with some known theoretical and experimental data on the possibility of generation of such <b>defects</b> as dislocations and disclinations. In particular, it is shown that the generation of dislocations is necessarily connected with the existence of disclinations. The formal class of <b>defects</b> being a source of disclinations is specified. A formal generalization of classification of <b>defects</b> is developed to include the <b>defects</b> of arbitrary finite level. The development of consistent theory of <b>defects</b> is very important from both, fundamental and applied viewpoints. The potential applications include, in particular, the modeling of dispersed composite materials, porous media, dynamics of surface effects, crackling, cavitation and turbulence...|$|R

In the study, each of seven goats received four implants. The implants were fixed in the buccal cortex of the left body of the mandible. Four types of GTRM were used. These were Capset, Biomend, P-BioBarrier, and NP-BioBarrier. The grafting material used was Laddec. Twenty-four osseous-implant <b>defects</b> were used as the test group. Twelve of these <b>defects</b> were grafted and covered with one of the GTRMs used, so that each GTRM covered 3 grafted <b>defects.</b> The remaining 12 test <b>defects</b> were covered with one of the GTRMs alone; again, each membrane was used for 3 <b>defects.</b> It was found that both resorbable and non-resorbable GTRMs augmented implant-osseous <b>defects.</b> The range of bone contour in the ungrafted <b>defects</b> was between 550 and 1135 mm. Capset membrane produced the thickest bone in the ungrafted <b>defects</b> (1135 mm). Grafting osseous-implant <b>defects</b> increased the bone thickness. The increase ranged from 512 to 950 mm.
