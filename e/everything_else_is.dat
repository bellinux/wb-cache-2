25|$|The regulative {{principle}} of worship is a teaching shared by some Calvinists and Anabaptists {{on how the}} Bible orders public worship. The substance of the doctrine regarding worship is that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for worship in the Church and that <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and its worship practices, and it associates musical instruments with icons, which he considered violations of the Ten Commandments' prohibition of graven images.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{its fifth}} edition release, XML 1.0 {{differed}} from XML 1.1 in having stricter requirements for characters {{available for use}} in element and attribute names and unique identifiers: {{in the first four}} editions of XML 1.0 the characters were exclusively enumerated using a specific version of the Unicode standard (Unicode 2.0 to Unicode 3.2.) The fifth edition substitutes the mechanism of XML 1.1, which is more future-proof but reduces redundancy. The approach taken in the fifth edition of XML 1.0 and in all editions of XML 1.1 is that only certain characters are forbidden in names, and <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> allowed to accommodate suitable name characters in future Unicode versions. In the fifth edition, XML names may contain characters in the Balinese, Cham, or Phoenician scripts among many others added to Unicode since Unicode 3.2.|$|E
25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> a part of the cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E

500|$|Another {{point of}} {{conflict}} concerning Nulls is that they violate the closed world assumption model of relational databases by introducing an open world assumption into it.

[...] This view assumes that the knowledge of the world stored within a database is complete. [...] Nulls, however, operate under the open world assumption, in which some items stored in the database are considered unknown, making the database's stored knowledge of the world incomplete.|$|E

The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast.

500|$|... "Mi Chico Latino" [...] is a Latin pop song which moves at a {{moderate}} tempo of 104 beats per minute. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Halliwell chants the spoken word line [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?". The lyrics to the song are centred on a lost love theme, with castanets in the background. During the song, the singer also sings in Italian on its chorus, when <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> Spanish. According to biographer David Sinclair in his book Spice Girls Revisited: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop, Halliwell continued to explore the Riviera-pop theme of the Spice Girls' song, [...] "Viva Forever", whilst [...] "murmuring sweet nothings in a peculiar brand of estuary Spanish while castanets and timbales clattered alongside a cod-flamenco guitar".|$|E

500|$|During the 1990s, to be a [...] "rockist" [...] {{was defined}} as {{demanding}} a perception of authenticity in pop music despite whatever artifice is needed. Seattle Weeklys Douglas Wolk acknowledged the loose definition of rockism and proposed: [...] "Rockism, let's say, is treating rock as normative. In the rockist view, rock is the standard state of popular music: the kind to which <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> compared, explicitly or implicitly." [...] In 2004, music critic Kelefa Sanneh offered a definition of rockists: [...] "omeone who reduces rock 'n' roll to a caricature, then uses that caricature as a weapon. Rockism means idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star; lionizing punk while barely tolerating disco; loving the live show and hating the music video; extolling the growling performer while hating the lip-syncher.". He further accuses rockists of projecting a sexist, racist, and homophobic point of view.|$|E
500|$|Furtado {{embarked}} on a world concert tour, the Get Loose Tour, on 16 February 2007 in the UK, {{in support of the}} album; the tour included thirty-one dates in Europe and Canada, with additional shows in the US, Japan, Australia and Latin America. Furtado described the show as a [...] "full sensory experience" [...] with [...] "a beginning, middle and end ... takes you on a journey", also stressing the importance of crowd involvement and [...] "spontaneity and rawness, because those are my roots, you know? I started by doing club shows, and that's the energy I love, the raw club energy of just feeling like you're rocking out." [...] Though Furtado said choreographed dance routines were {{to be included in the}} show, she described it as [...] "music-based ... <b>Everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> just to keep it sophisticated and sensual and fun." [...] Furtado said she hoped to have Chris Martin, Juanes, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Calle 13 to guest on the tour, and have a [...] "revolving door" [...] of opening acts with Latin musicians opening in the US.|$|E
500|$|... "Your Racist Friend", {{produced}} by Langer and Winstanley, is a politically-charged song which follows a fairly straightforward narrative. The song, which depicts a social conflict, {{is considered to}} be the band's most clear [...] "political statement". On the other hand, the accordion-tinged [...] "Particle Man" [...] lightheartedly chronicles the disputes of three characters, the titular Particle Man, Universe Man, and Triangle Man. Linnell has claimed that the character Triangle Man was inspired by Robert Mitchum's appearance in the 1955 film The Night of the Hunter. The final single, [...] "Twisting", was selected over [...] "Your Racist Friend", in part because it was more lyrically ambiguous. The song references both The Young Fresh Fellows and The dB's, two groups that influenced the sound of the track itself. Flansburgh has noted that, while recording the song, Bezozi accidentally erased the entire drum track for [...] "Twisting". Flansburgh then had to recreate the track from scratch. The cryptic [...] "We Want a Rock" [...] features a violin performance by Mark Feldman, and [...] "Someone Keeps Moving My Chair" [...] revolves around petty concerns and their importance [...] "when <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going haywire". [...] "Hearing Aid" [...] features the mixing of standard They Might Be Giants sounds with an [...] "Arto Lindsay guitar solo and the vacuum-cleaner synth sounds", experimentations that Flansburgh felt were difficult to achieve.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} several {{references}} to German {{culture in the}} film. The most notable {{is the use of}} Hans Paetsch as a narrator.
