Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution.</b> The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E
5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution</b> was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
25|$|Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), <b>Electronic</b> <b>Brakeforce</b> <b>Distribution</b> (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA) was {{standard}} fitment.|$|E
25|$|All models come {{standard}} with side torso airbags, {{side curtain}} airbags, anti-lock braking and <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution.</b> For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability Control and traction control systems became standard.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{equipment}} level, standard on some variants and optional on others, the facelifted Logan comes with driver, passenger and side airbags. In terms of active safety, all versions feature the latest generation Bosch 8.1 ABS, which incorporates EBD (<b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution)</b> and EBA (emergency brake assist).|$|E
25|$|Since initial {{widespread}} use in production cars, anti-lock braking {{systems have been}} improved considerably. Recent versions not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but also electronically control the front-to-rear brake bias. This function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known as <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution</b> (EBD), traction control system, emergency brake assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
25|$|Standard safety {{features}} on the GS ranged from multiple airbags, including knee airbags and front row side torso airbags, to adaptive headlights, anti-lock braking, <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution,</b> brake assist and electronic stability control. The radar-based pre-collision system with an autonomous cruise control system was optional. The GS 450h {{was among the first}} vehicles to receive the infrared Driver Monitoring System for driver attentiveness. For the 2007 model year, the GS 350 replaced the GS 300 in the US and several other export markets.|$|E
25|$|The Proton Prevé {{has been}} {{developed}} to house a maximum of six SRS airbags, an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with <b>Electronic</b> <b>Brakeforce</b> <b>Distribution</b> (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). However, the Prevé was only offered with a maximum of four airbags upon its April 2012 Malaysian debut. The maximum of six airbags were only offered upon the Prevé's Australian launch in October 2012. Later on 18 October 2013, Proton released the Prevé LE in its domestic market, offering exactly the same safety specifications as the Australian market Prevé models. The following month, Proton updated the Prevé range {{with all of its}} engineered safety features as standard equipment, thus standardising the Malaysian market Prevé as a 5-Star ANCAP rated model.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} Lexus GS came standard with dual front airbags, front driver and passenger knee airbags, {{front and rear}} row side curtain airbags, and front row side torso airbags standard while rear row side torso airbags were optional. An Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) was standard on the V8 model while optional on the V6 model. The radar-based Pre-Collision System (PCS) with a Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system was optional. PCS can automatically apply up to 0.3g of deceleration if the driver does not react to imminent crash warnings. Anti-lock braking, <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution,</b> brake assist and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) are standard on all models. VSC with the electric power steering system can immediately alter steering torque assist during evasive maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|The Proton Prevé {{was finally}} {{unveiled}} on 16 April 2012 at Seri Kembangan by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. It launched {{with a choice}} of six colours and three trim variants, the Executive MT, Executive CVT and Premium CVT respectively. Both Executive trim variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro IAFM+ engine. The Executive MT is paired with a five-speed manual gearbox whereas the Executive CVT is equipped with a six-speed CVT. The Premium trim is offered with the superior 1.6L turbocharged CamPro CFE engine, mated to a seven-speed CVT, also known as ProTronic, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. Safety-wise, the Executive variants are equipped with dual SRS airbags and an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with <b>Electronic</b> <b>Brakeforce</b> <b>Distribution</b> (EBD) whereas the Premium trim features an additional two airbags, Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) on top of those offered in the Executive. The Premium variant is also equipped with exclusive kit such as steering-mounted paddle shifters, automatic headlights and wipers, cruise control, climate control, a built-in touchscreen GPS head unit with Bluetooth, USB & iPod connectivity as well as push-start engine ignition. All Proton Prevés are equipped with a Smart Information Display system (SiD) that displays information such as average fuel consumption, battery health and distance to empty. Another standard feature is in-car WiFi, made possible by a collaboration between Proton and Malaysian ISP, Yes 4G. The Prevé is priced between RM59,540 and RM72,990 respectively. It received over 11,000 bookings within two months of its official launch and became the 7th best-selling car in Malaysia for the month of May 2012, topping all rivals in its category.|$|E
500|$|All C3 Picasso {{models have}} an {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS), <b>Electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution</b> (EBD), child locks, remote central locking and two front airbags.

500|$|Safety {{was a key}} aspect in the {{development}} of the Aurion. All safety features are standard across the entire range and there are no optional safety devices. Features such as dual front, side and curtain airbags, traction control, brake assist, <b>electronic</b> <b>brakeforce</b> <b>distribution</b> and Vehicle Stability Control come standard. In tests conducted by Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP), the base model scored a four-star rating, with 30.03 out of 37 points. Toyota caused controversy by not providing a third test vehicle for ANCAP to use for the optional [...] "side-pole impact test". This third test, allows tested vehicles to be eligible for a five-star rating if the initial score is high enough. Toyota cited the additional expense of A$75,000–$100,000 including the car as being unjustifiable, and that they did not agree with the nature of the pole test. The scores given without the optional test indicate that the maximum two points that could have been earned would have been slightly less than needed to give the Aurion a five-star rating anyway. Due to Toyota's decision to fit a driver and front passenger seat belt reminder, along with their decision to fund the optional pole test, the Aurion's safety rating was upgraded to a full five stars from August 2009 production, with a score of 33.03 out of 37.|$|E
