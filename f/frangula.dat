2500|$|The {{temperate}} climate and humidity resulting from {{proximity to the}} coast favour {{the growth of a}} rich mat of forest includong Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (Viburnum tinus), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow Narrow-leaf ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), Grey willow (Salix atrocinerea), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Alder buckthorn (Rhamnus <b>frangula)</b> and Black Elderberry (Sambucus nigra).|$|E

60|$|This plant {{exists in}} the United States, as I am {{informed}} by Professor Asa Gray, under two hermaphrodite forms. In the one, which may be called the short-styled, the flowers are sub-solitary, and include a pistil about two-thirds or only half {{as long as that}} in the other form; it has also shorter stigmas. The stamens are of equal length in the two forms; but the anthers of the short-styled contain rather less pollen, as far as I could judge from a few dried flowers. My son compared the pollen-grains from the two forms, and those from the long-styled flowers were to those from the short-styled, on an average from ten measurements, as 10 to 9 in diameter; so that the two hermaphrodite forms of this species resemble in this respect the two male forms of R. catharticus. The long-styled form is not so common as the short-styled. The latter is said by Asa Gray to be the more fruitful of the two, as might have been expected from its appearing to produce less pollen, and from the grains being of smaller size; it is therefore the more highly feminine of the two. The long-styled form produces a greater number of flowers, which are clustered together instead of being sub- solitary; they yield some fruit, but as just stated are less fruitful than the other form, so that this form appears to be the more masculine of the two. On the supposition that we have here an hermaphrodite plant becoming dioecious, there are two points deserving notice; firstly, the greater length of the pistil in the incipient male form; and we have met with a nearly similar case in the male and hermaphrodite forms of Euonymus compared with the females. Secondly, the larger size of the pollen-grains in the more masculine flowers, which perhaps may be attributed to their having retained their normal size; whilst those in the incipient female flowers have been reduced. The long-styled form of R. lanceolatus seems to correspond with the males of R. catharticus which have a longer pistil and larger pollen-grains. Light will perhaps be thrown {{on the nature of the}} forms in this genus, as soon as the power of both kinds of pollen on both stigmas is ascertained. Several other species of Rhamnus are said to be dioecious or sub-dioecious. (7/10. Lecoq 'Geogr. Bot.' tome 5 1856 pages 420- 26.) On the other hand, R. <b>frangula</b> is an ordinary hermaphrodite, for my son found a large number of bushes all bearing an equal profusion of fruit.|$|E

40|$|Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) causes high {{economic}} losses worldwide, {{especially in the}} production of seed potatoes (Solanum tuberosum). PVY control systems rely on measuring virus pressure and vector pressure in the field. Calculation of the vector pressure is based on the relative efficiency factors (REFs) of aphid species. These REFs express the transmission efficiency of aphid species in relation to the transmission efficiency of Myzus persicae, the most efficient vector of PVY. In this paper, we report on the determination of aphids' relative transmission efficiency factors (REFs) for isolates of the PVY strains PVYN, PVYNTN and PVYN-Wi. Biotype Mp 2 of M. persicae was tested for its transmission efficiency for six PVY isolates (one PVYN, three PVYNTN and two PVYN-Wi isolates) and showed comparable average transmission efficiencies for all isolates. The transmission rate of this biotype for the six PVY isolates was set to 1 and Mp 2 was used as an internal control in transmission experiments to determine the REFs of three other biotypes of M. persicae and 16 other aphid species (three biotypes per species when available) for the six PVY isolates. Comparing the calculated REFs for PVYN with the REFs reported in the previous century for PVYN, we observe overall comparable REFs, except for Aphis fabae, Aphis spp., Hyperomyzus lactucae, Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Rhopalosiphum padi, which have a lower REF in our experiments, and Aphis <b>frangulae</b> and Phorodon humuli, which have now a higher REF. Comparing the new REFs found for the PVYNTN strains with the new REFs for PVYN, we observe that they are overall comparable, except for A. <b>frangulae</b> (0. 17 compared with 0. 53) and Schizaphis graminum (0. 05 compared with 0. 00). Comparing the REFs calculated for PVYN-Wi with those calculated for PVYN, we can observe six aphid species with higher REFs (Acyrthosiphon pisum, A. fabae, Aphis nasturtii, Aphis spp., P. humuli and R. padi). Only the species A. <b>frangulae</b> shows a lower REF for PVYN-Wi compared with the transmission efficiency of PVYN. Three aphid species (Aulacorthum solani, Myzus ascalonicus and S. graminum) for which no REF was determined earlier were found to be capable to transmit PVY and their REFs were determin...|$|R
40|$|Aphid-AutoEPG {{is a new}} {{software}} program, developed to acquire and automatically analyse electrical penetration graph (EPG) signals used for monitoring plant penetration by aphids. Characteristically EPG signals include waveforms that allow one to {{study the effects of}} plants on the acquisition and transmission of viruses, plant protection substances on pests and identify the location of resistance in plants to aphids. The success of electrical monitoring arises from the fact that different species of aphids generate similar EPG patterns. But the visual analysis of EPG waveforms in recorded signals is very time consuming, which has greatly hampered the wider application of EPG technology. To overcome this Aphid-AutoEPG software was developed, which has been extensively tested using data files for several different species of aphids, M. persicae, A. <b>frangulae</b> gossypii, M. albifrons, S. avenae, B. brassicae and N. ribis-nigri. The results have also been compared with visual analyses using Stylet+ software.

40|$|In this work, anti-atherogenic and anti-hyperlipidemic {{effects of}} a herbal mixture, rich in polyphenols, and {{composed}} of 35 % of buckthorn bark (<b>Frangulae</b> cortex), 20 % of mint leaves (Menthae piperita folium), 20 % of caraway fruit (Carvi fructus) and 25 % of parsley fruit (Petroselinum fructus) were studied by monitoring biochemical parameters in experimental animals. Experimental animals (Wistar rats) were subjected to five different feeding regimes. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and cholesterol linked to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were monitored in different time periods. The feces of experimental animals was analysed for seven bile acids, {{as well as for}} total cholesterol. Simultaneously, the activities of alanine aminotranferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. The introduction of herbal mixture into fatty food did not have significant influence on enzyme activities; however, the effect on induced hyperlipidemia was significant. Total atherogenic index was reduced by 43. 3 %, whereas total cholesterol and cholesterol bound to low density lipoproteins were reduced by 18. 2 % and 18. 8 %, respectively. Total bile acids concentrations dropped by 13. 2 %, whereas cholesterol was reduced by 33 %.

40|$|A {{number of}} plants can be {{successfully}} transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes through the transfer of T-DNA from agrobacteria to the plant genome. Transgenic tissue – hairy roots – is produced {{as a result of}} the transformation process. This organized, genetically stable, hormone-independent transformed tissue is capable of accomplishing complex metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis and accumulation of various secondary metabolites. Somaclonal variation is often observed among the hairy root cultures. The highlyproductive hairy root lines, containing a large amount of important metabolites can be selected and grown in vitro on hormone-free media for a long period of time, whilst preserving their biosynthetic capacities. Consequently, during the last decade, hairy root cultures have been recognized as an excellent system for in vitro generation of a large biomass of transgenic tissue that could be utilized for the extraction of desired metabolites or even in the development of new compounds through novel metabolic pathways. Species from the family Rhamnaceae are well known for their capacity to synthesize the aromatic carbohydrates, anthraquinones (AQs). These metabolites with laxative action are traditionally extracted from the bark of <b>Frangulae</b> cortex. Applying a genetic engineering approach, the hairy root cultures of Rhamnus fallax open a convenient alternative for the production of increased amount of medically important metabolites such as AQs while protecting natural recourses and environmen...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} new and {{previously}} known data on insufficiently studied fauna of aphids living on flowering plants in Krasnoyarsk region, {{the main part}} of a vast geographical province named Central or Middle Siberia, depending on terminology used by authors of literature sources. From physical geography viewpoint, the surveyed territory belongs to the Yenisey river basin. Aphids are an ecologically and morphologically diverse group of insects included in 11 families of the suborder Aphidinea in insect fauna of Russian Federation and 25 families in the world’s fauna. Geographical location, dates of collection of aphid colonies are presented with identification of species-specific feeding preferences. First found in Siberia were Symydobius nanae, Euceraphis betulae, Cavariella cicutae, C. konoi, Uroleucon (Dactynotus) aeneum, U. giganteum, U. nigrocampalulae, U. trachelii, Aphis agrimoniae, A. coronillae, A. mongolica, A. neothalictri, A. pruni, A. pseudocomosa, A. pulsatillae, A. sambuci, A. (Debilisiphon) umbelliferarum. Collected for the first time from willow were Betacallis comes (normally feeds on birch and alder), B. quadrituberculata (common on birch), colonies of Metopeurum fuscoviride were first found on Achillea millefolium. Aphis craccivora was previously collected from plants of different families, but was never seen on Cruciferae (Capsella bursa­pastoris). Aphis <b>frangulae</b> was concidered to feed exclusively on buckthorn, however, it was found on Chamaenerion angustifolium. Judging on diversity of host species, some aphids may be more important for agriculture than it was previously thought.
