5|$|Chłapowski advised Plater {{to stand}} down and return home. She {{allegedly}} replied {{that she had}} no intention of taking off <b>her</b> <b>uniform</b> until her fatherland was fully liberated. Her decision was accepted and she was made a commanding officer of the 1st company of the Polish–Lithuanian 25th Infantry Regiment. She was promoted to the rank of captain, the highest rank awarded to a woman at that time. She spent some time in Kaunas, before the insurgents were forced to retreat in late June.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to {{extend to the}} local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing <b>her</b> <b>uniform),</b> who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, <b>her</b> <b>uniform</b> included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E

25|$|Sailor Chibi Moon is Chibiusa's {{identity}} as a Sailor Soldier. <b>Her</b> <b>uniforms</b> resemble Sailor Moon's, colored primarily in cherry blossom pink and red, with a prominent motif of small hearts, joined later by crescent moons and stars.

She is given various titles throughout the series, including Princess Soldier, Apprentice Soldier, and Soldier in Training. As the daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, she exhibits traits of both parents in battle.

25|$|As {{she grows}} stronger, Sailor Chibi Moon gains {{additional}} power, and at key points <b>her</b> <b>uniform</b> changes to reflect this. The first change is first seen in act 33 of the manga, when the Holy Chalice {{of the future}} allows her to turn into Super Sailor Chibi Moon (or Super Sailor Mini Moon in the English anime). Later, Pegasus gives her a compact which lets her transform without the Grail. In episode 128 of the anime, this gift is what causes her to become Super Sailor Chibi Moon for the first time. A third, manga-only form appears in act 42, unnamed but analogous to Eternal Sailor Moon (sans wings).|$|E

25|$|All {{four of the}} {{officers}} involved have since quit or have been fired from the LAPD. Officer Theodore Briseno left the LAPD after being acquitted on federal charges. Officer Timothy Wind, who was also acquitted a second time, was fired after the appointment of Willie L. Williams as Chief of Police. Chief Williams' tenure was also short-lived. The Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department {{in the wake of}} the Rodney King disaster. Susan Clemmer, an officer who gave crucial testimony for the defense at the initial trial, committed suicide in July 2009 in the lobby of a Los Angeles Sheriff's Station. She rode in the ambulance with King and testified that he was laughing and spat blood on <b>her</b> <b>uniform.</b> She had remained in law enforcement and was a Sheriff's Detective at the time of her death.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Cold as Ice" [...] {{is based on}} a {{relationship}} Cox had with a girl named Alice. Having fallen in love with her in the fifth grade, he proposed to marry her on the school's playground. Alice rejected Cox, calling the ring he had given her [...] "a cheap piece of crap." [...] Years later, Cox worked with Alice at a Subway restaurant. Occasionally, [...] "for no reason", she would ask him to watch her change into <b>her</b> <b>uniform</b> in the restaurant's refrigerator, which he described as having been as [...] "cold as ice". Cox suspects that [...] "she was trying to torture me or something." [...] The song [...] "Bite Marks" [...] is about [...] "sadomasochism and boy prostitution." [...] In the song, Cox references an experience he had when he was kissing a man who bit him [...] "really, really hard" [...] on his shoulder, leaving bite marks [...] "for like two weeks." [...] This experience, along with other abuses he received as a child, formed the lyrical basis of the song.|$|E

This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as <b>her</b> <b>uniform</b> and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but i think what i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." [...] Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.|$|E
500|$|Kaneko {{designed}} the main cast around multiple notable celebrities and fictional {{characters of the}} time, along with members of Atlus staff. While the characters wearing the same uniform helped designate them as a single group, it also made them look the same. To balance against this, Kaneko expressed their individuality through accessories. Atlus staff members also made cameos as minor characters. The character of Philemon was based on Carl Jung's titular wise old man archetype, described as a contradictory existence. His appearance in-game was based on paintings of Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou. Multiple ideas and terms used in-game were based on Jungian psychology and archetypes. The Velvet Room, a key gameplay location, {{was based on the}} Black Lodge from Twin Peaks. One of the characters focused on by Kaneko was Maki, who was given multiple forms throughout the story. The first versions created were the original Maki, who had been bed-ridden for a long time, and the [...] "ideal" [...] version, whose inexperience with the outside world and interactions with others made her an expressionless doll. In addition to these forms, black-clothed [...] "Aki" [...] and white-clothed [...] "Mai" [...] were created when Maki's personality split, representing her extremes. The true Maki represented balance, so Kaneko made <b>her</b> <b>uniform</b> grey. Because of this, the school uniform had to be grey. To represent her psychological immaturity, she was given a ribbon to represent her girlishness, along with a locket she believes can grant wishes.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1994 Shaya, a NYPD officer, {{appeared}} nude in Playboy {{after receiving}} authorization {{to engage in}} outside work from her Captain/Commanding Officer.

On March 7, 1995, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton overturned the departmental judge's ruling and terminated Shaya anyway, saying her appearance in Playboy violated the City Charter and the department's rules.|$|E
