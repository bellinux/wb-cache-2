5|$|<b>Enumerating</b> the Sudoku {{solutions}} {{breaks into}} an initial setup stage {{and then into}} two nested loops. Initially all the valid Band1 permutations are grouped into equivalence classes, who each impose a common constraint on the Band2,3 completions.|$|E
5|$|The Band1 symmetries (above) are {{solution}} permutation symmetries defined {{so that a}} permuted {{solution is}} also a solution. For the purpose of <b>enumerating</b> solutions, a counting symmetry for grid completion {{can be used to}} define band equivalence classes that yield a minimal number of classes.|$|E

50|$|People in Poland (when {{the country}} was still {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire) were <b>enumerated</b> allegedly by their native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. Sovereign Poland <b>enumerated</b> people by ethnicity/nationality in 1921. It <b>enumerated</b> people by mother tongue in 1931, and used this data to determine ethnicity/nationality. After World War II, the Communist Polish government did not <b>enumerate</b> people by nationality/ethnicity. The post-Communist 2002 Polish census did <b>enumerate</b> people by nationality/ethnicity and language used at home.|$|R
5|$|This {{allows the}} host to perform bus {{management}} action like <b>enumerating</b> new USB devices via retrieving the new device device descriptors.

5|$|George Washington was {{the first}} child of Augustine Washington (1694–1743) and his second wife Mary Ball Washington (1708–1789), born on their Pope's Creek Estate near present-day Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, {{according}} to the Julian calendar and Annunciation Style of <b>enumerating</b> years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a birth date of February 22, 1732.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of Sudoku falls into two main areas: analyzing {{the properties of}} (1) completed grids and (2) puzzles. Also studied are computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, and to develop (or search for) new Sudokus. Analysis has largely focused on <b>enumerating</b> solutions, with results first appearing in 2004. There are many Sudoku variants, partially characterized by size (N), and the shape of their regions. Unless noted, discussion in this article assumes classic Sudoku, i.e. N=9 (a 9×9 grid and 3×3 regions). A rectangular Sudoku uses rectangular regions of row-column dimension R×C. Other variants include those with irregularly-shaped regions or with additional constraints (hypercube) or different constraint types (Samunamupure).|$|E

50|$|People in Malawi were <b>enumerated</b> by {{race between}} 1911 and 1987, but not after 1987. They were <b>enumerated</b> by {{language}} only in 1966, 1998, and 2008. They were <b>enumerated</b> by tribal affiliation only in 1926, 1945, and 2008.|$|R
5|$|The {{most ancient}} {{recorded}} name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), {{which is consistent}} with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer <b>enumerating</b> 47 alternative forms.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{is vital}} to Manhattan's economy, and the {{landmarks}} of Manhattan {{are the focus of}} New York City's tourists, <b>enumerating</b> approximately 61 million visitors in 2016. According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013–2014 season, an increase of 11.4% from US$1.139 billion in the 2012–2013 season; attendance in 2013–2014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012–2013 season's 11.57 million. As of June 2016, Manhattan had nearly 91,500 hotel rooms, a 26% increase from 2010.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan's most {{important}} economic sector {{lies in its}} role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. The borough's securities industry, <b>enumerating</b> 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine for Manhattan, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700. Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.|$|E

5|$|As a {{small but}} rapidly intensifying hurricane, Janet passed just south of Barbados on September22, {{becoming}} the first hurricane to strike the island in 57years, since the 1898 Windward Islands Hurricane. Maximum sustained winds {{on the south side}} of the island were estimated to be between 110–120mph (180–190km/h). The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately <b>enumerating</b> casualties on the island, though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio. Electric power was later restored, allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm. Sugar cane, the island country's main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses estimated to be in excess of $1million. Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds. An estimated 8,100homes were damaged by the hurricane. The destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways, and the Seawell Airport was forced to close. Heavy rains peaked at 4in (100mm) and a storm surge of 7ft (2.1m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast. An estimated 2,000people were left homeless due to the hurricane. Property damage on Barbados was estimated to be $5million, and at least 57people were killed.|$|E
