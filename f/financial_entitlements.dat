The ‘market turn’ from social democracy to market liberalism was enabled by easy credit in the 1980 s.

This research investigates the problems of family caregivers of children orphaned by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -related death of their parents. A qualitative semistructured interview format was used in a focus group of 18 social workers. Four questions were designed to assess family needs and resources, as well as to evaluate the social workers' perspectives of governmental policies affecting these families. A list of four problems and two recommendations for change evolved from the focus group. Inadequate finances to house and care for the children was the primary cause for distress in these families. The major governmental policy that hindered the social workers' ability to assist families pertained to the low <b>financial</b> <b>entitlement</b> for caregivers who are related to the orphaned child. It was noted that unrelated caregivers receive substantially more money for the care of these children than family caregivers receive. Recommendations were made to change this policy and to develop guardianship laws that facilitate families' abilities to provide care to AIDS orphans. Family caregivers of AIDS orphans are bombarded with great demands and limited resources. This analysis of their situation from the social workers' perspective is a positive step toward the improvement of support services for these families. Further research should include individual qualitative interviews assessing the needs of the caregivers and AIDS orphans...|$|R

40|$|During recent decades, {{the rapid}} pace of {{financial}} markets involving new modes of management, governance, and regulation has framed business firms. This corporate drift toward financialization is summarized under the “shareholder value” label. What do financial markets do? Unequivocally, they organize trading on shares that are securities: tradable <b>financial</b> <b>entitlements</b> established by law, which formalize expectations, and claims of financial rents {{paid by the}} issuing company. Actually, how continued quotation on share exchanges came to be the barometer of economic or social welfare is a different matter. The latter adoption has required quite a great leap from “the euthanasia of the rentier, of the functionless investor” involving changes in, and reforms of, monetary and financial architectures at policy-making and regulatory levels; banking and financial institutions; shareholding, monetary, and investment funds (including pension and insurance); and the management, organization, and accounting of business firms. This general trend has been further shaped by transnational imitation between various socioeconomic environments and regulatory regimes, led by some global institutions. This paper aims to address some theoretical problems with shareholder value that come from its misguided understanding of shareholding and the business firm. Shareholder value relies on complementary views that point to market and ownership to understand the dynamics of both securities markets and the enterprise activity. But what happens when shares, acquired at a definite price in a given circumstance, relate to the enterprise congeries of legal and economic systems involving flows and immobilizations that require an accounting system to explicate them? This Article engages this theoretical challenge by drawing upon {{the concept of the}} firm as an “enterprise entity,” which has significant implicationsfor governance and disclosure. It argues that the enterprise entity is a comprehensive approach to the firm that integrates accounting, economics, and law, thus improving on the received understanding of the firm. PartII discusses a framework based on the concept of the firm as an enterprise entity. Part III then contrasts this framework with three alternative views on the firm that jointly constitute the shareholder value rhetoric: the “black box,” the “proprietor-entrepreneur,” and the “legal person. ” Further, these views are criticized as “daydreams. ” Finally, Part IV applies this comparative assessment to matters of corporate governance and disclosure, clarifying the novel approach to governance and disclosure of the business firm...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the percentage of}} students who do not take up their federal need-based student <b>financial</b> aid <b>entitlements</b> and sheds light on determinants of this behavior. Against the background that educational mobility in Germany is low although extensive student financial aid for needy students is available, it is crucial to know whether students assert their claims for student aid at all. To investigate non-take-up, we set up a microsimulation model for the German Socio-Economic Panel Study 2002 - 2013 and estimate the respective aid amounts students would have received, had they filed an application for need-based aid. The results indicate that about 40 % of the eligible low-income students do not take up their entitlements. We employ instrumental variable techniques and a sample selection model to consider several potential explanatory factors for this behavior. Our results suggest that non-take-up is inversely related to the level of benefits, though the elasticity is rather low. Apart from that, a shorter expected duration of benefit receipt is related to a higher non-take-up rate, whereas the possibility to draw upon older siblings' experience with completing the complex application for aid is associated with higher probabilities to claim. Moreover, we find robust evidence that significantly more students socialized in the former socialist East Germany choose to take up student aid than similar West German students. Finally, in line with behavioral economic theory, debt aversion of highly impulsive and impatient students is associated with higher rates of non-take-up...|$|R

40|$|Mainland China has {{undergone}} drastic {{social and economic}} changes in the last century. Rapid social changes often transform individual values and family structures, which directly affect the personality development process and life quality of human beings. The review of English and Chinese-language publications will enhance the readers¡¯ understanding of the Mainland Chinese personality features, coping resources and social changes. The research assessed the impact of social changes on the patterns of personality traits, stress coping resources, and life satisfaction of 2359 people in Mainland China. Participants completed three surveys: 1) the Coping Resources Inventory for Stress (CRIS) (Matheny, Curlette, Aycock, Pugh, 2 ̆ 6 Taylor, 1987), 2) Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larson, 2 ̆ 6 Griffin, 1985), and 3) Basic Adlerian Scales of Interpersonal Success-Adult Inventory (Wheeler, Kern, 2 ̆ 6 Curlette, 1995). Pearson Correlations, Univariate analysis of variance, Multivariate analysis of variance, and Multiple regression analyses were {{used to examine the}} relationship between personality types, stress coping resources, and life satisfaction for three generations. Income and gender factors were considered in analysis. The three generations do not have significant difference in personality as measured by BASIS-A. Females scored higher than males on <b>Entitlement,</b> <b>Financial</b> Freedom, and Satisfaction with Life. High income group scored significantly higher than middle and low income groups on Belonging-Social Interest, Softness, Taking Charge, and Wanting Recognition, Self Disclosure, Social Support, Financial Freedom, Physical Health, and Physical Fitness. Old generation scored significantly higher than the middle and young generations on Structuring and Satisfaction with Life. Old generation with low income scored significantly higher on Satisfaction with Life than young generation with high income. Within the young generation, middle income group perceived more Financial Freedom and Satisfaction with Life than the high and low income groups. Females with high income perceived less Physical Fitness than females with low and medium income. <b>Entitlement,</b> <b>Financial</b> Freedom, Coping Resource Effectiveness, age, and Belonging-Social Interest are found to be predictors of Satisfaction with Life among Chinese people. Findings of this study have important implications for the design of training programs aimed at assisting Chinese individuals and families to cope more healthfully with distressing circumstances and events. The results should also be useful in developing cross-cultural mental health tests...|$|R
40|$|When {{gold was}} first discovered, the Crown {{accepted}} {{that it needed}} Maori consent to open their land for mining and had to assuage fears of losing their land. Accordingly, officials devised agreements to protect Maori interests {{and to provide a}} financial return. Because of what had occurred in other countries after goldfields opened, both Maori and the government agreed that these must be well controlled. Over time, the regulations increasingly favoured the mining industry rather than the original landowners, who were not informed about the true value of their land, auriferous or otherwise. Maori were confused about their <b>financial</b> <b>entitlement</b> because of changes made by the government to the fees payable to them. Some rangatira, most notably Wirope Hoterene Taipari of Ngati Maru, saw a chance to obtain unexpected (and unearned) wealth, as shown by his insistence on opening Thames to miners despite the opposition of most of his hapu. Later, other rangatira wanted to open Ohinemuri and other potential fields because of the money they were promised by impatient miners and by more patient officials. For a brief time, some Maori considered controlling the potential Ohinemuri goldfield themselves. The main incentive to opening land was the wealth received by landowners during {{the early days of the}} Thames goldfield, but as mining faded later so did goldfields revenue. Changes to mining regulations diminished the amount distributed to Maori in ways that some Pakeha considered unfair, and these provoked complaints from Maori. A continuing problem for officials was to ensure that revenue was allocated to the right owners. The system was complex, resulting in delays in paying money and in some Maori obtaining too much and others too little (or none at all), an outcome often resulting from rangatira distributing it as they chose rather than caused by government officials, who did their best to ensure fairness. Over time, the government unilaterally made changes to the system. For their part, miners complained about being required to pay for the right to mine, and encouraged the government to acquire the freehold of goldfield land because miners’ rights on Crown land were one-quarter the cost of those on Maori land. The revenue received by the landowners soon slipped through their fingers, sometimes in traditionally competitive gatherings such as tangi. It can be argued that Taipari, who very shrewdly adapted to the new economy (and experienced its perils, becoming bankrupt in 1870), used his income not just to give himself a luxurious lifestyle but also to boost the mana of his hapu. The government has been blamed for not insisting that revenue be protected for the use of future generations, a concept that occurred to only a few Pakeha at the time and to no Maori; far from considering the interests of their descendents, cultivating the land decreased while this revenue was received. But due to the nature of mining, by the twentieth century the landowners were lamenting the serious decline in their income from this source; despite having sold so much of their goldfield lands, some complained at not receiving any more revenue. Evaluating the outcome, the Waitangi Tribunal indulged in some counter-factual history by suggesting that the government should have encouraged rangatira to set up trusts to protect the income for future generations, but no rangatira had suggested this idea, nor did they ask that they should manage goldfields jointly with the Crown. After imagining that Maori in partnership with Pakeha capitalists could have developed the goldfields without the involvement of the Crown, the Tribunal had to accept that the outcome would have been the same: loss of money (because apart from anything else mining could not remain payable indefinitely) combined with the loss of much of their land...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Substance {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} {{often leads to}} involvement in the child welfare system, resulting in multiple social service systems and service providers working with families to achieve successful child welfare outcomes. The Vulnerable Infants Program of Rhode Island (VIP-RI) is a care coordination program developed to work with perinatal substance-users to optimize opportunities for reunification and promote permanency for substance-exposed infants. This paper describes services used by VIP-RI participants and child welfare outcomes. Methods Data collected during {{the first four years}} of VIP-RI were used to identify characteristics of program participants, services received, and child welfare outcomes: closed child welfare cases, reunification with biological mothers and identified infant permanent placements. Descriptive Results Medical and financial services were associated with positive child welfare outcomes. Medical services included family planning, pre- and post-natal care and HIV test counseling. Financial services included assistance with obtaining entitlement benefits and receiving tangible support such as food and clothing. Conclusions Findings from this study suggest services that address basic family needs were related to positive child welfare outcomes. The provision of basic services, such as health care and <b>financial</b> assistance through <b>entitlement</b> benefits and tangible donations, may help to establish a foundation so mothers can concentrate on recovery and parenting skills. Identification of services for perinatal substance users that are associated with more successful child welfare outcomes has implications for the child welfare system, treatment providers, courts and families. </p...|$|R
40|$|Legislation in the Australian Capital Teritory {{shows how}} we might achieve equity for {{same-sex}} couples, writes Andrew Lynch GAY MARRIAGE is a topic {{that is not going}} away anytime soon. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is currently holding an inquiry so as to chart the extent to which same-sex couples are disadvantaged under Australian law. There is no doubt that such couples get a raw deal when compared to their heterosexual friends who are married or de facto. The difficult question is how we should fix this. The commission’s inquiry is looking at the operation of Commonwealth, state and territory laws which discriminate against gay and lesbian couples. It is particularly interested in hearing from such persons about instances where they have missed out on <b>financial</b> and work-related <b>entitlements</b> because they are in a relationship with a person of the same gender. Although the inquiry is just gathering steam, there are countless ways in which same-sex couples lose out under the law. Just some of the areas in which this occurs include the taxation system, social security benefits, and worker’s compensation. A particularly common example arises when a member of a same-sex relationship dies without a will. In some states, the deceased’s partner {{will not be able to}} inherit the estate because they are not a spouse and nor are they able to claim as a de facto. It is not really clear how much of this discrimination is the result of a definite policy or just a failure to update legislation in line with growing community acceptance of same-sex relationships. While it is rare these days to find laws which talk about “husbands” and “wives”, many statutes still utilise gender specific language when discussing couples, be they married or de facto. The effect is to exclude persons whose partner is of the same sex. We might think then that the solution to whatever the commission’s inquiry turns up is a simple one. Instances of discrimination against same-sex couples could be eliminated by means of statutory amendment on a case by case basis. However, even taking this step would not amount to true equality in the recognition of same-sex relationships. It might, at best, put those couples on the same footing as other de facto relationships. While these days the position of heterosexual de facto couples approximates that of married couples, the two are not simply equivalent under the law. Apart from any specific benefits denied to the former, the paramount distinction is that persons in a de facto relationship still have to prove their relationship when they are seeking to enforce legal entitlements. To return to the earlier example, if a de facto wishes to receive his or her partner’s estate upon their death, there is a list of factors which the courts use to decide if their relationship meets the bar. These include evidence as to where the couple lived, their sex life, their level of financial dependence and even how household duties were shared. But while heterosexuals can avoid these disabilities by affirming their relationship for legal purposes through marriage, this is not an option open to same-sex couples. As a result, even wide-ranging statutory change which puts same-sex relationships on an even par with de facto relationships fails to guarantee true and complete equality. Gay and lesbian relationships will only be on a level footing with heterosexual ones when same-sex couples are able to make a similar choice about having their relationship recognised under the law and to enjoy the consequences which flow from that. This need not mean including same-sex unions within the definition of marriage. For one thing, that might be constitutionally impossible given that when the Commonwealth was given power over marriage in 1900 it was undoubtedly understood as limited to the union of a man and woman. The Australian Capital Teritory’s Civil Unions Act shows {{how we might}} achieve equity for same-sex couples. A civil union is to be treated as a marriage for all purposes under territory law, but it expressly states that “a civil union is not a marriage”. This aims to avoid any inconsistency with the federal Marriage Act. While the attorney-general seemed placated by those efforts, the Commonwealth is yet to firmly indicate whether it sees the territory’s law as usurping its power over marriage. It is tempting to think the ACT law introduces gay marriage but that it dare not speak its name. However, it seems to strike the middle ground of respecting the traditional and constitutional definition of ‘marriage’, while also ensuring that same-sex couples are able to have their union recognised as exclusive under the law. Even people with qualms about same-sex couples as parents should be able to appreciate that there can be no justification for the many instances of financial disadvantage experienced by these members of our community. The solution is to provide a means of legally recognising such relationships and then extending to those persons the same benefits which apply to married couples. This will remove the discrimination which Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is cataloguing. If doing so threatens the institution of marriage then it is a weak institution indeed. • Andrew Lynch is director of the Terrorism and Law Project at the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, University of New South Wales.
