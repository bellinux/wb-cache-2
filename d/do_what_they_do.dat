[...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think I could handle any longer.

According to IGN's Travis Fahs, [...] "Sega was a creatively fertile company with a rapidly expanding stable of properties to draw from. It seemed like {{they were in a}} perfect position {{to start a new life}} as a developer/publisher." [...] Former Working Designs president Victor Ireland wrote that [...] "It's actually a good thing... because now Sega will survive, doing what they do best: software." [...] The staff of Newsweek remarked [...] "From Sonic to Shenmue, Sega's programmers have produced some of the most engaging experiences in the history of interactive media... Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> best for any machine on the market". Rosen predicted [...] "they have the potential to catch Electronic Arts". Game Informer, commenting on Sega's tendency to produce under-appreciated cult classics, stated: [...] "Let us rejoice in the fact that Sega is making games equally among the current console crop, so that history will not repeat itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a [...] "romantic adventurist occupation". To generalize, the public views archaeology as a fantasized hobby more than {{a job in the}} scientific community. The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of [...] "who archaeologists are, why they <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> and how relationships to the past are constituted". The modern depiction of archaeology is sensationalized so much that it has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is. The public is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts.|$|E

[...] North Carolina chancellor Carol Folt commented on {{the resolution of the}} case when she said [...] "I believe we have done everything possible to correct and move beyond the past academic irregularities and have established very robust processes to prevent them from recurring." [...] Tyrone P.

2500|$|At {{the time}} Riki Lindhome {{was called in}} to {{audition}} for the role of Sadie, December 2007, she had not heard of Craven's original film. On the day of her audition, Lindhome was informed that she had missed her scheduled appointment and that she would need to return come January. Lindhome took the time to watch the original movie and read an article in Vanity Fair about the film, giving her some familiarity with the story and her role when she went to audition. Lindhome says she finds her character [...] "creepy for no apparent reason", because the film does not attempt to justify why the three antagonists <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> The actress characterizes Sadie as being [...] "equally as bad as [...] ", being just as vicious as the others. Lindhome admits that early in production it was easier for her to detach herself from the violent character she was portraying, but as filming continued and the cast grew closer she says that it became more difficult and [...] "upsetting" [...] to perform some of the scenes. According to Lindhome, as a response to seeing how some of the scenes were affecting the women, the producers sent Paxton, Lindhome, and Martha MacIsaac to a spa for a weekend.|$|E

60|$|What {{is true of}} {{competitiveness}} is equally true of love of power. Power, in the form {{in which it is}} now usually sought, is power of command, power of imposing one's will upon others by force, open or concealed. This form of power consists, in essence, in thwarting others, for it is only displayed when others are compelled to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not wish to do. Such power, we hope, the social system which is to supersede capitalist will reduce to a minimum by the methods which we outlined in the preceding chapter. These methods can be applied in international no less than in national affairs. In international affairs the same formula of federalism will apply: self- determination for every group in regard to matters which concern it much more vitally than they concern others, and government by a neutral authority embracing rival groups in all matters in which conflicting interests of groups come into play; lout always with the fixed principle that the functions of government are to be reduced to the bare minimum compatible with justice and the prevention of private violence. In such a world the present harmful outlets for the love of power would be closed. But the power which consists in persuasion, in teaching, in leading men to a new wisdom or the realization of new possibilities of happiness--this kind of power, which may be wholly beneficial, would remain untouched, and many vigorous men, who in the actual world devote their energies to domination, would in such a world find their energies directed to the creation of new goods rather than the perpetuation of ancient evils.|$|E

And yet they have been softened in that fierce furnace of God's wrath, into another likeness of Christ--which after all is still the same; the character which he showed when he wept by the grave of Lazarus, and over the sinful city of Jerusalem; which he showed when his heart yearned over the perishing multitude, and over the leper, and the palsied man, and the maniac possessed with devils; the character which he showed when he said to the woman taken in adultery, 'Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more;' which he showed when he said to the sinful Magdalene, who washed his feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair, 'her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much;' the likeness which he showed in his very death agony upon the torturing cross, when he prayed for his murderers, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' This is the character which man may get in that dark deep.--To feel for all, and feel with all; to rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep; to understand people's trials, and make allowances for their temptations; to put oneself in their place, till we see with their eyes, and feel with their hearts, till we judge no man, and have hope for all; to be fair, and patient, and tender with every one we meet; to despise no one, despair of no one, because Christ despises none, and despairs of none; to look upon every one we meet with love, almost with pity, as people who either have been down into the deep of horror, or may go down into it any day; to see our own sins in other people's sins, and know that we might <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> and feel as they feel, any moment, did God desert us; to give and forgive, to live and let live, even as Christ gives to us, and forgives us, and lives for us, and lets us live, in spite of all our sins.|$|E
