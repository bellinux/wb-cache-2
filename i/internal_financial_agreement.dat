40|$|While many {{hospitals}} {{are under pressure}} to become more cost efficient, new costing systems such as activity-based costing (ABC) may form a solution. However, the factors that may facilitate (or inhibit) cost system changes towards ABC {{have not yet been}} disentangled in a specific hospital context. Via a survey study of hospitals, we discovered that cost system development in hospitals could largely be explained by hospital specific factors. Issues such as the support of the medical parties towards cost system use, the awareness of problems with the existing legal cost system, the type of contract for the physician's <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>agreement,</b> should be considered if hospitals refine their cost system. Conversely, ABC-adoption issues that were found to be crucial in other industries are less important. Apparently, installing a cost system requires a different approach in hospital settings. Especially, results suggest that hospital management should not underestimate the interest of the physician in the process of redesigning cost systems. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the level of use of the <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> statements of budgetary users in their management process. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the importance of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> statements prepared according to the specific requirements of managers in decision making and budgetary user management. Another goal {{of this paper is to}} assess the implications of using a wide range of accounting information on efficiency of budgetary users management, rational spending of public resources, providing quality public services and satisfaction of public needs. As the result of application of the modified accrual basis in government accounting in Croatia, the current system provides a limited range of information presented in external financial statements. Initial hypothesis of the paper is that the <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> statements in the Croatian public sector are underdeveloped and insufficiently used in decision making and budgetary user management. By applying the survey method, this paper aims at investigating the current level of using external and <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> statements in decision making and management of Croatian budgetary users. The results obtained from the survey show that managers of most budgetary users consider that information presented in external financial statements are generally sufficient for decision making and successful management. Furthermore, the research results indicate that public managers are only partially familiar with the cost accounting and management accounting instruments. The information offered in the <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> statements are not exploited enough in the pricing of services, performance measurement and the performance monitoring of service provision...|$|R

Also, in order to support candidate countries in their internal control system reforms in the public sector. Therefore, it is expected for the candidate countries to establish and develop the system of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> controls according to the concept which was in that field developed by the European Union based on International Standards and the best practice of European countries. Since the year 2003 the Republic of Croatia undertakes intensive activities on the establishment and development of the <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> control system according with the regulation of European Union. In keeping with the set concept, the Republic of Croatia undertook numerous activities during the past six years to create all the necessary assumptions for the establishment and development of the system, including: the adoption of the initial strategic documents; drafting of laws; the creation of organizational capacities and human resources; and the implementation of the system with budget users at central government and local levels. In this paper, phases of implementation PIFC in Croatian Public Sector will be presented. Through these phases we will show impact that PIFC has on development of New Public Management in Croatia and changes in organizational structure and human resource that are caused during this process. Also, we will give critical opinion of that process and problems which occur during implementation. Finally, we will present approach in implementation of PIFC in Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
