5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were torn down, resulting in street peddlers displaying their wares on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers did not pay rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. To <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E

5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel frame {{was also a}} first for the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston.
