The main objective was to demonstrate how changes in the vapor void fraction inside the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> would affect the loop behavior, The fluid inventory and the relative tilt between the evaporator and the compensation chamber were varied so as to create different vapor void fractions in the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core.</b> The effect on the loop start-up, operating temperature, and capillary limit was investigated.

40|$|It is {{essential}} to address the startup issues prior to the wide application of loop heat pipes (LHPs) in both space and terrestrial surroundings. As non-condensable gas (NCG) {{is an important factor}} affecting the startup behavior, its effects on the startup performance of an ammonia-stainless steel LHP with and without preconditioning were experimentally investigated in this work. Nitrogen with controlled amounts was used to simulate the NCG, and the temperature overshoot, liquid superheat and startup time were employed as the evaluation criteria. Four situations relating to initial liquid/vapor distribution in the evaporator were examined: (1) both <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> and vapor grooves are filled with liquid, (2) vapor exists in vapor grooves and the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> is filled by liquid, (3) vapor grooves are filled by liquid and vapor exists in the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core,</b> and (4) vapor exists in both <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> and vapor grooves. Experimental results showed that with NCG presence in the LHP, the startup could only proceed in situation 1 with preconditioning, while it could proceed in situations 1, 3 or 4 without preconditioning. For the startup in situation 1, a larger NCG inventory led to much degraded startup performance, and a higher startup heat load could benefit the startup. For the startup in situation 3, the most difficult startup situation, NCG resulted in a very high temperature overshoot, which may even exceed the maximum allowable value. For the startup in situation 4, the existence of NCG in the vapor grooves could facilitate the evaporation there, leading to a very desirable startup...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results on}} a loop heat pipe, using R 134 a as the working fluid, {{indicates}} that the liquid inventory in the compensation chamber can significantly influence the operating characteristics. The large liquid inventory in the compensation chamber, under terrestrial conditions, can result in loss of thermal coupling between the compensation chamber and the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core.</b> This causes the operating temperature to increase monotonically. This phenomenon, which has been experimentally observed, is reported in this paper. A theoretical model to predict the steady-state performance of a loop heat pipe with a weak thermal link between the compensation chamber and the core, as observed in the experiment, is also presented. The predicted and the experimentally determined temperatures correlate well...|$|E

They have been gaining importance {{as a part}} of the thermal control system of spacecraft. The evaporation heat transfer coefficient at the tooth-wick interface of an LHP or CPL has a significant impact on the evaporator temperature. It is also the main parameter in sizing of a CPL or LHP. Experimentally determined evaporation heat transfer coefficients from a three-port CPL with tubular axially grooved (TAG) evaporator and a TAG LHP with acetone, R- 134 A, and ammonia as working fluids are presented in this paper.

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{recycling}} a vehicle is extremely complicated {{as there are}} many parts to be recycled and many hazardous materials to remove. Briefly, the process begins with incoming vehicles being inventoried for parts. The wheels and tires, battery and catalytic converter are removed. Fluids, such as engine coolant, oil, transmission fluid, air conditioning refrigerant, and gasoline, are drained and removed. Certain high value parts such as electronic modules, alternators, starter motors, infotainment systems - even complete engines or transmissions - may be removed if they are still serviceable and can be profitably sold on; either in [...] "as-is" [...] used condition or to a remanufacturer for restoration. Other hazardous materials such as mercury, and sodium azide (the propellant used in air bags) may also be removed. After all of the parts and products inside are removed, the remaining shell of the vehicle is sometimes subject to further processing, which includes removal of the air conditioner <b>evaporator</b> and heater <b>core,</b> and wiring harnesses. The remaining shell is then crushed flat, or cubed, to facilitate economical transportation in bulk to an industrial shredder or hammer mill, where the vehicles are further reduced to fist-sized chunks of metal. Glass, plastic and rubber are removed from the mix, and the metal is sold by multiple tons to steel mills for recycling.|$|R

A case study on the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> building of the model car (PA) was conducted. This study describes the set-up time reduction in a Fagor press involved in the machining of evaporator plates. The well-known Single Minute Exchange of Die technique (SMED) was applied. SMED {{is one of the many}} lean production methods for reducing waste in a manufacturing process. It provides a rapid and efficient way of converting a manufacturing process from running the current product to running the next product. It is also often referred to as Quick Changeover (QCO).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} the pressure drop on the operating temperature in a loop heat pipe (LHP). Because the evaporator and the compensation chamber (CC) both contain two-phase fluid, a thermodynamic constraint exists between the temperature difference and the pressure drop for these two components. As the pressure drop increases, so will the temperature difference. The temperature difference in turn causes an increase of the heat leak from the evaporator to the CC, resulting in a higher CC temperature. Furthermore, the heat leak strongly depends on the vapor void fraction inside the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core.</b> Tests were conducted by installing a valve on the vapor line so as to vary the pressure drop, and by charging the LHP with various amounts of fluid. Test results verify that the LHP operating temperature increases with an increasing differential pressure, and the temperature increase is a strong function of the fluid inventory in the loop...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{microchannel}} heat exchangers, {{and the methods}} used to try and reduce the charge contained in them. First, four condensers were designed and manufactured with the same air side characteristics and same tube design (with the exception of some blocked ports in one design) so that any difference in charge, capacity, pressure drop etc. {{can be attributed to}} flow geometry. These designs were a two circuit serpentine design, a two pass parallel flow design, and two one pass parallel flow designs. The difference between the two one pass designs were the number of microchannel ports in the tubes, one with 19 ports and the other with 10. The one pass design with 10 ports contained the least amount of charge, on average about 20 g, while the other one pass design contained the most charge, about 28 g. The reason for this difference was not only because the smaller tube volume, but an increase in mass flux also decrease the amount of charge in the exit header by 20 - 30 %. The serpentine condenser also had very low charge amounts, but pressure drop was about ten times higher than in the parallel flow designs. This caused a 4 % lower COP than what was given with the one pass design. Two serpentine evaporators have also been examined. The <b>evaporators</b> had similar <b>core</b> volumes of about 870 cm 3. One evaporator had double the fin length by using a ???splitter??? fin, which reduced the length of the evaporator tube and therefore reduced the internal volume. Both evaporators performed almost exactly the same, but the splitter fin evaporator had less of a pressure drop and contained 15 % less charge. Finally, the models developed for this thesis were used to theoretically compare the performance and charge of six different refrigerants, propane (which was the refrigerant used for experiments), R 22, R 134 a, isobutane, ammonia, and R 410 A in a condenser. A pressure drop based on a 1 % decrease of Carnot COP was found for each refrigerant. Ammonia was found {{to be able to have}} same capacity as the other refrigerants, but able to achieve the capacity with a much smaller cross sectional area and a very small amount of charge.

40|$|Loop {{heat pipe}} is a passive {{two-phase}} heat transport device that is gaining importance {{as a part}} of spacecraft thermal control systems and also in applications (such as in avionic cooling and submarines). Hard fill of a loop heat pipe occurs when the compensation chamber is full of liquid. A theoretical study is undertaken to investigate the issues underlying the loop beat pipe hard-fill phenomenon. The results of the study suggest that the mass of charge and the presence of a bayonet have significant impact on the loop heat pipe operation. With a largern mass of charge, a loop heat pipe hard fills at a lower heat load. As the heat load increases, there is a steep rise in the loop heat pipe operating temperature. In a loop heat pipe with a saturated compensation chamber, and also in a hard-filled loop heat pipe without a bayonet, the temperature of the compensation chamber and that of the liquid core are nearly equal. When a loop heat pipe with a bayonet hard fills, the compensation chamber and the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> temperatures are different...|$|E
40|$|In this article, an {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to provide {{better understanding of the}} transient characteristics of a dual compensation chamber loop heat pipe (DCCLHP) subjected to the acceleration force. A new acceleration test rig was set up to provide the acceleration up to 11 g with three different directions. The heat load on the evaporator ranging from 25 W to 300 W was applied with the acceleration force simultaneously. Experimental results indicated that the DCCLHP could start up at a small heat load of 25 W and the startup behavior was different under acceleration direction conditions because of the vapor-liquid distribution change in the evaporator and compensation chambers (CCs). Under the current operating conditions, the effect of acceleration force was significant to the operating performance at small heat loads whereas was weak at large heat loads. Experimental results also clearly showed that both acceleration magnitude and direction can alter the operating mode. What’s more, it was found that temperature oscillation, reverse flow and evaporation in the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> phenomena occurred under acceleration conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{evaporator}} tilt {{on the operating}} temperature of a loop heat pipe (LHP) without a secondary wick under terrestrial surroundings was investigated both experimentally and theoretically in this work. The experiments were conducted with the evaporator placed at three different tilts: (a) the evaporator was horizontal with the compensation chamber (CC), (b) the evaporator was vertically below the CC, and (c) the evaporator was a little higher than the CC with a tilt angle of 1. 80 °. Experimental {{results show that the}} evaporator tilt has significant effect on the operating temperature of the LHP: the operating temperature at evaporator tilt (c) was much higher than those at two other evaporator tilts. Theoretical analysis based on a two-zoned evaporator wick, i. e. a subcooled zone and a saturated zone, is conducted to explain the experimental results, indicating that the cooling effect of the returning liquid on the vapor region in the CC or the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> is crucial in determining the operating temperature of LHPs, which should be well considered in the LHP design and applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{operating}} temperature of a loop heat pipe (LHP) with multiple evaporators {{is a function}} of the total heat load, heat load distribution among evaporators, condenser temperature and ambient temperature. Because of the many variables involved, the {{operating temperature}} also showed more hystereses than an LHP with a single evaporator. Tight temperature control can be achieved by controlling its compensation chamber (CC) temperatures at the desired set point. This paper describes a test program on active control of the operating temperature in an LHP with two evaporators and two condensers. Temperature control was achieved by heating one or both CC's. Tests performed included start-up, power cycle, sink temperature cycle, CC temperature cycle, and capillary limit. Test results show that, regardless one or two CC's were heated to the set point temperature, one of CC's was always flooded with liquid. The loop could operate successfully at the desired set point temperature under most conditions, including some fast transients. At low heat loads, however, the CC temperature could suddenly increase above the set point temperature, possibly due to a sudden change of the vapor content inside the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core...</b>|$|E
40|$|The noise {{sources and}} {{mechanisms}} {{of the front}} and rear HV AC systems of an automotive are characterized experimentally. The front system has three main outlet ducts equipped with louvers and operates in two modes of bypass and recirculation. The inlet and outlet sides of the rear system are both located in the cabin; hence, it always works only on the recirculation mode. The outlet duct of the rear system is covered by a ten-hole curved plate which is found to be a strong source of noise. Both systems are tested at the highest possible flow rate, as it is the most annoying condition of noise generation. The noise coming out of each duct of {{the front and rear}} systems and their fan units are measured separately. Since the fan {{is an important part of}} the systems, it is studied at different speeds with more details. In order to compare the effect of the noise generated by the fan section with the noise produced by the complete system, the impeller is replaced with a speaker generating an overall sound level similar to the fan noise. Under this condition, the flow noise due to the <b>evaporator</b> <b>core,</b> distributive ducts and louvers are cancelled. It is concluded that at low frequencies the duct flow-noise i...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) Technology {{has become}} an {{accepted}} technology for thermal management of spacecraft. Despite {{the acceptance of the}} technology, there remains a lack of understanding about how to analyze these devices, creating the myth that inadequate tools exist for modeling LHPs and CPLs (capillary pumped loops). LHPs are two-phase devices with a very tight thermal coupling to their environment. Consequently these systems must be modeled in a manner capable of capturing both thermal and fluid behavior. Over the past decade various programs have been written to model LHPs and CPLs, however the majority of them have been either design-specific or focused on capturing a specific behavior within the system. SINDA/FLUINT is a thermal/fluid modeling code fully capable of capturing both heat transfer and fluid dynamics of an LHP. In addition it provides the flexibility to model any portion of the system in as much or as little detail as needed. Unfortunately, the perception that FLUINT is too difficult to learn has precluded many engineers and technologists from learning how to model LHPs. A recently developed Application Programming Interface (API) provides a means of launching and controlling SINDA/FLUINT from a separate stand-alone software program. To support the analysis needs of engineers who are interested in evaluating LHPs and performing system level studies, but who do not have the resources required become fluent with SINDA/FLUINT, a Microsoft Excel-based front end has been developed using this API. The resulting LHP Launch Control Panel is a simple Excel-based user interface requiring no knowledge of SINDA/FLUINT nor any need to purchase licenses if no changes are required to the underlying model. This paper will provide an overview of the LHP Launch Control Panel, discuss typical analysis results, and provide some guidelines on bracketing the LHP performance for stochastic phenomena such as <b>evaporator</b> <b>core</b> state. In addition it will provide information for the advanced user on how to further customize the tool for their needs. The Excel-based LHP model is available in a licensed or unlicensed SINDA/FLUINT mode...|$|E
