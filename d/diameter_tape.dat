40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{harvester}} measurement accuracy assumed traditional manual log measurements were accurate and represented true log dimensions, which {{relies heavily on}} the assumption that logs are regular in shape. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the level of variability in manual log measurements and consider its impact on harvester calibration and accuracy assessments. Log length was measured along the top and each side and small-end diameter with callipers, a <b>diameter</b> <b>tape,</b> and a steel ruler in two radiata pine stands near Mt. Gam-bier in Southern Australia. Observed variability in manual log measurements was sufficient to affect harvester accuracy studies and calibration. Length variability on different sides of a log occurs mainly from non-square log ends. Differences due to observer were minor. Diameter measurement variability occurs mainly from the effect of stem eccentricity on each instrument, which is dependent on its number of stem contact points. Callipers have fewer contact points than a <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> and hence more variability. This variability was evident in comparisons between observers and instruments. Harvester accuracy studies need to minimize manual measurement variability to identify harvester measurement errors. Length should be measured on the same side measured by the harvester. Diameter should be measured with a <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> in preference to callipers as they have greater stem contact and less variability. Harvester calibration needs to minimize manual and harvester measurement variability to identify harvester measurement bias with the least number of logs to minimize the time required for these activities. In addition to the above suggestions relating to harvester accuracy study measurements, logs selected for calibration must be the most uniform in shape available to highlight harvester measurement biases...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of stem diameter {{is essential to}} forest inventory. As a millimeter-level measuring tool, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has not yet reached millimeter-level accuracy in stem diameter measurements. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop an accurate method for deriving the stem diameter from TLS data. The methodology of stem diameter measurement by <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> was adopted. The stem cross-section at a given height along the stem was determined. Stem points for stem diameter retrieval were extracted according to the stem cross-section. Convex hull points of the extracted stem points were calculated in a projection plane. Then, a closed smooth curve was interpolated onto the convex hull points to simulate the path of the <b>diameter</b> <b>tape,</b> and stem diameter was calculated based on the length of the simulated path. The stems of different tree species with different properties were selected to verify the presented method. Compared with the field-measured diameter, the RMSE of the method was 0. 0909 cm, which satisfies the accuracy requirement for forest inventory. This study provided a method for determining the stem cross-section and an efficient and precise curve fitting method for deriving stem diameter from TLS data. The importance of the stem cross-section and convex hull points in stem diameter retrieval was demonstrated...|$|E
50|$|Importantly, {{the bottom}} edge of the prism must be roughly {{parallel}} to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in forestry today because, the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other angle gauges when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center, and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking forest inventory are clinometers, Biltmore sticks, relascopes, and <b>Diameter</b> <b>Tapes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Since 1988, Virginia Tech has had various {{programs}} in which undergraduate students visited {{public schools and}} presented natural resources-based information One {{of the more popular}} presentations involved teaching public school students how to identify and measure forest vegetation. In 2008, the Ambassadors for Conservation Education (ACE) Program was developed to enlist a larger, more diverse student body to participate in forestry and agriculturally-related undergraduate degree programs. In this program, undergraduates visited two parks and six high schools with forest nearby to collect forest ecological data with high school students. At each park and school we established a series of 0. 02 -ha permanent plots. Accurate baseline data on tree species, and tree diameter (3 ̆e 10 cm) were collected on all plots by Virginia Tech faculty and staff. These data, along with the exercise objectives and field trip preparation material (e. g., data sheets), were placed on the internet for use by teachers. To prepare for their teaching days, undergraduate students enrolled in a communication class where they were taught principles of effective communication. The class emphasized outdoor environmental teaching with numerous practice sessions where students improved their skills at teaching outdoors in informal settings. Undergraduates then led high school field trips where students and their teachers visited the plots and collected the same information in the pre-established plots. High schoolers learned principle of tree identification and use of <b>diameter</b> <b>tapes</b> and increment borers. Following data collection, students returned to the classroom and submitted their data via the internet. Relatively accurate data can be collected when trained undergraduates assist high school students closely. Utilizing schools with forest plots nearby greatly increased the number of students reached and eliminates the need for special field trip permission and transportation costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure trees {{remotely}} or {{at a distance}} may be of value to forest inventory processes. Within three forest types (young coniferous, old coniferous, and deciduous), we compared laser caliper measurements collected at distances up to 12 m from each tree, to direct contact caliper measurements. Bitterlich sector-fork measurements and <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> measurements were also collected for reference purposes. We used non-parametric tests to evaluate three of our four hypotheses that suggest there are {{no significant differences between}} direct and remote diameter measurements, between caliper measurements and sector-fork measurements, and between diameter measurement errors across forest types. In general, most of the differences in diameters were small (≤ 0. 8 cm) and were observed within the 0 – 6 m measurement distance from each tree. These results suggest that forest characteristics and measurement distance {{may play a role in}} remote diameter measurement accuracy. We also performed a correlation analysis between light conditions and remote measurements. The correlation analysis suggested light conditions were not significantly correlated to diameter measurement accuracy...|$|E
30|$|D was {{measured}} at 1.3  m {{above the ground}} using <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> (F 10 - 02 DM, KDS). H {{was measured}} using an altimeter (Vertex IV, Haglöf), and V was calculated from the equation of Monteuuis et al. [1]. SWV of the stem was measured using a commercial, hand-held stress-wave timer (FAKOPP Microsecond Timer, FAKOPP Enterprise) according to the method previously described [3, 5]. Start and stop sensors were set at 150 and 50  cm from ground level, respectively. The start sensor {{was hit with a}} small hammer to create a stress wave. After the stress wave was received by the stop sensor, the stress-wave propagation time between the two sensors was recorded. Eleven measurements of stress-wave propagation time were obtained for each tree, and the mean value was calculated for each tree. SWV was calculated by dividing the distance between sensors (100  cm) by the averaged stress-wave propagation time. P was measured using a Pilodyn tester (strength of spring, 6  J; diameter of pin, 2.5  cm, Proceq) at 1.3  m above ground level at three positions for each tree [3, 7, 8]. The bark at the measuring positions was removed before measuring P. The mean value of three P measurements was recorded for each tree.|$|E
40|$|Among others, the dbh, basal area, {{and tree}} height {{are the most}} {{important}} parameters to describe tree dimensions in forest inventories. In traditional forest inventories, these parameters are measured manually. In times of forest staff reduction and amalgamation of forest districts, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) could evolve as a fast, efficient and automatic tool for the determination of basic inventory parameters such as the number of trees, diameter at breast height (dbh), basal area, tree height as well as stem and crown shape parameters. Since there has so far been little attention drawn to the accuracy and precision of TLS itself, we statistically investigated TLS in comparison with traditional inventory methods. We developed an investigation procedure, exemplified for a 49 -year-old Douglas-Fir stand (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. Viridis Mirb.) near Eberswalde in the northeastern part of Germany to analyse the potential of TLS in terms of diameter at breast height (dbh) and height measurements. The results of the study suggest that the precision of the dbh measured from the laser scan point cloud return is sufficient. However, TLS was linked to an underestimation of dbh in comparison to the reference values measured with a <b>diameter</b> <b>tape.</b> Stand volume was accurately measured only if multiple scan positions were distributed in the forest stand...|$|E

30|$|Data were {{collected}} from 337 quadrats across 42 sites {{in the summer of}} 2010 – 2011. The number of quadrats sampled at a site differed to ensure that the area surveyed was proportional to the size of each site. Dimensions of the 120 m 2 quadrats differed based on the shape of the restoration site. A systematic search was conducted to locate planted and regenerating individuals in each quadrat. The species type and the height and diameter at base were recorded for each plant. Diameters were measured using Vernier calipers or a <b>diameter</b> measuring <b>tape</b> where the <b>diameter</b> exceeded 150 mm. Heights were measured using a 2 m ruler or a Silva clinometer for taller plants. The presence of reproductive material (buds, flowers, fruits) was recorded for each plant. Remnant trees were measured using the same method if they were present within a sampled quadrat. Recruitment was considered episodic if there were large numbers of individuals of the same age class and species within a quadrat (for example, if there were river red-gum seedlings in a drainage line). Where regeneration was clearly arising from suckers, this was noted due to the different reproductive method.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Tree {{inventory}} is {{a necessary}} tool to validate the accuracy of acquired LiDAR point cloud against the gathered field data when extracting information on forest resources. This research study focuses on establishing a protocol for field inventory survey and comparison of positional accuracies of surveyed points from different methods. A 2 -ha permanent forest plot in Molawin-Dampalit, Mount Makiling, Laguna, established by the Makiling Center for Mountain Ecosystems (MCME) using a hand-held GPS and bearing method, {{was used as the}} comparative study site for this research. Diameter at breast height of trees with diameters greater than 10 cm, 1 - 10 cm and less than 1 cm were measured using a <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> at 20 mx 20 m, 10 mx 10 m and 5 mx 5 m grids,respectively. Canopy closure and gap fraction was measured using digital hemispherical photography and fisheye lens. Regression methods were used to establish relationships and to know if the parameters directly measured from LiDAR specifically canopy height, point density, point spacing and canopy cover would derive the diameter at breast height of the trees in the study site. Based on the field inventory, tree height in the study site ranges from 0. 01 to 33 m, DBH ranges from 0. 01 to 150 cm, and canopy cover ranges from 53. 5 % to 98. 3 %.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel methodology for measuring stand sapwood area (SA), {{which provides a}} useful indicator of evapotranspiration from forest stands. The method is demonstrated in a 73 -year-old Eucalyptus regnans forest comprising 784 stems over a 5 [*]ha area. We used photos of stump cross-sections to differentiate sapwood from heartwood and found 90 % of stump segments to have a visible transition boundary. The digital images were corrected for lens distortion and scaled to an actual cross-sectional area, with resulting stump perimeters corresponding well with field-measured perimeters traced using string (root-mean-square error[*]=[*] 4 [*]cm, R²[*]=[*] 0. 99). Calculated SA and basal area (BA) at stump height were coupled with tree and sapwood taper data to predict the SA:BA ratio at 1. 3 [*]m height (̂R 1. 3). Tree taper data were coupled with stump dimensions data in a mixed-effects model to predict each stump's BA at 1. 3 [*]m, and sapwood taper data from buttress logs were used to improve each stems ̂R 1. 3. Using this procedure, we found our study site to have an ̂R 1. 3 of 0. 21 and total stand SA at 1. 3 [*]m height of 9. 3 [*]m²[*]ha⁻¹. We quantified the bias in traditional ̂R 1. 3 estimates that use cores to measure sapwood thickness and <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> to calculate SA. We show traditional methods underestimate inline image that increases with tree diameter and decreases with stem circularity, whereas our methodology gave more accurate measures of SA in large buttressing trees.

40|$|Problem statement: Spatial {{modeling}} {{has many}} applications in various fields like agriculture, meteorology, forestry {{and it takes}} into consideration the spatial correlation structures. In the field of forestry the growth rate, in particular, the diameter of trees is usually an important parameter. The growth rate of trees in a forest {{is likely to be}} influenced by various factors like nutrients, fertility of soil, sunshine and rainfall. In this study, we investigated the spatial correlation of the mean diameter of trees in the natural Dipterocarp forest in Gunung Tebu forest reserve, Terengganu, Malaysia. Approach: The diameters were measured using the <b>diameter</b> <b>tape</b> and the unit of measurement is in centimeters (cm). The main sampling unit was 1 ha plot of 100 by 100 m located approximately in the centre of each treatment block. Within the 1 ha sample plot, the quadrants (20 by 20 m) were numbered consecutively from 1 - 25 and in the outer 16 quadrants; all trees having a diameter at breast height over bark (dbh) of 15. 0 cm or more are individually numbered, tagged and enumerated. Using the rook's and queen's neighborhood structure, we computed the Moran's spatial correlation coefficient for the mean diameter of trees in each quadrant for the years 1975 up to 1986. Results: We found that there was a negative spatial correlation among the mean diameter of trees in the 16 quadrants (cases) of the natural Dipterocarp forest in Gunung Tebu forest reserve, Terengganu at Î± level 0. 10. Conclusion/Recommendations: The existence of negative spatial correlation indicated that there was competition among the trees in Dipterocarp forest as a result of tree growth over time which was affected by species, size, age and other environmental factors. Further research will concentrate on the spatial modeling of diameter of trees for the years where negative correlation was found...|$|E
