5|$|Attachment {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E

5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages, a {{substantial}} ice cap covered the Patagonian and Fuegian Andes. Two stages of glaciation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> southern Tierra del Fuego; four more {{have been found}} north of the Magellan Strait. After about 10,000 years ago, Nothofagus woods developed in the region.|$|E

5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms {{have been}} implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others may be related to particular issues and experiences.|$|E
5|$|Only {{three classes}} of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and guanine) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> spiders, {{although}} other pigments {{have been detected}} but not yet characterized. Melanins, carotenoids and pterins, very common in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species, the exocuticle of the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> the prion-like {{domains of}} heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form {{of all of}} these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2001 {{discovery}} of a single individual in Myanmar, at least nine separate sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and Karen Hills outside the Thanlwin, Ataran, and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States. The Thai and Myanmar populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.|$|E
5|$|The pantropical {{subfamily}} Nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers, {{known as}} nasutes, {{that have the}} ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn-like frontal projection that they use for defence. Nasutes have lost their mandibles through the course of evolution and must be fed by workers. A wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> the liquids that nasutes secrete.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of exoplanets <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> {{the last}} twenty years.

5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds with wooden internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also being covered by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with wooden internal structures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built {{where there was no}} suitable stone.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at the shores of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found within their own tunnels. They were probably used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at {{the shores of the}} lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in the lake was the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus.|$|E
