Comparison of the attenuation factor (β of the simplified Simmons equation) across these SAMs with the corresponding value obtained with length-matched SAMs of oligophenyls (HS(Ph) nH) and n-alkanethiols (HS(CH 2) nH) demonstrates that SAMs of oligo(ethylene glycol) have values of β (β(EG) n = 0. 29 ± 0. 02 natom(- 1) and β = 0. 24 ± 0. 01 Å(- 1)) indistinguishable from values for SAMs of oligophenyls (β(Ph) n = 0. 28 ± 0. 03 Å(- 1)), and {{significantly lower than}} those of SAMs of n-alkanethiolates (β(CH 2) n = 0. 94 ± 0. 02 natom(- 1) and 0. 77 ± 0. 03 Å(- 1)). There are two possible origins for this low value of β. The more probable involves hole tunneling by superexchange, which rationalizes the weak dependence of the rate of charge transport on the length of the molecules of HS(EG) nCH 3 using interactions among the high-energy, occupied orbitals associated with the lone-pair electrons on oxygen. Based on this mechanism, SAMs of oligo(ethylene glycol) s are good conductors (by hole tunneling) but good insulators (by electron and/or hole <b>drift</b> <b>conduction).</b> This observation suggests SAMs derived from these or electronically similar molecules are a new class of electronic materials. A second but less probable mechanism for this unexpectedly low value of β for SAMs of S(EG) nCH 3 rests on the possibility of disorder in the SAM and a systematic discrepancy between different estimates of the thickness of these SAMs...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model to {{describe}} diffusion processes within active deformable media. Our general theoretical framework is based on physical and mathematical considerations, and it suggests to use diffusion tensors directly coupled to mechanical stress. A proof-of-concept experiment and the proposed generalised reaction-diffusion-mechanics model reveal that initially isotropic and homogeneous diffusion tensors turn into inhomogeneous and anisotropic quantities due to the intrinsic structure of the nonlinear coupling. We study the physical properties leading to these effects, and investigate mathematical conditions for its occurrence. Together, the experiment, the model, and the numerical results obtained using a mixed-primal finite element method, clearly support relevant consequences of stress-assisted diffusion into anisotropy patterns, <b>drifting,</b> and <b>conduction</b> velocity of the resulting excitation waves. Our findings also indicate the applicability of this novel approach {{in the description of}} mechano-electrical feedback in actively deforming bio-materials such as the heart...|$|R
50|$|Computers {{have made}} it {{possible}} to bring together decades of isolated magnetic observations and extract average patterns of electrical currents and average responses to interplanetary variations. They also run simulations of the global magnetosphere and its responses, by solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a numerical grid. Appropriate extensions must be added to cover the inner magnetosphere, where magnetic <b>drifts</b> and ionospheric <b>conduction</b> need to be taken into account. So far the results are difficult to interpret, and certain assumptions are needed to cover small-scale phenomena.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of the}} residual heat associated with stored nuclear waste casks proposed for long-term storage in Yucca Mountain has been developed. The Yucca Mountain Repository, located about 100 miles from Las Vegas, NV, is the proposed long-term geologic repository for high-level nuclear waste. STAR-CD, one of several commercial computational fluid dynamics packages being used for the assessment studies, was used to establish the {{numerical model}}. The model was developed to simulate the fluid flow and heat transfer within the drift tunnels generated by the waste casks over a 10, 000 -year time cycle. The model shows that the heat generated from within the casks is partially removed by ventilating air moving through the <b>drifts</b> and <b>conduction</b> through the <b>drift</b> walls. Thermal radiation {{was found to have}} little effect on overall cooling compared to the roles of natural convection adjacent to the casks and forced convection from the drift ventilation...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} and paradoxes of the Lifshitz theory in application to real dielectric and semiconductor materials are reviewed. It is {{shown that the}} inclusion of <b>drift</b> current of <b>conduction</b> electrons into the model of dielectric response results in contradictions with both thermodynamics and experimental data of different experimental groups. Physical reasons why the {{problems and}} paradoxes arise are analyzed and found to be connected with the violation of basic applicability condition of the Lifshitz theory, the thermal equilibrium. A recent alternative approach to {{the resolution of the}} problems based on the inclusion of screening effects and diffusion current is considered and demonstrated to be thermodynamically and experimentally inconsistent. It is argued that the inclusion of the diffusion current leads to an even deeper violation of thermal equilibrium. Phenomenologically, the Lifshitz theory with role of drift and diffusion currents neglected is shown to be free of problems and in agreement with both thermodynamics and all available experimental data.

40|$|The {{electron}} spin lifetime and diffusion length are transport parameters {{that define the}} scale of coherence in spintronic devices and circuits. Since these parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in metals, semiconductors {{could be the most}} suitable for spintronics. Thus far, spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors or in combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group is silicon (Si), which (in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics) has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced lifetime and diffusion length due to low spin-orbit scattering and lattice inversion symmetry. Despite its exciting promise, a demonstration of coherent spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of universal impedance mismatch obstacles, and are obscured by Lorentz magnetoresistance and Hall effects. Here we demonstrate conduction band spin transport across 10 microns undoped Si, by using spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through ferromagnetic thin films for both spin-injection and detection. Not based on magnetoresistance, the hot {{electron spin}}-injection and detection avoids impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The clean collector current thus shows independent magnetic and electrical control of spin precession and confirms spin coherent <b>drift</b> in the <b>conduction</b> band of silicon.

40|$|Modification of spiral wave (SW) reentry by {{antiarrhythmic}} {{drugs is}} a central issue to be challenged for better understanding of their benefits and risks. We investigated the effects of pilsicainide and/or verapamil, which block sodium and L-type calcium currents (I(Na) and I(Ca,L)), respectively, on SW reentry. A two-dimensional epicardial ventricular muscle layer was created in rabbit hearts by cryoablation (n = 32), and action potential signals were analyzed by high-resolution optical mapping. During constant stimulation, pilsicainide (3 - 5 microM) caused a frequency-dependent decrease of conduction velocity (CV; by 20 %- 54 % at 5 Hz) without affecting action potential duration (APD). Verapamil (3 microM) caused APD shortening (by 16 % at 5 Hz) without affecting CV. Ventricular tachycardias (VTs) that were induced were more sustained {{in the presence of}} either pilsicainide or verapamil. The incidence of sustained VTs (> 30 s) /all VTs per heart was 58 % +/- 9 % for 5 microM pilsicainide vs. 22 % +/- 9 % for controls and 62 % +/- 10 % for 3 microM verapamil vs. 22 % +/- 8 % for controls. The SWs with pilsicainide were characterized by slower rotation around longer functional block lines (FBLs), whereas those with verapamil were characterized by faster rotation around shorter FBLs. Combined application of 3 microM pilsicainide and 3 microM verapamil resulted in early termination of VTs (sustained VTs/all VTs per heart: 2 % +/- 2 % vs. 29 % +/- 9 % for controls); SWs showed extensive <b>drift</b> and decremental <b>conduction,</b> leading to their spontaneous annihilation. Blockade of either I(Na) or I(Ca,L) stabilizes SWs in a two-dimensional epicardial layer of rabbit ventricular myocardium to help their persistence, whereas blockade of both currents destabilizes SWs to facilitate their terminatio...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of a strong magnetic field, various weakly damped collective Bose modes, most of which have counterparts in the gas approximation, can exist in the plasma of interacting electrons of normal metals at low temperatures. The spin waves predicted by Silin [1] and detected experimentally in alkali metals by Schultz and Dunifer [2] are the type of excitations attributable to correlation effects that is characteristic only of the electron Fermi liquid. In degenerate conductors with a quasi-two-dimen-sional charge carrier energy spectrum, the domain of existence of spin waves is wider than that in metals [3, 4]. In layered conductors with metal-type conductivity, the propagation of spin waves for any direction of the wave vector is possible even under conditions of strong spatial dispersion [4]. This is because the <b>drift</b> velocity of <b>conduction</b> electrons is a quantity of the second order of smallness in low-dimensionality parameter η of the electron energy spectrum at certain orientations of the magnetic field deflected significantly from the layers. As a result, there is no Landau damping and the spin density oscillation decays in the relaxation time in the system of electrons and their spins, i. e., it is undamped in the collisionless limit. Previously, we considered the spin waves in the case where the constant-energy sur-faces are {{in the form of a}} corrugated cylinder with an isotropic spectrum in the plane of the layers. Experi-mental studies of galvanomagnetic effects in layered structures [5, 6], in particular, organic conductors from the family of tetrathiafulvalene salts, show that the Fermi surface (FS) can consist of topologically differ-ent elements, for example, in the form of corrugated planes. In this paper, we investigate the spin waves in lay-ered conductors with an anisotropic charge carrier dis-persion law that admits of open trajectories in p space. Let us consider the following charge carrier disper-sion law...|$|R
