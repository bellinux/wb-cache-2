50|$|The 2311 {{mechanism}} is largely {{identical to the}} 1311, but recording improvements allow higher data density. The 2311 stores 7.25 megabytes on a single removable IBM 1316 disk pack (the same type used on the IBM 1311) consisting of six platters that rotate as a single unit. The 2311 has ten individual read/write (R/W) heads mounted on a common actuator which moves in and out hydraulically and is mechanically <b>detented</b> at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks plus three optional tracks {{which could be used}} as alternatives in case faulty tracks were discovered. Average seek time was 85 ms.

5000|$|An {{important}} Minimoog innovation {{was a pair}} of wheel controllers {{that the}} musician could use to bend pitch and control modulation effects in real time. The two wheels are mounted {{to the left of the}} keyboard, next to the lowest key. The function of the Pitch wheel was assigned solely to control oscillator pitch (either sharp or flat from a default, <b>detented,</b> non spring-loaded center position), whereas its neighboring Mod (Modulation) wheel was assignable to control a mixable amount of oscillator 3 and/or Noise routed to the three oscillators and/or the VCF cutoff frequency. In particular, the intuitive function and feel of the Pitch wheel allowed Minimoog users to create similar expressive pitch-bending effects that musicians such as guitarists achieve by physically 'bending' strings and using [...] "whammy" [...] bars.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "park-to-reverse" [...] {{situation}} {{involves a}} driver {{who believes that}} they have shifted into [...] "park" [...] and believing so, and the vehicle not moving when they pull their foot off the brake, proceeds to exit the vehicle. There can then be a delay in vehicle movement sufficient for the driver to either fully or partially exit the vehicle before the vehicle moves. Typically, the vehicle will move backwards. However, when on certain vehicles the shift selector can be placed between the <b>detented</b> park and reverse gear positions; i.e. in [...] "false park" [...] the transmission is in hydraulic neutral, without the parking pawl engaged. As such the vehicle can also roll either forward or back in neutral. While less common, transmissions with the defect, can also be shifted to between [...] "neutral" [...] and [...] "drive", and then self shift into [...] "drive" [...] or roll (called a [...] "neutral to drive" [...] accident).|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type <b>detent</b> on the shift sleeve and <b>detents</b> on the shift rail assists the driver in shifting quicker. The <b>detent</b> raises the force required to move the shift lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between the shift sleeve and the shift rail also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|R

50|$|Each IBM 1316 Disk Pack is 4 in high, weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and {{contains}} six 14 in diameter disks, yielding 10 recording surfaces (the outer surfaces are not used). The 10 individual read/write heads are {{mounted on a}} common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and mechanically <b>detented</b> at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack {{is covered with a}} clear plastic shell and a bottom cover when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the bottom cover. Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the plastic shell lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the plastic shell, which is then removed and the drive cover closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 2314 Disk Access Storage Facility was {{introduced}} on April 22, 1965, {{one year after}} the System/360 introduction. It was used with the System/360 and the System/370 lines. With the Two Channel Switch feature it could interface with two 360/370 channels. The 2314 Disk access mechanism was similar to the 2311, but further recording improvements allowed higher data density. The 2314 stored 29,176,000 characters (200×20×7294 bytes per track) on a single removable IBM 2316 disk pack which was similar in design to the 1316 but was taller as a result of increasing the number of disks from six to eleven. The 2316 disk pack containing the eleven 14 in diameter disks yielded 20 recording surfaces. The drive access consisted of 20 individual R/W heads mounted on a common actuator which was moved in and out hydraulically and mechanically <b>detented</b> at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks. Access time was initially the same as the 2311, but later models were faster as a result of improvements made in the hydraulic actuator. Data transfer rate was doubled to 310 kB/s.|$|E

50|$|The <b>detent</b> or {{chronometer}} escapement {{is considered}} the most accurate of the balance wheel escapements, and was used in marine chronometers, although some precision watches during the 18th and 19th century also used it. The early form was invented by Pierre Le Roy in 1748, who created a pivoted <b>detent</b> type of escapement, though this was theoretically deficient. The first effective design of <b>detent</b> escapement was invented by John Arnold around 1775, but with the <b>detent</b> pivoted. This escapement was modified by Thomas Earnshaw in 1780 and patented by Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783, however as depicted in the patent it was unworkable. Arnold also designed a spring <b>detent</b> escapement but, with improved design, Earnshaw's version eventually prevailed as the basic idea underwent several minor modifications {{during the last decade}} of the 18th century. The final form appeared around 1800, and this design was used until mechanical chronometers became obsolete in the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|Haptic technology, {{providing}} force cues {{and creating}} a pro-grammable physical instrument interface, can assist musi-cians in making gestures. The finite reaction time of the human motor control system implies that the execution of a brief musical gesture does not rely on immediate feedback from the senses, rather it is preprogrammed to some degree. Consequently, we suggest designing relatively simple and deterministic interfaces for providing haptic assistance. In this paper, we consider the specific problem of assist-ing a musician in selecting pitches from a continuous range. We build on a prior study by O’Modhrain of the accuracy of pitches selected by musicians on a Theremin-like haptic interface. To improve the assistance, we augment the inter-face with programmed <b>detents</b> so that the musician can feel the locations of equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, the musician can still perform arbitrary pitch inflections such as glissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various forms of haptic <b>detents,</b> including fixed <b>detent</b> levels and force-sensitive <b>detent</b> levels. Preliminary results from a subject test confirm improved accuracy in pitch selection brought about by <b>detents...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{have increased in}} the last four decades in high technology applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties and low weight. In the automotive industry carbon fiber have become popular exclusively in luxury cars because of its high cost. However, Carbon-glass hybrid composites offer an effective alternative to designers to implement fiber-reinforced composites into several conventional applications without a considerable price increase maintaining most of their mechanical properties. A door latch system is a complex mechanism that is under high loading conditions during car accidents such as side impacts and rollovers. Therefore, the Department of Transportation in The United States developed a series of tests that every door latch system comply in order to be installed in a vehicle. The implementation of fiber-reinforced {{composite materials}} in a door latch system was studied by analyzing the material behavior during the FMVSS No. 206 transverse test using computational efforts and experimental testing. Firstly, a computational model of the current forkbolt and <b>detent</b> structure was developed. Several efforts were conducted in order to create an effective and time efficient model. Two simplified models were implemented with two different contact interaction approaches. 9 composite materials were studied in forkbolt and 5 in <b>detent</b> including woven carbon fiber, unidirectional carbon fiber, woven carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites and unidirectional carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites. The computational model results showed that woven fiber-reinforced composite materials were stiffer than the unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite materials. For instance, a forkbolt made of woven carbon fibers was 20 % stiffer than a forkbolt made of unidirectional fibers symmetrically stacked in 0 ° and 90 ° alternating directions. Furthermore, Hybrid composite materials behaved as expected in forkbolt noticing a decline in the load-displacement slopes while the percentage of glass fiber increased. In the other hand, results showed that a <b>detent</b> made of only glass fiber layers was preferable than a carbon-glass fiber hybrid <b>detent</b> due to the high stresses shown in carbon fiber layers. Ultimately, forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were redesigned according to their functionality and test results. It was observed that the new design was stiffer than the original by showing a steeper load-displacement curve. Subsequently, an experimental procedure was performed in order to correlate computational model results. Fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were waterjet cut from a composite laminate manufactured by Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VART) process. Then, samples were tested according to the computational model. Six testing sample combinations of forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were tested including the top three woven iterations forkbolts from the computational model paired with woven and unidirectional glass fiber <b>detents.</b> Test results showed a stiffness drop of 15 % when the carbon fiber percentage decreases from 100 % to 75 %. Also, it was observed that woven glass fiber <b>detent</b> was superior to the unidirectional glass fiber <b>detent</b> by presenting a forkbolt-detent stiffness 38 % higher. Moreover, the new design of forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were tested showing a stiffness increment of 29 %. Furthermore, it was observed that fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and <b>detent</b> did not reach the desired load of 5000 N. However, the redesigned forkbolt made of 100 % woven carbon fiber and the redesign <b>detent</b> made of 100 % woven glass fiber were close to reach that load. The design review based on test results performed (DRBTR) showed that components did not fail where the computational model concluded to be the areas with the highest maximum principal stress. In contrast to the computational model, all samples failed at the contact area between forkbolt and <b>detent.</b> ...|$|R
