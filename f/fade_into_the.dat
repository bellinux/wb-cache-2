5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist.|$|E
5|$|The album {{version of}} the song runs for 5:47. It begins with a low note played on an {{electric}} guitar with heavy delay and distortion. The note is sustained for ten seconds as its harmonics gradually feed back. A pulsing rhythm guitar part with muted staccato chords by the Edge then begins underneath. After a further ten seconds it is joined by lower-register guitar drones played by the Edge, and a repetition of four descending piano notes performed by the Edge and Bono. Forty-five seconds into the song, halfway through the introduction, Clayton's bass and percussion by drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> song with producer Jacknife Lee's synthesizers, which play part of the melody line. The first verse begins at 1:20 and is accompanied by the bass, drums and rhythm guitar playing the chord progression A–E–D. This alters to B–D in the pre-chorus, with a short harmony vocal line leading to the E–D chorus.|$|E
25|$|Royal National Park {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of terrain. Roughly, landscapes in the park vary from coastal cliffs broken by beaches and small inlets to an ancient high plateau broken by extensive and deep river valleys. The river valleys drain from south to north where they run into Port Hacking, the extensive but generally shallow harbor inlet which forms the northern border of the park. When looking across the park from east to west (or vice versa) the rugged folds of valley after valley <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance.|$|E

25|$|By early June, the {{original}} ADC site at Padong was being shelled by 85mm field guns; it could reply {{with only a}} single 4.2 inch mortar. At 1445 hours 6 June, the PAVN roared in from the north in a ground assault. The Hmong retreated, leaving behind hand grenade booby traps littering their path through a cornfield. As the Vietnamese tripped the booby traps, Hmong troopers began to <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jungle. CIA agent Jack Shirley, a White Star Team, and the PARUs were picked up on 7 June and transferred some 12km southwest to Pha Khao to resume training ADC.|$|E
25|$|The series six opening titles have {{cut-outs}} of each character, as they <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{white screen}} and zoom {{in and out}} and eventually stop moving. The line-up {{from left to right}} is Abi, Michael, Susan, Ben, Janey and Roger. The titles remain the same for series seven and eight; the one difference is that Janey's clothes are changed. In series nine, the line-up changes due to Abi's departure {{at the end of the}} previous series. Her place is taken by Alfie, who has been a regular since series six but never appeared in the titles until the ninth series. Starting in the 2009 Christmas Special, Alfie has been replaced by Kenzo.|$|E
25|$|In {{the night}} of 29 October, 52 Indonesian volunteers sailed across the Straits of Malacca in commandeered fishing vessels, and landed {{on each side of}} the western mouth of the Kesang River. Their {{objective}} was to avoid being sighted initially by Malaysian security forces and slip quietly into the swampland, where they would attempt to blend in with the populace, begin sowing the seeds of rebellion, and launch guerrilla raids against Malaysian infrastructure. However, Malaysian fishermen spotted the raiders in the process of landing, and quickly informed the police. British troops of General Terence McMeekin's 28th Commonwealth Brigade were immediately directed to the scene, where they swept the region and killed or captured all but two of the invaders, who managed to <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. The remainder were swiftly shipped off to internment locations. The British were assisted by Australian troops of the Royal Australian Regiment's 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce McDonald, who had also received similar tip-offs and assisted in the rout of the Indonesian force.|$|E

The second logo was a spinning sphere and the title, now written in something close to Calibri, kept going around the opposite direction the sphere was going.

500|$|Negative {{opinions}} about the album stemmed from its lyrical content. Some critics {{have said that the}} serious nature of the lyrics are hard to digest. Others said Dreyer's lyrics and vocals still overshadow the instrumentation. Alex Andrews of Thrash Hits gave the album a four out of six rating, saying: [...] "The flipside of Dreyer's imposing presence is that it can be all too easy to let the rest of the band <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> background. It's a shame, because for the most part, there are some interesting things happening".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{has stated}} that Azaria {{possesses}} the ability to turn unfunny lines {{into some of the}} best in an episode, while former writer Jay Kogen stated: [...] "Just when I think I know [...] bag of tricks, he's always got a new thing he does to surprise me." [...] Throughout the run of The Simpsons, Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally. The Smurfs writer David N.

Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was [...] "by far" [...] her favorite actor, praising his [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "tendency to take small roles that would normally <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially [...]|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] on the Sgt. Pepper album (as first {{released}} on LP in the UK and years later worldwide on CD) is a high-frequency 15-kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced Beatles studio chatter. The frequency is {{best understood as}} what we know as a dog whistle as the frequency is {{picked up by a}} dog's ear and was part of their humour. They joked about picturing barking dogs should they be present when the album would finish. [...] Recorded two months after the mono and stereo masters for [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] had been finalised, the studio chatter (titled in the session notes [...] "Edit for LP End") was added to the run-out groove of the initial British pressing. There are even a few variations of the chatter, though the best known one is them saying during the laughter and chatter [...] "never could see any other way." [...] The Anthology 2 album includes an early, pre-orchestral version of the song and Anthology 3 includes a version of [...] "The End" [...] that concludes by having the last note <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> final chord of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (reversed, then played forwards). The Love version has the song starting with Lennon's intro of [...] "sugar plum fairy", with the strings being more prominent during the crescendos.|$|E

500|$|As the bell-making nears completion, Boriska’s {{confidence}} slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he’s succeeded at the task. The work crew {{takes over}} as Boriska makes several attempts to <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{background of the}} activity. Once the bell has been hoisted into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests. As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will have them all beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Prince had his brother, who raided Vladimir in The Raid sequence, beheaded.) There is a quiet, agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to {{the lip of the}} bell with each swing. A pan across the assembly reveals white-robed Durochka, leading a horse (preceded by a child, presumably hers) as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. [...] He admits his father never told him the secret of casting a bell. Andrei comforts him, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: “You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons.” Andrei sees Durochka, the boy, and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance.|$|E

2500|$|The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer {{tried to}} show, {{from his own}} imagination, {{the value of the}} eyespots as {{disruptive}} camouflage in a 1907 painting. He used the painting in his 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, denying the possibility of sexual selection and arguing that essentially all forms of animal coloration had evolved as camouflage. He was roundly criticized in a lengthy paper by Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote that Thayer had only managed to paint the peacock's plumage as camouflage by sleight of hand, [...] "with the blue sky showing through the leaves in just sufficient quantity here and there to warrant the author-artists explaining that the wonderful blue hues of the peacock's neck are obliterative because they make it <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky." ...|$|E

In 2011, Laura Pledger of Radio Times listed Kingston as the fourth best Doctor Who guest star, writing, [...] "For my money we’ve seen rather too much of River {{in the last two}} series, but there’s no denying Kingston has created a memorable character in Melody Pond." [...] Keith Phipps for The A.V. Club compared the Doctor and River's romantic storyline to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, [...] "if a bit more elegantly, for my money—it echoes the plight of anyone who's watched a loved one <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadowlands of dementia. This is not a story that ends well for River and she knows it, whatever flirtatious high spirits being around The Doctor stirs in her."

2500|$|Gears of War is a third-person shooter {{that places}} {{emphasis}} on using cover to avoid taking damage while moving towards enemy forces. The game uses {{a number of}} weapon archetypes, but predominately featured is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can deal melee damage at close range. Playable characters can carry two primary weapons, grenades, and a smaller, secondary weapon such as the Snub Pistol. Weapons are reloaded with a tap of the RB button, and a second tap within a given time (active reload) rewards the player with a damage bonus. However, failing to perform the [...] "Active Reload" [...] correctly will cause the gun to become momentarily jammed while the player's character fixes it. When the player takes damage, the [...] "Crimson Omen", a red cog representing the player's health gauge, will <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> screen, becoming more defined with larger amounts of damage.

[...] With a rating of 7/10 (flawed yet worthy), Spin magazine's Chris Norris said: [...] "Since Janet is State-of-the-art production right down to her sculpted nose, {{it makes sense that}} she should call her retrospective Design. As the studio team that wrought Control, Rhythm Nation and janet. (which for record-label reasons is under-represented here), designers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are unofficial second and third Janet Jacksons. Their triumph is letting their dazzling sound sculptures <b>fade</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> background of Janet's cartoon antics." [...] Elysa Gardner with [...] Vibe magazine was in high praise of Design of a Decade, as well as Jackson herself, stating, [...] "It's been almost 10 years since Janet Jackson announced that her first name wasn't Baby, and it's easy to forget what a bold proclamation that was coming from a woman—particularly a black woman—at that time [...] Only two women were there to remind the rest of us that there was power and freedom in feminine sexuality—to reinforce the fact that we could be adorable and flirtatious and strong and assertive. And Madonna wasn't a sista.
