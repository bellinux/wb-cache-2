Using a unique panel dataset, the authors combine propensity score matching techniques and fixed effects models to estimate the program's impact. Although the results vary according to the crops, the authors find consistent evidence that the program increased the rate of adoption of certified varieties and the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation.</b> However, there is only limited evidence of its effects on productivity, mostly derived from helping producers to cope with an illness of peach orchards. Conversely, the authors find some indications of negative lagged productivity effects for apples, which might be related to a short term cost of transitioning to new varieties or technologies. While the evidence of the effects on yields is not definitive due to the limited timeframe of the evaluation, the results indicate that PREDEG services were useful for incentivizing the adoption of specific technologies, as well as for crop-specific technical assistance like plant health...|$|E

The research method is using correlation analysis and descriptive to explain the distribution patterns, land burn time, and the public perception of combustion. The results showed: 1) there is a relationship between the purpose of combustion (open land and eradicate weeds) with the population, and there is no relationship between the objectives of land combustion on the combustion behavior of the land associated with the main types of cultivated plants, and there is a correlation to the density of hotspots, the density of dry land farming and bush, shrub/ swamp density, marsh density, <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation,</b> and density of open land. 2) The pattern of the farmers burning rice, horticulture and perenninal crops were classified into the type of the pattern of spots and the perception is part of a burning activities, type with ash beds and lodge with the perception of not being a part of burning activities, and type with only one time burning on the stages of land preparation, and type with in the eradication of weeds.

40|$|The water {{footprint}} of a crop is {{the volume of}} water {{that is necessary to}} produce, therefore relating crop water requirements and yield. The components of {{water footprint}}, blue, green and grey water footprints refer to the volumes of respectively, surface and groundwater, rainfall, and water required to assimilate pollution, which are used to produce the crop yield. Determining blue and green water footprints is generally achieved using estimates of evapotranspiration. In the present study we have used evapotranspiration measurements to estimate the water footprint of a super-intensive olive grove in southern Portugal. Crop water requirements were measured using a sap flow technique, to determine transpiration and the eddy covariance method for direct measurement of evapotranspiration. This technique was used for a short period, while the sap flow measurements were performed for long periods, hence allowing the extension of the data series. Evapotranspiration measured directly was in average close to 3 mm d- 1 and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration approached 0. 6 for the same period. The water footprint of the olive crop under study was lower than those reported in literature. A possible reason relates to the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation,</b> yield and irrigation management. The irrigated grove under study produced a high yield, which compensates for high water use, leading to a water footprint lower than for rainfed or less dense groves. Furthermore, as evapotranspiration measurements were used to calculate water footprint instead of the common procedure, this might have also caused some differences. As recently discussed in literature, remote sensing techniques can provide estimates of actual evapotranspiration and water balance terms when associated with modeling. For the present study, water footprint estimates using in situ evapotranspiration measurements were further compared with water footprint estimates obtained with remote sensing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The water {{footprint}} {{of a product}} {{can be described as}} the volume of freshwater used to produce it, associated to a geographic and temporal resolution. For crops, the {{water footprint}} relates crop water requirements and yield. The components of water footprint, blue, green and grey water footprints, refer to the volumes of respectively, surface and groundwater, rainfall, and water required to assimilate pollution, used to produce the crop yield. The global standard for crop water footprint assessment relies on evapotranspiration models to estimate green and blue water evapotranspiration. This approach has been {{used in the present study}} to estimate the water footprint of a very high density drip irrigated olive grove and further compared with data obtained from evapotranspiration measurements or from its components: the eddy covariance method to quantify latent heat flux, a heat dissipation sap flow technique to determine transpiration and microlysimeters to evaluate soil evaporation. The eddy covariance technique was used for short periods in 2011 and 2012, while sap flow measurements were performed continuously, hence allowing the extension of the data series. Measurements of evapotranspiration with the eddy covariance method provided an average close to 3. 4 mm d- 1 (2011) and 2. 5 mm d- 1 (2012). The ratio of evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration approached 0. 6 and 0. 4 for the respective periods. The water footprint of the olive crop under study, calculated with field data, was higher than the water footprint simulated using the global standard assessment and was lower than that reported in literature for olives. Lower values are probably related to differences in cultural practices, e. g., the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation,</b> harvesting techniques and irrigation management. The irrigated high-density olive grove under study had a high yield, which compensates for high water consumption, thus leading to a water footprint lower than the ones of rainfed or less dense groves. Other differences may relate to the procedures used to determine evapotranspiration...|$|E
40|$|Tropical forests {{have been}} {{perceived}} as biodiversity sanctuaries {{that should be}} preserved from human action. However, rural communities have lived in these forests over millennia using their biodiversity to satisfy {{a wide range of}} needs (timber, food, medicinal plants, etc.), without threatening the long run benefits they provide. Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) were identified as a valid option to achieve sustainable development. Recently, traditional forest management systems, created and implemented by rural communities, have been identified as another way to favor the sustainable use of these areas. Management practices are extremely complex and ever changing to fit the different environmental, cultural and economic conditions of each territory. The study conducted is focused in two traditional management systems in Indonesian forest, third country in extension of tropical forest after Brazil and Zaire. The resources studied, exploited in small management units (gardens), are benzoin resin (Styrax paralelloneurum) and rattan canes (Calamus caesius). Both are forest resources classified as NTFPs. Benzoin is a tree characteristic of mature forest that requires shade in the first stages of growth, therefore it is planted under forest cover once the undergrowth vegetation have been eliminated. After the first years the samplings need more sunlight so it become independent of the forest that provided shelter. Therefore regular clearance is practiced once the exploitation of the resin starts, seven to ten years after the planting. On the other hand, rattan is a multi stemmed climbing palm that it is established together with rice in shifting cultivation plots where all the vegetation have been eliminated. After one or two years the plot is abandoned and the rattan grows with the secondary vegetation. This palm will need trees to climb to so the canes have good quality. In this systems the silvicultural activities are directed to maintain a forest cover that it is not too dense, it would not allow sunlight to come in, not too open, which would restrict climbing possibilities. Silvicultural practices are human alterations of the natural dynamics of forest and therefore they can provoke structural changes in forest structure. Benzoin gardens the density of Styrax trees is the main discriminant variable. They can go from the plantation extreme (where 80 % of the trees above 10 cm dbh are cultivated) to the forest like extreme (benzoin represents 45 % of the stems), with presence of lianas, epiphytes and other elements of mature forest. In the first case, even with high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation</b> (477 tress/ha) the undergrowth vegetation is clear but diverse, which differentiate them from real plantations, that are monospecific, and that require in general external inputs. Rattan gardens on the other extreme are structurally more similar to a forest. Tree density (dbh³ 10 cm) ranges from 374 to 651 compare to 600 trees/ha in primary forest areas. Differences are related tree cover and size and with Calamus clusters density. This uniformity is an indication of the low intensity of management required to keep the gardens in good conditions. A parameter with major importance {{in the context of this}} work is the diversity this gardens hold compared to the one in mature forest areas...|$|E

Plantation {{cultivation}} of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestrisL.) {{in the world}} applies {{a longer period of}} time. The study of macroscopic properties and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>plantation</b> grown Scots pine from the area of Cazin in Bosnia and Herzegovina was carried out in order to acquire knowledge about the macroscopic characteristics and density so grown pine. Plantation growth (Buckman, 1985) is primarily carried out for species of wood which, in short rotation, accomplish the greatest financial and general useful functions in a given area. Under the provisions of ISO 3129 from year 1975, 76 test trees for studying were selected. From department 30 of unit Gata 40 test trees were taken, and from department 26 of unit Gata 36 test trees were taken. All relevant parameters were collected on selected test trees: geographical position, diameter at breast height, ground plan projection of tree top, tree orientation toward cardinal points, total tree height, height to first living branch and stump height (Kličić, 2006). Test trees were classified into three diameter classes: (1) 11 to 20 cm of diameter at breast height, (2) 21 to 30 cm of diameter at breast height and (3) 31 to 40 cm of diameter at breast height. From each test tree test sample of about 70 cm length was made, beginning at breast height. Following macroscopic properties were measured: ring width, latewood width and latewood percentage was calculated. Density was measured in oven dry condition and also basic density. The range of ring width of studied Scots pine is large and ranges from 0. 3 mm to 16. 6 mm, with mean value for all three diameter classes of 3. 6 mm. The range of ring width can be also seen through the variance of 4. 28. Mean values of ring width for each diameter class mutually differ significantly. Distribution trend of ring width in radial direction is downward, with no major signs of achieving more constant values for all diameter classes. Latewood percentage ranges from 1. 7 % to 90 % with mean value of 38. 6 % for all three diameter classes together. Distribution trend of latewood percentage in radial direction is growing. Density in oven dry condition ranges from 0. 308 g/cm 3 to 0. 690 g/cm 3, with mean value of 0. 469 g/cm 3 for all three diameter classes. Wood in trees of diameter at breast height from 11 to 20 cm has mean value of density in oven dry condition of 0. 482 g/cm 3, in trees of diameter at breast height from 21 to 30 cm mean value of density in oven dry condition is 0. 481 g/cm 3, and in trees of diameter at breast height from 31 to 40 cm is 0. 453 g/cm 3. Mean value of density in oven dry condition for all three diameter classes is significantly different. Distribution trend of density in oven dry condition is growing for all three diameter classes, without any indication of achieving more constant values. Basic density ranges from 0. 283 g/cm 3 to 0. 644 g/cm 3, with mean value of 0. 419 g/cm 3 for all three diameter classes together.

O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi inteiramente casualizados em esquema fatorial (3 x 4), sendo três doses de nitrogênio (0, 267 e 534 kg ha- 1 ciclo fonte ureia) e quatro doses de K 2 O (200, 800, 1600 e 2400 kg ha- 1 ciclo- fonte KCl) conduzidas em três densidades de plantio, com três repetições, foram utilizadas mudas da cultivar Nanicão 2001 proveniente de cultura de tecidos. Os tratamentos foram parceladas em quatro épocas (planta mãe), foram coletadas amostras de solo na profundidade de 0 - 20 cm e 20 - 40 cm, para determinação do pH (água), P, K, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ca, Mg, H+Al, N total e matéria orgânica e amostras de tecido vegetal (folhas) sendo utilizada a 3 ª folha para diagnóstico foliar. Os frutos foram analisados quanto ao diâmetro e comprimento, as relações polpa/casca, número de frutos por penca, número de pencas, comprimento do fruto, resistência da polpa, produtividade, teor de sólidos solúveis (grau brix) e acidez titulável. Os resultados mostram que para se obter o máximo de produtividade, independentemente das doses de N e K, os teores de P, Ca, Mg, S e dos micronutrientes têm que estar dentro ou um pouco acima das faixas consideradas adequadas. Os atributos químicos do solo (pH, P, Na, Ca, Mg, H+Al, Al, N total, MO, Cu, Fe, Mn e Zn) foram afetados pelo adensamento das plantas e tratamentos aplicados (doses de N e K). Com o aumento da densidade de plantio houve incremento na produção, porém, prolongou a produtividade anual, com aumento gradativo do ciclo; O tamanho do cacho, número de pencas, textura, acidez, sólidos solúveis não apresentaram correlação entre si e nem entre os teores foliares e do fruto de N e K. Devido a não significância entre as doses 267 e 534 kg ha- 1 de N na produtividade, recomenda-se no espaçamento 3 m x 1 m, utilizar a menor dose de N, diminuindo o elevado custo de produção do bananal na região, ocasionado pelo alto preço dos fertilizantes.

Para descobrir quais são as formas de obter uma alta produtividade e produtos com teores de óleos essenciais e com boa qualidade é necessário submeter as plantas às mais diferentes condições, entre elas: época de cultivo (primavera-verão e outono-inverno), intervalo de corte, estágios ontogenéticos (fases que possuem melhor concentração de óleo), espaçamento, densidade de plantio, podas, condições climáticas, formas de cultivo como hidroponia, estufa e campo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi submeter plantas de melissa, ao mesmo tempo, a dois tipos de adubação e dois sistemas de cultivo em duas épocas distintas (primavera/verão e outono/inverno), nas condições de Uberlândia, MG, Brasil, para avaliar a produção vegetal e de óleo essencial. O experimento foi conduzido em campo e em estufa na Fazenda Experimental do Glória, pertencente à Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU). Foram realizados dois experimentos em duas épocas distintas, caracterizadas como primavera/verão e outono/inverno. O primeiro experimento ocorreu entre os meses de outubro de 2009 e fevereiro de 2010 e o segundo entre os meses de maio e agosto de 2010. O delineamento experimental utilizado nos dois experimentos foi de blocos casualizados (DBC), em esquema fatorial 2 x 2, com cinco repetições, sendo dois sistemas de cultivo (estufa e campo) e dois tipos de adubação (mineral e orgânica). Foram avaliadas altura da planta, comprimento e largura foliar, massa fresca e seca, teor, rendimento e composição de óleo essencial. A época primavera/verão e o cultivo na estufa proporcionaram as melhores condições para o bom desenvolvimento da melissa. As maiores médias de altura foram encontradas na estufa utilizando a adubação orgânica nas duas épocas de estudo. A adubação não interferiu no rendimento de óleo essencial de melissa para época primavera/verão. A produção de biomassa de melissa foi consideravelmente maior na época primavera/verão, em relação a outono/inverno, assim como na estufa, em relação ao campo, nas duas épocas. A composição química do óleo foi semelhante para as plantas cultivadas em ambiente protegido e campo, para massa fresca e massa seca, prevalecendo como constituintes majoritários o neral, o geranial e o citronelal nas duas épocas de estudo. A época outono/inverno não favoreceu tanto a produção dos constituintes majoritários (neral e geranial), como na primavera/verão. A maior disponibilidade de nutrientes pela adubação orgânica, associada ao aumento da umidade do solo, permitiu o aumento da biomassa.

Height of the plant, length and foliar width, cool mass had been evaluated and dry, essential oil text, income and composition. The time spring/summer and the culture in the greenhouse had provided the best conditions for the good development of lemon balm. The average greaters of height had been found in the greenhouse using the organic fertilization at the two times of study. The fertilization did not intervene with the essential oil income of lemon balm for time spring/summer. The production of biomass of lemon balm was considerably bigger at the time spring/summer in relation the autumn/winter, as well as in the greenhouse in relation to the field at the two times. The chemical composition of the oil was similar for the plants cultivated in protecting environment and field, for cool mass and dry mass, taking advantage as constituent majority the neral, the geranial and the citronelal at the two times of study. The time autumn/winter in such a way did not favor the production of the majority constituent (neral and geranial) as in the spring/summer.

This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} predominance of sandy soil in the area where Scots pine has no competitors. Calculated total volume per hectare for 15 - and 35 -year-old trees was higher in all the forests except for Voskresenskoe forest and Staroustinskoe forest. Scots pine standing volume is higher in all the forests except Scientific and Experimental forest (15  years old), Agryzskoe forest (15  years old) and Voskresenskoe forest (15 and 35  years old).

Nematodes extracted from wood samples were identified as a species of Bursaphelenchus. The recovery of nematodes from affected trees varied between specimens collected from different locations. The highest <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> nematodes were found in samples collected at K’Long K’Lanh and Cam Ly. Based on the morphological characteristics of adult sawyer beetles, all were identified as the Japanese sawyer beetle. Sawyer beetles have two emergence periods each year, the first lasting from the end of March to early July and the second from September to the end of October. The largest numbers of adults emerged at the end of April {{and at the end of}} September. Stems of 3 -year-old Pinus kesiya were inoculated with cultured nematodes and the pathogenicity of the Bursaphelenchus sp. was demonstrated...|$|R

Mean <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plantation</b> was 573 TPA (Trees per Acre) while the natural stand averaged 328 TPA, with a slightly higher <b>density</b> <b>of</b> 390 TPA in the study area. Total cycle time was not significantly different between the two stands and averaged 66. 8 seconds. The feller-buncher harvested an average of 6. 3 trees per min and 7. 1 trees per accumulation. Productivity of the fellerbuncher in the plantation averaged 77. 9 green tons per PMH (Productive Machine Hour) with a mean tree size of 0. 19 green tons.

Radiotelemetry data {{were used to}} define territory boundaries, and I tested for effects on territory {{size and shape of}} landscape habitat composition and foraging patch configuration. Tuamotu kingfisher territories were larger in areas with reduced <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> coconut <b>plantation</b> foraging habitat, and territories were less circular in the study site that had a single slender patch of foraging habitat. Maximum territory length did not differ between study sites, however, which suggested that the size of Tuamotu kingfisher territories might be bounded by the combined influence of maximum travel distances and habitat configurations. Results also suggested that birds enlarge territories as they age. Together, results supported previous work indicating that territory configurations represent a balance between the costs of defending a territory and gains from territory ownership...|$|R

If {{a significant proportion}} of this resource is to be used for sawlog production, it is necessary to design effective silvicultural systems, particularly thinning procedures. A thinning trial was carried out at two sites in QLD and two in NSW. Each was planted with two species, Eucalyptus dunnii and Corymbia citriodora ssp. variegata. The original stocking <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plantations</b> at planting was 1000 – 1300 trees per hectare. When the trees were 6 – 8 years of age, three treatments were applied in randomised complete block designs: an unthinned control, 550 and 300 stems per hectare residual stocking. Basal area increment after thinning was affected by site quality but was not affected by thinning treatments for either species. Mean diameter increment was significantly greater in the thinned stands of both species for all trees in the stand and for the largest 250 trees per hectare. The similarity of basal area growth and difference in diameter growth gives good management flexibility as all treatments at all sites were fully utilising site resources.

Trees minimize water stress effects by leaf osmotic adjustments which are dependent on K ions. Eucalyptus plantations were established in tropical and subtropical soils especially poor in K. Fertilization by substitution of K by Na is a potential alternative way, at lower cost and greater availability, that is especially suitable for smallholder plantations. For these reasons, we studied respective K and Na fertilization effects on growth and basic wood <b>density</b> <b>of</b> Eucalyptus grandis <b>plantations</b> with different objectives (domestic energy, timber). Significant differences in volume of trunk and wood density were observed on 8 -year-old E. grandis trees fertilized with Na vs. K and the control. Trees with Na fertilization showed a significantly higher volume with Na vs. the control and a lower volume vs. K. Wood density and radial variability were significantly lower compared to trees with K and the control.

40|$|M. Sc. The foresty {{industry}} {{is a very important}} industry m South Africa. Forestry is mostly practised in rural areas. Commercial plantations cover only 1. 18 % of the area of South Africa, with Mpumalanga Province having the largest area and greatest <b>density</b> <b>of</b> commercial <b>plantations.</b> This is because Mpumalanga province is physiographically and climatically conducive to afforestation. The study area, quaternary catchment X 22 D, is situated in Mpumalanga province; about 80 percent of this catchment is afforested with pine. The hydrological impact of afforestation in the study area is estimated in this study using two models, namely Shell and Affdem 3. The impact of afforestation on surface flow depends on the percentage of the afforested area in a catchment, the rotational period, the genera, and the availability of water. As the percentage of afforested area in a catchment increases, so does the consumption of water by the trees increase. This author found that there is a positive relationship between the consumption of water by trees, and the rotational period and the availability of water. Also: Eucalyptus and Pine are consuming more water than Wattle. Understanding these effects of afforestation on water resources at the level of a quaternary catchment is a fundamental requirement in optimal water resource allocation and the long-term sustainable use of water.

Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and aspen (Populus tremula) were preferred-food compared to pine and both silver birch (Betula pendula) and pubescent birch (B. pubescens). However, rowan and aspen were not capable of withstanding continuous browsing by moose owing to their diminished biomass. The browsing intensity (number of browsed twigs/tree) on pine and birch was about twice that on rowan and aspen. The number of browsed twigs per tree increased {{as the amount of}} available main branches increased. The number of bites per available branch, as well as the maximum diameter of the bites, decreased as the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plantation</b> increased.

5000|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Cepas del Mundo" [...] (1997), José Peñín gives {{the origin of}} Airén as being in La Mancha, from where two thirds of all the grapes grown in Spain come from. It is {{absolutely}} the dominant variety in this region, especially so in Ciudad Real and Toledo, and slightly less so in Albacete and Cuenca. It {{can also be found}} further south in Montilla-Moriles. Peñín describes the wine made from Airén as follows: Airén has had a bad press, more due to the processes used which never did it justice, rather than for the quality of the vine itself. In the past, there was a double problem of low productivity, due mainly to the low <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plantations,</b> along with the traditional method of fermenting in terra cotta fermentation vats. In addition, almost all the wine was sent to other regions to mix in with other musts or for distillation. In general, the wine Airén are characterised by a pallid colour with yellow iridescences; in the nose, mature fruit can be noted (banana, pineapple or grapefruit), and in the mouth, despite a certain lack of acidity, they are quite tasty and pleasant, easy to drink, though not ‘elegant’. The best ones have a fresh bouquet of roses, with a fine harmonious taste that does not leave false tastes {{at the back of the}} mouth. Peñín goes on to comment on the agronomic characteristics: [...] Late sprouting and maturing variety. Alcoholic content of about 13 or 14°. The vine is perfectly adapted to the harsh arid climate of La Mancha, its calcareous soils, and at up to 700 m above sea level. It is very resistant to drought and to diseases, which explains its extensive planting after the phylloxera crisis.|$|R
