50|$|Individuals with <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures</b> usually {{experience}} pain in {{the upper}} neck but no neurological signs. The fracture may also cause damage to the arteries in the neck, resulting in lateral medullary syndrome, Horner's syndrome, ataxia, and the inability to sense pain or temperature.|$|R
40|$|Background: Majority of C 1 {{fractures}} can {{be effectively}} treated conservatively by immobilization or traction {{unless there is}} an injury to the transverse ligament. Conservative treatment usually involves {{a long period of}} immobilization in a halo-vest. Surgical intervention generally involves fusion, eliminating the motion of the upper cervical spine. We describe the treatment of unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures</b> designed to avoid these problems of both conservative and invasive methods. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 12 patients with unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures</b> treated with transoral osteosynthesis of C 1 between July 2008 and December 2011 was performed. A steel plate and C 1 lateral mass screw fixation were used to repair the unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures.</b> Our study group included eight males and four females with an average age of 33 years (range 23 - 62 years). Results: Patients were followed up for an average of 16 months after surgery. Range of motion of the cervical spine was by and large physiologic: Average flexion 35 ° (range 28 - 40 °), average extension 42 ° (range 30 - 48 °). Lateral bending to the right and left averaged 30 ° and 28 ° respectively (range 12 - 36 ° and 14 - 32 ° respectively). The average postoperative rotation of the atlantoaxial joint, evaluated by functional computed tomography scan was 60 ° (range 35 - 72 °). Total average lateral displacement of the lateral masses was 7. 0 mm before surgery (range 5 - 12 mm), which improved to 3. 5 mm after surgery (range 1 - 6. 5 mm). The total average difference of the atlanto-dens interval in flexion and extension after surgery was 1. 0 mm (range 1 - 3 mm). Conclusions: Transoral osteosynthesis of the anterior ring using C 1 lateral mass screws is a viable option for treating unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures,</b> which allows maintenance of rotation at the C 1 -C 2 joint and restoration of congruency of the atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Jefferson</b> <b>{{fracture}}</b> is a {{bone fracture}} of the anterior and posterior arches of the C1 vertebra, {{though it may}} also appear as a three- or two-part fracture.

40|$|Background: Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the management of}} unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures,</b> with some surgeons performing reduction and immobilization of the patient in a halo vest and others performing open reduction and internal fixation. This study compares the clinical and radiological outcome parameters between posterior atlantoaxial fusion (AAF) and occipitocervical fusion (OCF) constructs {{in the treatment of}} the unstable atlas fracture. Materials and Methods: 68 consecutive patients with unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fractures</b> treated by AAF or OCF between October 2004 and March 2011 were included in this retrospective evaluation from institutional databases. The authors reviewed medical records and original images. The patients were divided into two surgical groups treated with either AAF (n = 48, F/M 30 : 18) and OCF (n = 20, F/M 13 : 7) fusion. Blood loss, operative time, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, atlanto-dens interval, lateral mass displacement, complications, and the bone fusion rates were recorded. Results: Five patients with incomplete paralysis (7. 4 %) demonstrated postoperative improvement by more than 1 grade on the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale. The JOA score of the AAF group improved from 12. 5 ± 3. 6 preoperatively to 15. 7 ± 2. 3 postoperatively, while the JOA score of the OCF group improved from 11. 2 ± 3. 3 preoperatively to 14. 8 ± 4. 2 postoperatively. The VAS score of AAF group decreased from 4. 8 ± 1. 5 preoperatively to 1. 0 ± 0. 4 postoperatively, the VAS score of the OCF group decreased from 5. 4 ± 2. 2 preoperatively to 1. 3 ± 0. 9 postoperatively. Conclusions: The OCF or AAF combined with short-term external immobilization can establish the upper cervical stability and prevent further spinal cord injury and nerve function damage...|$|R
40|$|Nonsurgical {{treatment}} of <b>Jefferson</b> burst <b>fractures</b> (JBF) confers increased rates of C 1 – 2 malunion with potential for cranial settling and neurologic sequels. Hence, fusion C 1 – 2 {{was recognized as}} the superior treatment for displaced JBF, but sacrifies C 1 – 2 motion. Ruf et al. introduced the C 1 -ring osteosynthesis (C 1 –RO). First results were favorable, but C 1 –RO was not without criticism {{due to the lack}} of clinical and biomechanical data serving evidence that C 1 –RO is safe in displaced JBF with proven rupture of the transverse atlantal ligament (TAL). Therefore, our objectives were to perform a biomechanical analysis of C 1 –RO for the {{treatment of}} displaced <b>Jefferson</b> burst <b>fractures</b> (JBF) with incompetency of the TAL. Five specimens C 0 – 2 were subjected to loading with posteroanterior force transmission in an electromechanical testing machine (ETM). With the TAL left intact, loads were applied posteriorly via the C 1 –RO ramping from 10 to 100  N. Atlantoaxial subluxation was measured radiographically in terms of the anterior antlantodental interval (AADI) with an image intensifier placed surrounding the ETM. Load–displacement data were also recorded by the ETM. After testing the TAL-intact state, the atlas was osteotomized yielding for a JBF, the TAL and left lateral joint capsule were cut and the C 1 –RO was accomplished. The C 1 –RO was subjected to cyclic loading, ramping from 20 to 100  N to simulate post-surgery in vivo loading. Afterwards incremental loading (10 – 100  N) was repeated with subsequent increase in loads until failure occurred. Small differences (1 – 1. 5  mm) existed between the radiographic AADI under incremental loading (10 – 100  N) with the TAL-intact as compared to the TAL-disrupted state. Significant differences existed for the beginning of loading (10  N, P =  0. 02). Under physiological loads, the increase in the AADI within the incremental steps (10 – 100  N) was not significantly different between TAL-disrupted and TAL-intact state. Analysis of failure load (FL) testing showed no significant differences among the radiologically assessed displacement data (AADI) and that of the ETM (P =  0. 5). FL was Ø 297. 5  ±  108. 5  N (range 158. 8 – 449. 0  N). The related displacement assessed by the ETM was Ø 5. 8  ±  2. 8  mm (range 2. 3 – 7. 9). All specimens succeeded a FL > 150  N, four of them > 250  N and three of them > 300  N. In the TAL-disrupted state loads up to 100  N were transferred to C 1, but the radiographic AADI did not exceed 5  mm in any specimen. In conclusion, reconstruction after displaced JBF with TAL and one capsule disrupted using a C 1 –RO involves imparting an axial tensile force to lift C 0 into proper alignment to the C 1 – 2 complex. Simultaneous compressive forces on the C 1 -lateral masses and occipital condyles allow for the recreation of the functional C 0 – 2 ligamentous tension band and height. We demonstrated that under physiological loads, the C 1 –RO restores sufficient stability at C 1 – 2 preventing significant translation. C 1 –RO might be a valid alternative for the treatment of displaced JBF in comparison to fusion of C 1 – 2...|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of surgery}} {{to treat a}} <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> is {{somewhat}} controversial. [...] Non-surgical treatment varies depending on if the fracture is stable or unstable, defined by an intact or broken transverse ligament and degree of fracture of the anterior arch. [...] An intact ligament {{requires the use of}} a soft or hard collar, while a ruptured ligament may require traction, a halo or surgery. The use of rigid halos can lead to intracranial infections and are often uncomfortable for individuals wearing them, and may be replaced with a more flexible alternative depending on the stability of the injured bones, but treatment of a stable injury with a halo collar can result in a full recovery. [...] Surgical treatment of a <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> involves fusion or fixation of the first three cervical vertebrae; fusion may occur immediately, or later during treatment in cases where non-surgical interventions are unsuccessful. [...] A primary factor in deciding between surgical and non-surgical intervention is the degree of stability as well as the presence of damage to other cervical vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> can be {{associated}} with this injury, with the C1 ring, or atlas, being fractured in several places, allowing the spine to shift forward relative to the skull base. The Hangman's fracture which is a fracture of the C2 vertebral body or dens of the cervical spine upon which the skull base sits to allow the head to rotate, can also {{be associated}} with atlanto-occipital dislocation. Despite its eponym, the fracture is not usually associated with a hanging mechanism of injury.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A bipartite atlas {{is a rare}} {{coincidental}} finding, and it {{is reported}} in only 0. 1 % of the general population. It is a congenital disorder characterized by incomplete fusion of the anterior and the posterior arches of C 1, {{and it is important}} to differentiate it from a <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture.</b> STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Case report and literature review. PURPOSE: To report three cases of patients with bipartition of the atlas with a focus on imaging. To review the literature on these fusion defects, the embryologic basis, and the differentiation from a <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture.</b> METHODS: We report three cases of patients with a bipartite atlas as a coincidental finding in a trauma setting. The bipartite atlas was assessed by multidetector computed tomography (CT). The first case, for example, describes a 36 -year-old patient who was struck by a moped. The CT of the skull showed a bipartite atlas as an additional finding. The embryologic development of C 1 is reviewed and also the imaging features and the management. Furthermore, a CT image of a <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> is provided for comparison. RESULTS: The CT scans of the three patients show midline clefts of the anterior and the posterior arches of C 1 with similar imaging features: smooth margins lined by cortical bone and no lateral offset. The patients had no neurological symptoms relating to the C 1 abnormality, and no follow-up was performed. The clefts at level C 1 are the result of the failure of three ossification centers to fuse properly. Anterior and posterior clefts are caused by hypoplasia of the hypochordal bow and lateral parts of the C 1 sclerotome, respectively. Because of the risk of instability, assessing atlantoaxial stability is advised. However, patients usually have no symptoms and require no specific treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A bipartite atlas is a rare congenital abnormality, caused by a failure of anterior and lateral ossification centers to fuse. It needs to be differentiated from a <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> in a trauma setting. It usually requires no specific treatment. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{describe}} a modified technique for the reduction and stabilization of unstable Jefferson fractures. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present {{the case of an}} isolated unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> in a 33 -year-old woman. The patient was the victim of a motor vehicle accident. Her neurological examination was normal. A cervical computed tomographic scan revealed an isolated <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> that we thought to be unstable when we applied the Spence criteria. TECHNIQUE: The fracture was treated by a technical variant of C 1 -C 2 posterior fixation with compression on the rods by means of a crosslink connector, allowing the reduction of the atlantoaxial lateral mass overhanging. C 1 -C 2 fusion with posterior iliac crest bone graft was added. CONCLUSION: The 1 -year radiological follow-up evaluation showed a complete consolidation of the fracture lines and atlantoaxial stability. This technique could be an option for the reduction and stabilization of the unstable Jefferson fractures...|$|E
30|$|Initially {{described}} by Sir Geoffrey Jefferson, atlas fractures {{can be classified}} as type I which are fractures involving the posterior arch alone, type II fractures which involve the anterior arch alone, type III (the classical <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture)</b> which are bilateral posterior arch fractures associated with a unilateral or bilateral anterior arch fracture, type IV which involve the lateral mass and type V (Fig.  17 a and b) which are transverse fractures of the anterior arch [29, 68, 69]. A crucial stabiliser of the atlanto-axial articulation is the transverse ligament {{and the integrity of}} this ligament determines the stability or instability of atlas fractures.|$|E
30|$|A {{variety of}} {{structural}} developmental anomalies affect the vertebral column. Malformed vertebrae can arise secondary to errors of vertebral formation, fusion and/or segmentation and developmental variation. Malformations can be simple {{with little or}} no clinical consequence, or complex with serious structural and neurologic implications. These anomalies can occasionally mimic acute trauma (bipartite atlas versus <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture,</b> butterfly vertebra versus burst fracture), or predispose the affected individual to myelopathy. Accurate imaging interpretation of vertebral malformations requires knowledge of ageappropriate normal, variant and abnormal vertebral morphology and the clinical implications of each entity. This knowledge will improve diagnostic confidence in acute situations and confounding clinical scenarios.|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of unstable burst fractures of the atlas (Jefferson fractures) is controversial. Unstable Jefferson fractures have been managed successfully with either immobilization, typically halo traction or halo vest, or surgery. We report {{a patient with}} an unstable <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> treated nonoperatively with a cervical collar, frequent clinical examinations, and flexion-extension radiographs. Twelve months after treatment, the patient achieved painless union of his fracture. The successful treatment confirms prior studies reporting unstable Jefferson fractures have been treated nonoperatively. The outcome challenges the clinical relevance of treatment algorithms that rely on the “rules of Spence” to guide {{treatment of}} unstable Jefferson fractures and illustrates instability {{may not necessarily be}} present in patients with considerable lateral mass widening. Additionally, it emphasizes a more reliable way of assessing C 1 –C 2 stability in unstable Jefferson fractures is by measuring the presence and extent of anterior subluxation on lateral flexion and extension views...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{this study}} we aimed to {{investigate}} the efficacy, long term result and associated complications of Halo Vest treatment for patients with upper cervical spine fractures. Methods: This study included 13 patients (11 men and 2 women) who applied Halo Vest treatment for traumatic upper cervical vertebral fracture between 2006 and 2011. We reviewed the radiological and clinical findings of patients {{before and after the}} treatment. Results: Six of 13 patients had odontoid type 3 fracture, 2 patients had odontoid type 2 fracture with C 1 type 1 fracture, 2 patients had odontoid type 2 fracture with <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture,</b> one patient had type 2 hangman fracture and two patients had unclassified C 2 corpus fractures. The mean follow-up time with Halo Vest was 14 weeks (10 - 21 weeks). Ten patients had bone fusion and the mean time of bone fusion was 12 weeks. Conclusions: Halo Vest treatment for upper cervical spine fracture is a safe and effective method but the patients comfort and satisfaction are low.

40|$|Traditionally, {{fractures}} of the dens {{have been}} classified {{according to the}} scheme proposed by Anderson and D’Alonzo, who divided these fractures into three types: type 1, involving {{the apex of the}} dens; type 2, reaching through the base of the dens; and type 3, extending into the body of C- 2 (1). Vertical fractures of the dens are thought to occur separately from those mentioned above. When isolated (pure), verti-cal dens fractures may be considered a fourth type; however, vertical dens fractures com-monly occur in association with other fractures of the atlas and axis. The mechanism of injury responsible for the more common dens frac-tures is accepted to be related to a combination of hyperextension, hyperflexion, and rotation (2). The mechanism responsible for pure verti-cal dens fractures, however, has not been reli-ably established. In this article, we review the imaging features in three cases of vertical dens fractures. In all cases, type 2 fractures were also present and in one case a unilateral <b>Jefferson</b> <b>fracture</b> was also present. Materials and Methods Three adult men (age range, 35 to 70 years) were admitted to the emergency department after high-speed motor vehicle accidents (n 5 2) or after being hit on the vertex of the head by a large piece of ice falling from a roof (n 5 1). All patients were initially examined with cross-table lateral radiography of the cervical spine followed immediately by computed tomography (CT) in which 3 -mm-thick contiguous axial sections were obtained {{from the base of the}} skull to C- 3.
