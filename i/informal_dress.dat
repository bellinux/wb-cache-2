5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally <b>informal</b> <b>dress</b> code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1993 {{parliamentary}} election, Ryan was one {{of three}} nominee candidates for the Socialist Left Party's list in Nord-Trøndelag. Ryan was nominated on third place on the list, after Jorunn Hageler and Inge Staldvik. Hageler was elected to parliament, and Ryan was her second deputy during the term 1993 to 1997. Prior to the 1997 election, Ryan was launched as an alternative top candidate for Nord-Trøndelag. At the nomination meeting, Hageler won 23 against Ryan's 13 votes, and Ryan was placed on second place on the list. After the nomination, Hageler stated that she regretted having said that Ryan was less suitable to sit in parliament than she was, because of his down-to-earth appeal and <b>informal</b> <b>dress</b> code. The party failed to win a seat from the county in 1997. Ryan was a possible candidate to become deputy party leader of his party in 1997, but was instead appointed as central board member. He became deputy leader in 1999, a position he held until 2001.|$|E
2500|$|In clothing, a suit {{is a set}} of {{garments}} {{made from}} the same cloth, usually consisting of at least a jacket and trousers. Lounge suits (also known as business suits when sober in colour and style), which originated [...] in Britain as country wear, are the most common style of Western suit. Other types of suit still worn today are the dinner suit, part of black tie, which arose as a lounging alternative to dress coats {{in much the same way}} as the day lounge suit came to replace frock coats and morning coats; and, rarely worn today, the morning suit. [...] This article discusses the lounge suit (including business suits), elements of <b>informal</b> <b>dress</b> code.|$|E

50|$|She {{was known}} for chinoiserie, {{displayed}} in the Chinese wallpapers of her often-photographed drawing room, and for baroque and rococo Venetian, South German and Austrian furniture, {{at a time when}} conservative New York tastes ran to Louis XV and English Georgian furnishings.

She brought chintz to <b>informal</b> <b>dressing</b> rooms and bedrooms, inaugurated the vogue for smoked mirrors veined with gold and extended her love of reflective and lacquered surfaces to lacquered walls, satin upholstery and the metallic wallpapers she invented.|$|R
60|$|The concert on Thursday {{night was}} better attended, but Mrs. Kearney saw {{at once that}} the house was filled with paper. The {{audience}} behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an <b>informal</b> <b>dress</b> rehearsal. Mr. Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs. Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He {{stood at the edge of}} the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of the evening, Mrs. Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr. Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it was true.|$|E

60|$|Waterville {{was struck}} with his coolness. He admired it; for, after all, he noted, {{it must have}} been disagreeable to him to be interrupted. He felt rather an ass, and wished he had kept hold of Mrs. April, to give him the air of having come for her sake. Mrs. Headway was looking adorably fresh in attire that Waterville, who had his ideas on such matters, felt sure wouldn’t be {{regarded}} as the proper thing for a Sunday morning in an English country-house: a négligé of white flounces and frills interspersed with yellow ribbons—a garment Madame de Pompadour might have sported to receive Louis XV., but probably wouldn’t have worn for a public airing. The sight of this costume gave the finishing touch to his impression that she knew on the whole what she was about. She would take a line of her own; she wouldn’t be too accommodating. She wouldn’t come down to breakfast; she wouldn’t go to church; she would wear on Sunday mornings little elaborately <b>informal</b> <b>dresses</b> and look dreadfully un-British and un-Protestant. Perhaps after all this was best. She began to talk with a certain volubility.|$|R

The officiating {{chaplain}} Humphrey Tyndall later remarked that the bride wore a [...] "loose gown" [...] (an <b>informal</b> morning <b>dress),</b> which has triggered modern speculation {{that she was pregnant}} and that the ceremony happened under pressure from her father. The marriage was, however, in planning between Leicester and his wedding guests for almost a year. While Lettice Devereux may well have been pregnant, there is no further indication as to this. The marriage date coincided {{with the end of the}} customary two-years-mourning for a widow.|$|R

2500|$|Family portraits tended, as in Flanders, {{to be set}} {{outdoors}} in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively <b>informal</b> in <b>dress</b> and mood. [...] Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among {{the large numbers of}} civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's schutterij or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially {{in the first half of}} the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. [...] Rembrandt's Syndics of the Drapers' Guild is a subtle treatment of a group round a table.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fashion of}} the Gibson Girl allowed them {{a much more}} active {{lifestyle}} then previously, in both work and recreation. [...] "Skirts were long and flared, and dresses were tailored with high necks and close-fitting sleeves. The style was considered masculine, and this was sometimes emphasized by wearing a necktie.

Gibson shows off the classic Gibson Girl as a figure who embraced outdoor physical activities." ...|$|R
50|$|The sack-back gown or robe à la française was a women's {{fashion of}} the 18th century. At the {{beginning}} of the century, the sack-back gown was a very <b>informal</b> style of <b>dress.</b> At its most informal, it was unfitted both front and back and called a sacque, contouche, or robe battante. By the 1770s the sack-back gown was second only to court dress in its formality. This style of gown had fabric at the back arranged in box pleats which fell loose from the shoulder to the floor with a slight train. In front, the gown was open, showing off a decorative stomacher and petticoat. It would have been worn with a wide square hoop or panniers under the petticoat. Scalloped ruffles often trimmed elbow-length sleeves, which were worn with separate frills called engageantes.|$|R

50|$|In recent decades, some {{churches have}} {{encouraged}} a more <b>informal</b> <b>dress</b> code. Among {{the first to}} adopt this policy were the Calvary Chapel associated churches. Many clergy members, especially those in denominations and religious groups formed in the 20th century, have abandoned the traditional robes and vestments in favor of business casual clothing. This change was made to close the perceived gap between the clergy and laypersons. Some even wear jeans and other everyday casual wear if the members have chosen to dress casual as well. In many other churches, clergy continue to wear vestments while encouraging congregants to dress however they prefer.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 18th century, the term had {{referred}} to learned people of both sexes. It subsequently was applied primarily to intellectual women, and the French equivalent bas bleu {{had a similar}} connotation. The term later developed negative implications, {{and in some instances}} such women were stereotyped as being [...] "frumpy". The reference to blue stockings may arise from the time when woollen worsted stockings were <b>informal</b> <b>dress,</b> in contrast to formal, fashionable black silk stockings. Curiously, the most frequent such reference is to a man, Benjamin Stillingfleet, who reportedly lacked the formal black stockings, yet still participated in the Blue Stockings Society.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the death}} of her protector, the placée and her family could, on legal challenge, expect up to a third of the man's property.

She could also become a placée to another white Creole. She sometimes taught her daughters to become placées, by education and <b>informal</b> schooling in <b>dress,</b> comportment, and ways to behave. A mother negotiated with a young man for the dowry or property settlement, sometimes by contract, for her daughter if a white Creole were interested in her.

5000|$|EGO CAUSABONZZO's {{friend and}} attorney. He {{is always in}} dispute with the daily living. His motto is: [...] "that is the Perversity of Matter", which for him means the true liberation of his spirit and problems. He uses this phrase at all times to {{describe}} his situations in daily life, which intentionally cause harm around him and corrupt his customs, with a great negative effect on himself. You can see {{the effect of the}} perversity of matter in the advice that he gives BONZZO at all times, full of wisdom, and many others lacking sensitivity. For EGO in his legal profession, everybody has a cause for being guilty, in that way he always has a reason to charge and legally defend them. He is always victorious on legal situations with a verdict in favor of his clients, of innocence. He is very good at his profession, although his personality proves otherwise, as it reflects a level of mediocrity and irresponsibility with his <b>informal</b> way of <b>dressing,</b> with shorts, shirt and tennis shoes; also, his car is full of bumps. He is a mess at first glance, as a first impression {{for those who do not}} know him, but for BONZZO, is more than an unconditional friend, is like a father.|$|R
5000|$|Even though President Vázquez favored his Finance Minister Danilo Astori as presidential {{candidate}} of the then unified Broad Front to succeed him in 2010, Mujica's broad appeal and growing support within the party posed {{a challenge to the}} president. On 14 December 2008, The Extraordinary Congress [...] "Zelmar Michelini" [...] (a party convention) proclaimed Mujica as the official {{candidate of the}} Broad Front for primary elections of 2009, but four more precandidates were allowed to participate, including Astori.On 28 June 2009, Mujica won the primary elections becoming the {{presidential candidate}} of the Broad Front for the 2009 general election. After that, Astori agreed to be his running mate. Their campaign was centered on the concept of continuing and deepening the policies of the highly popular administration of Vázquez, using the slogan “Un gobierno honrado, un país de primera" [...] (An honest government, a first-class country) - indirectly referencing cases of administrative corruption within the former government of the major opposition candidate, conservative Luis Alberto Lacalle. During the campaign, Mujica distanced himself from the governing style of presidents like Hugo Chávez (Venezuela) or Evo Morales (Bolivia), claiming the center-left governments of Brazilian Luis Inácio Lula da Silva or Chilean socialist Michelle Bachelet as regional examples upon which he would model his administration. Known for his <b>informal</b> style of <b>dress,</b> Mujica donned a suit (without a tie) for some stops in the presidential campaign, notably during visits to regional heads of state.|$|R
