40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{relative}} importance of demand and supply factors <b>for</b> <b>hiring.</b> We use a search-matching model with imperfect competition in the product market to derive an equation <b>for</b> total <b>hiring</b> in a local labor market and estimate it on Swedish panel data. If product markets are imperfectly competitive, product demand shocks should have a direct effect on employment. Our main finding is that product demand is important <b>for</b> <b>hiring.</b> This highlights the importance of taking imperfect competition in the product market into account in studies of employment dynamics and hiring. We also find that the number of unemployed workers has a positive effect on hiring, confirming the importance of search frictions. Hence, both demand and supply factors seem to matter <b>for</b> <b>hiring...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is on the}} River Stour or Great Stour, {{flowing from}} its source at Lenham {{north-east}} through Ashford to the English Channel at Sandwich.

The two branches rejoin or are linked several times, but finally recombine around the town of Fordwich, {{on the edge of the}} marshland north east of the city. The Stour is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used.

5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun <b>for</b> <b>Hire</b> (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E

5|$|Bond boards Krest's {{ship the}} Wavekrest and foils Sanchez's latest drug shipment, {{stealing}} five {{million dollars in}} the process.

Bond meets and teams up with Pam Bouvier, an ex-CIA agent and pilot, at a Bimini bar, and journeys {{with her to the}} Republic of Isthmus. He finds his way into Sanchez's employment by posing as an assassin <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> Two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers foil Bond's attempt to assassinate Sanchez and take him to an abandoned warehouse. They are joined by Fallon, an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond. Sanchez's men rescue him and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins. Later, with the aid of Bouvier, Q, and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora, Bond frames Krest by planting the $5 million in the Wavekrest. Sanchez kills Krest via a decompression chamber and admits Bond into his inner circle.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was {{outgrowing}} its customary venues, {{and plans}} to build a new concert hall in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available <b>for</b> <b>hire,</b> Britten realised that the largest of them could be converted into a concert hall and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen {{at the start of the}} twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country. The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale by auction in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> or reward.|$|E
