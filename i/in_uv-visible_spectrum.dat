Two significant peaks {{appeared in the}} electronic spectrum of TSC in the simulated concrete pore solution at 340 and 217  nm can be explained due to n[*]→[*]π* and π[*]→[*]π* electronic transitions, respectively. CPS contains TSC (1500  ppm) when treated with steel rebar for 3  days, showed three peaks {{in addition to the}} above mentioned peaks <b>in</b> <b>UV–visible</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Additional peaks displayed at 682, 757 and 788  nm can be assigned to the electronic transitions of Fe(II)–citrate complex. Furthermore, it is noticed that the colour of the concrete pore solution containing TSC (1500  ppm) gradually changed into pale green when it was treated with steel rebar. This colour was persisted for ~[*] 10  days. This indicates the stability of Fe(II)–citrate complex in the alkaline CPS. All other concrete pore test solutions (including nitrite added CPS) were changed into brown colour during 2 – 3  days. This implies that the Fe(II) ions produced due to corrosion is converting to Fe(III) ions quickly. Hence it can be concluded that the reluctance of Fe(II) to convert into Fe(III) in CPS containing NaCl and TSC is definitely due to the strong complex formation between Fe(II) and citrate ions.|$|E
