It was subsequently suggested that conversion of wave energy into electrostatic modes may be responsible for the error. We utilize a newly available extensive record of VLF transmitter energy reaching the magnetosphere, taken from the DEMETER satellite, and perform a direct comparison with a sophisticated full wave model of trans-ionospheric propagation. Although the model does not include the effect of ionospheric irregularities, it correctly predicts the average total power injected into the magnetosphere within several dB. The results, particularly at nighttime, appear to be robust against the variability of the ionospheric electron density. We conclude that the global effect of irregularity scattering on whistler mode conversion to quasi-electrostatic may be no larger than 6 dB. Citation: Cohen, M. B., N. G. Lehtinen, and U. S.

During the daylight hours, a station in middle or high latitudes using 100 watts {{and a simple}} dipole antenna can expect a maximum communication range of 200 miles/300 km, extending to a few thousand miles or more at night. Global coverage can be routinely achieved during the late fall and winter by a station using modest power and common antennas. The higher background noise on 80 meters, especially when combined with higher <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption,</b> causes stations with higher effective radiated power to have a decided advantage in long distance communications. With very high antennas or large vertically polarized arrays and full legal power, reliable worldwide communications occurs over darkness paths. Mobile operation is possible, although the relative shortness of a practical mobile antenna (usually less than 10 feet/3 meters) compared to a quarter wavelength results in the need for significant inductive loading to achieve resonance. Since short antennas have very low radiation resistance, overall antenna efficiency is often limited to less than 10%. Additionally, the large inductance of the loading coil creates a very high Q antenna system, with an extremely narrow bandwidth.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{conducts a}} {{scientific}} review on the complex eikonal, extrapolating the research {{perspectives on the}} <b>ionospheric</b> ray-tracing and <b>absorption.</b> As regards the scientific review, the eikonal equation is expressed, and some complex-valued solutions are defined corresponding to complex rays and caustics. Moreover, the geometrical optics is compared to the beam tracing method, introducing the limit of the quasi-isotropic and paraxial complex optics approximations. Finally, the quasi-optical beam tracing {{is defined as the}} complex eikonal method applied to ray-tracing, discussing the beam propagation in a cold magnetized plasma. As regards the research perspectives, this paper proposes to address the following scientific problem: in absence of electromagnetic (e. m.) sources, consider a material medium which is time invariant, linear, optically isotropic, generally dispersive in frequency and inhomogeneous in space, with the additional condition that the refractive index is assumed varying even strongly in space. The paper continues the topics discussed by Bianchi et al. [2009], proposing a novelty with respect to the other referenced bibliography: indeed, the Joule’s effect is assumed non negligible, so the medium is dissipative, and its electrical conductivity is not identically zero. In mathematical terms, the refractive index belongs to the field of complex numbers. The dissipation plays a significant role, and even the eikonal function belongs to the complex numbers field. Under these conditions, {{for the first time to}} the best of our knowledge, suitable generalized complex eikonal and transport equations are derived, never discussed in literature. Moreover, in order to solve the <b>ionospheric</b> ray-tracing and <b>absorption</b> problems, we hint a perspective viewpoint. The complex eikonal equations are derived assuming the medium as optically isotropic. However, in agreement with the quasi isotropic approximation of geometrical optics, these equations can be referred to the Appleton-Hartree’s refractive index for an ionospheric magneto-plasma, which becomes only weakly anisotropic in the presence of Earth’s magnetic induction field. Finally, a simple formula is deduced for a simplified problem. Consider a flat layering ionospheric medium, so without any horizontal gradient.

The crucial spectral features in the global 21 cm signal (turning points) occur at low radio frequencies < 100 MHz. In addition to the human-generated RFI, Earth's ionosphere drastically corrupts low-frequency radio observations from the ground. In this paper, we {{examine the effects of}} time-varying <b>ionospheric</b> refraction, <b>absorption</b> and thermal emission at these low radio frequencies and their combined effect on any ground-based global 21 cm experiment. It should be noted {{that this is the first}} study of the effect of a dynamic ionosphere on global 21 cm experiments. The fluctuations in the ionosphere are influenced by solar activity with flicker noise characteristics. The same characteristics are reflected in the ionospheric corruption to any radio signal passing through the ionosphere. As a result, any ground based observations of the faint global 21 cm signal are corrupted by flicker noise (or " 1 /f" noise, where "f" is the dynamical frequency) which scales as ν^- 2 (where ν is the frequency of observation) in the presence of a bright galactic foreground (∝ν^-s, where s is radio spectral index). Hence, the calibration of the ionosphere for any such experiment is critical. Any attempt to calibrate the ionospheric effects will be subject to the inaccuracies in the current ionospheric measurements using GPS ionospheric measurements, riometer measurements, ionospheric soundings, etc. Even considering an optimistic improvement in the accuracy of GPS-TEC (Total Electron Content) measurements, we conclude that the detection {{of the global}} 21 cm signal below 100 MHz is best done from above the Earth's atmosphere in orbit of the Moon.

Type 1 models calculate absorption as m times the square root of the flux of solar protons above an energy threshold, Et. Measurements from 14 riometers during 94 solar proton events (1995 – 2010) are assimilated by optimising {{the day and night}} values of m by linear regression. Further non-linear optimisations are demonstrated in which parameters such as Et are also optimised and additional terms characterise local time and seasonal variations. These optimisations reduce RMS errors by up to 36 %. Type 2 models incorporate altitude profiles of electron and neutral densities and electron temperatures. Here the scale height of the effective recombination coefficient profile in the D-region is optimised by regression. Furthermore, two published models of the rigidity cut-off latitude (CL) are assessed by comparison with riometer measurements. A small improvement in performance is observed by introducing a 3 -h lag in the geomagnetic index Kp in the CL models. Assimilating data from a single riometer in the polar cap reduces RMS errors below 1  dB with less than 0. 2  dB bias.

This is achieved by VHF links whilst within range of the widespread network of ground stations, and is by HF radio in remote areas such as the Polar regions, the North Atlantic and Pacific where VHF ground infrastructure does not exist. Furthermore, the Russian side of the pole only has HF capability. Researchers at the University of Leicester and at Lancaster University have developed various models (outlined below) that can be employed in HF radio propagation predictions. It is anticipated that these models will form the basis of an HF forecasting and nowcasting service for the airline industry. Propagation coverage predictions make use of numerical ray tracing to estimate the ray paths through a model ionosphere. Initially, a background ionospheric model is produced, which is then perturbed to include the various ionospheric features prevalent at high latitudes (in particular patches, arcs, auroral zone irregularities and the mid-latitude trough) that significantly affect the propagation of the radio signals. The approach that we are currently adopting is to start with the IRI and to perturb this based on measurements made near to the time and area of interest to form the basis of the background ionospheric model. This is then further perturbed to include features such as the convecting patches, the parameters of which may also be informed by measurements. A significant problem is the high variability of the high latitude ionosphere, and the relative scarcity of real-time measurements over the region. Real time measurements that we will use as the basis for perturbing the IRI include ionosonde soundings from, e. g. the GIRO database, and TEC measurements from the IGS network. Real-time modelling of HF radiowave absorption in the D-region ionosphere is also included. The geostationary GOES satellites provide real-time information on X-ray flux (causing shortwave fadeout during solar flares) and the flux of precipitating energetic protons which correlates strongly with Polar Cap Absorption (PCA). Real-time solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements from the ACE or DSCOVR spacecraft provide geomagnetic index estimates used to model the location of both auroral absorption (on a probabilistic basis) and the proton rigidity cutoff boundary that defines the latitudinal extent of PCA during solar proton events (SPE). Empirical climatological models have been uniquely adapted to assimilate recent measurements of cosmic noise absorption (at 30 MHz) from a large array of riometers in Canada and Scandinavia. The model parameters are continuously optimised and updated to account for regional and temporal variations in ionospheric composition (and hence HF absorption rate (dB/km)) that can change significantly during the course of an SPE, for example. Real-time optimisation during SPE can also improve estimates of the proton rigidity cutoff and improve the modelled <b>ionospheric</b> response function <b>absorption</b> vs. zenith angle) at twilight...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{prediction}} of the night-time sky-wave field strength in the MF- and LF-ranges is presented. This method differs from the wave-hop method by Knight (1975) {{as far as the}} determination of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>absorption</b> following the full-wave equation method is concerned. The usefulness of the modified wave-hop method has been proved by comparing the predicted field strength values with experimental data received in Central Europe (frequency 1575 kHz, distances between 50 km and 1700 km from a horizontally polarized transmitting antenna) ...|$|E
