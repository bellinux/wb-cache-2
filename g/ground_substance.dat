25|$|Whereas mantle dentin forms {{from the}} preexisting <b>ground</b> <b>substance</b> of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a {{different}} process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating {{the availability of}} any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted.|$|E
40|$|On the {{histogenesis}} or {{nature of}} so-called fibrinoid degeneration, two theories {{have been accepted}} hitherto. The first is that fibrinoid substances consist mainly of fibrin exuded from blood streams {{and the second is}} that fibrinoid degeneration is characterized by an increase of acidic mucopolysaccharides in the connective tissues concerned. The present report deals with the histogenesis of fibrinoid degeneration developed in allergic tissue changes, from a histochemical point of view. The present preliminary experiments were undertaken to examine the histochemical significances of cutaneous tissues of rabbits and guinea pigs, fibrin coagula, placental tissues, the umbilical cords and cartilage. The following results were obtained. 1. Collagen fibers in the skin of rabbits and guinea pigs were stained in the following order : reddish purple, reddish and bluish using PAS, Reinhart's Hale-Van Gieson ard Lillie's allochrome method, respectively. On the other hand, <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> contained in the samples showed positive Hale's reaction. Moreover, the contra! area of thick fiber-bundles appeared as violet by allochrome staining. Metachromasia reaction with toluidine blue was negative in the fibers while positive in the <b>ground</b> <b>substances.</b> 2. Mucinous substances of the umbilical cords and <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> of cartilages showed positive Hale's reaction, while appearing as picromethylblue by allochrome staining. The <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> of cartilage showed strongly positive metachromasia reaction with toluidine blue at pH of 2. 5, 4. 1 and 7. 0, while mucinous substances of the umbilical cords showed positeve reation only at pH 4. 1 and 7. 0. Fibrinoid substances of placental tissues are considered to be similar in their histochemical stainability to fibrin coagula; for example, each of these substances showed strongly positive fibrin stainability with no metachromasia and/or purple color with Reinhart's staining...|$|R

25|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor, {{as well as}} the progesterone receptor, {{have been}} detected in the skin, including in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. At menopause and thereafter, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning, and increased wrinkling of the skin and a reduction in skin elasticity, firmness, and strength. These skin changes constitute an acceleration in skin aging and are the result of decreased collagen content, irregularities in the morphology of epidermal skin cells, decreased <b>ground</b> <b>substance</b> between skin fibers, and reduced capillaries and blood flow. The skin also becomes more dry during menopause, which is due to reduced skin hydration and surface lipids (sebum production). Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging.|$|E
25|$|In the infant, many fibrous {{components}} were seen to extend from the macula flava towards the Reinke's space. Fibronectin is very {{abundant in the}} Reinke's space of newborn and infant. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is believed {{to act as a}} template for the oriented deposition of the collagen fibers, stabilizing the collagen fibrils. Fibronectin also acts as a skeleton for the elastic tissue formation. Reticular and collagenous fibers were seen to run along the edges of the VF throughout the entire lamina propria. Fibronectin in the Reinke's space appeared to guide those fibers and orient the fibril deposition. The elastic fibers remained sparse and immature during infancy, mostly made of microfibrils. The fibroblasts in the infant Reinke's space were still sparse but spindle-shaped. Their rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus were still not well developed, indicating that despite the change in shape, the fibroblasts still remained mostly in a resting phase. Few newly released materials were seen adjacent to the fibroblasts. The <b>ground</b> <b>substance</b> content in the infant Reinke's space seemed to decrease over time, as the fibrous component content increased, thus slowly changing the vocal fold structure.|$|E
500|$|The dermis is {{the layer}} of skin between the {{epidermis}} and subcutaneous tissue, and comprises two sections, the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis. [...] The superficial papillary dermis [...] with the overlying rete ridges of the epidermis, between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone. [...] Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and [...] <b>ground</b> <b>substance.</b> [...] Within these components are the pilosebaceous units, arrector pili muscles, and the eccrine and apocrine glands. [...] The dermis contains two vascular networks that run parallel to the skin surface—one superficial and one deep plexus—which are connected by vertical communicating vessels. [...] The function of blood vessels within the dermis is fourfold: to supply nutrition, to regulate temperature, to modulate inflammation, {{and to participate in}} wound healing.|$|E
25|$|Newborns have {{a uniform}} monolayered lamina propria, which appears loose with no vocal ligament. The monolayered lamina propria is {{composed}} of <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> such as hyaluronic acid and fibronectin, fibroblasts, elastic fibers, and collagenous fibers. While the fibrous components are sparse, making the lamina propria structure loose, the hyaluronic acid (HA) content is high.|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of intercellular substances and rounded {{cells of the}} incisor dental pulp of guinea pigs is described. The extracellular fibrils are of two kinds; collagen with typical cross-striations, varying from 400 – 700 Å in diameter, and fine fibrils of 100 – 120 Å in diameter. In cross section the latter fibrils appeared to be composed {{of three or four}} smaller subunits of less than 50 Å in diameter. The collagen fibril in the dental pulp appear singly or in small bundles of about a dozen or more fibrils. The fine fibrils are often aggregated along the cell surface. The <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> are finely granular to fibrillar and show localized clumping which is related to fibrillar elements. The <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> form an incomplete covering of 200 Å or more in thickness surrounuding collagen fibrils. When the collagen fibrils make a bundle, the sheath of grouund substances around one fibril becomes fused with that of adjacent fibrils. Rounded cells including macrophages, lymphocytes and eosinophils are present in the pulp. The {{fine structure}} of these cells is similar to that found in the same types of cells previously observed in other organs...|$|R

It is suggested that antibodies (and possibly antigens) may be attached to these mucinous <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> of the connective tissues...|$|R
2500|$|Type I {{collagen}} composes 90–95% of {{the organic}} matrix, with remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called <b>ground</b> <b>substance</b> consisting of proteoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate , as well as non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin or bone sialoprotein [...] Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of <b>ground</b> <b>substance</b> is not fully known. Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix of bone is {{laid down by}} osteoblasts, which secrete both collagen and <b>ground</b> <b>substance.</b> These synthesise collagen within the cell, and then secrete collagen fibrils. The collagen fibres rapidly polymerise to form collagen strands. At this stage they are not yet mineralised, and are called [...] "osteoid". Around the strands calcium and phosphate precipitate {{on the surface of}} these strands, within a days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite.|$|E
2500|$|Bone is not uniformly solid, but {{includes}} a tough matrix. This matrix makes up about 30% {{of the bone}} and the other 70% is of salts that give strength to it. [...] The matrix {{is made up of}} between 90 and 95% collagen fibers, and the remainder is <b>ground</b> <b>substance.</b> [...] The primary tissue of bone, bone tissue (osseous tissue), is relatively hard and lightweight. Its matrix is mostly made up of a composite material incorporating the inorganic mineral calcium phosphate in the chemical arrangement termed calcium hydroxylapatite (this is the bone mineral that gives bones their rigidity) and collagen, an elastic protein which improves fracture resistance. The collagen of bone is known as ossein. Bone is formed by the hardening of this matrix around entrapped cells. When these cells become entrapped from osteoblasts they become osteocytes.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the results of histochemical, biochemical, electron-microscopical and {{physical}} examinations made on allergic tissue reactions in rabbits and guinea pigs caused by egg albumin and old tuberculin, and discussions are made on the histogenesis of so-called fibrinoid degeneration from the viewpoint of experimental allergy. The two characteristic features histologically observed in fibrinoid degeneration in both the tuberculin and the Arthus type are considered to be due to either (1) destruction of mucinous <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> which directly bundle the fibrils of connective tissues or due to (2) precipitation of exudate derived from blood streams in 'spaces' among the dissociated fibrils. However it is, as yet, unknown whether the precipitation or the destruction of <b>ground</b> <b>substances</b> comes first. In both cases, however, almost no change of the fibrils in their electron-microscopical and physical structures was observed. Fibrinoid substances showed strongly positive PAS and fibrin reaction {{and at the same time}} they showed weakly Positive Hale's reaction. From enzymatic examinations,using fibrinolytic enzyme and hyaluronidase, the PAS-positive substances are considered to consist mainly of fibrin or precursors of fibrin, while Hale-positive substances are found to contain acid mucopolysaccharides. These glycoproteins are considered to be derived mainly from the blood stream, since hexosamine was observed to increase in the blood stream as well as in the tissues concerned...|$|R

2500|$|The {{umbilical}} cord develops from and contains {{remnants of the}} yolk sac and allantois. It forms by the fifth week of development, replacing the yolk sac {{as the source of}} nutrients for the embryo. [...] The cord is not directly connected to the mother's circulatory system, but instead joins the placenta, which transfers materials to and from the maternal blood without allowing direct mixing. [...] The length of the {{umbilical cord}} is approximately equal to the crown-rump length of the fetus throughout pregnancy. [...] The umbilical cord in a full term neonate is usually about 50 centimeters (20 in) long and about 2 centimeters (0.75in) in diameter. [...] This diameter decreases rapidly within the placenta. The fully patent umbilical artery has two main layers: an outer layer consisting of circularly arranged smooth muscle cells and an inner layer which shows rather irregularly and loosely arranged cells embedded in abundant <b>ground</b> <b>substance</b> staining metachromatic. The smooth muscle cells of the layer are rather poorly differentiated, contain only a few tiny myofilaments and are thereby unlikely to contribute actively to the process of postnatal closure.|$|E

In the browner parts of this coal, sharp eyes will readily detect multitudes of curious little coin-shaped bodies, of a yellowish brown colour, embedded in the dark brown <b>ground</b> <b>substance.</b> On the average, these little brown bodies may have a diameter of about one-twentieth of an inch. They lie with their flat surfaces nearly parallel with the two smooth faces of the block in which they are contained; and, on one side of each, there may be discerned a figure, consisting of three straight linear marks, which radiate from the centre of the disk, but do not quite reach its circumference. In the horizontal section these disks are often converted into more or less complete rings; while in the vertical sections they appear like thick hoops, the sides of which have been pressed together. The disks are, therefore, flattened bags; and favourable sections show that the three-rayed marking is the expression of three clefts, which penetrate one wall of the bag.|$|E

Hirano and Sato studies suggested that the macula flava is responsible for the synthesis of the fibrous components of the VF. Fibroblasts have been found mostly aligned in the direction of the vocal ligament, along bundles of fibers. It then was suggested that the mechanical stresses during phonation were stimulating the fibroblasts to synthesize those fibers.|$|R
