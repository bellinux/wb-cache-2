In developed countries, a diverse set of <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> has been developed to monitor innovation performance and the impact of innovation policies. Developing countries have been late to jump on this bandwagon and are now faced with a set of well-established <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> that might not be that well suited to measure innovation in their economies. Existing <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> can be broadly classified into three different types: Science & Technology (S&T) <b>indicators,</b> <b>Innovation</b> survey <b>indicators,</b> and Composite <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators</b> combining different indicators, including S&T and Innovation survey data, into one indicator. All of these have their own particular strengths and weaknesses, and they score above or below average on a wide range of attributes considered to be favourable, if not downright necessary, for <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators.</b> This paper argues that, for <b>innovation</b> <b>indicators,</b> and for <b>innovation</b> survey <b>indicators</b> in particular, data collection has to be customised to the different socio-economic structures of developing countries.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an exploratory analysis {{as to whether}} input-output analysis can be extended to measure information spillovers. A modified input-output framework is developed which links regional context, global markets, an information sector and <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> matrices. Regional context is described as the cultural and economic qualities inherent in a regional economy and the information sector is derived in a manner described by Karunaratne (1988). <b>Innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> matrices are developed {{as an extension of}} the DeBresson (1991) innovative interactive matrices. They have added value by calculating the export related innovation spillover share for each export performance influencing variable, export strategy or innovation information source (defined by the TVH typology) at both the sector and firm level on a comparative and consistent basis. The <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> matrices are used to investigate whether the input-output approach will provide additional insights into issues raised in the regional development literature regarding the measurement and importance of information spillovers to small, regional exporting firms. A level of detail and analysis not possible using alternative more aggregated econometric methods is achieved. The method derives information innovation multipliers using National and State Input-Output tables constructed from ABS data, modified with the TVH typology data sourced from a survey of exporting strategies used by NSW regional firms. <b>Innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> matrices consist of two types as follows: those used for calculations which contain the TVH strategy use frequencies, and the storage matrices which contain their corresponding spillover values (the results of these calculations). Strategy spillover values are derived by proportioning the export portion of the innovation information value-added industry support multiplier across the strategy use frequencies. Specifically, the indicator matrices are used (1) to measure the spillover portion that adds value to the developments or improvements in export related products or production processes, (2) determining from where a how these spillovers are sourced or generated according to the TVH typology variables, (3) determining the TVH typology characteristics of the leading export enhancing sectors, multiplier groups, regions and firms, and (4) determining suitable export enhancing policies by modelling various network generated or government assisted information flows. This unique method found that: innovation information was flowing away from export production towards non-exports production (sector-regional dimensions are provided; strategy set components were more significant at the network and sector than regional levels; The unique method identified: significant variations in strategy and spillover use for networks across the regions; significant MAR and Jacobs spillover flows at the sector and regional levels; that supply and demand networks were independent of strategy use and spillover values at the region and sector levels; that firm‟s choice of region and information spillover sources were independent of TVH strategy choice; cooperative networking arrangements using overseas agencies and partnerships and electronic communications such as e-mail and internet, self sourced information on new technologies, attending business meetings and capital city conferences, offering after sales service, and obtaining external market development information using visits to or from service providers, as the main strategies and sources used by leading exporting firms (also significant for the networks, regions and sectors; successful exporting policies based on the spatial use of leading strategies. <b>Innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> matrices successfully measured information spillovers. Survey amendments are suggested to obtain the TVH data for more than one time period thus allowing strategy changes to be assessed and some weighting of strategy relative importance would be useful for improving spillover measure accuracy. Data disaggregation in the IO approach illustrated the coexistence of different innovation and development paths among firms and regions and broad networks across many regions. This revealed the simultaneous influence of many theories, the absence of one dominant approach, and the need to utilize existing spatial networks in policy design. Policies generated to encourage the use of successful strategies delivered results consistent with the innovative milieu theory in that assistance to promote related scientific research delivered the best export, associated employment outcomes and related flow-on effects...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. Regulation is {{especially}} important for infrastructure systems which are characterised by a triple regulation challenge in the fields of spillovers of R&D, environmental protection, and access to monopolistic bottlenecks. The paper starts from a system of innovation approach and distinguishes different innovation functions. The effect of regulation on innovation depends on how regulation influences these functions. An important role can be assigned towards regulation at the demand side of the technology markets. This paper analyses the relationship between regulation and innovation on an indicator based empirical base. Patents as an intermediate <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator,</b> and the success in international trade as an output-oriented indicator are used for measuring innovations. The results show an above average innovation dynamics of the renewable energy technologies. The technological capabilities of the countries differ, depending on the technology analysed. This underlines the need for a technology specific analysis. In general, countries use both traditional technology policies on the supply side such as R&D subsidies but also demand oriented policies such as feed-in-tariffs or quota systems. Proxies for regulatory indicators are developed indicating the level of regulatory activity for each country. Furthermore, a policy indicator of innovation friendliness of regulation is constructed, which reflects expert opinions on how the regulation in the countries affects additional innovation functions. An econometric analysis which matches the re-sults of the policy analysis with the outcome of the <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> analysis shows that R&D subsidies, diffusion of the technologies as a result of demand side regulation, capabilities in complementary sectors and the policy indicator are important determinants {{for the development of the}} innovation activities...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether patent subsidy {{programs}} aimed at promoting regional innovations have aroused {{a large number of}} low-quality applications in China and created biased patent statistics as an indicator for innovations. We found that patent filing fee subsidies encouraged filing of low-quality patent, resulting in a decreased grant rate. Though reward conditioned on grants increased patent grant rate, it also brought patents with narrow claim breadth. Our empirical results confirmed a general concern that patent subsidies have side effects in encouraging patent applications of low quality or low value. However, the patent subsidy programs does not affect the trend of granted patents, particularly for those applied by firms. Therefore, while the surge of patent applications has upward biases as an <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator,</b> increases in granted patents can be explained by uprising of technological capability at enterprise sector in China. ...|$|E

30|$|Several {{explanations}} are possible for this result. First, innovative performance simply {{may not be}} related to the staffing patterns that are the focus of this study, at least if potential systematic co-variation of innovative performance and staffing patterns in industrial sectors is controlled for. That this possibility cannot be simply dismissed is also underlined by the recent results by Verworn and Hipp (2009). They used an <b>innovation</b> <b>indicator</b> that is based on a survey question with the exact wording in our dataset, and did not find any age dependency of innovation. 18 Why then should age-related staffing patterns affect innovation? Still, we should not forget that both our results and those by Verworn and Hipp (2009) are of a purely cross-sectional nature, and the results may be biased by omitted variables or reverse causation. However, as has been extensively discussed in the literature survey, the great majority of estimation biases inflate the contributions of younger workers, and reduce the contributions of older workers to firm performance. Furthermore, as in our case, none of the strategies is significantly related to innovative performance, not even the influx of younger workers, and the usual pattern of estimation biases are clearly not a problem here.|$|E
