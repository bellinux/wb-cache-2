Continued progress in combating malaria requires development of new, easy to administer drug combinations with broad-ranging activity against all manifestations of the disease. DSM 265, a triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitor of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), is the first DHODH inhibitor to reach clinical development for treatment of malaria. We describe studies profiling the biological activity, pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties, and safety of DSM 265, which supported its advancement to human trials. DSM 265 is highly selective toward DHODH of the malaria parasite Plasmodium, efficacious against both blood and liver stages of P. falciparum, and active against drug-resistant parasite isolates. Favorable pharmacokinetic properties of DSM 265 are predicted to provide therapeutic concentrations for more than 8 days after a single oral dose in the range of 200 to 400 mg. DSM 265 was well tolerated in repeat-dose and cardiovascular safety studies in mice and dogs, was not mutagenic, and was inactive against panels of human enzymes/receptors.

At low-doses given every 24 h, aspirin is acting by a complete and persistent inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 in platelets (in the pre-systemic circulation) while causing a limited and rapidly reversible inhibitory effect on COX- 2 and/or COX- 1 expressed in nucleated cells.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to model {{apparent}} serum half-lives of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) with 7 - 10 bromine substituents. Workers with occupational exposure to PBDEs have elevated serum levels of PBDEs, but these substances are also found in the general population and are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The calculations were based on exposure assessments of rubber workers (manufactured flame-retarded rubber compound) and electronics dismanders who donated blood during a period with no work-related exposures to PBDEs, and referents without any known occupational exposure (clerks, cleaners, and abattoir workers). The workers had previously been found to have elevated levels of high- and medium-brominated diphenyl ethers compared with the referent populations. We performed nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of kinetics, using data from previous and present chemical analyses. The calculated apparent half-life for decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209) was 15 days (95 % confidence interval, 11 - 18 days).

Much is known about exposure to PFOA in drinking water; however, the impact of non-drinking water PFOA exposure on serum PFOA concentrations is not well characterized. The objective of this research is to apply physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate the impact of historic non-drinking water PFOA exposure on serum PFOA concentrations. In vitro to in vivo extrapolation was utilized to inform descriptions of PFOA transport in the kidney. Monte Carlo simulations were incorporated to evaluate factors that account for the large inter-individual variability of serum PFOA concentrations measured in individuals from North Alabama in 2010 and 2016, and the Mid-Ohio River Valley between 2005 and 2008. Predicted serum PFOA concentrations were within two-fold of experimental data. With incorporation of Monte Carlo simulations, the model successfully tracked the large variability of serum PFOA concentrations measured in populations from the Mid-Ohio River Valley. Simulation of exposure in a population of 45 adults from North Alabama successfully predicted 98 % of individual serum PFOA concentrations measured in 2010 and 2016, respectively, when non-drinking water ingestion of PFOA exposure was included. Variation in serum PFOA concentrations may be due to inter-individual variability in the disposition of PFOA and potentially elevated historical non-drinking water exposures.

40|$|Albumin is an {{abundant}} blood protein {{that acts as}} a transporter of a plethora of small molecules like fatty acids, hormones, toxins, and drugs. In addition, it has an unusual long serum <b>half-life</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> of nearly 3 weeks, which is attributed to its interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn protects albumin from intracellular degradation via a pH-dependent cellular recycling mechanism. To understand how FcRn impacts the role of albumin as a distributor, it is of importance to unravel the structural mechanism that determines pH-dependent binding. Here, we show that although the C-terminal domain III (DIII) of human serum albumin (HSA) contains the principal binding site, the N-terminal domain I (DI) is important for optimal FcRn binding. Specifically, structural inspection of human FcRn (hFcRn) in complex with HSA revealed that two exposed loops of DI were in proximity with the receptor. To investigate to what extent these contacts affected hFcRn binding, we targeted selected amino acid residues of the loops by mutagenesis. Screening by in vitro interaction assays revealed that several of the engineered HSA variants showed decreased binding to hFcRn, which was also the case for two missense variants with mutations within these loops. In addition, four of the variants showed improved binding. Our findings demonstrate that both DI and DIII are required for optimal binding to FcRn, which has implications for our understanding of the FcRn-albumin relationship and how albumin acts as a distributor. Such knowledge may inspire development of novel HSA-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

We decided to explore reasons for the variance in the data arising from the latter method. We were particularly interested in learning whether any physicochemical characteristics of xenobiotics might account for outlying data points (i. e., poor prediction of human half-life from rat half-life). We have explored the influence of lipid solubility as reflected by a xenobiotic's log P value because adipose tissue comprises a significantly larger percentage of total body weight in humans than in rats. We used half-life data from the literature for 127 xenobiotics. A data subset of 102 xenobiotics for which we were able to find estimates of log P values, including several with extremely large log P values, was also analyzed. First and second order models, including and excluding log P, were compared. The simplest of these models can be recast as the familiar allometric relationship having the form Y = a(Xb). The remaining models can be seen as extensions of this relationship. Our results suggest that incorporation of log P into the prediction of xenobiotic <b>half-life</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> from rat half-life data is important only for xenobiotics with extremely large log P values such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls.

The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, metoclopramide, and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation <b>in</b> <b>humans.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{biological}} <b>half-life</b> of strontium <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> has variously {{been reported}} as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published biological half-life figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life {{is estimated to}} be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected by age and sex, due to differences in bone metabolism.|$|R
