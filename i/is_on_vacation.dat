2500|$|One of the {{principles}} that Grace taught which provoked controversy was the concept of one-man leadership. Grace used the Bible as his reference and taught that God only used one man at a time (e.g. Noah, Moses, and Jesus). One of the many criticisms made against Grace is the following statement which Grace is to have allegedly made in the early 1940s: [...] "Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>vacation,</b> don't worry about Him. [...] If you sin against God, Grace can save you, but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you." [...] Nonetheless, the [...] "interpretation of this point – that Grace claimed he himself was God – has been almost completely definitive in both academic and popular literature, and {{only a handful of}} writers have ever questioned it, usually as an aside." [...] The most extensive research done by Danielle Brune Sigler on this statement shows that Mr. Fauset selectively quoted certain parts of the original message which changed the context." [...] The original statement, spoken by a member and not Grace, shows that the members and Grace, himself, thought that he was not [...] "God himself", but merely an [...] "intermediary" [...] and [...] "the path to salvation." ...|$|E
