25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to <b>friction,</b> <b>fit</b> and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a <b>friction</b> <b>fit</b> are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E

The constant torque braking device currently being used was redesigned {{in an effort to}} allow adjustment of the braking torque during strander operation. The intent of this adjustment is to provide more consistent tension as the wire pays off the spool at differing radial distances.

50|$|Japanese Handles {{are made}} of ho wood burned in and <b>friction</b> <b>fitted</b> to a hidden tang with a buffalo horn bolster capping the handle-blade {{junction}} to prevent splitting. This allows easy installation and replacement. The wood is porous and fine grained so as to not split and to retain grip when wet. More decorative woods as ebony, yew, cherry, or chestnut (often charred on the outside to improve grip and water resistance) are used and are heavier and some {{are more prone to}} cracking if not well cured or cared for properly in exposure to humidity. A silver colored metal spacer is sometimes seen in ebony handles to celebrate the completion of a chef's apprenticeship. The handle is lighter and greater in volume than most Western counterparts. The general shapes are chestnut (or D) and octagon among other variations of these shapes, with most tapering slightly larger toward the tail end. Some sand the ho wood handles as they do retain particles of dirt or sharpening swarf and discolor. Chefs who prefer a more blade-heavy knife, a lighter knife overall, a larger handle for other wise cramped hands, cutting techniques associated with sensitive knife feel, generally lower cost, and easily replaceable handles prefer the Japanese handle.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system introduced in 1927. Back brakes, expanding shoes in enclosed drums, are applied by rods from the hand lever outside the {{body on the}} off-side (to the driver's right). Four-wheel brakes actuated by the pedal through a master-plunger operate on the front wheels and on (the back wheels through) the transmission just behind the gearbox. On the front wheels the brakes expand internally within big ribbed enclosed drums and on the transmission the brake contracts. Operation is hydraulic, the transmission brake by having smaller pistons receives {{only a third of}} the force. The system is self-adjusting and self-compensating. Equalisation is ensured by the sizes of the plungers. Automatic adjustment is made by the action of a <b>friction</b> ring <b>fitted</b> in a recess in the plunger of the operating system. The front brakes are operated by a quick-thread screw formed by steel balls in grooves. The leading shoe in each wheel is arranged to come on slightly earlier and to release a shade before the other.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in designing diagnostic devices able to move along the colon is their locomotion method. Generating friction without applying high normal forces is a key requirement in order to eliminate the risk of tissue damage. One possible solution is to generate friction by means of adhesive forces. For this reason, the device can be covered with mucoadhesive films, which are able to stick on the colonic surface. This paper identifies that the friction of mucoadhesive films depends strongly on their geometry. It seems therefore feasible to adapt {{the level of the}} friction to the properties of the colonic surface by altering the geometry of the films covering the device. Moreover, an eventual influence of the film geometry on the generated friction can reveal film shapes which create high grip despite their small size, leading to a decrease in the overall size of the device. The aim of the paper is to test in vitro the relationship between film geometry and generated <b>friction,</b> to <b>fit</b> the experimental findings in a simplified but generic macroscopic theoretical model able to predict the behavior of various geometries, and to embed those findings in the principles of the design implementation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide new {{experimental}} evidences about the friction/water depth relationship and to improve the formulation of friction models in terms of consideration of the effect of water depth. Tests are conducted on test tracks. Friction forces are measured by means of a dedicated trailer providing a locked-wheel (full sliding) friction coefficient. The test surfaces are wetted by an on-board wetting system providing water depths varying from 0. 1 mm to 1. 50 mm. Effect of the road surface texture on the friction/water depth variation is shown and commented. Inputs newly provided by field tests, compared with laboratory tests, are highlighted. The obtained friction/water depths curves are assimilated to Stribeck curves and analyses, assuming conditions of a starved lubricated contact, are conducted to determine the lubrication regimes experienced by the tire/road contact when the road surface changes from dry to wet. A new friction model is formulated using the three-zone description of the tire/road contact area. The formulation is focused on the water drainage term reflected by a so-called hydrodynamic term FHL. It was assumed that FHL is a product of elementary functions expressing the respective effects of water depth, speed, tire tread depth and road surface macrotexture on water drainage. Form of the elementary functions is derived from experimental evidences and consideration of previous <b>friction</b> models. <b>Fitting</b> of the new model to experimental data is shown and comparison with previous models is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{designs of}} {{pneumatic}} tires required a separate inner tube which could fail {{for a number}} of reasons, such as incorrect tire <b>fit,</b> <b>friction</b> between the tire wall and inner tube generating excess heat, or a puncture. Tubeless tire technology does away with the need for an inner tube thereby increasing safety. In a tubeless tire, the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim. If a tubeless tire gets a small puncture, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation. Conversely, an inner tube could potentially burst like a balloon, leading to deflation of the tire which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle. However, the [...] "bursting like a balloon" [...] scenario is highly unlikely due to fact that the inner tube is inside of the tire and will deflate at a rate proportional to the puncture hole size.|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{flow through}} rock joints occurs in many rock {{engineering}} applications. As the fluid flows through rough-walled rock fractures, pressure head loss occurs due to friction drag {{of the wall}} and local aperture changes. In this study, the friction factor was experimentally investigated by performing flow tests through sandstone fractures with joint roughness coefficient ranging from 5. 5 to 15. 4 under changing normal stress from 0. 5 to 3. 5 MPa. According to the experimental results, the friction factor was formulated {{as a function of}} two-independent variables-Reynolds number and relative roughness. Relative roughness is defined as the ratio of maximum asperity height to equivalent hydraulic aperture. The experimental results show that the proposed predictor of the <b>friction</b> factor <b>fits</b> the data with a coefficient of determination R 2 3 ̆e 0. 93. Sensitivity analyses indicate that in general, the proposed friction factor increases with the relative roughness of confined fractures. The large difference of friction factor induced by relative roughness occurs when the Reynolds number is lower than unity, especially for Re 3 ̆c 0. 2. For Reynolds numbers greater than unity, the difference of friction factor induced by relative roughness is smaller. Inclusion of joint roughness in calculating the friction resistance to fluid flow in rough rock joints and the influence of normal stress to the joints is a major step towards more accurate predictions for fluid flow in underground joint networks. This study provides a significant improvement in fundamental understanding of fluid flow in the jointed strata. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien...|$|R
