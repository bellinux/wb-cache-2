The first part of the dissertation is referred to the development of wind energy applications. Data collected over a period of years were used to statistically analyze wind speed distributions. Weibull parameters, at the selected stations, were calculated as mean values from three different methods. Then, analysis of the cost per kilowatt-hour obtained for several wind turbines, at different hub heights, has been carried out for every station. This analysis demonstrated that there is a remarkable margin for profit from electricity generation by wind turbines in Missolonghi and Aktio, especially if larger wind turbines are to be used. In general, the specific cost per kilowatt-hour decreases as wind turbine size increases and the observed correlation is hyperbolic, while it’s not possible to make safe conclusions about the influence of the hub height in the cost per kilowatt-hour. The second part of the dissertation is referred to the development of passive cooling systems in this area of the central Western Greece. A lightweight aluminium nocturnal radiator was been constructed, painted with an appropriate white paint. It was been established on the roof of the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources Management in Agrinio and was used for the cooling of a thermal zone in the interior of the building. The dynamic thermal performance of the system during summer months was calculated using an accurate mathematical model.
