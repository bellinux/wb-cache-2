5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision {{may reflect the}} fact that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and <b>Fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E
