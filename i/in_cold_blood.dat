5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>blood,</b> or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means.

40|$|ObjectiveMore {{effective}} adjuncts {{are needed}} to {{reduce the incidence of}} acute renal injury after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. The purpose of this randomized trial was to determine whether renal perfusion with <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> provides better protection against renal ischemia than perfusion with <b>cold</b> crystalloid <b>in</b> patients undergoing TAAA repair with left heart bypass. MethodsOne hundred seventy-two patients were enrolled. Strict inclusion criteria were used, including planned Crawford extent II or III TAAA repair with left heart bypass. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intermittent renal perfusion with either 4 °C lactated Ringer's solution (n = 86) or 4 °C blood (n = 86). Renal complications within 10 days of operation were stratified by renal dysfunction score (RDS). Postoperative changes in the levels of five urinary biomarkers—retinol binding protein, α- 1 microglobulin, microalbumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase—were compared to assess potential differences in subclinical renal injury. ResultsAlthough total ischemic times were longer <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> group, unprotected ischemic times were similar between the two groups. Twenty-seven patients <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> group (31 %) and 21 patients <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> crystalloid group (24 %) had peak RDS ≥ 2 (serum creatinine > 50 % above baseline; P =. 4). There were no differences between the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> and <b>cold</b> crystalloid groups <b>in</b> the incidence of early death (7 / 86 [8 %] vs 5 / 86 [6 %], respectively; P =. 8) or renal failure requiring hemodialysis (3 / 86 [3 %] in both groups). Changes in renal biomarker levels were also similar in the two groups. Spinal cord deficits developed in 5 patients <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> group (6 %); there were no such deficits <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> crystalloid group (P =. 06). ConclusionCold renal perfusion during TAAA repair provides effective protection against renal injury. Using <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> instead of <b>cold</b> crystalloid does not enhance renal protection...|$|R

5|$|While {{living in}} Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan.

Breakenridge was {{assisted}} by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about Western history. The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. His description of the 1881 O.K.

5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>blood,</b> while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Clinical {{studies of}} {{myocardial}} protection rarely identify differences in hard clinical outcomes after surgery, either early or late, because most trials lack sufficient statistical power {{to deal with}} low-frequency events. Methods: Prospectively collected data concerning all isolated coronary bypass operations from November 1989 to February 2000 were analyzed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia and warm or tepid blood cardioplegia on early and late outcomes after surgery. Warm blood cardioplegia was used in 4532 patients, whereas <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia was used in 1532. The allocation of patients to receive warm <b>blood</b> cardioplegia and <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia was random in 749 cases and according to surgeon preference in the remainder. Most patients <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia group had surgery earlier in the time course of the study, and most in the warm blood cardioplegia group underwent surgery later. Results: Perioperative death, myocardial infarction, and death or myocardial infarction were all more common <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia group than in the warm blood cardioplegia group (death 2. 5 % vs 1. 6 %, P =. 027, adjusted odds ratio 1. 45, 95 % confidence interval 0. 95 - 2. 22, P =. 09; myocardial infarction 5. 4 % vs 2. 4 %, P <. 0001, adjusted odds ratio 1. 86, 95 % confidence interval 1. 36 - 2. 53, P <. 0001; death or myocardial infarction 7. 3 % vs. 3. 8 %, P <. 0001, adjusted odds ratio 1. 70, 95 % confidence interval 1. 30 - 2. 21, P <. 0001). Actuarial survival at 60 months was 91. 1 % ± 1. 4 % in the warm blood cardioplegia group and 89. 9 % ± 1. 3 % <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia group (P =. 09), whereas freedom from death or myocardial infarction was 84. 7 % ± 1. 8 % and 83. 2 % ± 1. 6 %, respectively (P =. 16). <b>In</b> multivariate models, <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia was associated with poorer survival (risk ratio 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval 0. 96 - 1. 75, P =. 09) and freedom from any death or late myocardial infarction (risk ratio 1. 93, 95 % confidence interval 1. 56 - 2. 39, P =. 0001). Conclusions: In 6064 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, warm or tepid blood cardioplegia may be associated with better early and late event-free survivals than is cold cardioplegia.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of bypass grafting in 96 patients operated on for triple-vessel coronary artery disease between May 1988 and September 1990. In the first 54 patients a cold crystalloid solution was employed, and in the 42 more recent patients <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> low-potassium cardioplegia was employed. There were no differences in postoperative cardiac index or left ventricular stroke work index. Yet, in patients with impaired prebypass left ventricular stroke work index, postbypass left ventricular performance correlated negatively with duration of aortic cross-clamping <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> crystalloid group (r = - 0. 441, p = 0. 045). In contrast, no correlation was found <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> low-potassium group (r = 0. 125, p = 0. 587). The incidence of myocardial infarction, need for inotropic support, and need for intraaortic balloon counterpulsation were similar among the groups. Release of the myocardial isoenzyme creatine kinase-MB from 12 to 30 hours after operation was significantly less in the low-potassium blood cardioplegia group. The use of low-potassium blood cardioplegia resulted in a marked reduction in the operative administration of fluids (1, 527 +/- 87 versus 3, 511 +/- 148 mL; p less than 0. 001). <b>In</b> conclusion, low-potassium <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia is a simple and effective method of myocardial protection. The fact that left ventricular stroke work index recovery was not dependent on the duration of aortic occlusion and that release of the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase was reduced in the low-potassium blood cardioplegia group implies better myocardial protection...|$|R

It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>blood,</b> he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Adenosine as an {{additive}} {{in blood}} cardioplegia is cardioprotective in animal studies, but its clinical role in myocardial protection remains controversial. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether the addition of adenosine <b>in</b> continuous <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia would enhance myocardial protection. METHODS: In a prospective double-blind study comparing adenosine 400 μmol l− 1 to placebo <b>in</b> continuous <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia, 80 patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement were randomized into four groups: antegrade cardioplegia with adenosine (n = 19), antegrade cardioplegia with placebo (n = 21), retrograde cardioplegia with adenosine (n = 21) and retrograde cardioplegia with placebo (n = 19). Myocardial arteriovenous differences in oxygen and lactate were measured before, during and after aortic occlusion. Myocardial concentrations of adenine nucleotides and lactate were determined from left ventricular biopsies obtained before aortic occlusion, after bolus cardioplegia, at 60 min of aortic occlusion and at 20 min after aortic occlusion. Plasma creatine kinase (CK-MB) and troponin T were measured at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after aortic occlusion. Haemodynamic profiles were obtained before surgery and 1, 8 and 24 h after cardiopulmonary bypass. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for significance testing. RESULTS: Adenosine had no effects on myocardial metabolism of oxygen, lactate and adenine nucleotides, postoperative enzyme release or haemodynamic performance. When compared with the antegrade groups, the retrograde groups showed higher myocardial oxygen uptake (17. 3 ± 11. 4 versus 2. 5 ± 3. 6 ml l− 1 at 60 min of aortic occlusion, P < 0. 001) and lactate accumulation (43. 1 ± 20. 7 versu...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBlood cardioplegia and {{terminal}} warm blood cardioplegic reperfusion (“hot shot”) reduce {{myocardial injury}} and improve metabolic recovery in hypoxic but not normoxic experimental models. However, {{there is little}} evidence of a benefit of either technique in pediatric clinical practice compared with crystalloid cardioplegia. MethodsPediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to receive intermittent antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia, <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia, or <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia with a hot shot. Right ventricular biopsy specimens were collected before ischemia, at the end of ischemia, and 20 minutes after reperfusion. Cellular metabolites were analyzed. In acyanotic patients postoperative serum troponin I levels were also measured at 1, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours. ResultsOf 103 patients recruited, 32 (22 acyanotic and 10 cyanotic), 36 (24 acyanotic and 12 cyanotic), and 35 (25 acyanotic and 10 cyanotic), respectively, were allocated to the groups receiving cold crystalloid cardioplegia, <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia, and <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia with a hot shot. Cyanotic patients were younger, with longer crossclamp times. There {{were no significant differences in}} clinical outcomes between cardioplegic methods. The cardioplegic method had no overall effect in terms of adenosine triphosphate, ln(adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate), or ln(glutamate) in acyanotic patients (P =. 11, P =. 66, and P =. 30, respectively). Also, there was no significant difference between groups in troponin I release. However, <b>in</b> cyanotic patients <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia with a hot shot significantly reduced the decrease in adenosine triphosphate, ln(adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate), and glutamate observed at the end of ischemia and after reperfusion compared with the decrease seen <b>in</b> those receiving <b>cold</b> crystalloid cardioplegia (P =. 002, P =. 003, and P =. 008, respectively), with <b>cold</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia representing an intermediate.

This results in blood coming from the body losing their heat so that by the time they interact with cold water from the gills, they're approximately the same temperature so no heat is lost from the body to the water. Whereas blood coming towards the body regain their heat, allowing the shark to maintain its body temperature. This minimizes heat lost to the environment, allowing salmon sharks to thrive <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> waters.|$|R
