6000|$|Apart from {{definite}} arguments, {{there are}} certain feelings, rather than reasons, which {{stand in the way}} of an acceptance of the mathematical account of motion. To begin with, if a body is moving at all fast, we see its motion just as we see its colour. A slow motion, like that of the hour-hand of a watch, is only known in the way which mathematics would lead us to expect, namely by observing a change of position after a lapse of time; but, when we observe the motion of the second-hand, we do not merely see first one position and then another--we see something as directly sensible as colour. What <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we see, and that we call visible motion? Whatever it is, it is not the successive occupation of successive positions: something beyond the mathematical theory of motion is required to account for it. Opponents of the mathematical theory emphasise this fact. [...] "Your theory," [...] they say, [...] "may be very logical, and might apply admirably to some other world; but in this actual world, actual motions are quite different from what your theory would declare them to be, and require, therefore, some different philosophy from yours for their adequate explanation." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} {{included in}} this report illustrate how some behaviors have changed as new technologies emerge while other behaviors remain constant. We have heard from our study participants {{time and time again}} that there are more convenient and familiar ways of getting information today than from the traditional library, usually discovered through a web browser, including freely available resources, such as Wikipedia; human resources; and library resources. We also have learned that the context of the information need influences how and why people engage with technology and make their information choices. Convenience often is the reason expressed for the choices that people make about technology, and about the information and resources they use. Convenient does not necessarily mean simple since individuals constantly are evaluating and assessing the importance and necessity of their information needs. This represents a fluid and ever-changing process, which makes it difficult to identify the one perfect way to provide information and services; making the saying, one size fits none, a reality.

40|$|Background: Every year {{million people}} visit high {{altitude}} areas. Studies indicate that at 3000 – 4000 meters above sea level, 25 % of subjects suffer from acute mountain sickness. It is claimed that brain function might be depressed, but <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be measured? Tales of strange behaviour and dangerous situations during climbs are numerous. Could {{it be that}} altered brain performance {{is the reason for}} this? Objectives: Our goal was to investigate whether the current literature supports the hypothesis that cognitive function is reduced at high altitudes. Material and methods: By performing a limited search in PubMed 11 publications were identified and here presented as a review. Search terms used were: altitude or mountain combined with cognitive or brain performance. Results: Six publications found a reduction in cognitive function, three were inconclusive due to limited numbers of subjects while one author reported an increase in cognitive function. It was not possible to compare these publications directly, mainly because the term “cognitive function” was not specifically defined. We found a cut of point at 5 000 meters above sea level where all articles showed a reduction in cognitive function regardless of quality tested. Conclusion: Research performed during climbs often suffers under the participants’ determination to reach the top, and the studies are of a rather poor quality. Nevertheless, they do indicate that cognitive function is altered during high climbs independent of acclimatisation and that cognitive function probably can be measured if better methods are developed.

40|$|A {{new model}} for land use {{planning}} Cue: Africa is well known as a continent rich in natural resources. However, if those resources are to bring prosperity and development, how they are used and managed is clearly critical. But who {{has the right to}} decide how the resources should be used? Local communities? Town councils? Government ministries or planning departments? An obvious answer is that it depends on who owns the land, but in many areas ownership is disputed. In much of rural South Africa, as elsewhere, two different systems of land ownership exist side-by-side, the formal system based on legal documents, and traditional systems rooted in local culture. Not surprisingly, reaching agreements on how land should be used in this context can be extremely difficult, and may lead to open conflict. According to Pat Luckin, a land use planner working in South Africa, preventing conflict and developing agreement over land use depends on involving local communities in planning, and creating better communication between the communities and other interest groups. In recent work with two communities, Pat has experimented with a new approach which she believes has greatly improved that communication process, and has given people a much better understanding of the resources that they have. She spoke to Susanna Thorp about the new approach and the way it has been used. IN:		?I {{think the most important thing}} ? OUT:		? reduction of conflict in certain areas. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Pat Luckin, on some new approaches to {{land use planning}} that have recently been piloted in South Africa. Transcript Luckin	I think the most important thing to realise when one deals with planning processes is trust, and that people participate in the planning process. Now that?s quite difficult with the formal planning tools that we have which are quite abstract and often come from other countries and sometimes aren?t applicable to our local conditions. So what we?ve done is we built three-dimensional models, physical models, so people can physically see the land and touch a model. Immediately people then identify where they live, where their schools are, where the rivers are, where the hills are, where the forests are etc. Thorp	So how has that made a difference in the way that people have worked together and if they have identified these things, how have they then used those results? Luckin	What we have done in our communities is we have brought people together, traditional leaders, women, other community members, people with disabilities, to make sure that we have a good range of people living in that particular area and ensure that they can participate on how land in that particular area should be used. Obviously one does this in an area where people are demanding a change in land use or more appropriate land use or where there are some conflicts in land use and people need to resolve these problems. So bring all the different parties together around the model and they just start discussing how they want to use different pieces of land. Thorp	Now you mentioned that there had previously been a lot of conflict. Has this process allowed some of those conflicts to be resolved, can you give me examples? Luckin	Often when one has large areas of land, like particularly in South Africa, there is often distrust or lack of communication between different sectors of communities, between traditional leaders and municipalities, and what these particular projects have facilitated is that by bringing the people together around the model, we?ve had municipal officials, we?ve had traditional leaders, we?ve had elders and women all talking around the same issues and agreeing and understanding one another. And I think that the modeling process has huge potential for helping people to genuinely communicate with one another and realise that they are much closer to one another than they had thought before, and that they all have the same intention which is the management of land and the development of a particular area concerned. Thorp	So a very powerful tool obviously, but you?ve only used it in two communities? Luckin		Very small, yes. Thorp	How would you take this process on now? Are there lessons that you have learned that you would perhaps do differently or <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you would like to try elsewhere? Luckin	Oh yes well the responsibility of using models in a community are very huge. So as I said earlier they must be based on trust. There is certain information in communities relating to biodiversity, relating to plants and animals which have specific significance to communities which they might not want to divulge and they have the right to keep that information private and within the community and not make it public, particularly relating to medicinal plants where people invariably get exploited. Next time I go into a community we would write up protocols of how the information would be managed, who would own the information, how much of it would become mapped in a public map for public consumption and how much of it would be kept within the community. It does not solve all problems there are obviously lots of other land legal problems which require other kinds of solutions but it definitely can facilitate the reduction of conflict in certain areas.

40|$|Nurseries and {{training}} 1 Cue: Tree nurseries are wonderful places. Especially {{if they are}} full of young indigenous or local fruit trees with all that potential to provide nutritious fruits as well as additional income to farming families. But if the nurseries are far away from where farmers live there is little {{hope that they will}} get the chance to buy good seedlings for planting. This is why the World Agroforestry Centre ? known as ICRAF ? is recruiting and encouraging farmers to set up tree nurseries in their communities. In Kenya, Jonathan Muriuki from ICRAF has been training these nursery farmers to cultivate local varieties of tamarind, for example. Eric Kadenge went to meet him {{to find out how to}} make a successful business of a community tree nursery. And, most importantly, to ask how much of a market there is these days for seedlings of local trees? IN:	?Unlike crops people don?t buy seeds of trees [...] . OUT:	?depending on your nursery entirely. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Suggested BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sounds like there is money to be made in tree seedlings, not to mention the income from sales of the fruits/nuts of the mature trees. Jonathan Muriuki was talking with Eric Kadenge. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Muriuki	Unlike crops people don?t buy seeds of trees. They normally want to buy seedlings because their planting programmes are smaller, especially for the small-scale farmers. And the nearer the nursery is to the farmer the better. We would rather farmers have their own nurseries where farmers can easily come and buy from the nurseries that are close to them. That is the purpose of setting up these nurseries. Kadenge	So you believe that is better of them to have and to own and to run these nurseries? Muriuki	Yes that is the best thing to do because farmers are not going to go a long distance to get seedlings and when the rains come farmers are busy doing very many things. So the nearer the nursery, then the better for them to plant trees. Kadenge	When it comes to decision making about issues regarding a nursery, do they do it on their own, or are you involved in that? Muriuki	Farmers make decisions on their own in setting up their nurseries. But however sometimes other organisations like the Ministry of Agriculture, Kenya Forest Service, they sometimes consult with farmers and guide them on what to do Kadenge	When you talk about what to do I take that to be training? Muriuki	Yes that is training because, if I give an example of this country we have got about 1800 tree species that are indigenous in this country, that means that farmers need to learn a lot of things about every individual tree species that is important to them, so scientists and extensionists have to come and train them on some of these techniques. Kadenge	What are some of the common trees that you are training them on how to build nurseries for? Muriuki	Some of the common trees that we have trained them on how to do nurseries for are most of them are exotic but for the indigenous pieces we have trees like mangoes. Kadenge	What advice would you give to somebody who is listening to this programme, for example through radio on how to set up their own nursery? Muriuki	One, it is very important that you have a permanent source of water. That can be a permanent river or it can be a tap, piped water or anything but as long as you are going to set up a nursery water is going to be very critical, it as going to be a day to day affair. We have seen many nurseries that have shut down because they could have water to sustain them. Unfortunately for most of the areas, water becomes scarce when the nursery needs it most, so having a permanent source of water is very important. It is also very important to know where you can be able get a rich soil. That is rich in organic matter because that is what the seedling is going to be depending on for the next three, four or six months that it is going to be in the nursery. So if you are near a forest then you can collect the soil from the forest, if you are not near a forest then you can collect organic matter from elsewhere and make compost, which then is going to mixed up in the soil that you have. It is also good to ensure that you have about a quarter of an acre to half and acre where you are going to set up your own nursery, because you need structures in there: a place where you will be having a shed for the seedlings, and a place where you will move them out of the shed, a place where you are going to store your tools that you are working with in the nursery, and a place whereby when people come to buy seedlings or to collect seedlings from you they can stay there because you do not want people moving around your nursery and messing up the seedlings that are there. And also, the hardening. Hardening is moving how you prepare the seeding from coming out of the nursery to the field conditions where it is going to be harsh and it is going to experience conditions that are not as it was in the nursery. So at least a quarter of an acre is important for you. And above all things it should be on a sloping land because some of the water that you will be pouring there should not stall, because if it stores then your seedlings are going to be sick. All the water is supposed to drain. Kadenge	<b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> they could also do and earn some extra shilling from? Muriuki	Yes as long as you have demand for seedlings. We have done our research and we have seen that farmers can make a lot of money from nurseries. Actually we have seen farmers that are in the cities or in the peri-urban areas of the city, who are completely and entirely relying on the money that comes from nurseries. For the common prices of seedlings that we see, about half of it is profit, that is if you inject faming labour into your nursery. Therefore you can make money on it depending on your nursery entirely. End of track. What to consider when setting up your own nursery...|$|E
40|$|Restoring a {{national}} textile industry Cue: In {{the last twenty}} years, approximately four {{out of every five}} textile manufacturers in Kenya has closed down. And among Kenya?s farmers, the decline in cotton production has been equally severe. But what are the reasons for this collapse in the cotton industry, and can anything be done about it? In fact, the reasons are many, and much is already being done. As a start, the Kenyan government has carried out in depth studies that have revealed weaknesses in every part of the cotton chain, from poor quality cotton seed, to unfair competition in world markets. Now, an organisation called the National Cotton Stakeholders? Forum has begun to work on the solutions. The Forum is organising activities at many different levels, to address problems throughout the industry. This has meant working with farmers, processors, marketing agents and crop scientists, and trying to establish links between them that will benefit all whose lives and livelihoods are somehow tied to cotton. Dennis Ochwada is the secretary of the Forum, as well as being Chairman of the Kenya Cotton Growers Association. He spoke to Eric Kadenge about the problems that face Kenya?s cotton industry, and how they are now being addressed. IN:		?In the mid 1980 s there? OUT:		? we are seriously working on it. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 24 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dennis Ochwada of Kenya?s National Cotton Stakeholders? Forum was talking to Eric Kadenge. Transcript Ochwada	In the mid 1980 s there were about 51 textile industries in Kenya. As a result of the adverse situation of the cotton textile sector a lot of them closed down. At the moment we are having about seven functioning textile industries {{and most of them are}} still operating very much under-capacity because of lack of raw material, poor state of equipment, and lack of finance for reinvestment. Kadenge	At least there is good news now that measures are underway to try and revive this industry. What are those measures? Ochwada	First, stakeholders have come together and they have realised the importance of cotton. By stakeholders I mean farmers, I mean those who own the processing industry both primary and secondary, I mean the manufacturers of textiles, I mean the actual manufacturers of apparels, all the way down to the mama cherehani at the local duka in the village. They have come together and they have formed the National Cotton Stakeholders? Forum. They have looked at the local cotton textile chain from bottom to top and back and have realised where these weaknesses are. We have also gone out and looked at the possibilities of producing seed because we really don't have good quality seed from which our farmers can benefit right now. We have also looked at the market situation and the main problem here was that farmers really didn't know who to sell it to. Anybody could come along and cheat a farmer, take his cotton and that is the end of the story. On the other hand the processor also who wanted cotton did not know where to find the farmer. So we have created a linkage between the producers and their market as a means of stabilising the whole situation in order for it then now to start regenerating. Kadenge	Cotton being a cash crop is also a crop that can be exported internationally. How is the playing field when in comes to the international market? Ochwada	We have been saying that we Kenyan producers are efficient producers of cotton; we are competitive at the production level. Unfortunately some people, mainly in the west, are not competitive but they have resources to keep an uncompetitive sector going through subsidies. Now this is illogical. They should do what they do best and they should allow us to do what we do best. At the international level in terms of quality our cotton is good. In terms of price our cotton is good. The only problem is when you introduce subsidies by western countries then we become unable to compete. Kadenge	And is there anything that you can do then to meet that challenge? Ochwada	We are continuing to lobby for the removal of those subsidies while at the same time improving our own efficiency in production so that we continue to be competitive. Kadenge	Now I do realise that cotton is one crop that requires a lot of chemical input and this can have an impact on the final cost of production for the farmer. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you are trying to address? Ochwada	Yes. First of all let me say that the cost of chemicals and pesticides take anything between 31 %- 37 % of the cost of production. So you can see they are quite significant. Any way we can find of mitigating that cost is of benefit to the farmer. Now what is happening is that while we are trying to get to the farmer better techniques of managing his crop so that his use of chemicals and pesticides goes down, we are also looking at alternatives like organic cotton. Those are varieties which have a special attraction in that their use of chemical is virtually negligible. They command a niche market which fetches a better price in the rich north. But we are also trying to look at what causes the chemicals to be so expensive because chemicals are also expensive. Kadenge	Now all said and done would you tell a farmer that cotton is a good business to get into and why? Ochwada	Well cotton is a good business to get into because it?s a hardy crop, it's drought resistant and it grows in those areas where not many other cash crops grow. So it is something that I would tell farmers to do. First of all from the individual household level they can get money. In terms of the national economy, its extensive coverage is good for the economy. We are estimating that a fully revived cotton industry in this country would create the 500, 000 jobs that have been talked about all over the place. Kadenge	And in terms of the future, when do you see a fully revived cotton industry coming into play? Ochwada	I would like to see it tomorrow. Unfortunately it doesn't quite work that way. There are certain things which have got time implications which we cannot avoid. One, the development of the pure seed. Surely you are not going to have a re-established and fully functional cotton sector if you don't have a pure seed. This we estimate will take about three to four years. That will go with other strategies such as the training of the farmers, the rehabilitation of our processing industry and the development of the marketing structures. That will take about three to four years if we are seriously working on it and we think we are seriously working on it. End of track. Dennis Ochwada of Kenya?s National Cotton Stakeholders?

40|$|Horticultural crops {{for export}} Cue: Kenya {{is well known}} as one of the major African {{suppliers}} of fruit, vegetables and flowers to European markets. In January this year, a group of European buyers, including some of the big supermarkets, introduced a new set of standards for horticultural produce. Called Eurepgap, the standards require all suppliers to grow their produce in accordance with strict rules - and to be able to prove that they have done so. Failure to meet the standards could mean that a buyer will refuse to accept the produce, potentially a big loss of income for the farmer. So growing for export markets remains a challenging business, not least for small-scale farmers. To find out how farmers are coping, and to learn about the support offered by the agricultural extension services in Kenya, Eric Kadenge recently visited two farms close to Nairobi. He also spoke to an extension officer who has been helping both farmers with their production and their marketing. IN:		?My name is Bernard Ngoi? OUT:		? alongside their food crops. ? DUR?N		 7 ? 55 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sarah Ndegwa concluding that while growing horticultural crops for export is a demanding activity, it can also be financially rewarding. Transcript Ngoi:	My name is Bernard Ngoi. I plant French beans, baby corns and maize for eating. Kadenge:	Do you also plant the French beans for eating? Ngoi:	No I plant French beans for selling. Kadenge:	Right now we are in your farm and I can see that you are busy as well as your colleagues here. What is happening, what are you doing? Ngoi:	Now we are preparing to plant some French beans. Kadenge:	Why did you decide to grow French beans for sale? Ngoi:	It is the crop for which I can get money easily, because we use one and a half months to get money. Kadenge:	What are some of the biggest challenges you face with this crop? Ngoi:	Sometimes when we have no fertilizers or the money where we can get it, it is difficult for us, because if you plant without fertilizer or manure it cannot do well. Also we use some labourers but we give them 120 /- per half day. Sometimes we use a machine for pumping some water. So sometimes we get loss instead of profit. Kadenge:	Why do you have to use labourers? Ngoi:	It is because if we use cows we cannot prepare well, so as to make the French beans grow well. Kadenge:	And you've mentioned that you also have to use a water pump to pump water. Where do you get this water from? Is it from that river ahead of us? Ngoi:	We get water from this river, you can see. Also we built a gabion here - you can see it. And we were helped by local government. We can use it and plant more and we can get money. Kadenge:	Now the level of the water here is very, very low. Is this what usually happens or are there times when you have a lot of water here that it actually flows like a big river? Ngoi:	Yes, in December, January to May it flows very much, and there is plenty of water here. Kadenge:	Other than the problems of pumping water and the cost of production of French beans, what other difficulties do you face in terms of growing French beans? Ngoi:	Sometimes there is some limit in marketing. And if we plant and it is not carried, we lose some kgs (kilograms). Kadenge:	So they are very perishable. They have to get to the market quickly. And how do you carry them from your farm to the market? Ngoi:	We use wheel-barrows to carry these to our nearest market, so it can be carried by the agent to send it to Machakos or Nairobi. SFX	Car stopping, door closing. Kadenge:	We have just arrived at Mr Katumbo's farm. He grows all kinds of fruits but what you can see most as you enter his farm are the mango trees and as you shall discover he has more than five different varieties of mango trees that he grows here. Katumbo:	I am Peter Mutisya Katumbo. I am a horticultural farmer. I grow a variety of mango fruits, oranges, tangerines, tomatoes and also some paw paws. Kadenge:	Of all the crops that you have mentioned, what do you grow most? Katumbo:	Mangoes. I've got about more than 10 mango varieties. Kadenge:	OK. Let?s move closer to this heap of mangoes here. What are they doing here - why are they heaped here? Katumbo:	We are going to ferry these to Nairobi for marketing. Kadenge:	So why don?t we take a walk to the farm and then continue to discuss a little bit more about your mango farming? SFX	Footsteps. Kadenge:	So we are standing just next to one of the mango trees here that seems to be very, very heavy with fruit. Now this is what variety? Katumbo:	This is called Kent. Kadenge:	Now why did you decide to grow mangoes? Katumbo:	I would say I was looking for a crop which can give good returns. This appears to be the only cash crop that can do well here. Kadenge:	Are there any challenges that you face as you bring up these mango trees? Katumbo:	Yeah there are all sorts of challenges. You find various diseases attacking the crop. Spraying of chemicals is very necessary. The required chemicals, for example fungicides. To export mangoes to Europe has become somewhat a big problem, because now we have newly-introduced conditions by EUREPGAP. Kadenge:	Now what word would you have for somebody that is thinking of growing mangoes? Katumbo:	I would like to tell him that growing mangoes should be taken seriously. It seems as though it is the only viable cash crop in this area. Kadenge:	So thank you very much for taking us around your farm and we've enjoyed talking about the various fruits especially about mangoes. SFX	Car stopping. Ndegwa:	My name is Sarah Ndegwa, I am a specialist in horticulture, and I am doing extension work for the Machakos district. I give guidance on production and after production we link the farmers to the market. Kadenge:	We have just visited two of the farmers you work with. One was a French bean farmer and the other one is this mango farmer. Let?s start with French beans. What are the conditions necessary for the cultivation of French beans? Ndegwa:	Generally what is required in almost all of the crops is record keeping. Because you need to know: time of planting, time of spraying, and what chemicals you sprayed, the dosage, the quantity, source of seed, for example - where you bought the seed from. So the farmers have to record every step of their activity, and this also helps in the traceability and also the expected time of harvesting. Each crop has its own chemicals. We do give a spray programme for each crop. And the chemicals depend on the time, the stage of the product. Because let?s say you are harvesting: you need to use chemicals that have a short post harvest interval, like one day or two days. The same thing with mangoes. If you are harvesting, at harvesting stage we actually discourage spraying at harvesting stage for mangoes. So most of the chemicals for mangoes you start when they are flowering. Kadenge:	One of the things that the two farmers have mentioned has been accessibility to the market and the exploitation by middlemen. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you are able to address, as a horticultural development agency? Ndegwa:	We are working very hard on this because we have been helping the farmers on production and they have managed to do good quality produce. We have a list of exporters that we have approached, and local markets also. So we are trying to link them with the farmer. Like this mango farmer; we just brought an exporter to him and he bought his mangoes and he bought even from the farmers around here. He is able to collect from the farm and pay them on the farm. And the same case with the French bean farmers. We are linking them with a buyer. That way the middlemen issue is being tackled; but only for those farmers we are working with. Kadenge:	But since these are high value crops, are you seeing a difference? Do they change the lives of the farmers here, who may not have been making much from the usual subsistence farming of maize and beans? Ndegwa:	Over the four years that I have been in extension work I have seen horticultural farming making a difference in farmers? lives. They are able to pay their school fees and meet other small expenses, because they are doing their horticultural farming as a cash crop alongside their food crops. End of track.
