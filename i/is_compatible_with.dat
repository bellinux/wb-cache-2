5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device {{includes a}} dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector {{is used for}} both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E

5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E

Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and final position within a word/ligature.|$|E
5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.|$|E

Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics.|$|E
