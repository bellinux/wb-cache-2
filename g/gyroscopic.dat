5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the <b>gyroscopic</b> effects of their wheels are canceled out, the hypothesis that the <b>gyroscopic</b> effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E
5|$|Between the two {{unstable}} regimes {{mentioned in}} the previous section, and influenced by all the factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, <b>gyroscopic</b> effects, etc.), {{there may be a}} range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright. It has been proven that neither <b>gyroscopic</b> effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they certainly can enhance hands-free control.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. <b>Gyroscopic</b> forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on <b>gyroscopic</b> effects below.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither <b>gyroscopic</b> effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any <b>gyroscopic</b> effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence <b>gyroscopic</b> forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, <b>gyroscopic</b> if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and <b>gyroscopic</b> effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as <b>gyroscopic</b> or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, David E. H. Jones {{published}} an article in Physics Today showing that <b>gyroscopic</b> effects are not necessary to balance a bicycle. Since 1971, when he identified and named the wobble, weave and capsize modes, Robin Sharp has written regularly about the behavior of motorcycles and bicycles. While at Imperial College, London, he worked with David Limebeer and Simos Evangelou.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and <b>gyroscopic</b> effects, direct position control over steering angle {{has been found to}} be problematic.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} <b>gyroscopic</b> {{effect in}} most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into the {{direction}} of a lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|While {{the moment}} from <b>gyroscopic</b> forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} {{significant}} part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of <b>gyroscopic</b> effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by <b>gyroscopic</b> precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double <b>gyroscopic</b> system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the San Giorgio class were {{designed}} as improved {{versions of the}} Pisa-class design. San Marcos design featured several new innovations that differentiated her from her sister ship San Giorgio. San Marco was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship {{and she was the}} first turbine-powered ship in any navy to have four shafts, the first with a <b>gyroscopic</b> compass, the first with antiroll tanks, and the first not to use wood in any way.|$|E
5|$|A re-release of {{the game}} was {{announced}} on 7 September 2017 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Virtuos handling the port. This enhanced version features finer texture details, upgraded weather effects, and new camera angles; the Switch version also features <b>gyroscopic</b> controls with the Joy-Con. All versions are scheduled for release on 14 November 2017. Rockstar also announced L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, {{a subset of the}} seven {{of the game}}'s cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive, originally scheduled for release in November 2017, but that date has now been changed to December 2017.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as <b>gyroscopic</b> organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the <b>gyroscopic</b> effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in <b>gyroscopic</b> compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through <b>gyroscopic</b> precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|Spindizzy is {{an action}} and puzzle game played from an {{isometric}} perspective. Players can view {{the playing field}} from four angles, and rotate between them. The game {{takes place in a}} fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a <b>Gyroscopic</b> Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform—and modify its mobility as a result—between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.|$|E

25|$|The model E {{was fitted}} with a {{prototype}} autopilot that used a wind driven generator and pendulums to drive the wing warping controls. The design was quickly eclipsed by a <b>gyroscopic</b> autopilot developed by Lawrence Sperry for the competing Curtiss Aeroplane Company.|$|E
25|$|The Bathursts were {{equipped}} with modified Type 128 asdic equipment, redesigned {{to be used}} without a <b>gyroscopic</b> stabiliser. Minesweeping equipment also varied across the class: ships {{equipped with}} the newer 'LL' minesweeping gear were distributed as evenly as possible throughout major Australian ports.|$|E
25|$|While {{the moment}} from <b>gyroscopic</b> forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} {{significant}} part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor, and a <b>gyroscopic</b> sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the <b>gyroscopic</b> sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemispherical}} resonator gyroscope (HRG), {{also called}} wine-glass gyroscope or mushroom gyro, makes using a thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures {{that surround the}} shell. <b>Gyroscopic</b> effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves.|$|E
25|$|The Norden bombsight {{consisted}} of two primary parts, the <b>gyroscopic</b> stabilization platform on the left side, and the mechanical calculator and sighting head on the right side. They were essentially separate instruments, connecting through the sighting prism. The sighting eyepiece was located in the middle, between the two, in a less than convenient location that required some dexterity to use.|$|E
25|$|A second {{experiment}} {{conducted during}} a trip to Paris involved a propeller-driven bicycle designed by Bossi; the test rider achieved a speed of , but one drawback was noted: the <b>gyroscopic</b> effect of the propeller generated so much torque that the bicycle became unstable. Bossi concluded, erroneously, that a successful human-powered aircraft would therefore require two counter-rotating propellers to cancel out the effects of torque.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by <b>gyroscopic</b> precession. The {{magnitude}} of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
25|$|By late 1941, the Army Research Center at Peenemünde {{possessed the}} {{technologies}} {{essential to the}} success of the A-4. The four key technologies for the A-4 were large liquid-fuel rocket engines, supersonic aerodynamics, <b>gyroscopic</b> guidance and rudders in jet control. At the time, Adolf Hitler was not particularly impressed by the V-2; he pointed out that it was merely an artillery shell with a longer range and much higher cost.|$|E
25|$|The Sidewinder missile uses small control {{surfaces}} {{placed at the}} rear of the missile with spinning disks on their outer surfaces and these are known as rollerons. Airflow over the disks spins them to a high speed. If the missile starts to roll, the <b>gyroscopic</b> force of the disks drives the control surface into the airflow, cancelling the motion. Thus, the Sidewinder team replaced a potentially complex control system with a simple mechanical solution.|$|E
25|$|He {{was educated}} at Birkenhead School and Shrewsbury School, where he {{demonstrated}} a natural engineering acumen, able to improvise fixes or improvements to almost anything mechanical. During the First World War, {{he created a}} small stir at the War Office by sending them a design for an interrupter gear to allow a machine gun to fire from a propeller-driven aeroplane without damaging the propeller's blades, and also a design for a <b>gyroscopic</b> stabilizer for aircraft.|$|E
25|$|By September 1931, his rockets had the now {{familiar}} {{appearance of}} a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with <b>gyroscopic</b> guidance, and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German V-2 over 10years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.|$|E
25|$|A {{temporary}} loss {{of funding}} from the Guggenheims, {{as a result of}} the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to Clark University until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed. Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The <b>gyroscopic</b> control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.|$|E
