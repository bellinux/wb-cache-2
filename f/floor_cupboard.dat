50|$|The {{interior}} of the main part has two rooms {{on the first floor}} and two on the second. The rooms on the west side are larger than the rooms on the east side. Each of the four rooms has a fireplace. In the western room on the first <b>floor,</b> <b>cupboards</b> flank the fireplace. In the opposite room is a staircase which ascends into a bedroom above.|$|R
60|$|Skins of {{lion and}} panther covered the <b>floor.</b> <b>Cupboards</b> and bookcases lined the walls. Odd vases made {{by his own}} hand from the clay of the region held {{beautiful}} tropical flowers. Curtains of grass and bamboo covered the windows, and, most arduous task of all, with his meager assortment of tools he had fashioned lumber to neatly seal {{the walls and ceiling}} and lay a smooth floor within the cabin.|$|R
5000|$|Helen Harper {{gets sick}} and can't train with her team. She is found by Rountree, huddled on the <b>floor</b> in kitchen <b>cupboard</b> {{with her hands}} shaking, and is taken to the doctor.|$|R
60|$|He slouched {{across the}} <b>floor,</b> entered his <b>cupboard,</b> and disappeared. Fischer was {{suddenly}} {{aware of the}} moisture upon his forehead. There was something animallike, absolutely inhuman, about this creature {{with whom he had}} made his murderous bargain.|$|R
5000|$|McCann {{writes in}} a 9th-floor {{apartment}} sitting {{with a computer}} device on his lap on the <b>floor</b> of a <b>cupboard</b> with no windows located between [...] "two very tight walls", surrounded by messages written by himself and others.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no sign}} here, at any rate, of hurried departure. Everything was in its place, not a {{scrap of}} paper {{littered}} the <b>floor,</b> not a <b>cupboard</b> or drawer was left open. The curtains were drawn aside, and through the open window the fresh morning air was streaming in.|$|R
50|$|A storage wall, in {{building}} trade jargon, {{is a system}} of <b>floor</b> to ceiling <b>cupboards,</b> storage elements, and doorways that can be pre-assembled or assembled on site when building an office. Storage walls are either built against pre existing walls, or {{can be used as}} a room divider / acoustic wall themselves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{detailing}} employed on {{the interior}} of Kinkabool was advertised as [...] "luxurious" [...] in 1960 and demonstrated the ideals of modernity that were to attract holidaymakers to this style of self-contained accommodation. The walls to the shops on the internal arcade were made with glass and Maple framing, and its floors were finished with terrazzo. The stairs were formed in reinforced concrete and lined with pre-cast terrazzo to the first level. The balusters and handrail were milled steel and Maple respectively. Ceilings throughout were sprayed with vermiculite plaster. Inside each unit, and demonstrating very clearly the preferences of the time for modern convenience, the kitchens featured laminated stainless steel sinks, plastic bench-tops, tiled splashbacks and <b>floors,</b> built-in <b>cupboards</b> with plywood doors, and sliding glass facing upper cupboards. They opened into the living area with bar units. The bathrooms were tiled in bright patterns.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} former building, the plan {{incorporated}} a large central room (pavilion) suitable for public gatherings. The plan and footprint generally followed that of the former building, except that a central entrance has replaced two former front porches. Other rooms include a dispensary, two wards men's and women's, the latter used by the nursing sisters or visitors when not needed for patients; a wireless room-cum lounge with an open fireplace, that once housed the transceiver and a circulating library {{for the use of}} local people; a large kitchen with <b>floor</b> to ceiling <b>cupboards</b> and an adjoining pantry; bathrooms, toilets and sisters' accommodation.|$|R
30|$|A {{second reason}} for the {{deviations}} is that the path loss close to the transmitter (low path losses) is somewhat overestimated by the prediction (see also T 1 (2) in Table 5, column 'Zuiderpoort'). Finally, the path loss is somewhat underestimated by the prediction model (± 3 to 5 dB) for locations with higher losses (see Figures 10 and 11). The {{reason for this is}} that some rooms on the third <b>floor</b> have metal <b>cupboards</b> against the wall, which make the actual path losses increase, but these metal cupboards are not taken into account in the prediction algorithm.|$|R
40|$|Many {{ordinary}} {{surfaces and}} hands of healthcare givers in hospitals are sometimes inadequately decontaminated with routine disinfection techniques. It {{is necessary to}} determine the distribution of these pathogens in the hospitals. In this study 160 swab samples were collected from ten different surfaces including nurses 2 ̆ 7 hand swab, Nurses 2 ̆ 7 table top, door knob/handle, toilet seat, operation table, sink, stretcher, <b>floor,</b> bedrail, and <b>cupboard.</b> Biochemical tests were used to identify the bacteria. Kirby-Bauer-Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) modified single disc diffusion technique {{was used to determine}} the antibiogram profile of the pathogens at 0. 5 scale McFarland 2 ̆ 7 s standard (1. 5 × 108 cells/ml).

50|$|James Baxter {{bought the}} future {{site of the}} present house in 1797 {{as part of a}} {{property}} approximately 0.5 sq mi in total area. Here he erected the core of the present house in 1807; many of the original elements, including the floor plan, the ash <b>floor,</b> the walnut <b>cupboards,</b> and {{much of the rest of}} the interior, have survived. Very little was modified until the 1930s, when the original building was expanded with a new section. The period owners derived much of the new addition's design from that of a Tidewater Virginia house, the colonial-era Carter's Grove. The resulting building is approximately 7000 sq ft in area and surrounded by a large lawn with early landscaping and a caretaker's house.|$|R
6000|$|Every {{thing in}} Uncle Abel's house {{was in the}} same time, place, manner, and form, from year's end to year's end. There was old Master Bose, a dog after my uncle's own heart, who always walked as if he was {{studying}} the multiplication table. There was the old clock, forever ticking in the kitchen corner, with a picture on its face of the sun, forever setting behind a perpendicular row of poplar trees. There was the never-failing supply of red peppers and onions hanging over the chimney. There, too, were the yearly hollyhocks and morning-glories blooming about the windows. There was the [...] "best room," [...] with its sanded <b>floor,</b> the <b>cupboard</b> in one corner with its glass doors, the ever green asparagus bushes in the chimney, and there was the stand with the Bible and almanac on it in another corner. There, too, was Aunt Betsey, who never looked any older, because she always looked as old as she could; who always dried her catnip and wormwood the last of September, and began to clean house the first of May. In short, this was the land of continuance. Old Time never took it into his head to practise either addition, or subtraction, or multiplication on its sum total.|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{metals in}} outdoor and indoor {{airborne}} particulate matter (PM) and dust in different residential built environmentsat two rural and one urban site in Pakistan were analysed. An eight stage non-viable impactor (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) loaded with EMP 2000 glass microfiber filter papers (Whatman, England) was used to collect airborne PM. The indoordust samples (settled dust) were collected from different indoor surfaces (<b>floor,</b> <b>cupboards)</b> in living rooms and kitchens from houses at rural sites. The outdoor samples were collected from courtyards of the houses. At the urban site dust samples were also collected by the roads at 27 different locations around Lahoreand at a background site (University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences). Additionally, samples of dung cake, used as solid fuel, {{at one of the}} rural sites were taken. Heavy metals (Si, Al, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb, Co and As) were determined by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. At rural site I, in general, the concentrations of metals were higher outdoors than indoors, except for slightly higher indoor levels of Cu (0. 85. g/m 3 indoor: 0. 56 outdoor. g/m 3), Si (3. 31. g/m 3 indoor: 3. 17 outdoor. g/m 3) and Pb(11. 99 ng/m 3 indoor: 9. 32 outdoor ng/m 3). At the rural site II the mean concentration were higher outdoors than indoors, excluding Ni which was considerably higher indoors (55. 68 ng/m 3) than outdoors (31. 91 ng/m 3). At the urban site,outdoors, Si had the highest concentration (3. 46. g/m 3) followed by Al, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb and Co. Similarly, the indoor levels had a maximum contribution from Si (12. 30. g/m 3) followed by Al, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, As, Pb, Ni and Co. With reference to dust at rural site I the top five metals outdoors were Si (708 mg/kg), Al, Cu, Zn and Pb (52 mg/kg) while, indoors Al was highest (281 mg/kg), followed by Si, Cu, Zn and Pb (57 mg/kg). At rural site II, both outdoors and indoors, Al (274 mg/kg – outdoor: 266 mg/kg - indoor), Si, Zn, Cu and Pb (61 mg/kg – outdoor: 80 mg/kg - indoor) were the five most abundant metals. The main five metals in decreasing order of their concentration in the road dust around Lahore were Si (686 mg/kg), Al, Cu, Zn and Pb (81 mg/kg). On the other hand, the dust samples from the background site showed Si (345 mg/kg) > Al >Pb> Cu > Zn (73 mg/kg). The airborne metal concentration of Pb was within the guideline value of WHO (0. 5. g/m 3) but the levels of Mn, Cd and Ni were higher at all sites than the guidelines proposed by European Commission and WHO highlighting the risk of exposure to toxic metals in non-occupational environments...|$|R
60|$|They {{were great}} black creatures that ran boldly in broad {{daylight}} through the streets, and swarmed so, all over the houses, that people at last could not put their hand or foot down anywhere without touching one. When dressing in the morning they found them in their breeches and petticoats, in their pockets and in their boots; and when they wanted a morsel to eat, the voracious horde had swept away everything from cellar to garret. The night was even worse. As soon as the lights were out, these untiring nibblers set to work. And everywhere, in the ceilings, in the <b>floors,</b> in the <b>cupboards,</b> at the doors, there was a chase and a rummage, and so furious a noise of gimlets, pincers, and saws, that a deaf man could not have rested for one hour together.|$|R
40|$|Many {{ordinary}} {{surfaces and}} hands of healthcare givers in hospitals are sometimes inadequately decontaminated with routine disinfection techniques. It {{is necessary to}} determine the distribution of these pathogens in the hospitals. In this study 160 swab samples were collected from ten different surfaces including nurses’ hand swab, Nurses’ table top, door knob/handle, toilet seat, operation table, sink, stretcher, <b>floor,</b> bedrail, and <b>cupboard.</b> Biochemical tests were used to identify the bacteria. Kirby-Bauer-Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) modified single disc diffusion technique {{was used to determine}} the antibiogram profile of the pathogens at 0. 5 scale McFarland’s standard (1. 5 × 108 cells/ml). The total percentage prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was 50. 80 %, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 28. 60 % and Escherichia coli 20. 60 %. Out of 20. 60 % of E. coli isolates 7. 7 % were found to be E. coli O 157 :H 7. S. aureus isolates were highly resistant to ampcillin and cefoxitin P. aeruginosa and E. coli were resistant to tetracycline. The multiple antibiotic resistance indexes of the pathogens were more than 0. 2. Among the isolates, S. aureus showed more multidrug resistance (31. 30 %) and E. coli had the least multidrug. Frequently touched surfaces within the hospital environment are contaminated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These pathogens can be transfer from surfaces to patients and to surfaces again through healthcare workers. The widespread use of antimicrobials, especially over- or inappropriate use of antibiotics, has contributed to an increased incidence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms...|$|R
