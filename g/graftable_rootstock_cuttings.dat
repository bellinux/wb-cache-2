This study involves verification of selected rootstocks with reference to growth, propagation ability and other characteristics. Different rootstocks, different growth stimulators and different kinds of cuttings techniques were adopted for these experiments. Stimulators used for evaluations included: 1 % Racine (2. 5 % naphthalene acetic acid - NAA), 0. 5 % Rhizopon AA (2. 5 % indole- 3 -butyric acid - IBA) and 0. 25 % IBA in 50 % ethanol solution. There were three sets of experiments in all. In Experiment 1, the bases of cuttings were treated with the stimulators and part of them was also treated with heat before planting. Results from Experiment 1 indicated that cuttings treated with Rhizopon AA produced the best effect after heat treatment (with an overall average of 36. 9 % of rooted cuttings). Pyrodwarf (78. 7 %), Cydomalus (73. 9 %) and Pyroplus (60. 6 %) were the best performing rootstocks among the evaluated ones. In Experiment 2, we evaluated the influence of the date of harvesting the cuttings on rooting (comparisons were made between cuttings prepared in December [early] and March [late]). For BA 29 <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings,</b> the best performance was attained by cuttings taken in March. The difference in rooting between March and December was 43. 9 %. On the other hand, early harvested <b>rootstocks</b> (<b>cuttings</b> taken in December) for Cydomalus showed the best performance, with an 18. 7 % difference between cuttings made in December and in March. Results from other evaluated rootstocks were not significant enough. In Experiment 3, the effect of chemical (phytohormone) stimulation and heat stimulations was compared. The best result was obtained by combinations of treatments without heat stimulations, when the cuttings were stored at 5 °C and later treated with 0. 25 % IBA in 50 % ethanol solution. The least rooting results, on the other hand, were observed in heat treated cuttings, in cuttings stimulated with IBA and subsequently with heat and in cuttings treated with a 3 cm radial cut at the base. Based on our findings we cannot prove clearly that heat stimulation and the phytohormones used have beneficial effects on rooting of especially new rootstock genotypes with an unknown propagation coefficient. This means that propagation using cuttings still remains an interesting topic to be further researched...|$|R

In the first one, semi-hardwood cuttings from the 'Sunki' mandarin hybrids H 49 and H 77 were collected {{in the fall and}} late spring of 2013 and treated with IBA (0 mg L- 1, 1, 500 mg L- 1 and 3, 000 mg L- 1). For each collection season, a 2 x 3 (two genotypes x three IBA concentrations) factorial scheme was adopted, in a randomized blocks design. In the second experiment, the development of cuttings that rooted in the late spring was evaluated until grafting. In this case, a completely randomized experimental design was adopted, with the hybrids H 49 and H 77. The IBA treatments positively influenced rooting and number of roots only in the fall collection, peaking at 23. 3 % of rooted cuttings.

40|$|Although plant biotisation with arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) is {{a promising}} strategy for improving plant health, a better knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms involved is required. In this context, {{we sought to}} analyse the root proteome of grapevine rootstock Selection Oppenheim 4 (SO 4) upon colonisation with two AMF. As expected, AMF colonisation stimulates plant biomass. At the proteome level, changes in protein amounts due to AMF colonisation resulted in 39 differentially accumulated two-dimensional electrophoresis spots in AMF roots relative to control. Out of them, 25 were co-identified in SO 4 roots upon colonisation by Glomus irregulare and Glomus mosseae supporting the existence of conserved plant responses to AM symbiosis in a woody perennial species. Among the 18 proteins whose amount was reduced in AMF-colonised roots were proteins involved in glycolysis, protein synthesis and fate, defence and cell rescue, ethylene biosynthesis and purine and pyrimidine salvage degradation. The six co-identified proteins whose amount was increased had functions in energy production, signalling, protein synthesis and fate including proteases. Altogether these data confirmed that {{a part of the}} accommodation program of AMF previously characterized in annual plants is maintained within roots of the SO 4 <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Nonetheless, particular responses also occurred involving proteins of carbon metabolism, development and root architecture, defence and cell rescue, anthocyanin biosynthesis and P remobilization, previously reported as induced upon P-starvation.

This work reports {{the results of a}} real-time PCR assay (TaqMan®) for detecting phy-toplasmas in grapevines affected by FD. We obtained specific detection in samples from seven FD-affected grapevines. This method gave no signal with phytoplas-mas associated with another grapevine disease (Bois noir) or with eleven reference phytoplasma strains grown in periwinkle. We propose Real-time PCR as an alternative and rapid method for the detection of phyto-plasmas in grapevine. Key words: grapevine, flavescence dorée, phytoplas-ma detection, real-time PCR Flavescence dorée (FD) {{is considered one of the}} most severe threats to viticulture in all areas where it has been reported (Boudon-Padieu, 2003).

We report herein a system to produce trees on `Swingle` citrumelo more rapidly by budding onto non-rooted cuttings, as well as assessing potential to rapidly multiply `Swingle` through rooting of non-budded cuttings. Therefore, two potential products are described: budded trees and rooted <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings.</b> `Valencia` sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] was budded at different heights on cuttings derived from eight-month old rootstocks. Grafted and additional non-budded cuttings were then treated with indole- 3 -butyric acid (500 mg L(- 1)) or left untreated before rooting. Three types of cuttings were evaluated: softwood, semi-hardwood and hardwood. The use of nursery trees derived from pre-budded hardwood cuttings of `Swingle` citrumelo is an alternative grafting method on this cultivar. Softwood cuttings with one leaf pair were considered the most adequate material for rapid multiplication of `Swingle` citrumelo by cutting. This could be particularly useful for inarching production or conventional budding after transplant of cutting-derived rootstocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

E. amylovora is a plant pathogenic bacterium regulated by the Directive 2000 / 29 /EC (Annexes II-A-II). E. amylovora is a single taxonomic entity. This organism can be accurately identified, based {{on a range of}} discriminative methods. Detection methods are available for symptomatic and asymptomatic plant material. E. amylovora ispresent in all EU Member States except Estonia, Finland and Malta, where host plants are not widely distributed or are rare. The host plants (mainly pear and apple) are cultivated throughout Europe where environmental conditions are conducive to disease development. Although no recent data are available on losses caused by E. amylovora in the EU, fire blight is considered to be the most destructive disease on pear and apple owing to the loss of trees. The analysis of past disease outbreaks previously reported in the EU highlights their considerable potential to have a severe impact on commercial horticulture, especially on apple, pear and quince, as well as on ornamentals and on nursery trade. The disease causes a range of symptoms on the aerial parts of plants, including the fruits, and E. amylovora often kills the trees and causes destructive outbreaks.

The aim {{of this research was}} to detect other possible sources of inoculum throughout the different nursery stages by classical and molecular techniques (nested-PCR and multiplex nested-PCR). Results revealed the presence of the I. liriodendri and/or I. macrodidyma complex in grapevine <b>rootstock</b> and scion <b>cuttings,</b> cutting tools, water from hydration tanks, well water, callusing medium, one indoor air sample and soils collected from mother fields and nurseries. “ Cylindrocarpon ” pauciseptatum was only detected in the callusing medium, nursery soils, rooted-graftlings and on the root pruning machine.

La mise au point récente d’un test Elisa spécifique de la flavescence dorée (FD) sur échantillon de vigne a permis de différencier la FD des autres jaunisses. Ce test permet de détecter la FD sur différents cépages, au vignoble, et sur des porte-greffes, en serre, présentant de légers symptômes. Il a été appliqué à des échantillons de vigne provenant de régions différentes du monde entier. La FD a été localisée ainsi dans le Sud de la France et le Nord de l’Italie (Friule). En France, ces résultats ont permis de clarifier la situation très confuse concernant la présence de la FD et du bois noir en Bourgogne, ainsi que dans les régions voisines. Les échantillons de Suisse, d’Italie (Émilie romagne et Sicile), Australie, Israël, États-Unis (État de New York), ainsi que ceux de l’Union Sud-Africaine infectés par la maladie du Shiraz, ont réagi négativement. Ces jaunisses n’ont donc pas de relation sérologique avec la FD. Une telle enquête ne garantit pas l’absence de la FD dans les régions prospectées, cependant, elle permet de mettre en évidence l’importance des autres jaunisses. Grapevine yellows (GY) are {{a group of}} diseases with similar symptoms. The recent publication on the use of Elisa to detect the flavescence dorée (FD) mycoplasma-like organism (MLO) in the grapevine itself has allowed the differentiation of FD from the other GY. In order to investigate the epidemiology of FD, grapevine canes or leaves showing GY symptoms were harvested from several areas in the world (France, 138 samples; Northern Italy and Sicily, 13; Switzerland, 39; Israel, 9; North America, 31; South Africa, 24; and Australia, 26) and tested by Elisa using specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against FD. FD-MLO were specifically detected in various cultivars from the field and in <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings</b> grown in the greenhouse and showing mild symptoms. In this work, FD was found to be confined to grapevine stocks in 2 regions of Europe: southern France and northern Italy (Friuli). In France, these results have allowed clarification of a very confusing situation concerning FD and Bois noir (BN). All the symptomatic vines of north-east France reacted negatively, and hence probably belong to BN. Some samples from the south of the Rhône valley (Ardèche) reacted similarly. No positive FD reaction was obtained with samples showing GY symptoms from Sicily, Emilia Romagna (Italy), Switzerland (western part and Tessin), Israel, USA (New York State), South Australia or with Shiraz decline desease from the Republic of South Africa. These results suggest that no serological relationship exists between FD-MLO and the other GY. However this study does not exclude that FD could be present in some parts of these areas.

40|$|The botryosphaeriaceous fungi {{can cause}} decline, dieback {{and death of}} grapevines. Anecdotal {{evidence}} has indicated that these pathogens might {{be present in the}} young vines sold by propagation nurseries, so this study investigated their role in spread of this disease. Sampling of grapevine nurseries across New Zealand showed that botryosphaeriaceous infections were present in eight out of nine nurseries with infection incidence ranging from 5 to 63 %. Of the 311 propagation materials and plants received, 23 % were positive for botryosphaeriaceous infection, with a total of 120 isolates recovered. The highest incidence was in failed grafted plants (33 %), followed by Grade 1 plants (28 %), <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings</b> (19 %), scion cuttings (17 %) and Grade 2 plants (7 %). For grafted plants, the majority of botryosphaeriaceous species (49 %) were isolated near the graft unions while infections on <b>rootstocks</b> and scion <b>cuttings</b> were mostly from the middle and basal parts. Identification of isolates by morphological and molecular methods showed that the six species commonly found in vineyards also occurred in nurseries, being Neofusicoccum luteum (57 %), N. parvum (18 %), N. australe (8 %), Diplodia mutila (8 %), Botryosphaeria dothidea (5 %) and D. seriata (3 %), with one novel isolate of N. macroclavatum and two unidentified botryosphaeriaceous isolates. Pathogenicity tests using one-year-old Sauvignon blanc rooted canes and green shoots showed that the seven identified botryosphaeriaceous species from the nurseries were pathogenic but pathogenicity differed significantly between species and isolates within a species, with N. parvum being the most pathogenic in both assays (P≤ 0. 001). Genetic variability analysis using UP-PCR showed that N. luteum isolates of different pathotypes were genetically diverse with intra- and inter-plant and nursery variability but no association between genotype and pathogenicity was observed. Susceptibility tests using three isolates each of N. luteum, N. parvum and N. australe against the most commonly used scion and rootstock varieties (six of each) found that all varieties were susceptible to the three species with 5 C and SO 4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions. Investigations into the sources of inoculum conducted in three nurseries in 2009 using conventional and molecular methods showed that the mothervines used to provide cuttings for propagation were the most likely source of botryosphaeriaceous infections. Propagules were detected on the surfaces of cuttings and dead grapevine materials, as well as in rain-water run-off, but not in soil samples collected from the mothervine blocks. The different botryosphaeriaceous isolates recovered from canes were mostly sited within the bark suggesting presence of latent infections. Since the isolates from mothervine trunk and canes were distributed in isolated patches and the UP-PCR assessment showed that they belonged to multiple genotypes and species, this indicated that they were spread from external sources. Microscopy and plating assays were not able to detect botryosphaeriaceous contamination from any of the nursery propagation stages but molecular methods using multi-species primers detected botryosphaeriaceous DNA in samples from a wash pit, pre-cold storage hydration tanks, post-grafting hydration tanks, grafting tools and callusing medium from the different nurseries. An investigation into the probable survival of N. luteum conidia during the processing of cuttings showed that they adhered rapidly and could not be totally washed from the surfaces of cuttings after 0 h, with minimal recovery of conidia after 1, 2 and 4 h incubation at room temperature. During this time they germinated and colonised the periderm, phloem and xylem but not the pith of the cuttings. At storage temperatures of 2 and 8 °C some conidia were able to germinate. At 2 °C, conidial germination was 4 % after 48 h, the number gradually increasing to 17 % after 3 weeks. At 8 °C, conidial germination was 23 % after 24 h, the number gradually increasing to 34 % after 72 h with no further increase observed up to 2 weeks. Cold storage did not kill all conidia, since conidia from 72 h and 3 weeks storage at 2 °C had 84 % and 33 % viability, respectively, while those from 8 °C storage had 72 % and 39 % viability after 72 h and 2 weeks storage, respectively. The N. luteum conidia stored at different temperatures were similarly pathogenic compared to freshly-harvested conidia but higher pathogenicity was observed on conidia stored at 2 °C for 48 to 72 h. Overall results suggest that botryosphaeriaceous infection in new vineyards may originate from latent infection that began in the nurseries, thus management of this disease should start at the nursery level to prevent this pathogen from being carried over into new vineyards...|$|R

O preparo das estacas livre de vírus dos porta-enxertos consistiu em deixar apenas uma folha na parte {{superior}} da estaca e um nó na base, ficando as mesmas com 20 cm de comprimento e 0, 5 cm de diâmetro. Para o enraizamento, as estacas foram então dispostas em caixas plásticas perfuradas contendo o substrato casca de arroz carbonizada em câmara de nebulização. Após quatro semanas, os porta-enxertos foram transplantados para sacos de polietileno com substrato a base de terra e mantidos em casa de vegetação. Avaliou-se a enxertia da videira ‘Rubi’ livre de vírus realizada em três épocas após o transplantio dos porta-enxertos (30, 60 e 90 dias). O delineamento experimental foi o inteiramente casualizado com 6 tratamentos e 5 repetições, sendo cada parcela composta por 10 mudas, em esquema fatorial 2 x 3. Aos 80 dias após cada época de enxertia, foram avaliados os seguintes parâmetros: porcentagem de enxertos brotados, comprimento e diâmetro dos brotos, matérias seca e fresca das raízes por muda e quantificação do sistema radicular (área de raízes e comprimento total de raízes por estaca) através da análise de imagem no programa SIARCS®. Com base nos principais resultados, pôde-se concluir que: a) a obtenção antecipada de mudas de videira ‘Rubi’ é possível realizando-se a enxertia verde em estacas herbáceas dos porta-enxertos ‘Campinas’ e ‘Jales’ 90 dias após o seu enraizamento e b) o emprego da enxertia verde sobre a produção antecipada de mudas de videira ‘Rubi’ reduz em 5 - 6 meses o tempo necessário para a produção de mudas em casa de vegetação e c) mudas de videira ‘Rubi’ produzidas por enxertia verde em estacas herbáceas dos porta-enxertos ‘Campinas’ e ‘Jales’ não apresentam diferenças quanto às características dos enxertos brotados e do seu sistema radicular. The objetive of {{this research}} was to evaluate the feasibility to produce nursery trees of ‘Rubi’ grapevine through green grafting on herbaceous cutting of two vine rootstocks (‘Campinas’ - IAC 766 and ‘Jales’ - IAC 572). <b>Rootstocks</b> <b>cuttings</b> were taken from a virus-free stock plant, and consisted of the leaves elimination of the basal portion, leaving just one leaf in the superior part of each one. Cuttings were prepared with a cut below the node in the basal portion and a cut in the internode in the superior portion, leaving each one with 20 cm of length and 0. 5 cm of diameter. Cuttings were then placed in plastic boxes containing hull rice coal growth medium on mist chamber. After four weeks, the rooted rootstocks were transferred into plastic bags containing soil mix. The ‘Rubi’ green grafting was performed in three different periods after the rootstocks transplantation (30, 60 and 90 days). A randomized design was used as statistical model with 6 treatments and 5 replications. Each plot was composed by 10 trees. The treatments were compared 80 days after each grafting period through the following parameters: porcentage of shooting grafts, length and diameter of shooting grafts, fresh and dry weigth of roots and root quantification (root area and total root length) through image analysis using SIARCS® software. It was possible to conclude that: a) the production advance of ‘Rubi’ young trees is possible performing the green grafting on ‘Campinas’ and ‘Jales’ rootstocks 90 days after their rooting, b) the green grafting technique reduces the time necessary to produce ‘Rubi’ young trees by 5 - 6 months on greenhouse condition and c) nursery trees of ‘Rubi’ grapevine produced through green grafting on herbaceous cuttings of ‘Campinas’ and ‘Jales’ rootstocks do not show differences in relation to the shooting grafts and the root system characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Phaeomoniella chlamydospora is {{the main}} causal {{organism}} of Petri disease, which causes severe decline and dieback of young grapevines (1 - 7 years old) and also predisposes the wood for infection by other pathogens. Knowledge about the epidemiology and especially inoculum sources of this disease is imperative for subsequent development of management strategies. Through isolation studies it was shown that Pa. chlamydospora is mainly distributed through infected propagation material in South Africa. However, the infection pathways and inoculum sources in grapevine nurseries are still unclear. The only existing method to detect this pathogen in various media is by means of isolation onto artificial growth media. This {{has proven to be}} problematic since this fungus is extremely slow growing (up to 4 weeks from isolation to identification) and its cultures are often over-grown by co-isolated fungi and bacteria before it can be identified. The aim of this study was (i) to develop a protocol for the molecular detection of Pa. chlamydospora in grapevine wood, and (ii) to use this protocol along with others, to test different samples (water, soil, <b>rootstock</b> and scion <b>cuttings</b> and callusing medium) collected from nurseries in South Africa at different nursery stages for the presence of Pa. chlamydospora. A protocol was developed and validated for the molecular detection of Pa. chlamydospora in grapevine wood. Firstly, several previously published protocols were used to develop a cost-effective and time-efficient DNA extraction method from rootstock pieces of potted grapevines. Subsequently, PCR amplification using species-specific primers (Pch 1 and Pch 2) was found to be sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 pg of Pa. chlamydospora genomic DNA from grapevine wood. The protocol was validated using various grapevine material from 3 different rootstock cultivars (101 - 14 Mgt, Ramsey and Richter 99) collected from each of 3 different nurseries, including grapevines that were subjected to hot water treatment. The basal end of the rootstock was parallel analysed for Pa. chlamydospora using isolations onto artificial medium and molecular detection. The identity of PCR products obtained from a subset of samples, that only tested positive for Pa. chlamydospora based on molecular detection, was confirmed to be Pa. chlamydospora specific through restriction digestion with AatII. Molecular detection was found to be considerably more sensitive than isolations, detecting Pa. chlamydospora from samples with positive as well as negative isolations. On average, the molecular technique detected Pa. chlamydospora in 80. 9 % of the samples, whereas only 24. 1 % of the samples tested positive for Pa. chlamydospora by means of isolations. Pa. chlamydospora was not isolated from hot water treated samples. The results confirm the importance of hot water treatment for proactive management of Petri disease in grapevine nurseries. However, Pa. chlamydospora DNA was molecularly detected in hot water treated samples in frequencies similar to that detected in non-hot water treated samples. As expected, the DNA in hot water treated plants was not destroyed and could be detected by the developed molecular detection protocol. This is an important consideration when using molecular detection for disease diagnosis or pathogen detection and shows that these methods should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools. Most importantly, the DNA extraction protocol was shown to be 10 to 15 times cheaper than commercial DNA extraction kits. Preliminary studies showed that the aforementioned molecular detection technique was not specific and sensitive enough for detection of Pa. chlamydospora in soil and water (unpublished data). Therefore, a one-tube nested-PCR technique was optimised for detecting Pa. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil, water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. Rootstock cane sections and soil samples were taking from the mother blocks from several nurseries. Water samples were collected from hydration and fungicide tanks during pre-storage and grafting. Scion and <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings</b> were also collected during grafting and soil were collected from the nursery beds prior to planting. The one-tube nested-PCR was sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of Pa. chlamydospora genomic DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR analyses of the different nursery samples revealed the presence of several putative Pa. chlamydospora specific bands (360 bp). Subsequent sequence analyses and/or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR bands confirmed that all bands were Pa. chlamydospora specific, except for five bands obtained from callusing media and one band from water. Considering only Pa. chlamydospora specific PCR bands, the molecular detection technique revealed the presence of Pa. chlamydospora in 25 % of rootstock cane sections and 17 % of the soil samples collected from mother blocks, 42 % of <b>rootstock</b> <b>cuttings</b> collected during grafting, 16 % of scion cuttings, 40 % of water samples collected after the 12 - hour pre-storage hydration period, 67 % of water samples collected during grafting and 8 % of the callusing medium samples. These media should therefore be considered as potential inoculum sources or infection points of the pathogen during the nursery stages. The results furthermore confirmed previous findings that Pa. chlamydospora is mainly distributed through infected <b>rootstock</b> canes and <b>cuttings.</b> Infected scion cuttings were also shown to be potential carriers of the pathogen. Management strategies should include wound protection of rootstock mother plants, eradicating this pathogen from rootstock-cuttings (e. g. hot water treatment), biological or chemical amendments in the hydration water and callusing medium and wound protection from soil borne infections. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Phaeomoniella chlamydospora is die hoof veroorsakende organisme van Petri se siekte wat lei tot die agteruitgang en terugsterwing van jong wingerdplante (1 - 7 jaar oud) en veroorsaak verhoogde vatbaarheid van hout vir infeksie deur ander patogene. Kennis oor die epidemiologie en veral die inokulumbronne van die siekte is noodsaaklik vir die daaropvolgende ontwikkeling van beheerstrategieë. Isolasies het getoon dat Pa. chlamydospora meestal versprei deur middel van geïnfekteerde voortplantingsmateriaal in Suid-Afrika. Die infeksieweë en inokulumbronne in wingerdkwekerye is egter steeds onbekend. Die enigste bestaande metode vir die opsporing van die patogeen, in verskeie mediums, is deur middel van isolasie op kunsmatige groeimediums. Dit is egter gevind om problematies te wees aangesien die swam uiters stadig groei (dit vat tot 4 weke vanaf isolasie tot identifikasie) en die kulture is telkens oorgroei deur ander organismes voordat identifikasie kan plaasvind. Die doel van die studie was (i) om ‘n protokol te ontwikkel vir die molekulêre opsporing van Pa. chlamydospora in wingerdhout, en (ii) om die protokol te gebruik, saam met ander, om verskillende monsters (water, grond, onderstok- en bostok-ente en kallusmedium) te toets, wat versamel is van kwekerye in Suid- Afrika, tydens verskillende kwekerystadiums, vir die teenwoordigheid van Pa. chlamydospora. ‘n Protokol is ontwikkel en geverifieer vir die molekulêre opsporing van Pa. chlamydospora in wingerdhout. Eerstens is verskeie protokols wat voorheen gepubliseer is, is as grondslag gebruik vir die ontwikkeling van ‘n ekonomiese en tydbesparende DNA ekstraksie protokol. Hierna is PKR (polimerase ketting reaksie) amplifikasie met spesie-spesifieke inleiers (Pch 1 en Pch 2) gevind om sensitief genoeg te wees om so min as 1 pg van Pa. chlamydospora genomiese DNA van wingerdhout op te spoor. Die protokol is geverifieer deur verskeie wingerdhoutmateriaal van 3 verskillende onderstokkultivars (101 - 14 Mgt, Ramsey en Richter 99) te gebruik, wat elk versamel is van 3 verskillende kwekerye. ‘n Aantal van die wingerstokke is ook onderwerp aan warmwaterbehandeling. Die basale kant van die onderstok is parallel geanaliseer vir Pa. chlamydospora deur gebruik te maak van isolasies op kunsmatige groeimedium asook molekulêre opsporing. Die identiteit van ‘n submonster van PKR produkte van verskeie monsters, wat slegs positief getoets het vir Pa. chlamydospora met die molekulêre opsporing, is bevestig om Pa. chlamydospora spesifiek te wees. Dit is gedoen deur middel van restriksie ensiem analise met AatII. Molekulêre opsporing is gevind om aansienlik meer sensitief te wees as isolasies, deurdat Pa. chlamydospora opgespoor is van positiewe sowel as negatiewe isolasies. Die molekulêre tegniek het Pa. chlamydospora in ‘n gemiddeld van 80. 9 % van die monsters opgespoor, terwyl slegs ‘n gemiddeld van 24. 1 % van die monsters postief getoets het vir Pa. chlamydospora, deur middel van isolasies. Pa. chlamydospora is nie geïsoleer van die monsters wat warmwaterbehandeling ondergaan het nie. Die resultate bevestig hoe belangrik warmwaterbehandeling is vir die proaktiewe beheer van Petri se siekte in wingerdkwekerye. Pa. chlamydospora DNA is met die molekulêre tegniek opgespoor, in warmwaterbehandelde monsters, in getalle wat ooreenstemmend is met die van niewarmwaterbehandelde monsters. Soos verwag, is DNA in warmwaterbehandelde plante nie vernietig nie en kon dit telke male opgespoor word deur die ontwikkelde molekulêre opsporing protokol. Dit is ‘n belangrike feit wat in ag geneem moet word wanneer molekulêre opsporing gebruik word in siekte diagnose en opsporing van patogene en dit is ‘n aanduiding dat die metodes gebruik moet word in samewerking met ander diagnostiese tegnieke. Die DNA ekstraksie protokol het getoon om tot en met 10 tot 15 kere goedkoper te wees as kommersiële DNA ekstraksie pakkette. Voorlopige studies het getoon dat die bogenoemde molekulêre opsporings tegniek nie spesifiek en sensitief genoeg is vir die opsporing van Pa. chlamydospora uit grond en water nie (ongepubliseerde data). Daarom is ‘n enkel-buis geneste-PKR tegniek geoptimiseer vir die opsporing van Pa. chlamydospora DNA wat geëkstraheer is vanaf grond, water, kallusmedium en wingerdhout. Dele van onderstokke en grond monsters is geneem vanaf moederblokke van verskeie kwekerye. Gedurende die voor-opberging en enting periodes is watermonsters versamel vanaf hidrasie en fungisied tenke. Bostok- en onderstokente is ook versamel gedurende enting en grond is versamel vanaf kwekerybeddens net voor uitplanting. Die enkelbuis geneste-PKR was sensitief genoeg om so min as 1 fg van Pa. chlamydospora genomiese DNA vanaf water en 10 fg vanaf hout, kallusmedium en grond op te spoor. PKR analise van die verskillende kwekerymonsters het getoon dat daar ‘n teenwoordigheid is van verskeie putatiewe Pa. chlamydospora spesifieke bande (360 bp). Daaropvolgende analise deur middel van DNA volgordebepaling en restriksie ensiem analise het bevestig dat al die 360 bp PKR bande wel Pa. chlamydospora spesifiek is, behalwe vir vyf bande wat verkry is vanaf kallusmedium en een band verkry vanaf water. As slegs Pa. chlamydospora spesifieke bande in ag geneem word, is daar met molekulêre opsporing die teenwoordigheid van Pa. chlamydospora gevind in 25 % van die onderstokke, 17 % van die grond versamel vanaf moederblokke, 42 % van die onderstokente versamel tydens enting, 16 % van die bostokente, 40 % van die watermonsters versamel voor die 12 -uur hidrasie periode, 67 % van die watermonsters versamel gedurende enting en 8 % van die kallusmediummonsters. Hierdie mediums moet dus beskou word as potensiële inokulumbronne of infeksiepunte van die patogeen gedurende die kwekerystadiums. Die resultate bevestig ook verdere bevindinge wat aandui dat Pa. chlamydospora meestal versprei word deur geïnfekteerde onderstokke en ente. Geïnfekteerde bostokente is ook aangedui om potensiële draers van die patogeen te wees. Beheerstrategieë moet dus wondbeskerming van onderstok moederplante insluit, asook uitwissing van die patogeen vanaf onderstokente (bv. warmwaterbehandeling), toediening van biologiese of chemiese stowwe in die hidrasie water en kallusmedium en wondbeskerming teen grondgedraagde infeksies...|$|R
40|$|Avocado (Persea americana) {{contributes}} $ 180 {{million at}} the farm gate and $ 420 million at retail to the Australian economy. Avocado is a woody tree species that is commercially grafted to obtain both desirable fruiting and rootstock resilience qualities. Clonal <b>rootstocks</b> derived from <b>cuttings</b> yield three times higher than sexually reproduced. However, the difficulty to generate adventitious roots on avocado stem cuttings makes propagation of rootstocks a significant challenge. The Frolich and Platt double grafting protocol is the standard practice for rootstock propagation and involves an un-interrupted etiolation step crucial for rooting. However, the molecular basis for this etiolation requirement is not yet understood. To address this, we analysed the effect of etiolation on expression of root promoting miR 160 and the root inhibitor miR 167 in avocado stems grafted for rootstock clonal propagation. Whilst miR 167 expression was not strongly correlated to etiolation treatments, etiolation resulted in a distinct spatial regulation of miR 160, with significantly stronger expression in basal tissue than in apical tissue, correlating {{to the site of}} adventitious root production. This is a trend absent in non-etiolated plants. This study suggests that etiolation facilitates a spatial gradient of miR 160 abundance in grafted stems and that this, rather than general enhancement of miR 160 expression, may be a key factor for adventitious rooting in avocado...|$|R

After callusing, the grafted cuttings were planted in two commercial fi eld nurseries with and without a previous history of grapevine cultivation. After nine months in the nursery, the plants were uprooted and analysed for the incidence and severity of the wood fungi. Plants uprooted from the fi eld without a previous history of grapevine cultivation were generally less strongly infected by wood fungi. Under this condition, only the mixture cyprodinil + fl udioxonil simultaneously reduced the incidence of Cylindrocarpon and Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, as well as the severity of Cylindrocarpon infections. Treatments did not produce signifi cant differences in the incidence and severity of P. viticola, and Pa. chlamydospora. For plants grown in the fi eld with a grapevine history, all fungicides except cyprodinil signifi cantly reduced the incidence and severity of Cylindrocarpon fungi. Also, the incidence and severity of Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens were signifi cantly decreased both by cyprodinil + fl udioxonil and by cyprodinil. No signifi cant differences were noticed for P. viticola incidence and severity, and Pa. chlamydospora was not detected again. These results suggest that the practice of soaking grapevine cuttings in selected fungicides prior to grafting signifi cantly reduces Cylindrocarpon spp. and Botryosphaeriaceae infections, thus improving the quality of planting material...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years {{research}} on esca has led to considerable progress in our understanding of the aetiology, epidemiology and physiology of the disease and revealed its complexity. On the basis of the available information, esca can be considered: 1. a disease complex, in the sense that several interacting factors and microorganisms concur to produce the overall syndrome; 2. a complex of at least two distinct diseases: ‘white rot’ caused by Fomitiporia punctata or other wood-rotting fungi, and brown wood-streaking and gummosis, caused by one or more species of Phaeoacremonium infecting the woody tissue; 3. a real hadromycosis induced by one or more species of Phaeoacremonium or related genera, which in mature or old grapevines is further complicated by the white rot caused by F. punctata. Research has also shown that different syndromes are produced depending on the origin of the infections, the prevalence of the associated fungi and the order in which they become active, and environmental factors. Five syndromes can be distinguished: 1. “brown wood streaking” (Petri, 1912). This affects rooted <b>cuttings,</b> <b>rootstocks,</b> and grafted or mother plants and is caused by species of Phaeoacremonium or related genera, often without external symptoms; 2. “Petri grapevine decline”. This name has been proposed to designate a decline of young grapevines known under various local names (‘black goo’, ‘slow dieback’, ‘Phaeoacremonium grapevine decline’), which occurs when propagation material or young grapevines are infected, again by species of Phaeoacremonium or related genera; 3. “young esca”. This syndrome, which Petri thought would evolve in ‘esca proper’, is characterised by black or brown wood-streaking and xylem gummosis in actively growing grapevines, with or without external symptoms. It is also caused by species of Phaeoacremonium or related genera, like the brown wood-streaking of point 1 above; 4. “white rot”. When infection is through wounds and solely or mainly by F. punctata or other wood-rotting basidiomycetes, it is characterised by wood rot, {{which may or may not}} be accompanied by external (leaf and fruit) symptoms; 5. “esca proper”. This occurs when white rot develops in the trunks of mature or old vines together with, or after, the development of brown wood-streaking. This, the full-fledged esca syndrome, is caused by the combined or successive action of one or more species of Phaeoacremonium, occasionally accompanied by other fungi, and F. punctata...|$|R
40|$|As doenças causadas por patógenos do solo provocam perdas expressivas em maracujazeiros comerciais. Uma das alternativas de controle dessas doenças seria a utilização de porta-enxertos resistentes. Passiflora nitida é uma das espécies de Passifloraceae que apresentam resistência a essas doenças, mas suas sementes geram porta-enxertos com caules finos e, portanto, incompatíveis com o diâmetro dos garfos da espécie {{comercial}}. Este problema pode ser resolvido pela utilização da enxertia em estacas enraizadas ou pela enxertia hipocotiledonar, mas, no Brasil, dados sobre o desenvolvimento e produtividade, em campo, de maracujazeiros enxertados, ainda são escassos. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a reação a doenças, produtividade e características físicas de frutos de um clone de maracujazeiro-azedo (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa) comercial propagado por estaquia, enxertia em estacas herbáceas enraizadas de P. nitida (acesso EC-PN 1) e por sementes. As plantas foram cultivadas em um Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo, onde foram conduzidas em espaldeiras verticais com 1, 90 metro em altura, com irrigação por gotejamento. As colheitas foram efetuadas semanalmente, durante 14 meses, e as avaliações das doenças foram efetuadas aos 17; 18 e 19 meses após o plantio. A produtividade das plantas propagadas por estaquia foi o dobro das enxertadas e das propagadas por sementes. Plantas enxertadas e propagadas por estaquia foram menos afetadas pelas doenças. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTDiseases {{induced by}} soil-borne pathogens cause expressive losses in passion fruit crops in Brazil. The use of resistant rootstocks {{could be an}} alternative to control these diseases. Passiflora nitida {{is one of the}} wild species of Passifloraceae, which have presented resistance to these diseases, but its utilization as seedling rootstock has been limited mainly due to differences of thickness between rootstock and the graft of the commercial cultivars. This problem can be solved by using grafting on <b>rootstock</b> of rooted-herbaceous <b>cuttings</b> and hypocotyledonary grafting, but data about the performance and yield of grafted passion fruit in field conditions are yet scarce in Brazil. The objective of this work was to evaluate the reaction to disease attack, yield and physical characteristics of fruits from a commercial passion fruit clone propagated by rooted cuttings, by grafting on rooted cuttings of a wild P. nitida (source EC-PN 1) and by seeds. The plants were cultivated in a red-yellow latosol with a drip irrigation system and oriented on a vertical espalier of 1, 90 meters high. Harvest occurred weekly during 14 months and disease eva 1 uations were carried out at 17, 18 and 19 months after the planting. Plant yields from rooted cuttings were twice greater than those from grafted plants or seedlings. The plants propagated by grafting and rooted cuttings were lesser affected by diseases...|$|R
40|$|Gisela 5 {{consists}} one of {{the most}} promising new cherry rootstocks in Greece. However, there is a gap in the knowledge related to the propagation of this <b>rootstock</b> by using <b>cuttings.</b> The first aim of this study was to investigate different methods to propagate the cherry rootstocks Gisela 5. The results showed that, this rootstock can be propagated by using hardwood cuttings with a moderate percentage of rooting (about 60 %). More investigation is required in testing the frequency of irrigations on the rooting of cuttings in different rooting media. In addition, ·more work should be done to examine the possibly effect of endogenous hormones, carbohydrates and mineral elements in rooting of cuttings. It could help to understand better how the external factors affect the percentage of rooting of Gisela 5 cuttings. Propagation of Gisela 5 by using semi-hardwood cuttings is also possible, but the percentage of rooting is relatively low (about 35 %). Improvement of the rooting could be achieved if the effect of some other external factors, such as etiolating, age of mother trees etc is examined. In cases of which propagation of Gisela 5 cherry rootstock with hardwood and semi-hardwood cuttings is impossible, the use of root cuttings could be another way to propagate this rootstock with high percentage of sprouting (67 %) and rooting (90 %) of achievement. More investigations should be conducted to evaluate the effect of higher concentrations of BOP on improvement of sprouting. This study also gives data for the use of micrografting as a quick grafting method. The percentage of achievement of micro grafted plants can be improved in a percentage of 55 - 60 % if parafilm is used as wrapping material and covering of plants after micrografting. A method to produce inter-stocked trees with the micrografting method was evaluated although the percentage of achievement is low (10 %). In this study, using micrografting in combination to thermotherapy was not an effective method to produce virus-free, probably because of inappropriate method of thermotherapy. More investigation should be done by using different method of thermotherapy so that vims-free plants will be able produced. In this study, experiments were conducted to i. mprove the tissue culture propagation of Gisela 5, cherry rootstock additionally to the previous works. The results showed that shoot apices possibly are appropriate explants for the tissue culture propagation of this rootstock. Adding 5 ~lM lBA in combination to 0. 15 glucose in medium improved the rooting of Gisela 5 explants. Supplement of medium with BA at concentrations as low as 0. 5 ~M in'creased the sprouting of explants. Considering the importance of the diseases Phytophthora crown rot, Crown gall and Bacterial canker for the cultivation of cherry trees, it is essential for growers to know the level of susceptibility of Gisela 5 to these diseases. In this study, the susceptibility of cherry rootstock Gisela 5 to infection by Phytophthora Crown Rot (P. cactorum, P. citrophthora, P. parasitica, and P. citricola), Crown Gall (Agrobacterillm tllmejaciens) and Bacterial Canker (Pselldonwnas syringae) was evaluated. The results showed that Gisela 5 is susceptible to all pathogens tested. The susceptibility of Gisela 5 in natural infections by the pathogens used in this study should also be evaluated. Before that, caution should be taken when Gisela 5 is used in locations where these diseases are endemic and this may limit its commercial potential.
