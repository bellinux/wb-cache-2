5|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, they launched a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (also a time of civil war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from the Quran to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning philosophy of materialism as unsound to human origins and a denial of Allah. Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the Western world.|$|E
5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany {{in taking}} aim at the {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world. Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim jihad. His hope was to provoke and aid a vast Muslim revolution, particularly in India. Translations of the proclamation were sent to Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, the proclamation {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|The First Crusade (1095–1099) was {{the first}} of a number of crusades that {{attempted}} to capture the Holy Land, called for by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095.

5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising {{all the available}} forces of the Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period of anarchy followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|Islam {{then started}} {{to spread out}} of Mindanao {{in the south and}} went into Luzon in the north. Manila in Luzon was Islamized during the reign of Sultan Bolkiah in 1485 to 1521. This was {{accomplished}} because the Sultanate of Brunei subjugated Tondo by defeating Rajah Gambang in battle and thereafter installing the Muslim rajah, Rajah Salalila to the throne and by establishing the Bruneian puppet-state of the Rajahnate of Maynila. Sultan Bolkiah also married Laila Mecana, the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir Ul-Ombra to expand Brunei's influence in both Luzon and Mindanao. The Muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the Visayans. Participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> raids, the Sultanate of Ternate consequently destroyed the Kedatuan of Dapitan in Bohol. The Rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu also endured slave raids from, and waged wars against the Sultanate of Maguindanao.|$|E

The most popular segments were those that contained cartoons, songs, and puppets. The show's viewers demonstrated an increase in their understanding and knowledge in all areas, especially information about their social and natural environment.|$|E

5|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{was heavily}} criticized by contemporaries for his oppressive fiscal {{policies}} and the suffering they caused among the population. The traveller Ibn Hawqal, who visited Nasir al-Dawla's domains, reports in length on his seizure of private land in the most fertile regions of the Jazira, on flimsy legal charges, until he became the greatest landowner in his province. This was linked with the practice of a monoculture of cereals, destined to feed the growing population of Baghdad, and coupled with heavy taxation, so that Sayf al-Dawla and Nasir al-Dawla {{are said to have}} become the wealthiest princes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world. Nevertheless, the Hamdanid administrative machinery seems to have been fairly rudimentary, and the tribute paid to the Buyids—estimated at somewhere between two and four million dirhams, when it was paid at all—was a heavy burden on the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Robert Silverberg connects {{this account}} with {{historical}} events of 1141, when the Kara-Khitan Khanate under Yelü Dashi defeated the Seljuk Turks near Samarkand. The Seljuks ruled over Persia {{at the time}} and were the most powerful force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, and the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. While the Kara-Khitan at the time were Buddhists and not Christian, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose Yelü Dashi was ever called Prester John. However, several vassals of the Kara-Khitan practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend, as well as the possibility that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, he must be Christian. The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East, and it is possible Otto recorded Hugh's confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade's European backers; according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.|$|E

5|$|The {{heaviest}} fighting {{occurred at}} the Thomas gate, where Thomas again commanded the sally in person. After intense fighting, Thomas, seeing {{that there was no}} weakening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> front, decided that continuing the attack would be fruitless and would lead to even heavier casualties among his men. He ordered a withdrawal and the Romans moved back at a steady pace, during which they were subjected to a concentrated shower of arrows by the Muslims.

5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E
5|$|Both Philip I of France and Emperor HenryIV were in {{conflict}} with Urban and declined {{to participate in the}} official crusade. However, members of the high aristocracy from France, western Germany, the Low countries, and Italy were drawn to the venture, commanding their own military contingents in loose, fluid arrangements based on bonds of lordship, family, ethnicity, and language. Foremost amongst these was the elder statesman, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse. He was rivalled by the relatively poor but martial Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred from the Norman community of southern Italy. They were joined by Godfrey of Bouillon and his brother Baldwin I of Jerusalem in leading a loose conglomerate from Lorraine, Lotharingia, and Germany. These five princes were pivotal to the campaign that was also joined by a Northern French army led by Robert Curthose, Stephen, Count of Blois, and Robert II, Count of Flanders. The armies, which may have contained as many as 100,000 people, including non-combatants, travelled eastward by land to Byzantium where they were cautiously welcomed by the Emperor. Alexios persuaded many of the princes to pledge allegiance to him and that their first objective should be Nicaea, which Kilij Arslan I had declared the capital of the Sultanate of Rum. Having already destroyed the earlier People's Crusade, the over-confident Sultan left the city to resolve a territorial dispute, enabling its capture in 1097 after a Crusader siege and a Byzantine naval assault. This marked a high point in Latin and Greek co-operation and also the start of Crusader attempts to take advantage of political and religious disunity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world: Crusader envoys were sent to Egypt seeking an alliance.|$|E
